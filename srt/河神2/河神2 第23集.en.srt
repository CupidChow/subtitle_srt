00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,220
Let's come back to our story and continue.


3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,740
Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2


4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,300
In last episode,


5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,060
When Guo Deyou was in great danger,


6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,030
In the magically changed realm, he broke the seal.


7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,140
They were saved and and went back to the Dragon Temple.


8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,800
Guo Deyou was inspired


9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,210
and found the key clues,


10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,790
inferring that the death of shadow play Liu has something to do with Rong Aoshuang.


11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,460
They went to the physiotherapy room,


12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,310
only to find Rong Aoshuang has gone.


13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
In a confused state of mind,


14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,260
The president of the tea Commerce Association spoke disjointedly,


15
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,140
referring to Fan Junyao's chemical fertilizer plant.


16
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,800
They four came to the chemical fertilizer plant


17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,880
and found another secret ordnance factory here.


18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,310
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao went to the ordnance factory at night,


19
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,120
finding lots of white phosphorus bombs there.


20
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,450
They continued to investigate and was trapped in the trial explosion room.


21
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,760
It turned out that the ordnance factory was owned by Wu Zuonan.


22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,140
Bai jiwen had died from trial explosion.


23
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,010
At this moment,


24
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,020
Wu Zuonan intended to kill Guo Deyou and Ding Mao to silence them.


25
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,750
When they were in extreme danger,


26
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,410
Gu Ying rushed in to rescue them.


27
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,160
They hid and moved in the ordnance factory


28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,100
to avoid the trace of Wu Zuonan's soldiers.


29
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,620
They took measures


30
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,480
and trapped Wu Zuonan in the trial explosion room.


31
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,680
Rong Aoshuang secretly threw the bomb and Wu Zuonan was burnt to death.


32
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,039
Checking Wu Zuonan's corpse,


33
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,640
they summarized the clues


34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,220
and found Wu Zuonan and Bai Jiwen were the two statues of tigers.


35
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,310
Now


36
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,550
the nine statues of ox and two statues of tiger have died.


37
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,030
The one statue of rooster is found nowhere.


38
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,160
The backstage murderer is on the lam.


39
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,660
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao investigated the physiotherapy room in secret.


40
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,860
Ding Mao explained that the aromatherapy


41
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,270
is the key to make the silver bell seal work.


42
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,930
Guo Deyou entered the magically changed realm,


43
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,430
finding Rong Aoshuang was the


44
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,350
backstage manipulator of the gold robbery case.


45
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,289
Shadow Play Liu was also killed by Rong Aoshuang.


46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,570
Guo Deyou noticed that


47
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,900
Rong Aoshuang took away a book before she left.


48
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,430
Then


49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,990
they four are in danger again!


50
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,460
Mr. Lu revealed the truth.


51
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,300
The evil fought with the justice to escape,


52
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,280
only to find that the evil was sure to die.


53
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,100
Jianghu.


54
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,780
Science.


55
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,620
Kung fu.


56
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,300
Truth.


57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,420
Nine statues of ox.


58
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,460
Two statues of tiger.


59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,140
One statue of rooster.


60
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,060
Gutenberg.


61
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
Deal with them soon.


62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,940
Bullshit.


63
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,300
Silver bell seal.


64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,900
Tientsin is in drought.


65
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,020
Curve cut-off.


66
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,220
What is discerning grievance by burning incense?


67
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,300
Throw stones into the well.


68
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,220
Pain killer.


69
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,180
Study.


70
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,020
Drought demon.


71
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,180
They are not supposed to die.


72
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,380
Discern grievance by burning incense /lighting a cigarette.


73
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,339
River God.


74
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,380
Tientsin Mystic 2


75
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,020
Episode 23


76
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,380
[Offer a reward for Rong Aoshuang's arrest]


77
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,330
Take it seriously!


78
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,860
Put up the posters every five steps.


79
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,040
Don't ignore any corners.


80
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,130
Go ahead.


81
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,960
Let's go.


82
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,030
Come to have a look.


83
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,310
Have a look.


84
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,550
The girl is beautiful


85
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,530
but malicious.


86
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,290
As the saying goes, women can be the most vicious creatures of this world.


87
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,440
It refers toâ€¦. Who are you talking about?


88
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,590
No no no.


89
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm not talking about any one of you here.


90
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,950
OK. You can read by yourself.


91
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,909
With the coordination of Secretary Ding,


92
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,080
even the foreign settlement unexpectedly


93
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,130
worked with our police in Tientsin.


94
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,860
We feel so proud.


95
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,659
However, having searched over Tientsin,


96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,390
we still


97
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,480
Find Rong Aoshuang nowhere.


98
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,000
In my view,


99
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,659
maybe


100
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,520
she has escaped Tientsin.


101
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,320
Too much curve cut-off


102
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,390
may lead to the decrease of the drainage area


103
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,340
and the rise of the ground and underground water level.


104
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,540
It will also affect the ecology and climate.


105
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,290
I have carefully studied


106
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,660
the engineering proposal of the Deutsche irrigationist.


107
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,660
The purpose of the curve cut-off project


108
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,040
seems to


109
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,510
maximize the side effects.


110
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,880
If the water level keeps falling,


111
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,760
the sea water is likely to flow backwards.


112
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,450
the salinity of water will increase rapidly,


113
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,370
which can't be used for agricultural irrigation


114
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,930
and industrial cooling.


115
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,130
In the Ministry of Health of Tientsin, among the doctor qualification of western medicine,


116
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,220
there isn't someone called Tai Bo.


117
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,909
So it's a false name.


118
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,570
All the medical records of foreigners are put here.


119
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,260
Without the permission of consulate, nobody can go inside.


120
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,100
Secretary Ding.


121
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,150
Secretary Ding, you can't go inside.


122
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,000
Secretary Ding.


123
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,070
But there is a receipt of drugs,


124
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,860
large dose of aspirin.


125
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,100
The physician is called Tai Bo.


126
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,680
The drugs were received by Rong Aoshuang's physical therapy clinic.


127
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,500
It's certain that Rong Aoshuang is Tai Bo.


128
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,080
Taking too much aspirin will lead to gastric ulcer.


129
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,560
So


130
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,690
it's not a coincidence for Crazy Cui to be burnt in halves.


131
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,420
The rumor of nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster


132
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,960
started then.


133
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
You're right, young master.


134
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,410
The person in charge of the Ministry of Health


135
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,500
has confessed


136
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,480
and admitted that Tai Bo's doctor qualification


137
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,830
was signed and issued by him,


138
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,130
saying he was forced to do so by the authority of foreign settlement.


139
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,540
He also told me a name.


140
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,290
I


141
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,570
It seems that Siegmund


142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,840
is not a common irrigationist.


143
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,820
He is also a member of the Gutenberg Association.


144
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,120
Deutsche is a great medicine-producing country.


145
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,260
Aspirin was originally imported from Germany.


146
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,020
What is Siegmund?


147
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,220
I'm so tired.


148
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,650
Many people ask me to pray for rain.


149
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,530
My mother said it was the drought demon that was making trouble.


150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
It's useless praying for rain.


151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,350
We need to hold a Dragon King meeting


152
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,080
to invite the Dragon King to suppress the drought demon.


153
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,200
Dragon King?


154
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,890
Secretary Ding.


155
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,059
You can go to see the foreigner.


156
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,049
I will go to ask about the Dragon King.


157
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,840
Though you left without saying goodbye


158
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,980
and made false entry record


159
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,730
with no information left,


160
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,420
depending on my interpersonal relationship in Deutsche,


161
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,620
I can still get some information.


162
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,450
The professors of the Deutsche military medical academy


163
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,460
is best at


164
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,550
achieving mastery through a comprehensive study of the traditional Chinese and western medicine.


165
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,820
The academy admits Chinese students regularly


166
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,930
and cultivates them secretly.


167
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,360
Rong Aoshuang


168
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,110
is one of them.


169
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,770
These students


170
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,920
are all recommended by


171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,200
Gutenberg Association


172
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,270
whose consul general in China


173
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,370
is you.


174
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,870
Am I right?


175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,040
Mr. Siegmund.


176
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,520
The Japanese restaurant in the Japanese settlement


177
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,660
is indeed a good place to deceive the public.


178
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
I couldn't get it why


179
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,330
the western doctor Tai Bo


180
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,040
cooperated with Wu Zuonan, commander of the warlord,


181
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,090
to run a ordnance factory.


182
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,840
Now I have figured it out.


183
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,490
With the support of Deutsche,


184
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,540
everything can make sense.


185
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,410
Twenty years ago,


186
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,550
with the spread of Mogudao virus,


187
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,190
you entered China in the name of helping China.


188
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,430
Twenty years later,


189
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,060
you still take the same way,


190
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,680
pretending to be an irrigationist


191
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,150
with the project of curve cut-off.


192
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,160
As well as the panic brought by the nine statues of ox and two statues of tiger,


193
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,680
the natural condition and political environment


194
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,790
will be in a chaotic state.


195
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,970
At that time,


196
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,910
you may use the secretly made white phosphorus bombs


197
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,130
to launch a war.


198
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,080
I just want to know


199
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,190
what the one statue of rooster is.


200
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,340
The tea culture originated from China.


201
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,280
But it's the Japanese that


202
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,620
make it tea ceremony.


203
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,740
There are many similar examples


204
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,590
like bow and arrow and Chinese Go.


205
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,000
So they are.


206
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,420
You're a guest here.


207
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,420
I treat you with tea ceremony.


208
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,920
As the guest,


209
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,590
you seem to be a little rude and impolite.


210
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,730
You can come here today,


211
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,670
which shows that I am very sincere to you.


212
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,030
Just learning some superficial knowledge,


213
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,590
you regard it as criterion.


214
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,830
Maybe they are called ceremony.


215
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,620
But in my view,


216
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,250
you can't make it.


217
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,150
Here if you can't tell me


218
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,710
what the one statue of rooster is,


219
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,020
what about


220
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,240
going back with me to the government office


221
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,540
or the police office to


222
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,430
carefully think about it.


223
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,020
Though it's a small country


224
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
with only a strip of water away from China,


225
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,500
its fortune is totally different,


226
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,940
not to mention Deutsche where you ever had further education,


227
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,240
the gap is self-evident.


228
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,420
If we intended to invade China,


229
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,590
we wouldn't need to make


230
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,700
the nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster as a cover.


231
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,070
We were tricked as well.


232
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,720
Even the project of curve cut-off


233
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,500
has been changed in internal data by others


234
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,440
as well as the white phosphorus bombs.


235
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,000
You mean


236
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,220
it's someone else that did them, right?


237
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,810
Unexpectedly, the Gutenberg association


238
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,500
cultivated a drought demon!


239
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,670
Confucius said


240
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,740
Manners makes man.


241
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,160
You have been working hard


242
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,820
to help us get rid of the drought demon.


243
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,060
Thank you for your help. I will reward you a piece of news.


244
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,970
As far as I know, around your fiancee,


245
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,020
there seems to be


246
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,920
something rude happening.


247
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,280
Thief.


248
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,750
Thief.


249
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,230
Mr. Lu.


250
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,210
You.


251
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,060
I...I...I...


252
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,470
How are you feeling these days?


253
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,609
I...I...


254
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,079
I'm fine,


255
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,730
eating well and sleeping well.


256
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,140
Everything goes well.


257
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,060
Do you want to extort money from me by buying medicine from you?


258
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,200
I mean if there is


259
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,050
something wrong with you different from usual.


260
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,080
I...


261
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,530
As you said,


262
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,580
I really


263
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,570
think


264
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,870
you're different from usual.


265
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,080
No. I mean


266
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,110
I'm here to ask you about someone.


267
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,620
The mask you gave me...


268
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,510
where can I find


269
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,790
the homeless person again?


270
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,570
I can tell you


271
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,810
what you want to know.


272
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,520
But you must promise me another thing first.


273
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,830
I'm listening.


274
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,790
If...


275
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,540
I mean if...


276
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,310
recently or someday in the future


277
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,360
there is something incredible


278
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,280
happening on you,


279
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,460
extremely incredible,


280
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,570
don't be nervous,


281
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,940
don't be afraid, don't be worried.


282
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,520
Come to see me.


283
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,340
I can help you.


284
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,060
Can you come straight to the point?


285
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
More than ten years ago, there was a drought in Tientsin.


286
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,030
Did you master tell you?


287
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,550
My master?


288
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,710
During that period,


289
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,330
something did happen in Tientsin.


290
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,110
The Old River God tried to appease it out of kindness.


291
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,250
However, the speaker has no particular intention in saying something,


292
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,100
but the listener reads his own meaning into it.


293
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,840
He got into trouble.


294
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,400
What did my master say?


295
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,830
People had different ideas


296
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,750
of the drought.


297
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,530
Some said it was caused by the syren,


298
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,880
and some said it was caused by the drought demon.


299
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,890
But the Old River God said


300
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,510
the syren and drought demon were the same.


301
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,050
No matter what caused the drought,


302
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,610
people need to have sacrifice and worship


303
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,720
in awe and veneration.


304
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,150
It was right.


305
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,620
So it was!


306
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,180
But those believed in syren


307
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,490
strengthened the influence based on his words.


308
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,860
Since the Old River God said


309
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,860
it was useless


310
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,270
praying for the rain, river and sea.


311
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,550
What to pray for?


312
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,280
They should pray fro the well.


313
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,330
Well


314
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,270
is the origin of all the water source.


315
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,650
The underground water is the most purest.


316
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,020
At that time, Mogudao was hated by everyone.


317
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,490
This saying


318
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,770
just conflicted with Mogudao's idea that


319
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,170
the underground water is the source of evil water.


320
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,090
So it was popular with the people.


321
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,650
Only by purifying the water in the well


322
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,680
can the guard of the nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster be rebuilt.


323
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,490
What to suppress?


324
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,930
Syren.


325
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,270
What to guard?


326
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,680
Drought demon.


327
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,240
And then?


328
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,790
So the sacrifice and praying for water should be held by a well.


329
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,990
When it was in extreme drought,


330
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,850
a woman who was born


331
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,280
with the same characters or at the time of Kuihai


332
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,220
should be thrown into the well.


333
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,670
People who are present at the sacrifice


334
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,850
should take a red stone


335
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,050
and smashed it into the well.


336
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,320
Then seal the well


337
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,990
and purify it.


338
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,730
Absorbent stone.


339
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,210
It's commonly used in potted landscape.


340
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,880
It can absorb water.


341
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,890
But those people didn't


342
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,450
use it to absorb water


343
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,810
but sacrifice it with blood.


344
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,370
Dipping in the blood, the stone can become better and better.


345
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,210
Now Tientsin is in great drought,


346
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,890
which is similar situation like then.


347
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,290
Maybe another woman who has a water fortune


348
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,900
will be thrown into a well and smashed by stone.


349
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,630
What did you say?


350
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,430
The president didn't come yesterday.


351
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,830
She didn't tell us where she had gone, either.


352
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,430
We really...really...


353
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,500
What did they say?


354
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,140
Why are you here?


355
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,890
What did you find?


356
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,410
Tell me.


357
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,960
What does the water fortune refer to?


358
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,990
Someone born at the moment of Kuihai, on the date of Kuihai, in the month and the year of Kuihai.


359
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,910
Kui means the most violent water.


360
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,830
Hai means rivers and seas.


361
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,130
All the characters are the same.


362
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,760
It's extremely thriving water.


363
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,370
Someone born with a water fortune have all kind s of water in the life.


364
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,420
All the water source meet again


365
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,240
to put out the fire of the God.


366
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,390
Rarely.


367
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,720
Rarely is a woman born with a water fortune.


368
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,280
Search carefully.


369
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,820
What did you find?


370
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,130
The photo studio, Huntun shop and the Jinghu Lake


371
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,960
have been searched over.


372
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,430
She isn't there.


373
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,420
It's chaos.


374
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,640
So many cases.


375
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,930
I have tried my best to search for Miss Xiao.


376
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,320
but police numerical strength is really inadequate.


377
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,730
Gosh!


378
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,290
In order to get the first bucket of water in the well,


379
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,420
the neighbors fought with each other.


380
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,730
Someone even lost the child.


381
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,130
Guess what?


382
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,780
The child was asked to go to the mountain


383
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,960
to fetch spring water


384
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,390
but never came back again.


385
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,230
Now people are shouting about


386
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,020
holding a Dragon King meeting.


387
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,450
Tientsin is going to be in a chaos.


388
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,610
You didn't find her, right?


389
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,500
Why bother talking so much nonsense?


390
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,340
You... I...


391
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,930
Yusi,


392
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,040
ask all the members of the
Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce


393
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,530
to the foreign settlement to ask Gutenberg for her.


394
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,110
OK.


395
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,010
No no no.


396
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,410
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.


397
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,570
Calm down.


398
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,040
My God.


399
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,510
The foreign settlement


400
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,690
deals with everything according to the foreign laws.


401
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,900
Not to mention the
Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce,


402
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,270
even the police and army of Tientsin go there,


403
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,610
it can't be helpful.


404
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,850
Calm down. Calm down.


405
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,410
You have searched over, right?


406
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,100
Yeah.


407
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,330
Little River God,


408
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,500
Are there any other possible places?


409
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,100
I will send people to search now.


410
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,010
Did you search there?


411
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,930
Origin.


412
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,410
Well


413
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,480
is the origin of all the water source.


414
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,870
The underground water is the most purest.


415
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,120
let's go.


416
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,260
Let's go. Hurry up.


417
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,020
Childe.


418
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,710
Guard outside.


419
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,140
If Lanlan comes out, take good care of her.


420
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,840
Water is good.


421
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,270
Water is good.


422
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,940
It is beneficial to everything.


423
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,180
It's beneficial to everything.


424
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,710
Water is like a boat.


425
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,020
Water is like a boat.


426
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,360
It can take you everywhere.


427
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,600
It can take you everywhere.


428
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,380
Assistants, listen carefully.


429
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,600
Which country are you from?


430
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,700
I just arrived in my hometown by riding a horse.


431
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,750
I didn't live in the south or north,


432
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,250
water or mountain.


433
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,490
Who I am?


434
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,120
I am Sorceress He coming to this world.


435
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,820
Last time, in the physical threapy room,


436
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,870
I was just kidding.


437
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,790
Unexpectedly, Little River God


438
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,190
can find any place


439
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,490
which has water.


440
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,830
Of course.


441
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,230
I'm looking for a woman with a water fortune.


442
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,350
Doctor Rong.


443
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,110
I just take a knife today


444
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,640
without binding tools.


445
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,560
Be careful in case you'll be scratched.


446
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,320
Backwards.


447
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,170
Don't stare at me


448
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,520
in case your eyes pop out.


449
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,740
I am


450
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,020
the captain of Jincheng police office, Fu Laiyong.


451
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,550
People inside,


452
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,720
no matter you are common people,


453
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,510
officials, wealthy people,


454
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,880
foreign military


455
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,670
or local gangsters,


456
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,770
if you get out by yourselves,


457
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,440
I can forgive you.


458
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,550
But if


459
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,310
my people rush in


460
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,390
with loaded guns


461
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,440
and find any people alive,


462
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,790
don't blame that


463
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,010
the bullets are blind.


464
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,630
Sorceress Gu.


465
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,710
Take them out now.


466
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,800
Come here.


467
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,560
I didn't live in the south or north,


468
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,760
water or mountain.


469
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,220
Who I am?


470
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,480
Hurry up. Stand in line.


471
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,280
It has been besieged by us.


472
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,250
If you still


473
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,850
have some bad ideas,


474
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,000
just forget them.


475
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,670
Hurry up.


476
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,230
Lanlan.


477
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,450
Lanlan.


478
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,860
Secretary Ding.


479
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,610
I think now


480
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,850
you shouldn't worry about Miss Xiao,


481
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,540
but yourself.


482
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,060
Lanlan.


483
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,700
Tieniu.


484
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,610
Master.


485
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,690
Master.


486
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,290
Ding Mao.


487
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,130
Ding Mao. Wake up!


488
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,190
False! Everything is false. Ding Mao.


489
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,130
Think what you have suffered these days.


490
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,159
What's your purpose?


491
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,400
You want to prevent the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce from breaking down,


492
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,190
ensure the safety of Tientsin


493
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,850
and make your father and Steward Hu


494
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,580
die in peace, Ding Mao,


495
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,500
It's almost done.


496
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,650
how could you back off now?


497
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,380
How could you back off now.


498
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,870
You can't save him.


499
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,560
He won't save you.


500
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,389
He has ever give you up.


501
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,500
Do you forget it?


502
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,449
How could you believe all the words?


503
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,260
You false foreigner! You stubborn!


504
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,500
Can't you use your brain


505
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,110
to think about it?


506
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,969
Why did the master take you as his apprentice?


507
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,300
Why are you the secretary of Tientsin?


508
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,469
Why do I take you as my younger brother?


509
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,280
Why do I regard you as my brother?


510
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,750
I'm blind.


511
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,440
I'm so unlucky. Wake up!


512
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,220
Ding Mao.


513
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,310
Previously, you said after you came back to life,


514
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,150
you felt there was something wrong with your body.


515
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,450
Is it possible that you can discern grievance by burning incense


516
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,560
again?


517
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm not sure if it's possible.


518
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,490
But the silver bell seal


519
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,780
can't work on me any more.


520
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,690
As for the thing you asked me to do,


521
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,450
I'm sure to make it.


522
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,910
I'm sure to make it.


523
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,500
I'm sure to make it.


524
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,600
Don't loose your hands.


525
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,120
Tell yourself.


526
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,500
Good.


527
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,210
A good play of evolution


528
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,640
will be on show soon.


529
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,840
Don't miss it.


530
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,160
Deyou.


531
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,930
Childe.


532
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,270
Deou. Childe.


533
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,400
How are you?


534
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,370
There is something inside the water.


535
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,100
Stay there.Don't move.


536
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,030
Childe.


537
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,890
Childe.


538
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,830
It really aches.


539
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,210
Unexpectedly Rong people use the silver bell seal


540
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,200
to make people think that pain doesn't exist


541
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,700
if they can't feel it.


542
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,650
Deyou. Deyou.


543
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,060
Childe. Childe.


544
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,410
Deyou. Oh, my God. Childe.


545
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,170
Deyou.


546
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,450
Deyou. I'm coming.


547
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,540
Childe.


548
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,250
Hurry up!


549
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,330
Childe. Hurry up!


550
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,980
Miss Xiao. Hold on.


551
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,350
Childe. Deyou.


552
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,180
Childe.


553
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,460
Hurry up. Childe.


554
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,930
Childe.


555
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,490
Be careful.


556
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,710
Lanlan.


557
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:34,090
One two three. One two three.


558
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,500
This way.


559
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,970
Look. What's that?


560
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,560
Ignore it. Save her first.


561
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,640
Captain.


562
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,320
Don't hug me. Just pull.


563
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,950
Three.


564
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,540
Three.


565
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,020
Lanlan.


566
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,520
Miss Xiao.


567
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,500
Miss Xiao. Come here.


568
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,320
Are you OK?


569
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,390
Deyou. Did you see it?


570
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,540
What is it?


571
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,890
The fire is on. Hurry to go out.


572
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,910
Go. Captain. Hurry up.


573
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,730
Let's go. Childe. Hurry up.


574
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,890
Let's go.


575
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,860
Lanlan. Lanlan. Go.


576
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,750
Quickly.


577
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,170
Quickly.


578
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,160
Deyou. Deyou.


579
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,410
Hurry up.


580
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,630
Let's go.
