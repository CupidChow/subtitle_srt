00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,940
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,920
Let's come back to our story and continue.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,640
Last time, we talked about the toxic water that spread out from the Evil Water Source.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,600
The shipping ban and the closure of all rivers in Tientsin.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,630
Guo Deyou was hung on the execution ground in the western suburb

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,840
for colluding with Mogudao.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,150
Ding Mao became Secretary-General

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,310
and promoted the curve cut-off project.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,950
Mr. Cui was against it

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,870
and made a scene at the press conference.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,680
Xiao Lanlan's father was dead.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,950
Xiao Lanlan turned against her ex Ding Mao

14
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,680
and was arrested for shooting him.

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,430
Ao Dan assumed office as Governor of Tientsin.

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,560
He and his subordinates

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,790
pressed Ding Mao

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,430
who had to promote vaccine at his own expense.

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,910
Guo Deyou's corpse changed on the way to the cemetery.

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,840
Ding Mao saved Guo Deyou.

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,110
It turns out that Guo Deyou faked his death

22
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,560
in order to get himself off the hook and promote the vaccine.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,629
However, Mr. Cui was found dead a few days later.

24
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,790
Therefore,

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,310
Yishengmen Gang picked a fight, and Zheng Simian was there to ease the conflict.

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,160
Mr. Ding signed a death warrant.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,270
Guo Deyou burned the incense to trace the origin of the poison.

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,270
They worked together to solve the case.

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,800
Jianghu.

30
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,240
Science.

31
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,079
Kung fu.

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,750
Truth.

33
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,670
Nine statues of ox.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,079
Two statues of tiger.

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,600
One statue of rooster.

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
Mr. Zheng, the vice headman.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,240
He's a leader, after all.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,750
The wife of the boss of Yishengmen Gang.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,270
Discern grievance by burning incense.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
He is just a sorcerer.

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,880
Governor.

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Terrific!

43
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,390
A newly appointed official.

44
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,390
Coincidence.

45
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,960
Deyou.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,190
My leg.

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
A nobody.

48
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,750
Tientsin Mystic.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,910
Tientsin Mystic 2

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,910
Episode 2

51
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you doing?

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,550
Get out of the way!

53
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,720
What are you doing?

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,440
What's going on?

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,520
What are you doing?

56
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,080
Get out of the way!

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,800
Shoot me.

58
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,440
What are you doing?

59
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,080
Shoot me in the head.

60
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,520
Just do it.

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,240
You're not allowed in here.

62
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,390
Mr. Ding, what brings you here?

63
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,920
If Yishengmen Gang runs into you,

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,950
you can never explain why you're here.

65
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
Curve cut-off requires water mapping.

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,270
All the engineers dispatched to the territory

67
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,070
of Yishengmen Gang have gone missing.

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm here to meet Cui for it.

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,550
However, Fu asked me to solve this crime for him.

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,760
We're not making money these days.

71
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,440
Otherwise, as a talented person,

72
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
I wouldn't be doing this.

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Oh, knock it off.

74
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,320
He must be in pain when he was split into two pieces.

75
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,390
His face was calm.

76
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,920
The fracture was at the stomach.

77
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
He had severe gastric ulcer.

78
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,230
The fracture

79
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,640
may be caused by

80
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,550
highly corrosive poison.

81
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,950
Sir, what brings you here?

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,510
Sir, what brings you here?

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
It's for…

84
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,200
Get out of the way.

85
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,790
Bro, the case is very tricky.

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,670
We hired two experts to assist in investigation.

87
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,510
Only the task force

88
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,200
is allowed in here.

89
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,390
Do you want me to use my axe?

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
Stay here.

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,440
I'll talk to them.

92
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,440
Are you nuts?

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,350
You're not afraid of death.

94
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,510
But what if they come in here and kill me?

95
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,760
We're gonna be caught with a smoking gun.

96
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,110
We're both at the crime scene.

97
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,510
That will make us murderers.

98
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,440
What should we do?

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,950
I tell you what, that's not gonna happen.

100
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,720
A straight foot is not afraid of a crooked…

101
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,760
Cui said there is no way

102
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,880
he'd agree on the practice of curve cut-off.

103
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,110
Come here.

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,390
I can't do this.

105
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,320
How come?

106
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,160
Come on.

107
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,510
Let's go.

108
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,600
Guys,

109
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,760
please go upstairs and take a rest.

110
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,350
Have some tea.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
I want to pee.

112
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,070
I'd like to use the bathroom.

113
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,270
As the saying goes, a man has to pee when he wants to pee.

114
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,040
If you want to pee,

115
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,880
the ladies' room is available.

116
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,510
Let's do it!

117
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,880
Let's do it!

118
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,040
Stop it! Stop it!

119
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,000
What are you doing?

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,830
What are you doing?

121
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,880
Do something about it!

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,510
My calfskin shoes!

123
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Stop it!

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
Stop it!

125
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,920
See?

126
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,480
They've blocked the rivers and roads.

127
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,640
Now, they're blocking our bladders.

128
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,040
Don't approach.

129
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,070
You're not allowed to pee here.

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,830
Hurry up!

131
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,440
Get them out of here!

132
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,230
Get out of here!

133
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,320
There they are!

134
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,160
Hit him!

135
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,200
Run!

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,270
Let's go back.

137
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,110
Follow them!

138
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,320
Stop!

139
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,110
Stop!

140
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,270
Stop! Follow them!

141
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,070
Oh, great.

142
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,790
How are we gonna explain why we fled from the crime scene?

143
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,200
Do you think we can explain it even if we didn't flee?

144
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,760
No one is gonna listen to us.

145
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,390
We just

146
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,390
got here a little earlier.

147
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,480
Brother!

148
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,960
You are way out of line!

149
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,280
If you keep doing this, you'll be arrested to the police station.

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,150
I'm from the police station of Tientsin…

151
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,840
I need to use the bathroom.

152
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,590
Excuse me.

153
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,640
Mr. Ding?

154
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,910
I'm good.

155
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,080
My name is Zheng.

156
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,230
I was just appointed the vice headman of Tientsin Police Station.

157
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,200
Nice to meet you.

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,840
Is Mr. Zheng, right?

159
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,440
Mr. Zheng? Mr. Fu?

160
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,520
Who runs this place?

161
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,790
This is…

162
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,280
My name is Guo Deyou.

163
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm senior fellow apprentice to Mr. Ding.

164
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,840
Who is there?

165
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,000
At the press conference,

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,320
our boss spoke the truth

167
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,080
which was unpleasant to the ear of Ding Mao.

168
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
And he was found dead in the bathroom today.

169
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,760
And Ding happened to be here.

170
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,000
He must be the murderer.

171
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,470
I was here

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,710
to talk to Mr. Cui.

173
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,470
However, he is dead when I got here.

174
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,470
The body is split into two pieces. It's so brutal.

175
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,550
We need to investigate

176
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,790
the details of the case.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm new here and ignorant of rules.

178
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,590
I'm wondering what to do about things like this.

179
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,030
Should we deal with it officially or personally?

180
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,470
Since you're here,

181
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,230
I guess it's an official case then.

182
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,520
However,

183
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,000
if Ding Mao recognizes himself as a member of Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce

184
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,550
and still wants to make a living in the industry,

185
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,080
we're gonna handle it our own way.

186
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,230
Of course, if Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce is dismissed

187
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,150
and that he changes his profession,

188
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,000
he doesn't have to obey the rules in the industry.

189
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,960
I see.

190
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,080
Then, what are the rules in the industry?

191
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,030
One is supposed to put his life at stake when it comes to a doubtful case.

192
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,470
The funeral will take place in three days.

193
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,960
Before the funeral, the murderer shall be found.

194
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,910
Or he shall kill himself

195
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,400
as a way of saying sorry.

196
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,910
What if

197
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,790
it turns out he is wronged?

198
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,470
I'll cut off an arm.

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,280
Someone is losing his life

200
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,350
or an arm for this case.

201
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,640
That sounds horrible to me.

202
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,200
My job here is to be the witness.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,710
It's your choice to make.

204
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,590
Alright.

205
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,520
I promise you,

206
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
I'll find out the truth in three days.

207
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,960
Okay, get prepared.

208
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,640
Let's go.

209
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,110
Ding Mao,

210
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,080
you got another three days.

211
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,030
Let's go.

212
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,710
When did he get in there?

213
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,670
Mr. Zheng,

214
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,520
may I borrow a cigarette from you?

215
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,550
You're welcome.

216
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,230
Let's take our time

217
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,200
to forge a bond.

218
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,550
Let's go.

219
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,960
The eggplant is overcooked.

220
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,030
The peel is unsmooth and tastes sweet.

221
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,110
It must have been irrigated with water from well.

222
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,230
It's not polluted water from river.

223
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,910
It's clean.

224
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,590
If the dishes were poisoned,

225
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,670
you'd also be split into two pieces.

226
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,670
Mr. Ding,

227
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,000
you don't want to get involved

228
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,280
in the psychic thing of discerning grievance by burning incense.

229
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,350
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,910
This is cerebral anoxia resulted from allergic reaction.

231
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,400
It's about observing the details

232
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,670
in an illusion.

233
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't call it "discern grievance by burning incense".

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,030
The scientific name

235
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,400
is anaphylactic neural activation syndrome.

236
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,590
Despite the fresh ginger, the dish has a taste of earth.

237
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,520
The fish from reservoir is also clean.

238
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,470
The sand vein of the shrimp has been removed. It's clean.

239
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,000
It's hard to get such big shrimp

240
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,910
since the fishing ban.

241
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,030
All the dishes are clean.

242
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,350
Perfect blanching

243
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,640
of lotus root.

244
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,960
Freshly brewed and moderately sweet

245
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,230
osmanthus-scented honey.

246
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,280
Perfect!

247
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Nothing is wrong with the food.

248
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,000
Mr. Nie, you really are a classy man.

249
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,830
The throat-smoothing soup is so nice.

250
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,920
There is a lot of ginseng in it.

251
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,760
Did you find anything?

252
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,160
The dishes are clean.

253
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,430
It would be too late

254
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,680
if the dishes are poisoned.

255
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,710
The craftsmanship and material of these soup bowls

256
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,070
are different than the tableware.

257
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,950
So?

258
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,160
Opera singers have the habit of consuming ginseng soup.

259
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,710
Let me guess,

260
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,640
the ginseng soup was served

261
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,520
for Nie Xiaoqiu, the star of the theater.

262
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,800
The soup is served at the backstage

263
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,310
only for honored guests.

264
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,280
So, you mean there is something wrong with the ginseng soup?

265
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,160
Both Mr. and Mrs. Cui had it.

266
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,000
And you had it, too.

267
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,880
You need to visit a place

268
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,040
which you don't like.

269
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,070
Which place?

270
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,040
The Cui Mansion.

271
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,640
For what?

272
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,590
To ask his wife

273
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,110
why she didn't eat anything

274
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,590
on her

275
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,800
birthday dinner.

276
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,430
Miss Xiao, I forgot to tell you that…

277
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,590
It was Mr. Ding

278
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,470
who bailed you out of the jail

279
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,680
so that we released you so soon.

280
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,430
Mr. Ding…

281
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,520
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused.

282
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,640
It would be nice

283
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,430
if you don't mention his name.

284
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Miss Xiao, my condolences.

285
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,040
I should be on my way.

286
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,430
Take care.

287
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,000
Junyao?

288
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,760
Lanlan!

289
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,160
I can't feel my legs.

290
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,640
Are you alright?

291
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
It must be

292
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,520
Guo Deyou's idea.

293
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,800
That's so typical of him.

294
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,430
What are you doing here?

295
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
I'm here to chant the rebirth mantra at the funeral.

296
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
You've become the target

297
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,710
of Yishengmen Gang.

298
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,880
Why are you here?

299
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,640
Can you do me a favor?

300
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,190
Just name it.

301
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
Where can I find Mrs. Cui?

302
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,470
It's inappropriate for a widow to meet the visitors if her husband was murdered.

303
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,430
She is in her room,

304
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,000
cleansing the aura.

305
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,560
Go straight

306
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,680
and Mrs. Cui's room

307
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,230
is right in the third courtyard.

308
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,640
You are an usher,

309
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,040
and you entering the room in the backyard will cause suspicion.

310
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,400
What should I do, then?

311
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,430
What are you doing?

312
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,800
Come on, take your costume off.

313
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,160
The banquet is in the backyard, isn't it?

314
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,760
There're a lot of people and things. Just keep a close eye on them

315
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,520
His Lord is gone. Watch out if someone created a disturbance here.

316
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,520
Please rest assured.

317
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,950
Everything is in order.

318
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,430
Good.

319
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,160
You're excused.

320
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,400
My apologies

321
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,430
for my bad manners

322
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,880
which have put you

323
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,830
through suffering.

324
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,760
This happened out of sudden.

325
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,160
And I'm desperate to find out the truth.

326
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,880
I have no choice.

327
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,800
Please forgive me.

328
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,280
There is nothing I can do

329
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,040
about the conflict

330
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,470
between Yishengmen Gang and Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce.

331
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,040
I'm here to ask you a few questions

332
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,950
and I'll be on my way.

333
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,230
It won't take long.

334
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,590
Mrs. Cui,

335
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,280
was there anything wrong with Mr. Cui

336
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,160
before his death?

337
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,760
He'd always been like that when he got drunk.

338
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,280
I can't tell

339
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,640
if there is anything wrong with him.

340
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,950
Does Yishengmen Gang have any unregistered mine?

341
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,640
I never asked him about his business.

342
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Then,

343
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,110
since when

344
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,110
had your marriage been in trouble?

345
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,310
Things can be complicated

346
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,680
when a couple has been married so long.

347
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,800
It's hard for me to tell.

348
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,000
It's common for a couple

349
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,800
to have argument or drift apart.

350
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,640
However,

351
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,470
it's not common

352
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,680
for a wife to hide scissors

353
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,470
under her pillow.

354
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,400
Mrs. Cui,

355
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,710
if your relationship

356
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,110
had become that bad,

357
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,350
why did your husband still celebrate your birthday

358
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,560
at Chunhe Theater with a grand banquet?

359
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,070
Though it was your birthday banquet,

360
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,800
you didn't eat or drink anything.

361
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,920
If what I think is correct,

362
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,310
you're the one

363
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,590
who drifted away from this marriage,

364
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,590
which made Mr. Cui very upset.

365
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,520
You must think I killed him.

366
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,160
I never jump to a conclusion when I get no proof.

367
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm the one who drifted away from this marriage?

368
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,350
Do you know how many times he'd get drunk a month?

369
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,430
I'm not talking about getting tipsy.

370
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,710
I'm talking about getting dead drunk.

371
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,520
When he was drunk,

372
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,350
his frustrations would undoubtedly rub off on me.

373
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,470
He would scold me,

374
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,920
using the worst words.

375
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,800
When he woke up the next day,

376
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,000
he couldn't remember anything

377
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,040
about his saying hurtful things and punching and kicking.

378
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,800
He'd be that bossy guy

379
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,920
he'd always been.

380
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,950
He'd show his manhood

381
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,520
by finding fault

382
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,430
with Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce.

383
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,160
In fact, the scissor

384
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,160
was not for him.

385
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,070
It was for me.

386
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,160
I got up late that day

387
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,310
and almost missed the ship.

388
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,760
I was in a hurry

389
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,470
and didn't say goodbye to you.

390
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,230
It's been fifteen years.

391
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,280
I've been planning on seeing you

392
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,760
before I'm back here.

393
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,710
However,

394
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
the sea was rough,

395
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,560
which made me late for two days.

396
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,710
I…

397
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,040
I didn't expect you to come back.

398
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,520
Of course I'm coming back.

399
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm the only cousin you've got.

400
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,590
The world is hard and cruel.

401
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,680
They took away all the valuable things

402
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,230
by the excuse of investigation.

403
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,190
They're searching the house and taking away things.

404
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,590
If I arrived two days earlier…

405
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,110
It's okay.

406
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,280
That's right.

407
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,680
I'm glad you're alright.

408
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,590
Master!

409
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,350
The mills of God grind slowly.

410
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,470
Just let it run its course.

411
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,310
What are you murmuring to yourself?

412
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,590
Did you cause trouble again?

413
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,830
Come on,

414
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,160
these are signature dishes from Chunhe Theater.

415
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,680
Your disciple Ding Mao took my cue

416
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,350
and bought it for you.

417
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
I'm not surprised.

418
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,830
What do you mean by that?

419
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,640
I'm afraid people won't go to

420
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,310
Chunhe Theater again.

421
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,280
This is the last time you bring me their dishes.

422
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,680
You do know everything going on in Tientsin

423
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,950
without leaving your room.

424
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,800
Do you have any clue

425
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,400
about the case?

426
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,560
It's overcooked.

427
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,230
Like fine wine, you get better with age.

428
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,800
You're like a patron saint to the city.

429
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,520
I mean the eggplant is overcooked.

430
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,680
Like I said,

431
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,470
the cook screwed up the order

432
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,560
of cooking minced pork and eggplant.

433
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,470
But I'm not here to talk about the cooking method.

434
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,230
Ding Mao is gonna get himself killed

435
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,470
for this case.

436
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,800
It's a shame on us.

437
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,950
As his senior fellow apprentice,

438
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,760
I'd like to let him die.

439
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,430
But people are gonna

440
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,590
say bad things about us.

441
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,520
So, I'd like to know

442
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,470
how to solve the case.

443
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,000
There is nothing you can do about it.

444
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,400
Master,

445
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,430
would you please

446
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,350
speak your mind openly?

447
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,800
Stay away from the smoke and alcohol.

448
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,110
Take care of your body.

449
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Keep the habit of taking baths.

450
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,560
Mind your own business.

451
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,470
Master, are you not gonna eat the food?

452
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,640
Are you not gonna

453
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,800
even touch it?

454
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,280

455
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,160
[The Compendium of Materia Medica]

456
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,110
Alocasia?

457
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,560
Guo Deyou

458
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,640
hung himself

459
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,920
and became a walking dead.

460
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,590
The vaccine saved his life.

461
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,190
What's your take on this?

462
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,040
I met him today.

463
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,000
It seems nothing has happened to him.

464
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,000
I can't believe it.

465
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,950
Do we need to kill the river monster?

466
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,350
Of course we do.

467
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,680
You promised the officials in Beijing

468
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,760
that you'll have Mogudao members eradicated from Tientsin.

469
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,520
Where is the river monster?

470
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,000
Where,

471
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,310
where is it?

472
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,640
It's on people's mind.

473
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,310
I don't get it.

474
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,310
Could you tell me more about it?

475
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,230
It doesn't matter if Mogudao has been eradicated

476
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,800
or Guo Deyou is dead or not.

477
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,920
Once the river monster on people's mind is gone,

478
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,310
the peace in Tientsin will be restored.

479
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,880
Introduce the vaccine.

480
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,400
Cut off the curves.

481
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,830
We even allowed Ding Mao to be the Secretary General.

482
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,040
We can also allow him

483
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,400
to save his brother's life.

484
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,310
No wonder you're the governor.

485
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,950
You asked me to ease the conflict at the theater.

486
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,590
First, Ding Mao got three days

487
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,680
to solve the case and save his life,

488
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,830
and got to work for you as before.

489
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,110
Second…

490
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,830
Second, we didn't show partiality to Ding Mao,

491
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,830
so that the Mayor and the Commander in Chief won't get irritated.

492
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,520
Brilliant! Brilliant!

493
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,230
Everything will fall into place

494
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,760
just in time.

495
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,350
It's not the right time yet.

496
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,310
We need to wait.

497
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,830
He is like a dragon without scale.

498
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:45,070
He is like a tiger without teeth.

499
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,760
If I miss this chance,

500
00:32:49,800 --> 00:33:04,160
it may not come again.

501
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,800
Mr. Cui was bad-tempered.

502
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,350
He'd scold or hit Mrs. Cui when he was in a mood,

503
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,830
not to mention when he was drunk.

504
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,040
Life is hard for Mrs. Cui.

505
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,160
But she has been a loyal wife.

506
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,400
She has developed a habit of drinking tea

507
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
and growing plants.

508
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,560
Except for going to Chunhe Theater

509
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,160
and seeing Mrs. Wang,

510
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,760
she'd stay home all day long.

511
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,800
Mrs. Wang? Which Mrs. Wang?

512
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
I don't know.

513
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,470
She has a chauffeur who drives her.

514
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,190
We're not allowed to follow.

515
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,710
Alright, you're excused.

516
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,520
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

517
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,310
This is the private room that Mrs. Cui rented.

518
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,950
This is not the room

519
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,110
where her birthday banquet was held.

520
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,110
This room is the most remote

521
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,469
and cheapest one in the theater.

522
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,670
I think she chooses this room

523
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,150
because she knows

524
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,429
it's inappropriate for a married woman

525
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,800
to go to the theater all alone.

526
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,429
Perhaps Mr. Cui didn't know this.

527
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,360
Does Mrs. Cui come here often?

528
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,000
She'd come here for every performance

529
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,389
of Mr. Nie.

530
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,760
You mean,

531
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,429
there is something between Mrs. Cui and Mr. Nie?

532
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,670
We're not supposed to talk about it.

533
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,520
Mr. Nie got support from people behind him.

534
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,630
Both of us can't afford to offend him.

535
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,080
Mr. Nie has so many fans.

536
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,280
Half of the audience

537
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,080
are his fans.

538
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,000
Last month, he came to me

539
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,430
to withdraw his savings of the last four or five years.

540
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,320
I was freaking out.

541
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,360
Luckily, he is a loyal friend.

542
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,320
Much to my relief,

543
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,000
he told me he wasn't ending the contract.

544
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,360
Are you finding fault with me by him?

545
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,910
Are you trying to destroy my business?

546
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,040
You said the dishes are clean.

547
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,760
Why should we visit the kitchen of the theater?

548
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,600
Shut up.

549
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,150
What are you doing?

550
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,910
It's only natural for a cook to steal food.

551
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,430
We're here to find clues. You're…

552
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,230
It tastes good.

553
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,710
Deyou,

554
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,360
do you feel bad

555
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,670
about Ding Mao's leg injury?

556
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,760
Will he be lame in the legs?

557
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,670
He is a handsome young man. How come…

558
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,840
Oh, give it a rest.

559
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,560
Just enjoy the ham

560
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,910
and stop talking about his leg injury.

561
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,000
Tell us, what are you doing here?

562
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,280
I was about to ask you the same question.

563
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,320
Who are you?

564
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,120
Who are you?

565
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,710
I'm an apprentice here.

566
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,630
My master sent me here to fetch something.

567
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,320
It's late in the night

568
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,950
and you're here to fetch a pot.

569
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,600
So what?

570
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,390
It's for cooking late night meal.

571
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,390
Okay, for cooking late night meal.

572
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,470
For cooking late night meal.

573
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,120
For cooking late night meal.

574
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,760
You broke your nose.

575
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,630
But you still keep that hat on your head.

576
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,710
Are you hiding something valuable there?

577
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,080
Shall I tell your master that you stole a pot

578
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,150
or tell the owner of the gambling parlor that you cheated in the game?

579
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,870
Please don't.

580
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,280
I'm begging.

581
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,600
You're so insightful. Please forgive me.

582
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,710
Then tell us what you're doing here.

583
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,840
Sometimes I play dice and card games.

584
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,430
I'm in debt.

585
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,120
I heard that the pot for cooking ginseng soup

586
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,000
has turned gold.

587
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,430
So, I got the idea of selling it for money to pay my debt.

588
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,870
You mean this is the pot which is used to cook ginseng soup for Mr. Nie?

589
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,390
That's right. Mr. Nie takes good care of himself.

590
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,670
He'd drink ginseng soup to wet his whistle

591
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,630
before the performance.

592
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,910
It has been a force of habit for years.

593
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,320
Who knows the pot would turn gold?

594
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,670
Did Mr. and Mrs. Cui

595
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,630
also drink the soup?

596
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,230
I think so.

597
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,950
Alright, you can go now.

598
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,230
Then, my dice…

599
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,470
It's yours now.

600
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,800
It's yours now.

601
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,080
You can have it.

602
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,670
Then the pot…

603
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,390
Do you want the pot?

604
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,120
It's yours now.

605
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,150
Do you want the pot?

606
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,600
Deyou,

607
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,710
what is it?

608
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,320
It's a little trick among the gamblers.

609
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,710
You can control the outcome of the dice rolling.

610
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,910
Really?

611
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,950
Three!

612
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,630
Come on, it's a six.

613
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,840
Four!

614
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,520
Five!
