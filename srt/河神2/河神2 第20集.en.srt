3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,840
Let's come back to our story and continue.


4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,000
Previously, we talked about


5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,720
with the directions of Boss Lu, Guo Deyou and Gu Ying went to the graveyard


6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,309
to find Grave Robber Zhang, the senior fellow apprentice of Carpenter Huang.


7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,230
But they failed to find Zhang Chengzhuan.


8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,120
Guo Deyou got a scented tea ticket


9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,360
and he went to the Cangcui House in disguise.


10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,950
He happened to meet Ding Mao there.


11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,440
They found the owner of the scented tea tickets


12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,630
is the top prostitute, Yuehong.


13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,310
They were supposed to inquire of her about something.


14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,520
But Yuehong had been hung by the neck.


15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,520
When Gu Ying came to the Cangcui House for Guo Deyou,


16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,630
she witnessed the death of Yuehong.


17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,950
The procuress cried piteously,


18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,950
and she said the death of Yuehong was because of the condemnation of the founder of her lineage.


19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,360
Ding Mao inquired of Director Lin again.


20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,590
He spilled out the truth under the pressure.


21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,720
He was calculated by some persons on the day he received the gold bars.


22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,840
And Yuehong was one of them.


23
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,880
Guo Deyou came to Gu Ying


24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,400
and he heard from Sorceress Zhang that


25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,310
the wood in the room of Yuehong


26
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,000
was used to fill the path leading to a grave.


27
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,950
According to the instructions of Sorceress Zhang,


28
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,510
they went to find Cobbler Liu.


29
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,950
They found Cobbler Liu came under strong suspicion of


30
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,080
killing Yuehong.


31
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,080
It introduced that the theft of gold bars had to be solved,


32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,870
otherwise some worthy man


33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,310
might lose his life.


34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,310
Good morning, Ganger.


35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,000
Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.


36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,160
Someone is dead.


37
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,670
Someone is dead.


38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,600
Help.

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,600

This way. This way. This way.


63
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,160
Hang in there.


64
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,830
Okay.


65
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,360
Slow. Turn it turn.


66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,110
It's great. Hang in there.


67
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,760
Okay.


68
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,070
Be careful.


69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,480
Keep it reposeful.


70
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,760
Great.


71
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,000
Right. Right. Right.


72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,320
Secretary General Ding,


73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,200
you're coming in person.


74
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,390
If you wanna see the truck,


75
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,000
I can park it outside the gate of your house.


76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,760
When was it found?


77
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,550
At my direction,


78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,790
the corpse-salvage team have just salvaged it from the water.


79
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,320
Fu Laiyong,


80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,950
come here. Hurry up.


81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,830
What do you intend to do?


82
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,550
To tell you the truth,


83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,920
the price won't be the same as salvaging a corpse.


84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
It's totally different.


85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
According to our rules,


86
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,830
something with two arms and two legs can be counted as one.


87
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,600
Have a look at it.


88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
How many arms and legs can you count?


89
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,550
Take care of the wheels.


90
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,480
Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo.


91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,000
Come here. Come here. Come here.


92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,510
What do you want?


93
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,270
You can even salvage a truck,


94
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,110
so salvaging a coffin seems to be a piece of cake for you.


95
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,350
I have a personal task for you,


96
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,950
which can let you earn a lot.


97
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,670
I haven't told any other person in your team.


98
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
You'll have to put forth a little of your strength,


99
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,440
and then we can earn the money.


100
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,160
What nonsense are you talking? I'm investigating the case.


101
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,510
Deyou,


102
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,600
shall we fix the price based on wheels?


103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,550
A truck has four wheels,


104
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,230
which can be constrainedly counted as one.


105
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,720
Captain, the truck has six wheels.


106
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,070
Then I'll count it as one and a half.


107
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,350
Write it down.


108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay. One and a half.


109
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,830
What do you want me to salvage?


110
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,670
A coffin. A coffin. A coffin.


111
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
Secretary General.


112
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,200
Have a check on it again.


113
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't miss anything.


114
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,550
Would you like to have a rest on the riverbank?


115
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,350
They're smart.


116
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,390
They did this as a gang did things whose members were always in a state of extreme nervousness.


117
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
The truck used to deliver the gold bars was like the crown prince


118
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,720
and this truck was like the racoon.


119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,880
One person hid in the truck


120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,070
to manipulate the shadow puppets.


121
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,200
Seeing from the outside,


122
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,040
it seemed the truck was full of soldiers.


123
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,640
And Director Lin was deceived because of this.


124
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
Actually there was no soldier in the truck.


125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,920
They are superior.


126
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,040
Then I have to count


127
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,350
how many arms and legs there are carefully.


128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.


129
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,950
I've counted it clearly.


130
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,950
Twelve arms and twelve legs.


131
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,830
It can be counted as six corpses.


132
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,640
And you said six wheels can be counted as one and a half corpses.


133
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,200
So there should be seven and a half corpses.


134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,159
Right?


135
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,200
I get a pain...


136
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,760
Captain.


137
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,790
...in my stomach.


138
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,070
Captain, something is wrong.


139
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,070
What's happening?


140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,110
Someone of the Chinese shadow puppetry troupe died.


141
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,110
Who died?


142
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,390
The last name of him is Liu.


143
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,550
His name is...is...Liu...Liu...


144
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,070
Liu...Cheng...what?


145
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,390
Mao.


146
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,070
Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. His name is Liu Chengmao.


147
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,510
Mao. Mao. Mao.


148
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
Mao. Mao. Mao.


149
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
Loo. Loo. I have to go to the loo.


150
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,830
His carotid artery was scratched by a sharp object,


151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
and he bled to death.


152
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,160
What on earth is Grave Robber Zhang gonna do?


153
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,070
Hurry up.


154
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,510
Little River God,


155
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,440
I've brought you the man you want.


156
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
Come on. Come here. Come here. Come here.


157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,880
Hurry up.


158
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,440
Come on. Come in.


159
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,320
What are you scared of? Cooperate with the investigation.


160
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,030
Don't be nervous.


161
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,840
Well, sit down, please.


162
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Come on. Sit down. Sit down.


163
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,230
I ask you here since I have a question for you.


164
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,710
Did he die of


165
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,230
the condemnation of the founder of his lineage?


166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,350
How do you know it, Little River God?


167
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,840
Of course, I know it.


168
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,000
But


169
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,000
Secretary General Ding doesn't know.


170
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
So you have to give a clear explanation


171
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,670
to our Secretary General Ding.


172
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,440
Give an explanation.


173
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,030
Spill it out.


174
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,150
There's a tradition in our industry.


175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,880
After making a shadow puppet,


176
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,760
one has to use some living things to fix its soul.


177
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Generally speaking, we'll cut the throat of a living chicken


178
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
and throw it into the vat.


179
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,470
And then put the shadow puppet at the rim of the vat,


180
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,760
and cover it with a red cloth.


181
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,400
When the shadow puppet is used in the future,


182
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
it seems to


183
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,670
have the soul.


184
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,590
We just wanna have a good luck in business.


185
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,760
Cobbler Liu used his life


186
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,400
to fix the souls of the three shadow puppets of Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.


187
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,840
What are you doing?


188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,230
It's the scene of crime. Don't you know it?


189
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,080
It's the scene of crime.


190
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,520
The four fellow apprentices stole the gold bars together.


191
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,960
It's gonna be a difficult case for you, isn't it?


192
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,880
It's so difficult.


193
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,470
Most of the prime culprits have died.


194
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,080
There's only one left,


195
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,150
who's Grave Robber Zhang, Zhang Chengzhuan.


196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,230
What?


197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,910
A cobbler, a carpenter,


198
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,960
a grave robber and a prostitute.


199
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,150
How did they know the gold trading?


200
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,230
How did they know?


201
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,470
And where did they get the military truck?


202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Where did they get it?


203
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,110
It's simple.


204
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,110
Maybe one of them


205
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,520
is a master.


206
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,710
-Or else... -There's a master.


207
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,880
there's another master except the four of them.


208
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,350
There's another master.


209
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,470
The fake military truck went to the real bank.


210
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,280
What about the real military truck?


211
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,320
Did these people forge a bank?


212
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,080
Oh my gosh.


213
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,760
It's not gonna happen.


214
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,790
According to what the director of the bank said,


215
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,910
when they were on Victoria Avenue,


216
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,350
they passed two blocks and turned right.


217
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,470
They arrived at the back door of the bank.


218
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,150
After two blocks,


219
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,320
we should turn right and we get there.


220
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,840
After that, I thought there might be something wrong.


221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,280
So I brought someone to take the same route again.


222
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,640
Turning right after two blocks,


223
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,670
we did arrive at the back door of the bank.


224
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,030
There's nothing wrong.


225
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,110
Turning right after two blocks ahead of Victoria Avenue,


226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
it's the back door of the bank.


227
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,760
Nothing is wrong. Could we stop?


228
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,200
We've been walking around for most of the day.


229
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
One more time.


230
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,590
There must be something we haven't found yet.


231
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,640
I don't wanna do it anymore. Go do it by yourself.


232
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,470
I'm worn out.


233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,590
You've promise to treat me with glutinous rice sesame balls


234
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,320
which won't make up for the physical effort I've consumed.


235
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,790
Are you walking a fool?


236
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,400
I'm not walking a fool.


237
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,520
I'm walking my silly wife.


238
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,840
Walking your silly wife?


239
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,880
You still have the physical effort to laugh, don't you?


240
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,150
Help me see what that is.


241
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,000
Nope.


242
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,030
Stand up.


243
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,880
I won't.


244
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,590
Stand up.


245
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,000
Help me see what that is.


246
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,910
That one.


247
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,320
Go, honey.


248
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,110
It's a deer sinew thread again.


249
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,110
I'm sorry.


250
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,760
I got you wrong that day.


251
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,200
If one does nothing,


252
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,110
he won't do anything wrong.


253
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,590
If one is capable of nothing,


254
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,110
he won't be understood.


255
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,150
I know you're not anyone like that.


256
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,710
Me either.


257
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,230
Now that I had witnessed it,


258
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,520
I wouldn't have pretended not to see it.


259
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,590
The color changes.


260
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,910
When the crotonic acid mixes with


261
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,840
alkaline intestinal juice,


262
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,520
a sharp reaction happens, leading to diarrhoea.


263
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,910
So there's crotonic water


264
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,520
in this bottle of milk.


265
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,840
How do you know


266
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,320
I'm investigating Mayor Bai and Commander-in-chief Wu?


267
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,280
Son. Son.


268
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,880
Son.


269
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,670
Son.


270
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,280
What's wrong with you?


271
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,280
Son.


272
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,000
My son.


273
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,030
To avenge the death of Ziren,


274
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,470
I've spent almost all the wealth of my family


275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,760
on investigating the evidence of crime of Bai Jiwen and Wu Zuonan.


276
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,080
If Miss Xiao is interested in it,


277
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,710
I can help you.


278
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,960
Or I mean we can help one another.


279
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,760
Why do you come to me?


280
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,910
Because the Jinlan Times is


281
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,230
the most righteous newspaper in Tientsin.


282
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,110
As long as the truth can do good to the people,


283
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,520
I'll expose it for sure.


284
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,080
Great.


285
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,200
Before I tell you the truth,


286
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,230
I have to confirm one thing.


287
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,150
Please.


288
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,030
Bai Jiwen and Wu Zuonan deserve a death,


289
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,000
but I found something else except for the two of them.


290
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,440
There's another person on the scene.


291
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,200
He might also be the murderer who killed Ziren.


292
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,520
Who?


293
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,150
Secretary General Ding.


294
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,000
According to my intuition,


295
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,030
Secretary General Ding is a good person.


296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,880
But in today's vanity fair in Tientsin,


297
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,470
I trust no one.


298
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,160
Unless Secretary General Ding


299
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
can point out the one who shot that day.


300
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,680
Then


301
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,280
why wouldn't you go ask Ding Mao directly?


302
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,310
Bai Jiwen and Wu Zuonan must have known


303
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,230
that I've been investigating them.


304
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,470
They'll do something to me soon.


305
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm wondering, before I'm killed,


306
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,110
I have to tell what I've found out till now


307
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,710
to the one who I think


308
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,880
can be trusted the most.


309
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,590
The one who can be trusted the most?


310
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,710
It seems you don't remember me.


311
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,880
When your father was transferred to Hangzhou


312
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,070
to supervise the building work of Suchen Power Plant,


313
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,310
he stayed in Hangzhou for four months with you.


314
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,230
You were seven of eight years old then.


315
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,430
When the Suchen Power Plant came into use for the first time,


316
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,950
it's you who closed the electric brake.


317
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
I was one of retinue of the secretariat.


318
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,400
Your father helped me a lot during that time.


319
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,040
I'm sorry.


320
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,470
I don't remember it clearly.


321
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,430
Without the guidance and support from Secretary General Xiao,


322
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,350
I would have been where I am now.


323
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,950
Secretary General Xiao is the most upright man among the people I know.


324
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,350
So I can trust the daughter of him.


325
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,880
I believe Miss Xiao must be able to


326
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,830
make the most just and objective judgement.


327
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,000
Thank you.


328
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Young Master, two hours has passed.


329
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,070
Miss Xiao has been delayed by something, hasn't she?


330
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,190
It's fine.


331
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,310
I won't wait for her.


332
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


333
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,470
There's a report of a sudden event.


334
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,230
Thank you.


335
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,400
There's always chaos in Tientsin.


336
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,400
No matter what happens,


337
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,710
you have to notice me in advance.


338
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,190
Remember it.


339
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,640
How is the case going?


340
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,190
Guo Deyou found a nail which was driven recently


341
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,920
near the bank.


342
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,880
And there's a thread of Cobbler Liu on it.


343
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
But we don't know what it is for.


344
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,520
The case of Nine Statues of Ox, the theft of the gold bars


345
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,800
and the cases of the condemnation of the founder


346
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,800
are closely related.


347
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,310
I have no idea whether they have something to do with the two statues of tiger.


348
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,070
It's said that


349
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,950
the troops haven't got pay and provisions yet.


350
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,190
The troops of Command seem to be in chaos.


351
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,950
No matter what will happen,


352
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,190
I have to find the gold bars.


353
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,400
Have you thought about


354
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,760
who you'll give the gold bars to


355
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,920
when you find them back?


356
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,640
Who to give them to?


357
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,880
Wu Zuonan and Bai Jiwen are friendly to one another


358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,310
on the surface.


359
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,590
And there's a feud between them.


360
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,470
They both know the weak points of each other.


361
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,470
If you help one of them tide over difficulties,


362
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,950
you'll offend the other.


363
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,680
Weak points?


364
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,160
How do you know these things?


365
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,760
I heard from a journalist.


366
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,680
Maybe it's just a rumor.


367
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,350
I'll investigate it further.


368
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,110
But you have to remember


369
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,520
the day you find the gold bars,


370
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,560
it's when you're in the teeth of a storm.


371
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,160
The more deeply you're entangled in it,


372
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,070
the more clearly you have to know yourself.


373
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,400
You can't associate yourself with them.


374
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,280
Don't get any innocent person wrong


375
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,280
due to some so-called support


376
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,310
and loyalty.


377
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,070
How come I feel you wanna tell me anything else?


378
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,520
It's merely a reminder.


379
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,880
Let's have dinner.


380
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,430
Okay.


381
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,680
The back door of the bank is located on the right side


382
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,950
after the two blocks ahead of Victoria Avenue.


383
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,160
This is the third block.


384
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,230
We've passed it.


385
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,920
We're here to have a look.


386
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,520
Why didn't the driver of the military truck find he had passed it?


387
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,590
You're sure that the nail and


388
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,430
deer sinew thread


389
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,040
were used to hang something to block the way, aren't you?


390
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,760
Otherwise how could they let the military officers who delivered the gold bars


391
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,710
miss the second block ahead of Victoria Avenue


392
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,470
but turn right at the third one


393
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,920
to arrive here?


394
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,590
Lend me your foreign stuff.


395
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,160
I've told you


396
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,880
those are tools for dissection.


397
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,830
They can't be used to unlock a gate.


398
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,000
Stop your nonsense.


399
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Why don't you take them with you?


400
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
Do you think it's proper for me


401
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,920
to take the tools for dissection with me


402
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,760
with the status I have now?


403
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,470
Look.


404
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,880
How long have you been an official


405
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,430
so that you've already forgotten what you used to do?


406
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,920
As the old saying goes that skills will never be burden.


407
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,000
When you go out and


408
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,920
see a headless female corpse,


409
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,190
you won't be able to know who she is


410
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,560
and determine the cause of her death


411
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,230
without those tools.


412
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,830
You won't know whether she's killed by an axe or...


413
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,230
Without the skill,


414
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,400
how could you keep a foothold in the Ganghood?


415
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,640
I haven't used much of my strength.


416
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,680
They look glittering


417
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,880
but why are they all made of wood?


418
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,230
Carpenter Huang does have exquisite skills.


419
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,760
This way.


420
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,590
They did forge a bank, didn't they?


421
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,710
What's it?


422
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,710
Unfold it.


423
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,760
It looks like a poster.


424
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,680
They did forge a wall with the poster.


425
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,160
Are you kidding?


426
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,040
How could they figure it out?


427
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,760
They didn't waste any of


428
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,590
the skill of Philanthropist Li.


429
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,190
Director Lin arrived at the Katun Church


430
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,880
half an hour earlier than usual to receive the gold bars,


431
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,430
so the military truck he met was fake.


432
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,310
Military Official.


433
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,230
You're Director Lin, aren't you?


434
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,710
Yes, I'm. I'm.


435
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,880
Get on the truck.


436
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,310
Okay.


437
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,190
The one who manipulated the shadow puppets in the truck


438
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,760
must be the junior fellow apprentice, Cobbler Liu.


439
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,110
The second senior fellow apprentice, Carpenter Huang lost two of his front teeth,


440
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,070
which was an obvious feature.


441
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,280
He couldn't talk


442
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,640
but act as an assistant.


443
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,280
So the one who pretended to be the military official


444
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,160
must be the eldest fellow apprentice, Grave Robber Zhang.


445
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,310
The milk Director Lin drunk in the morning


446
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,280
was mixed with crotonic water.


447
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,350
He suffered from stomach pains,


448
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,350
so Grave Robber Zhang got the deposit receipt


449
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,590
written by himself


450
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,710
without opening the box with the gold bars in it.


451
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,310
Military Official,


452
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,920
please have a look at it.


453
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,230
The gold trading between Wu Zuonan and Bai Jiwen


454
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,950
was finally done.


455
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,040
But what's deposited in than bank actually was a box of dry ice.


456
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,310
All these things


457
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,640
should be done in half an hour.


458
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,280
Because next he had to disguise as Director Lin


459
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,070
and go back to the Katun Church


460
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,680
to wait for the real military truck.


461
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
What a good actor he's!


462
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,070
Military Official.


463
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,590
You're the one who delivers the gold bars?


464
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,310
My last name is Lin.


465
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,950
Get on the truck.


466
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,590
Grave Robber Zhang met the real military truck on time.


467
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,560
The rest of them


468
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,350
had to set up the fake wall they had prepared in advance


469
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,430
before the truck passed the second block


470
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,280
ahead of Victoria Avenue.


471
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,520
One, two, three.


472
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,520
One, two, three.


473
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,560
One, two, three.


474
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,830
One, two, three.


475
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,710
One, two, three.


476
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,470
Then


477
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,070
the real truck would pass the block


478
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,430
where the back door of the real bank was located.


479
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,800
We will arrive


480
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,110
after we pass another two blocks and turn right.


481
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,110
It's here.


482
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,070
Turn right please.


483
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,880
These soldiers were so silly


484
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,040
that they wouldn't have thought they had taken a wrong path


485
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,470
and gone to the fake bank


486
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,000
forged by Carpenter Huang.


487
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,880
He gave the deposit receipt written by Director Lin to the military official


488
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,560
and got the box of gold bars successfully.


489
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,430
Brilliant.


490
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,070
It's impossible for the four of them to know the trading of the gold bars.


491
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,640
And they wouldn't be able to get a military truck.


492
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,400
There must be someone behind them.


493
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,000
He pretended to be a found who punished and awarded


494
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,430
people of all walks of life.


495
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,880
The founder is related to the two statues of tiger.


496
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,680
Now that the nine statues of ox are completed,


497
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,190
two statues of tiger are about to start.


498
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,560
What's lost in the case of the nine statues of ox is lives.


499
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,830
But what's lost now is the gold bars.


500
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,470
So


501
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,760
the tiger represents the gold.


502
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,710
Anyway,


503
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,040
we'd better find the one who forged the bank


504
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,880
and stole the gold bars first.


505
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,430
We've found the fake bank


506
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,110
but where can we find the real gold bars?


507
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,950
Among the four people,


508
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,110
only Grave Robber Zhang is missing.


509
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,160
As long as we find him,


510
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,400
we can find the gold bars.


511
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,400
He has got one box of gold bars.


512
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
He can't be waiting for us to catch him, can he?


513
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,520
The one who is closest to Grave Robber Zhang is Yuehong.


514
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,880
But she has died.


515
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,160
She has died but the brothel is still there.


516
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,350
What about you two going to the Cangcui House to have a further investigation?


517
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,590
Stop your nonsense.


518
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't...don't...don't make a plan for us.


519
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,710
If you hadn't witnessed


520
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,000
the death of her,


521
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,590
how would you have investigated the case?


522
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,070
You would have hugged prostitutes


523
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,230
or had fun with them?


524
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,710
The two of them...


525
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,880
Secretary General Ding,


526
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,590
if you hadn't harboured evil intentions,


527
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,310
why would you have investigated the case publicly? You wouldn't have disguise yourself and


528
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,230
worn a fake beard.


529
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,430
Stop talking.


530
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,640
I haven't finished yet.


531
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,560
Why don't I know it?


532
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,830
The key clues of a case


533
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,280
should be known to as few persons as possible.


534
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
There're secrets


535
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,400
between us, aren't there?


536
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,000
How do you know


537
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,520
Bai Jiwen and Wu Zuonan don't get along with one another?


538
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,070
Why haven't you told me?


539
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Do you hide it from me?


540
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,830
Neither fried dough twists nor small steamed buns


541
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,880
will work in the future.


542
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,190
Whoever will show interest in one another is a bastard.


543
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,680
Lanlan, let's go.


544
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,640
Mr. Guo,


545
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,680
the business I mentioned to you earlier is about to be missed,


546
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,680
if you still refuse to do.


547
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,350
That man died outside Tientsin,


548
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,830
and his coffin was shipped back.


549
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,070
But the boat encountered a big storm


550
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,640
and capsized. So the coffin dropped into the river.


551
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,520
That relative of the deceased said to me,


552
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,430
as long as the coffin is salvaged from the river,


553
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,640
I can state a price as I want.


554
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,760
That man is quite mysterious.


555
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,310
He asked me to keep it to myself.


556
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,230
But I think


557
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,520
I have to


558
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,310
share such a good thing


559
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,350
with you.


560
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,520
You do wanna keep it to yourself,


561
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,800
but can you make it alone?


562
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,389
If you dared to salvage the coffin from the water,


563
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,560
would you come to me?


564
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,040
Now Tientsin witnesses the severe drought


565
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,190
and the Haihe River has dried up.


566
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,630
How could it encounter a big storm?


567
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,389
Either he lied to you


568
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,150
or you lied to me.


569
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,469
I don't dare to lie to you.


570
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,670
I'm telling the truth.


571
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,280
That man also said


572
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,949
he could pay in gold.


573
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,469
How does the man look?


574
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,429
Two front teeth of him are missing,


575
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,389
so he can't speak clearly.


576
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,710
That Carpenter Huang lost two of his front teeth.


577
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,760
He seemed to lose them when he did his job.


578
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,360
All his neighbors know it.


579
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,080
You go to answer that man without two for his front teeth that


580
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,120
you do wanna do the job,


581
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
but


582
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,280
the coffin


583
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,710
has been salvaged by Guo Deyou from the Dragon King Temple.


584
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,190
Okay.


585
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,280
Groups of birds fly away.


586
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,120
The families bury the hatchet and get a harmonious reunion.


587
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,520
Guilty son and grandson should confess themselves.


588
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,600
They're not supposed to ruin the reputation of their parents.


589
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,280
Look at yourself. Do you look like the old hen


590
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,470
who has no egg in its belly but pretends to lay?


591
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,630
The business to comfort a soul is either to move the dead to another grave


592
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,840
or find a sorceress to sing a requiem to express some regret


593
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,520
because his descendants


594
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,870
have done something wrong


595
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,280
and they feel guilty.


596
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,800
You've been singing the requiem for four hours but you don't stop.


597
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,430
And you've almost kicked me to the fiery pit.


598
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,190
You know that I've been doing it for four hours, don't you?


599
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,230
Spill it out.


600
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,520
In the four hours,


601
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,120
how long did you sing?


602
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,390
It's you who were invited.


603
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,710
Since you're exquisite.


604
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,520
I, Sorceress Gu, have been in this industry for only a short time and I'm not that exquisite.


605
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,190
I have to learn more from you, don't I?


606
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,600
Groups of birds fly away.


607
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,870
Stop shouting. Stop shouting.


608
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,950
Mom, you mean, what evil thing


609
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,870
have they done


610
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,360
so that they make us shout so hard?


611
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,670
Who knows?


612
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,470
They sent someone to give me the card


613
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,000
where the location and time are written


614
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,470
without showing up.


615
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,280
They have no shame, don't they?


616
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,560
But they asked us to do so,


617
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,320
which means they value their prestige.


618
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
For this,


619
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,360
we have to do our job well.


620
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,360
You've received such an arduous offer,


621
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,710
so you must have got a big reward.


622
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,320
Stop. Stop. Stop. Don't even think about it.


623
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,230
Okay.


624
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,150
Then you don't think about how much I'll be paid


625
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,280
when I'll do the job alone.


626
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,520
I won't.


627
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,190
Do you think I care about that?


628
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,910
Groups of birds fly away.


629
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,280
The gold I got is quite big.


630
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,950
Groups of birds...


631
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:14,600
The gold I got is quite big.


632
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,630
You do care about the reward I got.


633
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,430
Isn't the soul-comforting curse supposed to be incanted


634
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,600
in front of the grave of the deceased?


635
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,870
Not exactly.


636
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,910
I'm wondering


637
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,190
here's covered with water, before the severe drought in Tientsin.


638
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,320
Who can be that generous to pay in gold?


639
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,870
Are you familiar with it?


640
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,430
It's the herbal coffin you mentioned earlier, isn't it?


641
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,430
It's the same as the wood box holding the red leeches,


642
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,360
which is waterproof and moistureproof.


643
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,950
The coffin has been sinking in the bottom of the river for quite long,


644
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,230
but it hasn't been permeated at all.


645
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,870
Whose coffin is it?


646
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,950
You'll get to know it tonight.


647
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Let's go have a meal.


648
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,870
Do you remember what master has taught us?


649
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,600
Catch the thief.


650
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,950
Use sere leaves to obscure the object and apply some oil on the road.


651
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,120
The move taught by master is quite useful.


652
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,230
If one doesn't make a sound, he's stealing something.


653
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,670
If he makes a sound, then he's robbing.


654
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,840
I know he's an outsider


655
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,120
with a glance.


656
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,710
You're still alive, aren't you?


657
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,630
Who is he?


658
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,630
The carpenter of the coffin shop,


659
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,870
Huang Chengzhong.


660
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,390
Then


661
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,040
who's that in the coffin?


662
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,840
Grave Robber Zhang.


663
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,600
It's he who killed Grave Robber Zhang.


664
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,870
Then he disguised the corpse as himself.


665
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,950
How do you know he killed Grave Robber Zhang?


666
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,600
When the deceased was found in the coffin shop,


667
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,360
the decoction in the coffin shop


668
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,670
was warm.


669
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,520
If it's decocted there, the room must be damp.


670
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,230
But the wood shavings at the corner of the wall were clean and dry,


671
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,280
which means they were newly planed.


672
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,470
As a carpenter, each one has his own plane.


673
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,520
Only with his own plane


674
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,190
can a carpenter plane wood shavings of exactly the same thickness.


675
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,000
A Yama Nail is the unique technique of a coffin maker.


676
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,190
Each nail should be placed in a specific location.


677
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,760
As long as the nails are well placed on the coffin and cracks are sealed with beeswax,


678
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,840
the smell of the corpse won't pervade.


679
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,230
It could delay the time the corpse was found,


680
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,470
which also conformed to


681
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,280
the condemnation of the founder of the carpenter industry,


682
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,080
the self-sealing coffin.


683
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,000
As long as all the people thought


684
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,360
Carpenter Huang had died,


685
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,190
he could be acquitted of a charge.


686
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,520
However, the one in the coffin


687
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,630
was actually Grave Robber Zhang.


688
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,630
Why did you kill him?


689
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,150
A box of gold bars triggered the death of three persons.


690
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,190
The condemnation of a founder scared everyone.


691
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,190
And the military and financial industry fought against one another because of this.


692
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,870
Are all these things


693
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,520
caused by forgetting friendship at the sight of money and failing to share the booty evenly of the four of you?


694
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,910
Do these things have anything to do with


695
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,630
the nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster?
