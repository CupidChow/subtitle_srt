[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,600
Let's come back to our story


4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,960
and continue.


5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,140
Previously, we talked about


6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,040
Crazy Cui's visit to Chunhe Theater


7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,200
to celebrate his wife's birthday.


8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,840
During the banquet, he had an excruciating pain in the belly.


9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,040
Then he suddenly died in the toilet.


10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,240
The people of Yishengmen Gang blocked Guo Deyou and Ding Mao's way.


11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,000
Inevitably there was a fierce fight.


12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,780
Zheng Simian assumed the post as deputy chief of Tientsin Police Department.


13
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,340
He led his guards to quell the chaos.


14
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,300
Yishengmen Gang and Ding Mao came to an agreement.


15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,940
If the real murderer cannot be caught within three days,


16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,020
Ding Mao will pay with his life.


17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,980
Guo Deyou discerned grievance by burning incense.


18
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,360
He learned that the poison which killed Crazy Cui


19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,780
came from the ginseng soup Nie Xiaoqiu, a famous actor.


20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,640
Ding Mao snuck into the Cui mansion.


21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,160
He learned that Crazy Cui and his wife were on bad terms


22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,580
and found that Mrs. Cui


23
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,860
has a long-term box in Chunhe Theater.


24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,080
Guo Chun reminded Guo Deyou.


25
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,340
Guo Deyou and Gu Ying checked the kitchen at night.


26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,660
And then


27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,220
they are going to check the golden pot to find out the hidden truth.


28
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,120
Fan Junyao is going to set up a fertilizer plant.


29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,260
Little River God is going to secretly visit Thousand Treasure House.


30
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,060
The people of Yishengmen Gang are going to carry the coffin to demand Ding Mao's life.


31
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,000
President Ding is going to die.


32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,960
Jianghu.


33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,500
Science.


34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,340
Kung fu.


35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,020
Truth.


36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,940
Nine statues of ox.


37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,880
Two statues of tiger.


38
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
One statue of rooster.


39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
Secretary General Ding.


40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,220
Without going out of the doors.


41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,280
Assistant to the boss of Thousand Treasure House.


42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,120
Ding Mao.


43
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,960
Fertilizers.


44
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
First issue.


45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,240
Deadly foe.


46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,660
Allergic nerve stimulation syndrome.


47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,560
Fan Junyao?

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,880
Silver Bell Seal.


49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,860

Tientsin Mystic 2


54
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,060
Episode 3


55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,780
Indeed,


56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,150
Bi Sheng invented the world's first movable type printing technology during the Northern Song Dynasty,


57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,380
400 hundred years earlier than Johannes Gutenberg,


58
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,540
an German inventor who was known for the invention of the movable type printing press.


59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,290
But this German printing machine in front of me


60
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,910
not only absorbed the essence of the First Industrial Revolution characterized by the use of steam power,


61
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,030
but also laid a solid foundation for the Second Industrial Revolution characterized by the use of electrical power.


62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,500
In UK,


63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,290
it was used to print newspapers reporting


64
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,250
the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution.


65
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,590
In 1888,


66
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,290
when Wilhelm II ascended the throne,


67
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,190
it was also used to print the newspapers reporting the news.


68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,850
Although it was invented


69
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,940
in 1845,


70
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,090
even to this day,


71
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,840
it can still represent


72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,120
the highest peak of the world's industrial level.


73
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,570
Then let me


74
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,980
and this machine


75
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,450
which is significant


76
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,430
for the publishing industry


77
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,760
congratulate on


78
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,540
the birth of a great newspaper --


79
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,330
Jinlan Times,


80
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,180
and grand opening of the business.


81
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,820
Good.


82
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,870
I can repair it. I can repair it.


83
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,350
Do you still remember


84
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,550
you helped me repair my dad's pocket watch when we were young?


85
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,620
Yes, I do.


86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,930
I remember


87
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,040
when you came to me,


88
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,340
it seemed that your face turned white.


89
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,620
Yes.


90
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,290
Back then,


91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,810
I almost fell apart.


92
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,920
Did you


93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,290
lose a front tooth when you fell?


94
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,310
No.


95
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,110
There were just


96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,420
some scratches on my lips


97
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,380
and a little blood.


98
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,720
The front tooth is still here.


99
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,070
Look.


100
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,350
Later...


101
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,300
You go ahead.


102
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,890
You go ahead.


103
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,530
You first.


104
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,550
I, I'll go on.


105
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,330
Later, I lit candles


106
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,610
and repaired the watch for a night.


107
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,890
Then I couldn't even see clearly.


108
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,510
But it seemed that I didn't know how to


109
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,940
install the four gear wheels no matter how hard I tried.


110
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,570
Strangely,


111
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,320
the watch could still work.


112
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,250
Later,


113
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,870
why did you leave?


114
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,320
I went to the place my family


115
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,860
asked me to go.


116
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,780
But I'm back now.


117
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,440
Thank you.


118
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,020
Don't be so polite.


119
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Without equipment,


120
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,220
how can you print newspapers?


121
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,570
Besides, this thing


122
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,909
is not worth much.


123
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,900
I mean,


124
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,060
thank you for repairing


125
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,100
my dad's pocket watch.


126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,600
I still keep it.


127
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,480
You're welcome.


128
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,880
Nowadays,


129
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,990
it's not so easy to run a newspaper independently.


130
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,900
They are waiting to laugh at you.


131
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,840
As soon as you rented such a place,


132
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,500
you spread the news that you are running a newspaper.


133
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,730
Did you get angry with anybody?


134
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,020
I didn't get angry with anybody.


135
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,220
I'm not afraid of being laughed at.


136
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,100
I have only one purpose for running the newspaper.


137
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,080
To tell the truth.


138
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,260
I'll support you.


139
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,230
Let me start by repairing this machine.


140
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,140
Thank you,


141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,680
Junyao.


142
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,020
It's nothing, Lanlan.


143
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,760
Every time, we park our car here


144
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,300
and Mrs. Wang stands there


145
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,320
to greet us.


146
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,220
Do you remember what Mrs. Wang looks like?


147
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,720
It's so far that I can't see clearly.


148
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,730
Is this far?


149
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,420
I have a slight problem with my eyes.


150
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,760
But Mrs. Wang doesn't mind it,


151
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,230
otherwise, I've long lost my job.


152
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,870
Anybody?


153
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,490
You are much better.


154
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,280
But the brace cannot be removed.


155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,330
You should go on with your rehabilitation.


156
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,170
Let's do it on Thursday next time, OK?


157
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,730
This is salt water.


158
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,210
Drink it up in three times.


159
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,490
How long have I slept?


160
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,300
About 20 minutes.


161
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,010
Have you finished drawing the hydrops?


162
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,870
It is here.


163
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,710
It really doesn't hurt.


164
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,490
Now you believe me?


165
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,890
I always thought


166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,360
Using hypnosis as a form of anesthesia


167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,830
is deceptive.


168
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,050
The purpose of hypnosis is to make the patient relax


169
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,970
and let his consciousness slack.


170
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,470
But my treatment


171
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,620
is to make my patient's


172
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,770
all consciousness


173
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,120
concentrate on one point.


174
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,270
So


175
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,640
you may have paid attention to


176
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,490
some detailed which you completely ignored before.


177
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,730
What you heard of,


178
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,530
like the so-called surgical hypnotic anesthesia,


179
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,810
and parturient hypnotic anesthesia,


180
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,280
are indeed deceptive.


181
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,610
Here is the treatment record this time.


182
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,650
Please sign here.


183
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,970
By the way,


184
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,690
does your method


185
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,960
belong to standard school, cooperative school


186
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,300
or authoritative school?


187
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,800
Just now I told you


188
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,850
that the principle of Silver Bell Seal


189
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,640
completely contradicts that of hypnosis.


190
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,690
It is not a form of hypnosis.


191
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,690
Silver Bell Seal?


192
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,290
Secretary General Ding,


193
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,150
you know a lot about hypnosis?


194
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,160
No.


195
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,530
I have read a few related books


196
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,870
to know something about it.


197
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,660
Silver Bell Seal


198
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,070
is a way we, the Rong people,


199
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,050
use to avoid hurt and pain


200
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,680
relying on our spiritual force.


201
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,810
The Rong people?


202
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,610
Dongyi, Nanman,


203
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,830
Xirong and Beidi.


204
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,490
At first,


205
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,500
Silver Bell Seal was just a sacrificial activity for nomads


206
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,250
in the hope that they could seal the territory


207
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,980
and resist foreign invasions.


208
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,350
Later, I discovered by accident


209
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,010
that combined with


210
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,550
the aromatherapy using Spanish balote flower oil,


211
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,660
it has clinical efficacy of treatment.


212
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,410
It can reduce pain


213
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,990
much more effectively than most medical means.


214
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,000
But only the female descendants of the Rong people


215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,490
can inherit and use the method.


216
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,760
So it hasn't been popularized.


217
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,670
Thank you.


218
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,060
Then can the treatment you mentioned


219
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,750
be given


220
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,930
to the person


221
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,630
without his permission?


222
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,300
Of course, yes.


223
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,240
You may have paid attention to


224
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,350
some detailed which you completely ignored before.


225
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:25,900
Well...


226
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,010
I'm going to get changed.


227
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,740
Thank you.


228
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,040
So you grew up together.


229
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,540
Not exactly.


230
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,330
It’s just that our two families lived close to each other.


231
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,270
Why didn't I hear you talk about that before?


232
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,870
We haven't seen each other for years.


233
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,730
I don't have to talk about that every day.


234
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,560
Right.


235
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,160
I left Tientsin at the age of 12.


236
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,760
How are your families related?


237
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,260
What do you mean by that?


238
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,730
Since ancient times, people have attached most importance to the clan relatives on the father's side.


239
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,820
From the great-great-grandfather to the great-great-grandson,


240
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,220
nine generations are considered as the nine patriarchal clans.


241
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,570
At the funeral,


242
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,230
the nine clans should pay attention to the mourning apparel they wear.


243
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,900
Close relatives wear heavy clothes, while distant ones wear light clothes.


244
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,790
In descending order.


245
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,200
Beyond five generations, people just need to hang things to mourn.


246
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,970
Within five generations, people cannot be related by marriage.


247
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,600
We, we are not related by blood.


248
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,090
Mr. Xiao and my father


249
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,080
are bosom friends,


250
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,810
like sworn brothers.


251
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,440
So that's similar to the relationship between Guo Deyou and me.


252
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,060
Something is wrong.


253
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,300
Why do you come to Tientsin?


254
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,710
Do you come here for Lanlan?


255
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,610
Sorceress Gu, please take a seat.


256
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,290
Europe...


257
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,590
Europe is leading the world


258
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,870
in industry.


259
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,430
In contrast, China, which focuses on agriculture,


260
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,580
is somewhat backward.


261
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,440
But we have been engaging in agriculture from generation to generation.


262
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,640
The growth of our nation cannot do without the soil.


263
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,300
When we see something good in other countries,


264
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,600
we can't just follow them blindly, right?


265
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,250
Right.


266
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,400
I,


267
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,280
I studied chemistry in Germany.


268
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,260
I return to China this time


269
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,480
to put into practice what I have learned.


270
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm going to set up a fertilizer plant in Tientsin.


271
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,060
To make the country prosperous by developing agriculture.


272
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,620
Fertilizers?


273
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,670
Yes, those spread on the soil.


274
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,760
Foreign wastes, right?


275
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,040
Foreign wastes are poisonous.


276
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,190
Manures are good for the soil.


277
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
My mother told me that since my childhood.


278
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,340
People have misunderstandings about fertilizers.


279
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,200
When fertilizers just came into the world,


280
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,990
indeed, many unreliable people


281
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,530
and formulas


282
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,450
made the soil hardened and impervious,


283
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,980
leading to irreparable consequences.


284
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,390
But nowadays fertilizer plants


285
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,670
are different from before.


286
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,950
Stop. Stop.


287
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,010
I announce


288
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,180
Jinlan Times


289
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,530
officially starts operation


290
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,900
today.


291
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,830
This newspaper tries to


292
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,810
report the truth,


293
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,730
without using bombastic


294
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,650
or absurd words.


295
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,320
Those who pay attention to current affairs


296
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,690
can get a general idea.


297
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,540
And those who make a living from it


298
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,609
won't be bullied.


299
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,920
We will promote the most true sayings of news


300
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,900
and report news with conscience.


301
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,829
Director of Jinlan Times,


302
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,970
Xiao Lanlan.


303
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,369
Congratulations, Director Xiao.


304
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,480
Wish Jinlan Times


305
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,490
to report big news and good news.


306
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,180
Lanlan,


307
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,000
there will be a piece of big news tomorrow.


308
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,410
Don't miss it.


309
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,990
Crazy Cui's corpse will be put into the coffin.


310
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,640
If Ding Mao hasn't obtained any clue to the case,


311
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,140
he has to be put into the coffin.


312
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,850
Is Ding Mao the newly appointed secretary general?


313
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,260
This is indeed big news.


314
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,520
You don't know


315
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,410
what we talk about.


316
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,630
Don't interrupt.


317
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,240
Lanlan,


318
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,180
you really don't worry at all?


319
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,530
How should I react?


320
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,000
Should I cry?


321
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,100
Well.


322
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,130
I worry for nothing.


323
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,790
I feel like the back seat driver.


324
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,270
I'm leaving.


325
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,380
Sorceress Gu, goodbye.


326
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,470
Do you have anything else to do here?


327
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,300
Yes.


328
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,500
Go.


329
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,270
Where are we going?


330
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,030
Sorceress Gu, I have something to do here. I won't leave.


331
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,780
Cut the crap. Let's go.


332
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,610
Why are you so strong?


333
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,190
Otherwise, I'll beat you to death.


334
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,100
I'll be back later.


335
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,230
Sorceress Gu. Sorceress Gu. My clothes are to be torn apart. They are to be torn apart.


336
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,590
Mrs. Cui admitted that she and her husband were on bad terms,


337
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,060
but there is no conclusive evidence


338
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,300
to prove she has something to do with Crazy Cui's death.


339
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,430
Bread is the staff of life.


340
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,890
Without it, one can't live.


341
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,220
No matter what, we can't starve to death.


342
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,760
Taste it.


343
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,230
I made it.


344
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,660
Stewed fish in the golden pot.


345
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,660
If there is still no clue


346
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,000
and the murderer cannot be found tomorrow,


347
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,410
what are you going to do?


348
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,610
Since I promised,


349
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,980
I'll have to follow the rules of water transport.


350
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,450
Suit the action to the word.


351
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,600
You deserve to be my disciple.


352
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,750
Master,


353
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,700
I always feel that something is missing for the fish dish.


354
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,060
Taste it to see whether it needs


355
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,110
a medicinal material recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica.


356
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,760
You boiled the fish like this.


357
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,680
You couldn't control the duration and degree of heating.


358
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,560
Even if you go to the night fair


359
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,540
and get the precious medicinal material,


360
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,570
it will be of no use.


361
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,740
I'm really not fond of eating


362
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,340
such a dish.


363
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,630
When it comes to the last meal,


364
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,230
you have to ask me.


365
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,900
Anyway, I did lie


366
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
in a coffin before.


367
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,300
If I have to die tomorrow,


368
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,220
take care of a person for me.


369
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,220
Got it. Got it.


370
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,630
Well.


371
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,420
Eat the fish. Eat the fish.


372
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,920
When the dish gets cold, it will smell and taste fishy.


373
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,800
Come on.


374
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,720
I'll go to the night fair


375
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,260
to buy the medicinal material Master mentioned


376
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,670
and see what the dish will taste like with it.


377
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,210
Why don't you go to the medicine shop


378
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,360
instead of the night fair?


379
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,950
Alocasia is highly toxic.


380
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,910
Not to mention the medicine shop.


381
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,320
They may not necessarily have it in the night fair.


382
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,880
Then why do we come here?


383
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
If you want a rare thing,


384
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,060
you can find it in the Thousand Treasure House in the night fair.


385
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,290
Let's go to find Mr. Lu of Thousand Treasure House.


386
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,210
There's nothing that he can't find.


387
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,770
As long as you have money,


388
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,880
cabbage can be turned into emerald.


389
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,670
Do you have money with you?


390
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,400
What a joke!


391
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,680
When I investigate into cases,


392
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,340
I have never spent my own money.


393
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,400
Let's go.


394
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,390
I really have a lot of unique goods here.


395
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,050
But


396
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,800
you'd better


397
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,430
go to somewhere else to find that harmful thing.


398
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,600
We are here because of your fame in the fair.


399
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,750
If you don't have it,


400
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,800
it will be a waste of time for me to go to other places.


401
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,590
Miss,


402
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,050
let's negotiate the price of the thing you like


403
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,910
before you put it in your clothes, OK?


404
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,000
Fine.


405
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,860
We want to buy alocasia. How much is it?


406
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,330
You can't afford it.


407
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,630
Hupimao, shut up!


408
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,810
Evil rooster!


409
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,050
What nonsense are you talking about?


410
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,130
Step aside.


411
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,290
It really is.


412
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,260
A parrot imitating human speech is not a rare thing.


413
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,140
Here a rooster just talked like a human.


414
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,470
That's about the lost skill of the Mu people.


415
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,030
I didn't expect to wide my vision here.


416
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,610
The Mu people in the southwest are good at using poisons.


417
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,490
It looks messy


418
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,290
in this room,


419
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,870
but things are put according to the trends of the five poisonous creatures.


420
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,450
If you don't have alocasia,


421
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,310
it's equal to say that the corpse-salvage team can't swim


422
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,040
and that those who perform shaman dance can't sing.


423
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,860
It's almost dawn.


424
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,420
Should you go home for breakfast?


425
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,420
Fine.


426
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,080
When it's dawn,


427
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,060
let's go out and spread the news


428
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,430
saying that in whole Tientsin,


429
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,780
only Mr. Lu of Thousand Treasure House


430
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,820
in the night fair has alocasia.


431
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,300
What a coincidence!


432
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,500
Crazy Cui of Yishengmen Gang died because of alocasia.


433
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,420
The people of Yishengmen Gang are quick-tempered,


434
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,400
so I'm not sure when


435
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,580
they will come to buy medicine to reduce internal heat.


436
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,760
How much do you want?


437
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,050
How much do you have?


438
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,860
You are unlucky, because it has been sold out.


439
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,220
A few days ago, a lady bought it all


440
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,370
at a price of 500 (silver dollars) per liang.


441
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,650
500?


442
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,250
So black-hearted?


443
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,720
See if my head is bright or not.


444
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,140
Doing business is not doing good deeds.


445
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,000
She was willing to buy and I was willing to sell.


446
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,000
So the buyer is


447
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,600
a lady having fame and prestige?


448
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,300
It's dawn. It's time to close the business.


449
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,100
Ying,


450
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,980
do you think the southwestern Mu poison


451
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,030
has something to do with Mogudao?


452
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,230
Aren't you the one


453
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,340
who is most familiar with Mogudao?


454
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,640
If you say yes, then it is yes.


455
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,560
As it's dawn, let's go out the spread the news.


456
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,250
That woman paid with a thumb ring.


457
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,900
Money can't tell its master, but the thumb ring can.


458
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,820
If you keep it, it will be trouble for you sooner or later.


459
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,680
You'd better let me keep it.


460
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,240
I promise I won't tell anyone else.


461
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,030
Hurry. Hurry.


462
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,840
Ying.


463
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,010
As it's dawn, let's go out the spread the news.


464
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,920
Thank you.


465
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,450
Thank you.


466
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,400
He will come again.


467
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,870
Shut up.


468
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,940
You talk a lot day and night.


469
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,680
President Ding,


470
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,360
three days have passed.


471
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,440
You should hand over the murderer.


472
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,530
We still can't confirm who the murderer is.


473
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,750
You can't confirm the murderer?


474
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,540
So you haven't found the person.


475
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,460
Let's follow the rules.


476
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,760
Carry the coffin here.


477
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,940
We follow the rules.


478
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,310
We have put thorns in the coffin.


479
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,520
We were careful.


480
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,310
They were carefully selected.


481
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,150
They all are strong branches with pointed thorns.


482
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,930
Please.


483
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,430
Today, I go into the coffin


484
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,630
of my own will,


485
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,340
but it doesn't mean I plead guilty.


486
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,370
I have nothing to do with this case.


487
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,270
It's just because I'm the president of the Water Transport Chamber of Commerce.


488
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,940
In this trade,


489
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,920
we must follow the rules of this trade.


490
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,480
Rules are the most important.


491
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,150
So don't stop me.


492
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,430
Pioneer built canals...


493
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,290
...to facilitate water transport!


494
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,280
In the past two days, we cooperated with the corpse-salvage team


495
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,630
to search above the water and underwater.


496
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,930
We have confirmed that the real detonation point


497
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,830
causing the leak of Evil Water Source


498
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,280
is a black mine without any declaration record.


499
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,520
Black mine?


500
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,830
Yes.


501
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,170
That place


502
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,900
belongs to Yishengmen Gang. I told that to President Ding.


503
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,970
Yusi,


504
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,790
Enemies are bound to meet on a narrow road.


505
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,780
A life for a life.


506
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,950
Take the blame and plead guilty.


507
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,960
Carry the coffin and bury it!


508
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,430
Wait!


509
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,830
I'll accompany him.


510
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,900
Mr. Yusi. Mr. Yusi.


511
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,790
Yusi?


512
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,610
Isn't this Yusi?


513
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,570
He is still alive.


514
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,360
Isn't he dead?


515
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,290
I don't know.


516
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,850
My goodness!


517
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,180
It's the first time


518
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,350
I saw a living ghost.


519
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,250
When I was five years old,


520
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,940
I almost starved to death.


521
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,730
Mr. Ding gave me a cake and saved my life.


522
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,850
This time, my waist was pierced.


523
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,330
You spent so much money


524
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,960
on asking a foreign doctor to operate on me


525
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,690
and saved my life.


526
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,230
Two generations of the Ding family gave me two lives.


527
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,750
But I didn't do the thing well for the Ding family.


528
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,270
You will not break the rules.


529
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,450
Then let me accompany you.


530
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,870
Offer a sacrifice to the coffin with blood.


531
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,500
Guys from the Water Transport.


532
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,200
Yes.


533
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,750
Remember those people standing opposite.


534
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,480
Kill them all later.


535
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,700
Yes.


536
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,670
Young Master,


537
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,130
I'll go first.


538
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,990
Let's meet at the end of Bridge of Forgetfulness.


539
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,710
Don't get lost.


540
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,890
Open the coffin!


541
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,830
The real murderer is found.


542
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,710
Open the coffin! Hurry!


543
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,140
We haven't seen the murderer yet. Who dares to open the coffin?


544
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,320
If you want to see the murderer,


545
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,280
go to the police station.


546
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,880
She's making her mark and confessing now.


547
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,120
Second Master, the murderer turned herself in.


548
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,130
It's her.


549
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,600
What?


550
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
You want to break the rules?


551
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,630
You, Yishengmen Gang, are big,


552
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,590
but you don't keep your word when doing business,


553
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,870
so you will have no way out.


554
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,180
Young Master.


555
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:32,990
Hurry up.


556
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,690
Young Master. Come on.


557
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,780
Hurry up.


558
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,120
Young Master.


559
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,890
Come on. Get up.


560
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,980
Young Master.


561
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,160
Young Master.


562
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,910
The one who took the blame is wronged.


563
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,980
What did you say before?


564
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,790
Secretary-General Ding keeps his word.


565
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,450
We, Yishengmen Gang


566
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,780
will keep our promise.


567
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,960
No need.


568
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,310
The Water Transport Chamber of Commerce and Yishengmen Gang


569
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,490
are quits.


570
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,690
How did you investigate about alocasia?


571
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,800
Last night, I asked you to have the stewed fish in the golden pot,


572
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,950
but you didn't even take a look at it.


573
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,420
What could be found?


574
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,770
Stewed fish in the golden pot?


575
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,350
The Compendium of Materia Medica says


576
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,100
alocasia is mild in nature and bitter in taste.


577
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,280
Put its juice on the iron, it will turn into gold immediately.


578
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,200
If you cook with an iron pot,


579
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,540
it will turn into a golden pot.


580
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,740
Alchemy is deceptive.


581
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,540
Jianghu tricks.


582
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,990
Bitter water is needed to boil alocasia to stimulate its efficacy.


583
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,590
It's not a golden pot.


584
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,000
It's covered with copper.


585
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,730
It doesn't matter whether it's golden pot or copper pot.


586
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,290
The key is that alocasia boiled with water


587
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,820
is normally non-toxic,


588
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,220
but when mixed with blood, it can dissolve bones.


589
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,420
When mixed with blood, it can dissolve bones?


590
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,400
Crazy had severe gastric ulcer during his lifetime.


591
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,870
His stomach bled a lot.


592
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,500
When his blood was mixed with alocasia...


593
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,110
Then, why did she surrender herself?


594
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,950
Did you really me consider me as someone who does nothing to save you?


595
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,440
Could I just watch you get into the coffin that will take your life without doing anything to help you?


596
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,760
The owner of the jade shop said


597
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,040
that the thumb ring


598
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,300
was made from the original stone that Crazy Cui got at the auction a few days ago.


599
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,860
Jade.


600
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,170
One jade, one stone.


601
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,949
As the name suggests...


602
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:28,780
He was killed by me.


603
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,389
I hate him.


604
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,070
I have long wanted him to die.


605
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,190
I poisoned and murdered my husband.


606
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,949
If you trust me,


607
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,670
do me a favor.


608
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,020
Tomorrow morning,


609
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,429
after I finish washing and dressing myself,


610
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,730
I'll go to the police station to surrender myself.


611
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,670
What, what else do you want to say?


612
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,390
I, I don't have anything else to say either.


613
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,680
I didn't expect that


614
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,540
Mrs. Cui admitted that so quickly.


615
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,170
I really couldn't stand his beating and scolding,


616
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,760
so I killed him.


617
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,790
Sorry for bringing trouble to you, Secretary General Ding and Mr. Guo.


618
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,870
Why didn't you tell me


619
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,020
when I went to your mansion earlier?


620
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,900
I had the idea of leaving things to chance,


621
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,630
so I hid it from you.


622
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,250
Now I plead guilty.


623
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,270
When did you buy the crumbled heartbreak grass you put in the meal


624
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,000
from Mr. Wan?


625
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,900
I can't remember


626
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,120
the exact date.


627
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,490
Anyway, with the excuse of


628
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,020
going out to play mahjong...


629
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,380
The lady of Yishengmen Gang


630
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,980
is really not ordinary.


631
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,960
You go out to play mahjong at night.


632
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,060
The night fair is hidden.


633
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,230
It opens in the middle of the night.


634
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,580
I made up the word


635
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,460
crumbled heartbreak grass.


636
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,540
The poison that killed Crazy Cui is alocasia.


637
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,350
The one who sold the drug is Mr. Lu,


638
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,020
not Mr. Wan.


639
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,780
He was killed by someone else, not you.


640
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,870
Captain,


641
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,300
is this how the police station handles cases?


642
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,990
I pleaded guilty.


643
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,660
Won't you declare me guilty?


644
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,010
Catch her...


645
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,190
Or not?
