[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,630
Let's go back to our main story.


4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,710
In the last episode,


5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,800
Tieniu had a violent death.


6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,270
The corpse-salvage team broke with Guo Deyou.


7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,880
Nine statues of ox. Two statues of tiger. One statue of rooster.


8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,640
Rumors are spreading.


9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,880
Tianjin had a drought.


10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,230
Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce was full of crises.


11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,920
Guo Deyou condoled with his master at the bier,


12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,870
discerned grievance by lighting a cigarette, only to find that he was trapped.


13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,550
Gu Ying and her mother woke up Guo Deyou and saved him.


14
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,390
Sorceress Zhang said something to enlighten them.


15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,630
Ding Mao decided to resign and leave Tianjin.


16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,310
Xiao Lanlan firmly determined to revenge for her father.


17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,910
Ding Mao worshipped Guo Chun.


18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,520
They both got drunk, making a commitment.


19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,590
Guo Deyou checked Tieniu's corpse by himself


20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,470
and found the seal of First Freezer that Tieniu risked his life to keep.


21
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,150
An idea occurred to Guo Deyou's mind.


22
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,520
Thus


23
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,590
the stories of life and death emerged.


24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,360
Three old cases emerged again.


25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,880
Tianjin lost another ox again.


26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,160
Ganghood.


27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,039
Science.


28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,680
Kung fu.


29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,479
Truth.


30
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,310
Nine statues of ox.


31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,910
Two statues of tiger.


32
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,120
One statue of rooster.


33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,320
Ding Mao.


34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Lanlan.


35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Midwife.


36
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,550
Mourning for three years.


37
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,800
Beauty.


38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
Westlake Restaurant.


39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,829
I'm not on purpose.


40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,160
Alas, my little ancestor.


41
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,880
Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce is going to break down.


42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,829
Truth.


43
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,550
Commitment.


44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
As for the marriage...


45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,800
River God.


46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,520
Tientsin Mystic 2


47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,390
Episode 16


48
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,670
Have you ever had the thousand-year ginseng?


49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,829
You didn't eat anything yesterday.


50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,750
While you're so energetic today.


51
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,079
It needs to be postponed.


52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,270
What?


53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
My master passed away.


54
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,880
As his apprentice, I have to observe mourning for him for at least three years.


55
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,670
So


56
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,720
our marriage


57
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,670
has to be postponed.


58
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,030
Anyhow I have waited for twenty years.


59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,270
It's just another three years.


60
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,000
Deyou.


61
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,550
We've waited for so long.


62
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,950
The door was closely watched.


63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,200
The First Freezer


64
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,920
is not so easy to go inside.


65
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,720
Turn to your friend for help.


66
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,350
I have lots of friends.


67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,110
Which one do you refer to?


68
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,070
Lord.


69
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,270
I dreamed about you last night.


70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,390
You asked me


71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,390
about the situation of the Chamber of Commerce


72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,830
and the childe.


73
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,600
I even didn't dare to look at you.


74
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,000
Lord.


75
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,440
The childe is leaving.


76
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,510
The chamber of commerce is going to break down.


77
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,230
I'm not capable,


78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,440
failing to live up to your great trust.


79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,230
You can appear in my dream and tell me how to deal with me.


80
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,230
Childe.


81
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,040
Two things.


82
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,790
One,


83
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,110
find the best actuary


84
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,950
in Tientsin.


85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,790
Two,


86
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,110
find the person whose right hand is burnt,


87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,550
related to First Freezer.


88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,230
No need to pack the luggage.


89
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,040
I won't leave for the time being.


90
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,230
Why are you still standing here?


91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,600
Please.


92
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,720
Although


93
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,830
it happened in different restaurants,


94
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,790
according to my survey,


95
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,880
I found there is something in common.


96
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,550
The fact is that


97
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,670
all the restaurants


98
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,440
have stock in First Freezer.


99
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,920
So far,


100
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,550
Have a seat.


101
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,000
there are still some people suffering from vomit and diarrhea.


102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,270
The food poisoning


103
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,950
really has a bad effect.


104
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,160
Ridiculous!


105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,200
Absolutely ridiculous!


106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,200
Since I dare let you come here,


107
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,350
it means I'm confident about my supply of goods.


108
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,760
So please


109
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,790
figure out the whole story


110
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,640
and report the truth,


111
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,600
proving our innocence.


112
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,160
The superior attached much importance to this case


113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,510
and has ordered to look into it strictly.


114
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,390
I can come here before the police


115
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,640
because there is informant


116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,230
informing me of the news in advance.


117
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,640
Thank you for reminding me.


118
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,550
I will order the workers


119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,270
to check and count the stock again.


120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,070
Since you're so confident,


121
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,670
can we


122
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,350
enter the freezer together with you


123
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,270
and take some photos


124
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,230
for report?


125
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,070
The freezer is in a mess


126
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,510
with no place for you to stand.


127
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,720
Besides, the cooling devices are very dangerous.


128
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,480
It's really not convenient


129
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,040
for you to go inside.


130
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,640
You were very confident just now.


131
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,270
But you don't allow us to go inside now.


132
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,510
It's easy for us to suspect you.


133
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,510
Look at here.


134
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,160
What are you doing?


135
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,880
What about this?


136
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,510
I will ask


137
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,830
the workers


138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,160
to prepare three clean cotton clothes for you


139
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,950
to enter the freezer.


140
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,480
Thank you.


141
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,670
Wait a moment.


142
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,670
[First Freezer]


143
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,550
First Freezer.


144
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,030
Help yourselves.


145
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,840
Usually you just treat me Guobacai


146
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,590
and stinky Tofu.


147
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,440
Today, Lanlan comes


148
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,400
and we have a feast.


149
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,910
These dishes


150
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,910
are specially


151
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,350
for you.


152
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,670
I can't make you wait me for another three years in vain.


153
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,520
You can do it now.


154
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,710
Later after we get married,


155
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,110
don't live like this.


156
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,880
It's up to you.


157
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,760
It's better for me to leave now.


158
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Then you can flirt with each other freely.


159
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,400
Just sit


160
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,520
to enjoy the food.


161
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,280
We want to enter the freezer to look into the case of the frozen corpses.


162
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,470
Spending much to have food here


163
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
is also for the case, right?


164
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,110
I will interview Ding Mao carefully later.


165
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,670
Living with such a clever girlfriend later,


166
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,670
he can't hide anything from you.


167
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,960
What a hard life!


168
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,350
You mean I'm stupid!


169
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,320
It's not your fault


170
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,710
but the heredity.


171
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,590
If the dad was silly, there would be one silly child. If the mother was silly, there would be silly children.


172
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,710
Just enjoy the food.


173
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,280
By the way, I found the midwife.


174
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,150
Twenty years has passed.


175
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,710
Could it be possible that she is a fake?


176
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,000
No.


177
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
All the information is right.


178
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,880
Have you found the truth?


179
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,640
Not yet.


180
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,910
They said the midwife


181
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,230
went to Tanggu to help deliver a child.


182
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,470
She will be back tomorrow.


183
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,790
Enjoy the food.


184
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,840
We also need to eat in dozens of other restaurants.


185
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,110
Dozens of restaurants?


186
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,790
Are you crazy, Deyou?


187
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,200
Just eat.


188
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Someone will pay for them.


189
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,910
Hey, do you have fire?


190
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,470
Zhao Shuan.


191
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,710
You are...


192
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,200
Have you ever worked in First Freezer?


193
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,640
Let me down.


194
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,670
What are you doing? Let me down.


195
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,030
Grandpa.


196
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,280
Grandpa.


197
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,230
Who are you?


198
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,710
How did you enter?


199
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,840
Checking all the hospitals in Tianjin,


200
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,670
eventually we found someone


201
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,440
with a burnt hand


202
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,150
who had ever worked in First Freezer.


203
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,400
It's the person in charge.


204
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,000
It's the person in charge who asked us to kill him.


205
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Mr. Zhao.


206
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What a coincidence!


207
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,440
Nonsense. Ridiculous!


208
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,400
It's has nothing to do with me.


209
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,230
How did my brother die?


210
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,670
I don't know how he sneaked in.


211
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
The workers thought he was a thief,


212
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,520
ran after him and beat him.


213
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,080
He is really cruel,


214
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,110
hurting several of my brothers.


215
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,840
He is here.


216
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,640
Run after him.


217
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,080
The freezer is over there.


218
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,080
He ran inside by himself.


219
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,520
We couldn't stop him.


220
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,550
Run after him.


221
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,710
This way, please.


222
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,000
This is the freezer.


223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,960
Here


224
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,440
he knocked over the


225
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,590
liquid nitrogen storage tank


226
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,200
and ran out of the freezer.


227
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,470
He was burnt to death.


228
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,319
We were afraid.


229
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,109
So we threw him into the river.


230
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,430
Listen.


231
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,430
If it had been just liquid nitrogen poured on his body,


232
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,710
he wouldn't have died.


233
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,880
There are burns all over his respiratory tract.


234
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,430
He was suffocated to death.


235
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,520
You have another chance.


236
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,109
Tell me the truth.


237
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,590
I admit that


238
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,430
we poured liquid nitrogen on him.


239
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,160
We just wanted to frighten him


240
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,350
with no intention to kill him.


241
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,190
He struggled very hard.


242
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,640
Several people couldn't control him.


243
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,350
It was in a great bustle.


244
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,830
With a tank of liquid nitrogen poured on him,


245
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,880
it's hard to avoid the body and the mouth.


246
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,110
Let me go.


247
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,950
I've been to all the restaurants above.


248
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,470
The number of seafood of five restaurants


249
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,520
is not consistent with the record on the shipping list.


250
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,920
They didn't order from you.


251
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,680
They are unregistered.


252
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
When Brother Niu identified the corpses,


253
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,640
he found a dappled oncomelania from Southeast Asia.


254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,040
So we tracked down by the clues,


255
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,110
finding three freezers purchased seafood from Southeast Asia.


256
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,280
There is seafood from Southeast Asia on the frozen corpse.


257
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,040
Three freezers purchase this kind of seafood.


258
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,680
Two of them


259
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,920
purchased the seafood after the case.


260
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,070
Only you purchased before the case.


261
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,950
Were they frozen to death here?


262
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,310
Please forgive me.


263
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,520
If there were another way,


264
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,070
I won't have killed them.


265
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,280
I was forced to do so.


266
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,950
I was forced to do so.


267
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:23,920
Who forced you?


268
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,040
What are you doing?


269
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,760
No need to try.


270
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,350
It's useless even though the door is opened now.


271
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
We have been exposed to liquid nitrogen on most part of our body.


272
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,190
Our skin is in low temperature.


273
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,880
As long as we are exposed to normal temperature,


274
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,160
the temperature difference will lead to severe burns.


275
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,000
It's the same with the burns on Tieniu's body.


276
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
No. No. No.


277
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,160
Have a rest.


278
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,430
We can't stop. Otherwise we'll become frozen sucker.


279
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,040
Just use our minds.


280
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,640
Can we keep our temperature by using our minds?


281
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,590
Let's look back on the case.


282
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,710
Ok. Just do it.


283
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,950
Crazy Cui. Gu Weiliang.


284
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,920
Master. Steward Hu.


285
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,830
An


286
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,280
Lanlan's father.


287
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,190
Tieniu and three ice corpses.


288
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,280
How many oxen?


289
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,590
Plus Niusu.


290
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,880
It's four oxen.


291
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,310
Four oxen.


292
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,230
Chen Siru. Bai Sihu.


293
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,640
and


294
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,590
Daria, the girl who jumped from the building.


295
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,590
Can they count?


296
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,520
If so, there are eight oxen.


297
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,190
Do they have anything to do with the case?


298
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,830
Do you feel warmer?


299
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,430
My mind is nearly frozen.


300
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,640
By the way,


301
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,230
these bills are all on credit in your name.


302
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,350
If you can go out, remember to pay for them.


303
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,710
You have tasted food in all of these restaurants, right?


304
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,470
It's just for the case.


305
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,400
I just suffered.


306
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,760
It doesn't matter.


307
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,040
So hot.


308
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,710
Don't take off the coat.


309
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,830
It is


310
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,830
the temperature regulation center that is excited because of the heat dissipation.


311
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
Listen.


312
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,830
Once you take off your coat,


313
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,110
you will lose your temperature quickly


314
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,350
and be frozen to death.


315
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,800
I feel so hot.


316
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,640
Really you can't take off your coat.


317
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,070
Don't take off your coat.


318
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,800
Don't.


319
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
My God.


320
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,190
Save them.


321
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,830
What happened?


322
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,070
Hurry up! Carry them out.


323
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,230
Hurry up!


324
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,070
Wait a moment.


325
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,350
Prepare


326
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,760
some water.


327
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,800
and clothes for me.


328
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,310
We can't go out until we clean the liquid nitrogen on our body.


329
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,710
Water and clothes.


330
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,190
Hurry up!


331
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,880
Quickly!


332
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,950
How can you


333
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,230
do this?


334
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,400
If Tientsin


335
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,310
lost an official


336
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,070
and the Little River God,


337
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,040
how could people live their life?


338
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,190
All the people may break down.


339
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,000
Luckily, I, the powerful detect in Tientsin come in time.


340
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,710
Otherwise...


341
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,950
Otherwise what?


342
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,400
Get down to business.


343
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,280
Have you caught the person in charge of the freezer?


344
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,880
No need to catch him.


345
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,230
He went to the police office by himself,


346
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,830
dead.


347
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,160
If he hadn't died,


348
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,470
it wouldn't be possible for you to stay alive.


349
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,230
It was in front of the police office


350
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,280
that he stuck two golden pens


351
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,520
into his temple on both sides,


352
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,280
bleeding.


353
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,680
Then


354
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,710
we came here to look into it,


355
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,040
also attracting many reporters.


356
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,040
Outside,


357
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,110
it's in a mess now.


358
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,040
Stuck like this?


359
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,310
Yeah.


360
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,680
So he just committed suicide.


361
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,190
Right!


362
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,400
The driver, the lime mason and the electrician


363
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,560
were all frozen by him.


364
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,400
According to my prediction,


365
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,640
it must be him who


366
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,590
ordered the three people to kill the three old men.


367
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Now the case was exposed, so he committed suicide for fear of punishment


368
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,400
The case is solved.


369
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,880
Good!


370
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,070
How could a person in charge of the freezer


371
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,350
kill master and other people?


372
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,560
Hmm.


373
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,190
It's all about kindness and hatred.


374
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,350
Who knows?


375
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,400
Anyhow


376
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,230
the real murderer is known.


377
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,640
I have solved another strange case.


378
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
Mr. Ding.


379
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,590
The reporters outside


380
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,520
are eager to interview you.


381
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
According to your present situation,


382
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,350
it's inconvenient for you to appear.


383
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,230
What about


384
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,950
my going out to deal with them for you?


385
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,110
Thank you!


386
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,710
Have a rest.


387
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,000
Captain, remember to stand on tiptoe.


388
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,010
You just stand lower.


389
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,230
Do we get the same idea?


390
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,560
Gold, silver, bronze and iron.


391
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,190
If there are really nine oxen, at least they four are included.


392
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,280
Crazy Cui was killed by the bronze ox as the book end.


393
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,640
The person in charge of the freezer was killed by two golden pens like ox horns.


394
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,800
Plus Tieniu.


395
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,040
The gold, bronze and iron ox are there


396
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,950
except...


397
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,310
Hmm.


398
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,430
I haven't seen how Mr. Fu bamboozles the reporters for a long time.


399
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,830
I'm going out to have a look.


400
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,040
Sit down.


401
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,680
I planned to


402
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,350
go to see you


403
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
after everything comes to an end.


404
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,190
Unexpectedly,


405
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,400
I feel so awkward just like a drowned rat now.


406
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,800
No, not awkward at all.


407
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,830
You are the more vigorous


408
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,230
than ever before.


409
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,920
Will you go with me?


410
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,680
You still want to leave?


411
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,560
Of course.


412
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,000
Life in the future is very hard.


413
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,160
Are you willing to let me, a lame person, go alone?


414
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,520
Is this a sense of humor of you officials?


415
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,590
Humorous?


416
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,800
Isn't it romantic?


417
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,590
The road is not smooth.


418
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,310
So


419
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,680
it's important to choose the right partner.


420
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,070
I planned to


421
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,350
say goodbye to Mr. Guo


422
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,470
after everything is packed.


423
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,190
Unexpectedly you come first.


424
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,800
What do you want to say?


425
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,560
Tell me directly.


426
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,680
I know


427
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,190
you don't want to mention it.


428
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,520
As long as it can help, that's OK.


429
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,590
Besides coming to Tienstin


430
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,070
to marry you,


431
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,590
did Diplomat Gu have anything else to do?


432
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,400
We planned to


433
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,430
go on a honeymoon


434
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,920
to Europa after the wedding,


435
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,760
but Weiliang


436
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,830
had an important appointment,


437
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,760
so the boat tickets


438
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,310
were booked three days after the wedding.


439
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,590
Do you know whom he had the appointment with?


440
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,590
I take no interest in his work.


441
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,000
OK.


442
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,710
Thank you!


443
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,760
Just go on.


444
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,560
Since what the merchants need most


445
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,310
is to sell the goods to make profits.


446
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,430
Then selling the goods


447
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,590
is the most important.


448
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,760
Now Tientsin is in great droughts.


449
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,040
The goods,


450
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,880
in any case,


451
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,560
can't get to


452
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,950
the original owners.


453
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,430
The business is bound to fail.


454
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,470
But if the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce


455
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,350
orders the goods at a price


456
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,760
higher than the market price,


457
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,160
then the merchants don't need to transfer the goods


458
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,880
to other places far from here.


459
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,160
Why does the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce buy the futures?


460
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,590
Tientsin is in great droughts.


461
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,830
It's certain that the farmers won't have a good harvest.


462
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,400
When I was checking the stock,


463
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,430
I found lots of grains


464
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,520
and fruits.


465
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,350
We can sell them


466
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,520
to the farmers at very low price.


467
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,710
Isn't it a losing business?


468
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
What if making compensation according to the previous rules?


469
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,230
When the futures rot,


470
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,760
we need to compensate for them at treble damage.


471
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,470
But if we buy all these goods,


472
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,590
I'm confident that


473
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,800
I can negotiate with the owners


474
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,190
about cutting the price to less than one time.


475
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,760
Then we can save compensation for twice damage.


476
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,310
As for the futures to the farmers,


477
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,590
we can sell some and send some to them.


478
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,160
Although the returned money is barely enough,


479
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,190
at least


480
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,310
the money used for the storage


481
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,950
and rotted goods can be solved.


482
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,760
Why are you confident that


483
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,190
the owners will give up the compensation for treble damage


484
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,760
by offering a price less than one time


485
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,190
to sell them to you?


486
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,760
This is


487
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,190
the reason why I ask you here today.


488
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,520
Can we give all the owners


489
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,000
a promise?


490
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,110
After the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce resumes shipping,


491
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,070
we can surrender two points of the freight charge


492
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,400
for ten years.


493
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,590
Two points for ten years?


494
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,190
Just count it.


495
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,280
It's a losing business.


496
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,630
I agree.


497
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,469
Though we lose two pints of profits,


498
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
we keep our asset.


499
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,560
Making the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce alive


500
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,909
is the most important of all.


501
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,710
Only when they feel they can make a profit


502
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,150
can they agree to make a deal.


503
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,080
Besides I have worked out that


504
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,360
the profit won't be too small.


505
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,630
Previously,


506
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,800
the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce lose much money


507
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080
in dispatch.


508
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,429
If the dispatch model improves,


509
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,469
I'm confident that


510
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,760
within a year


511
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,760
with the freight charge unchanged,


512
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,429
we can improve our profits for another three points.


513
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,040
If the plan works,


514
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,870
the compensation for the owners


515
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,560
will be one third of the previous money.


516
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
20% of the compensation can be earned by selling the futures at low prices.


517
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,390
When I was checking the stock,


518
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,080
I found some goods with no owners.


519
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,840
By selling them, we can get 50% of the compensation.


520
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,760
As for the last 50%,


521
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,560
I will use the money from my family.


522
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,950
After all,


523
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,360
it's all my fault.


524
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,630
I am supposed to bear it.


525
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,120
What do you think?


526
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,870
For anything I can do for you,


527
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,910
just tell me.


528
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,520
What about the stock that Steward HU stored previously?


529
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,120
Will we


530
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,120
cash them?


531
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,230
What did Steward Hu store?


532
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,040
Chinese herb golden cypress.


533
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,230
The golden cypress from Sichuan tastes bitter and can decrease the internal heat and relax the bowels.


534
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,560
How could it lack such common herbs?


535
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,520
We are also puzzled.


536
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,760
During that period, all the drugstores in Tienstin


537
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,040
had no golden cypress.


538
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,840
It's a present?


539
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,000
Who gave it?


540
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,280
I don't know.


541
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,430
With no name left,


542
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,910
he just told us he was an old customer of our restaurant, thinking that


543
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,280
the painting


544
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,840
really matched with the atmosphere of the Westlake Restaurant


545
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,630
and asking people to send it here specially.


546
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,360
Mr. Gu


547
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,600
likes this painting very much,


548
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,760
standing in front of it for a long time.


549
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,560
I planned to


550
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,080
send it to Mr. Gu after the wedding.


551
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,560
Without this painting,


552
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
I think he


553
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,150
wouldn't choose to hold the wedding ceremony here.


554
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,910
The god of destiny makes fools of the people.


555
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,390
I won't bother you anymore.


556
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,150
After you get everything ready,


557
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,320
I will treat you


558
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
boiled fish with cakes


559
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,520
as a farewell dinner.


560
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,950
OK.


561
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,360
You're so kind.


562
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,040
You're really sentimental.


563
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,080
I always have a question in my mind.


564
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,080
It's just a temporary residence,


565
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,840
why is the wedding photo hanged so solemnly?


566
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,710
I just planned to


567
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,150
take the wedding photo only


568
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,000
and get it mounted after arriving in Tientsin.


569
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,120
But Weiliang didn't agree with me.


570
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,040
He insisted in taking it with the frame.


571
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
If it were framed


572
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,430
with the material of ivory or rosewood,


573
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,710
it would be understandable to take it with the frame.


574
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
But


575
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,670
the vast material


576
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,470
is


577
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,280
just from weed trees.


578
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,390
Why did he do so?


579
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Hmm.


580
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,710
Can I take it back to have a look?


581
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,910
Will there be new progress?


582
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,080
Forget it.


583
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,040
Weiliang has something that I don't know.


584
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
I don't want to know about it, either.


585
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,360
It's OK for me


586
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,600
to know him just as my husband.


587
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,360
The gold cypress was in need


588
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,800
because Uncle Hu stored it.


589
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,560
So the drugstores


590
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,560
changed the gold cypress into giant knot weed


591
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,600
which led to Gu Weiliang's allergy.


592
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,760
Holding the wedding ceremony in the Westlake Restaurant


593
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,560
is just because of a painting.


594
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,150
The painting


595
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,470
was bought by my father


596
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,950
and presented it to the Westlake Restaurant anonymously.


597
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,870
This is the receipt for buying the painting.


598
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,560
I found it in his office.


599
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,560
The prescribe for the unguent of allergy


600
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,150
was actually given


601
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,150
by master.


602
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,040
Why didn't you tell me earlier?


603
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,320
Where is the prescribe?


604
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,470
It was burnt.


605
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,280
Burnt?


606
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,800
Ying regards master as her biological father.


607
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,040
What if Gu Weiliang


608
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,870
really is her father


609
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,190
and what if


610
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,670
master really committed the case?


611
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,520
Then it would be that father killed father.


612
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,630
How could Ying face it?


613
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,190
Could it be that


614
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,320
really it was they


615
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,950
that killed Gu Weiliang?


616
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,430
For public or personal revenge,


617
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,430
there must be a reason.


618
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,910
Gu Weiliang hid it in the wedding photo.


619
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,190
What is the foreign language about?


620
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,800
It's a name list,


621
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,280
among which


622
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,040
there are many


623
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,950
superior officials and rich people,


624
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,120
wealthy and powerful.


625
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,910
In my father's remains,


626
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,390
there is also a seal with this pattern.


627
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,390
Gutenberg Association.


628
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,910
Yellow croaker hot pot. Chicken hot pot.


629
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,190
Steam over high fire and simmer in a pot.


630
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,320
What is Gutenberg Association about?


631
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,040
Johannes. Gutenberg,


632
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,910
founder of the western printing,


633
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,430
aims to


634
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,670
spread advanced things throughout the world


635
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,120
the same as the printing to spread civilization.


636
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,630
I heard of it when I was in Germany.


637
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,630
Their founders


638
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,150
seemed to be


639
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,710
some industrial magnates appearing


640
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,080
during the time of the Steam Revolution.


641
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,840
Twenty years ago,


642
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,040
the Gutenberg Association came to China


643
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,800
helping to fight against the Mogudao virus.


644
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,910
But I don't know why


645
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
after tens of years,


646
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,630
they seemed to disappear totally,


647
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,470
removing all the administrative offices in Tientsin.


648
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,670
It is related to Mogudao.


649
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,040
As for the fight against Mogudao,


650
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,670
master is supposed to know it.


651
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,560
But I've never heard of him talking about it.


652
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,360
Besides master,


653
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,800
my father and Uncle Hu


654
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,360
have also made contributions to


655
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,470
the extermination of Mogudao.


656
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,800
My father also took part in it.
