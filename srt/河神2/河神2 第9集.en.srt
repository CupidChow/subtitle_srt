00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,380
Let's come back to our story and continue.


3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,380
Previously, we talked about


4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,420
a scruffy young woman walked on the street


5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,660
as if she was out of her wits.


6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,190
Xiao Lanlan intended to place a notice on her newspaper to look for the lunatic girl's family,


7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,200
only to find the girl dead after jumping off a building.


8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,420
Guo Deyou entered the Thousand Treasure House again


9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,020
and got to know the Fiery Bull Scroll is Wu Shuosheng's last painting.


10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,960
Gu Ying and Xiao Lanlan found out Gu Weiliang's case


11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,520
is related to the case of the woman who died from jumping off a building.


12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,700
The two of them got to know from Fan Junyao


13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,030
that a neurotoxin was found in both cases.


14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,940
A rift appeared between Ding Mao and Xiao Lanlan


15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,210
and Xiao retreated in silence.


16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,580
In order to find out the dead woman's background,


17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,300
Miss Xiao visited Enlightenment Women's Academy


18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,830
and was received by Bai Sihu who kept prevaricating over a certain matter.


19
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,160
Xiao Lanlan joined hands with Gu Ying with an intention to dig deeper.


20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,590
In order to carry out the curve cut-off project, Ding Mao


21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,190
held back the corpse-salvage team,


22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,300
but the project could no longer be carried out.


23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,240
When Ding Mao dissected the woman who died from jumping off a building,


24
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,660
the body came back to life again.


25
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,740
Ding Mao kept having nightmares.


26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,820
When Guo Deyou visited Ding Mao at night,


27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,980
the Silver Bell Seal suddenly cast its spell,


28
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,420
inducing him to hallucinate.


29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,539
That leads to


30
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,460
River God breaking the spear, Silver Bell Seal exhibiting its power,


31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,060
a visit to the black market to probe a weird game,


32
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,410
with clever tricks and visceral words,


33
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,760
life remaining in limbo amid dangers and dilemmas.


34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,960
This envelope


35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,430
was on my desk.


36
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,229
I asked Yusi to have a look.


37
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,890
Nobody


38
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,170
had come in and out of my office.


39
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,070
It was from the guy who invited you to the game.


40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,479
Game?


41
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,210
A game that some people play.


42
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,430
It aims to


43
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:46,770
take in new people


44
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,860
and get rid of dissidents.


45
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,289
What game?


46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,630
You'll know once you go there.


47
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,620
If you don't go,


48
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,090
it doesn't matter what kind of people they are.


49
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,229
How is the game played then?


50
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,830
If you haven't joined the game,


51
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,110
you wouldn't know how to play;


52
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,390
once you join,


53
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,010
it's not uncommon to lose your life in it.


54
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,350
Can I turn it down?


55
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,150
As an adult,


56
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,620
as long as you are willing to bear the consequences,


57
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,790
there's nothing you can't turn down.


58
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,070
What are the consequences?


59
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,120
When you go fishing,


60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,210
you must have baits.


61
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,030
If they want you to join the game,


62
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,740
they must have something you want on their hands.


63
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,960
The curve cut-off project?


64
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,550
I received this envelope


65
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,470
as soon as the project was called off.


66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,340
Do you think I should go?


67
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,070
It's hard for the fish to escape


68
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,090
if the bait is too alluring.


69
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,630
It's not up to me.


70
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,260
If the curve cut-off project is their bait,


71
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,690
then joining the game


72
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,890
will be the last chance of survival for my Chamber of Commerce.


73
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,920
Don't forget


74
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,840
the two things you've promised me.


75
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,020
Jianghu.


76
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,660
Science.


77
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,500
Kung fu.


78
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,060
Truth.


79
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,380
Nine statues of ox.


80
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,060
Two statues of tiger.


81
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,300
One statue of rooster.


82
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,820
Remarkably handsome.


83
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,300
Dignified and distinguished-looking.


84
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
On the contrary.


85
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,340
The stolen time.


86
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,740
Karl Benz


87
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,620
Enlightenment


88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,620
Brave


89
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,740
The circle


90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Acting


91
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,780
Cousin


92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,740
Discern grievance by burning incense.


93
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,340
Women's Academy


94
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,980
Join the game


95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,820
Come out now!


96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,860
River God.


97
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,020
River God.


98
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,140
River God.


99
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,860
River God.


100
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,340
Tientsin Mystic 2


101
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,580
Episode 9


102
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,140
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


103
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,340
I'd certainly be drowned if you didn't save me.


104
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,740
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


105
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,490
I'd certainly be drowned if you didn't save me.


106
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,430
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,860
I'd certainly be drowned if you didn't save me.


108
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,909
You stayed up all night.


109
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,810
Go back to get some sleep.


110
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,050
Where did you go


111
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,260
last night?


112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,110
Given your level of intelligence,


113
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,580
you should count it as good luck


114
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,930
that you are able to come around


115
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,320
after being bewitched by the Silver Bell Seal.


116
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,920
What Silver Bell Seal?


117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,210
The skill handed down from the ancestors of the Rong tribe


118
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,060
doesn't harm people per se,


119
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,710
but it kills if people have something they can't get over


120
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,590
on their mind.


121
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,390
Your amateurish skill of discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette


122
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,180
is a failure


123
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,909
from today on.


124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,470
What should be confessed, what shouldn't be confessed,


125
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,560
you've confessed it all;


126
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,060
people you should offend, people you shouldn't offend,


127
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,210
you've offended them all.


128
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,540
It's better for your skill of bringing evil and making trouble


129
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,650
to be a failure.


130
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,960
What are you talking about, master?


131
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,340
You must bathe in it until the water is cold.


132
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,150
As you are not in your right mind,


133
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,500
you'd better wash your hair too.


134
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,940
Your amateurish skill of discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette


135
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,820
is a failure


136
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,690
from today on.


137
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,080
Imagine your agitation and frustration


138
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,610
as a streetcar.


139
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,070
It comes to you with a tinkling sound.


140
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,120
Don't avoid it,


141
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,650
don't ignore it.


142
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,240
Watch it stop slowly.


143
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,670
Some people get on,


144
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,460
some people get off,


145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,340
but you just lie there,


146
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,500
watch it drive off slowly.


147
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,000
It goes


148
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,970
further and further.


149
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,950
I'm sorry, Dr. Rong.


150
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,710
He insists on...


151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
It's OK.


152
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,250
Get out of here for now.


153
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,890
OK.


154
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,630
Don't be nervous.


155
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,450
I've increased the density of salt on purpose.


156
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,170
The buoyancy force is so strong


157
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,930
that you won't sink.


158
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,850
Concentrate all your attention


159
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,090
on your breath.


160
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,010
Not only your legs,


161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,990
you'll feel


162
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,850
your whole body doesn't exist.


163
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,150
Only your consciousness exists.


164
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,690
You deserve to be Little River God indeed.


165
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,830
You can find every place with water


166
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,750
in Tientsin.


167
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,270
What's that Silver Bell Seal for?


168
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,410
If the therapy of Silver Bell Seal


169
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,120
is interrupted by external force,


170
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,400
it'll be very dangerous.


171
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,730
The patient's blocked pain


172
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,200
will multiply.


173
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,760
As a doctor,


174
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,810
of course I'm obliged to stop you


175
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,470
to protect my patient.


176
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,400
Not to mention


177
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,930
my patient


178
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,620
is the secretary general of Tientsin.


179
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,410
I'll lose my job


180
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,330
if they blame me for it.


181
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,640
So the Silver Bell Seal is for relieving pain?


182
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,880
Not only so,


183
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,760
it can also strengthen psychological line of defense


184
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,510
and seal off all discomforting


185
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,490
neurotransmissions and receptions


186
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,670
which mainly involve pain.


187
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,680
Unseal it for me.


188
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,370
Unseal it?


189
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,690
The sealing effect won't last


190
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,420
after the therapy.


191
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,660
Could it be


192
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,770
the crown jewel of Tientsin,


193
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,760
the skill of discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette


194
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,030
is sealed off?


195
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,680
This is the aromatherapy of Ballota nigra.


196
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,790
I don't think you like this smell.


197
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,290
If my analysis is right,


198
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,910
the rationale for discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette


199
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,150
should be cerebral hypoxia


200
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,880
caused by anaphylactic reaction


201
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,820
which leads to a surge of adrenaline.


202
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,770
The brain's protective mechanism is forcibly turned on,


203
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,220
making the activity of neurons hyper


204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,930
so as to improve the ability to receive information.


205
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,800
You don't need to ponder the rationale behind


206
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,630
discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette.


207
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,000
I see.


208
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,750
The Silver Bell Seal tends to


209
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,600
block neuronal activity,


210
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,720
while discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette


211
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,700
tends to fully activate neurons.


212
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,670
Little River God,


213
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,360
your repressed memory which was dug out of your subconsciousness


214
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,600
suppressed your neuronal activity,


215
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,450
making the blocking effect


216
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,560
linger after you've come around.


217
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,560
Your clinical reaction is such a rarity.


218
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,240
I really want to


219
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,230
do a few more experiments on you.


220
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,810
Don't tell me something I don't understand.


221
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,540
Let me tell you one last time:


222
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,880
Unseal it for me!


223
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,670
If one day


224
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,110
there's a showdown between the two skills,


225
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,240
it must be well worth watching.


226
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,000
But


227
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,140
the Silver Bell Seal is modern medicine,


228
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,530
not hitting at certain acupoints as you do in martial arts.


229
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,410
The thing you need to untie


230
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,040
is the knot in your heart.


231
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,880
Is there a knot in my heart?


232
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm a physiotherapist.


233
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,890
Such kind of therapy


234
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,560
doesn't fall under my specialization.


235
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,820
I'm sorry, Mr. Guo,


236
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,150
this is the second time you've interrupted my therapy.


237
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,160
My patient is waiting for me.


238
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,650
If you are still not ready to leave,


239
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,960
I'll have to


240
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,710
ask for help from the concession police.


241
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,280
You keep talking about science


242
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,620
but resort to a sorceress' witchcraft


243
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,280
instead of a western doctor to treat your legs.


244
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,650
If I knew you had such a need,


245
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,800
I'd suggest you go to Gu Ying.


246
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,660
That's not witchcraft.


247
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,390
That's empirical science.


248
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,470
For example, traditional Chinese medicine


249
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,330
also has a scientific basis now.


250
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,870
Just that there's not a systematic account.


251
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,160
Rong Aoshuang was using the Rong tribe's witchcraft.


252
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,680
It seems that witchcraft works well.


253
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,280
You take sides with the demon.


254
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,430
Going by your logic,


255
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,960
is discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette also a witchcraft?


256
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,970
You got the point.


257
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,340
It's OK for that demon to fool you,


258
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,450
but why did she seal my skill of discerning grievance by lighting a cigarette?


259
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:41,990
Sealed?


260
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,280
The skill I got from my master


261
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,110
doesn't work.


262
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,450
What do you think is to be done?


263
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,610
As I said before,


264
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,720
there is no such skill at all.


265
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,930
It is a subjective illusion


266
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,520
which emerges after you have allergy.


267
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,180
It's just right that it doesn't work.


268
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,860
This shows


269
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,990
Dr. Rong has cured your allergic constitution.


270
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,160
Damn it.


271
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,530
That demon has really taken your soul away.


272
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,920
I've got to ask Gu Ying to call it back for you.


273
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,800
If you came today


274
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
just to talk about this to me,


275
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,130
let's put it off to another day, OK?


276
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,670
I've got something to do.


277
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,880
What is it?


278
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,290
Is it a funeral?


279
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,210
You are giving a funeral gift.


280
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,710
Just tell me you want it.


281
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,630
Why did you...snatch it?


282
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,970
It's not that I wouldn't give it to you.


283
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,610
Is this important?


284
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,020
This is a game to test me.


285
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,940
Opening the envelope means accepting the invitation,


286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,730
which may cost my life, do you know?


287
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,440
Can you glue it back?


288
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,839
Up the river there is a ghost,


289
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,560
over the ghost there is a bridge,


290
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,000
under the bridge there is a window


291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,109
through which you can peep and see people.


292
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,080
Guo Deyou, I tell you what,


293
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,370
nothing good happens every time you make me dress up in disguise.


294
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,830
Don't let me know you are fooling me again.


295
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,070
Ding Mao, I'm helping you.


296
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,220
How can I fool you?


297
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,250
The black market receives no officials,


298
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,400
it's bound to close when it sees one.


299
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,010
Is there anyone like you who's dressed in a foreign style


300
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,730
to visit the market?


301
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,170
Up the river is the black market,


302
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,120
that's why it says "Up the river there is a ghost".


303
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,880
Even if "Up the river there is a ghost"


304
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,410
means the black market,


305
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,820
what about "over the ghost there is a bridge"?


306
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,300
There are so many bridges,


307
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,560
which one is it?


308
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,520
Is this a bridge?


309
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,610
This is a path.


310
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,400
A path is straight,


311
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,960
and a bridge is arched.


312
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,710
Over the ghost there is a bridge...


313
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,990
Fundraising ball


314
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,780
at Residence No.8.


315
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,590
This is just a regular invitation.


316
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,180
Why was it


317
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,950
hidden so covertly?


318
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,880
Officials must follow a path.


319
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,530
The point is not in this invitation


320
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,770
but in asking me to come to the black market


321
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,690
and see if I have connections with the ganghood people.


322
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,050
Look,


323
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,910
how can you do it without me?


324
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,910
Of course I can.


325
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,600
There is only one invitation.


326
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,650
I'll go alone.


327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,210
You burn the bridge after crossing it, don't you?


328
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,770
If you want to enter the Enlightenment Academy to look into the case,


329
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,750
you have to become a student of the academy first.


330
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,910
It's OK you don't want to be dressed like this.


331
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,020
Just pass the entrance exam


332
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,940
and enter the academy justifiably.


333
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,540
Why don't I want to be dressed like this?


334
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,890
The material is so nice.


335
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,660
This sorceress will just manage to be dressed in this today.


336
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,120
Stop going on about sorceress.


337
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,140
Remember


338
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,260
you are Qiao Jing today.


339
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,980
I know.


340
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,310
My father is Qiao Wansheng,


341
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,260
one of the top Chinese businessmen in Europa.


342
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,410
I am


343
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,030
the third daughter of the rich and powerful Qiao family.


344
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,920
If only this was true!


345
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,100
You have to take it as if it's true today.


346
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,940
Will they recognize us?


347
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,770
Rest easy.


348
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,200
Qiao Jing has never returned home.


349
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,810
Hello, Miss Xiao.


350
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,090
I'm Qiao Guowei.


351
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,010
I'm Qiao Wansheng's son.


352
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,890
I'm...I'm Qiao Wansheng's nephew.


353
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,230
This is my younger sister.


354
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,190
This is...this is my younger cousin sister.


355
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,340
This is...this is...


356
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
This is Qiao...Qiao Jing.


357
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,840
The academy president is right over there.


358
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,870
Leave it to me. Rest easy.


359
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,550
Wait a minute.


360
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,730
Make sure to bite your tongue


361
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,750
when you are not sure.


362
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,670
Brother Junyao has met


363
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,020
Qiao Guowei and his younger sister in Deutsche before.


364
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,300
He knows better than you.


365
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,270
Is that...is that limping guy Ding Mao?


366
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,300
Yes.


367
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,070
Long time no see.


368
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,890
Are you busy with the curve cut-off project these days?


369
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,660
Yes, yes, yes.


370
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,340
This way.


371
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,910
I'll go there to say hello.


372
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,680
OK.


373
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,900
Didn't you say you don't want to be secretary general?


374
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,460
Why do you show up at such kind of cocktail party


375
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,950
with a gathering of high-ranking officials and dignitaries?


376
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,270
Do you have to start a conversation


377
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,400
with satires after not having met for such a long time?


378
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,560
Why did you come here?


379
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,670
Why?


380
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,780
You've got nothing


381
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,510
to say now other than lies?


382
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,580
That day,


383
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,240
I went to see Dr. Rong


384
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,160
for the sake of looking into the case,


385
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,720
and I did go back to my office after that.


386
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,390
I didn't mean to lie to you.


387
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,820
What's more, there are a lot of details of the case


388
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,930
that you don't have to know.


389
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,660
A half truth


390
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
is a whole lie.


391
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,180
If you want to hear the truth,


392
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,890
you should tell the truth first.


393
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,660
So why are you here?


394
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,270
For an interview.


395
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,400
Where are your notebook and camera then?


396
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,210
All right.


397
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,120
It was indeed my fault


398
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,910
for this matter.


399
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,980
But I've got an important thing to do today.


400
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,450
So


401
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,240
let's talk


402
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,970
when you calm down.


403
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,110
Go home early.


404
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,640
Watch out for your safety.


405
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,190
It's a long story.


406
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,560
Jing's father went on a study tour in Deutsche


407
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,090
with Grand Secretary Li of the Qing Dynasty.


408
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,520
However, the cold and clammy weather along the Rhine


409
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,320
caused the relapse of an old ailment in his right foot.


410
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,750
He had no choice


411
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,480
but to stay in Deutsche for recuperation.


412
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,040
Out of his expectation, the Great Qing regime collapsed


413
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,250
while he was healing his foot.


414
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,680
Therefore, he was jokingly nicknamed


415
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,800
"Regime Change with One Foot" by his colleagues.


416
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,400
Just that the word "change"


417
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,870
doesn't sound very good.


418
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,850
I've long heard of Mr. Qiao's


419
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,770
appellation of "Regime Stability with One Foot".


420
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,010
I've finally got its origin today.


421
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,320
Yes.


422
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,920
My uncle is homesick on a foreign land,


423
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,900
but suffers from a chronic illness,


424
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,140
so he had to ask me to take Jing back home first.


425
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,570
Before I left, he entrusted me with a fund


426
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,300
for the use of education back home.


427
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,480
How do I know about these things?


428
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,910
I must ask you for your advice, academy president.


429
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,760
He's really dedicated to serving his home country.


430
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,980
His sagacious foresight


431
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,940
is admirable.


432
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,350
Have you chosen


433
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,970
a school for Miss Qiao?


434
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,150
We are considering it now.


435
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,400
Miss Qiao,


436
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,400
the food back home is a far cry from what you had in Deutsche.


437
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,640
I wonder if you are used to it.


438
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,950
More than just used to it,


439
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,420
I like it so much.


440
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,830
Chinese gastronomy


441
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,790
is both exquisite


442
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,810
and delicate.


443
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,280
In comparison,


444
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,760
I think


445
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,510
Deutsche cuisine is much cruder.


446
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,820
The most gastronomical-minded cuisine in Europa


447
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,740
is French cuisine.


448
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:01,890
Exactly.


449
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,070
Miss Qiao, please.


450
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,950
Step 1 of concealing your ignorance


451
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,710
at a banquet:


452
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,870
Table manners.


453
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,320
Don't make a sound.


454
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,670
You are too loud.


455
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,310
This is mine.


456
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,520
Yours is over there.


457
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,870
Don't make a sound, Brother Junyao.


458
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,370
Don't make a sound.


459
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,130
Burgundy snails with vanilla.


460
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,160
The fishy smell is removed with umami flavor left.


461
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,910
Sehr lecker.


462
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,140
It means very delicious.


463
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,760
Jing,


464
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,230
haven't I told you?


465
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,770
You must speak Mandarin back in your home country.


466
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm sorry.


467
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,270
The vanilla as you said just now is...


468
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,220
Our own people seem to call it sweetgrass.


469
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,880
Exactly.


470
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,440
It was originated in South America,


471
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,130
but captivates the entire Europa.


472
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,730
It is said that some painters


473
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,230
add vanilla juice in their pigment


474
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,190
and use it for painting.


475
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,170
It seems you've also dabbled in


476
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,260
Western art?


477
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,920
I have a smattering of it.


478
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,420
Which master do you admire the most?


479
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,570
Step 2:


480
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,040
You should always say something


481
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,260
that shows your artistic taste.


482
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,730
The Night Watch


483
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,420
is a canvas oil painting by Dutch painter


484
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,040
Rembrandt Rijn


485
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,320
in 1642.


486
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,730
It is mainly about...


487
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,120
Gu Ying!


488
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,000
Rembrandt...


489
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,430
The Night Watch...


490
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,590
It's nice.


491
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,510
I'm good at night watch.


492
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,240
The one I admire most is Rembrandt Rijn,


493
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,160
especially his use of


494
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,340
chiaroscuro as shown in The Night Watch.


495
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,580
The Qiao family's upbringing


496
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,790
turns out to be outstanding indeed.


497
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,030
I'm flattered.


498
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,310
That's an overpraise of yours, Madam Zhou.


499
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,550
Miss Qiao is so knowledgeable at such a young age,


500
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,770
she's quite a rarity.


501
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,480
My younger cousin sister has miscellaneous hobbies


502
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,690
which are eclectic


503
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,210
but not specialized.


504
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,830
What is the thing you are best at, Miss Qiao?


505
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,630
Drawing charms and chanting incantations.


506
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:52,860
Well...


507
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,980
Waffeln Nachtisch.


508
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,410
You see, I've told you,


509
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,950
you must speak Mandarin back in your home country.


510
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,060
These are two German words.


511
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,320
They mean waffle and dessert.


512
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,460
Jing likes baking best.


513
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,980
My younger cousin sister is very fond of playing the piano.


514
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,390
She has had no time to practice


515
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,720
ever since she left Deutsche.


516
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,760
She must be itching to show her skill when she sees a pianist


517
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,710
giving a live performance today.


518
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,440
That's great then.


519
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,780
Could I enjoy a feast for my ears?


520
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,800
No problem, Madam Zhou.


521
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
We'll go and get ready now.


522
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,430
OK. Please excuse us.


523
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,800
Do you know what the most dangerous time is for a corpse salvager?


524
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,210
Why are you everywhere?


525
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,540
It's when you take yourself too seriously.


526
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,010
As the common saying goes,


527
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,250
"A hero is killed by a fall from the horse,


528
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,360
a swimmer is killed by drowning in the river."


529
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,050
The more dangerous it is, the more you should act dumb.


530
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,160
What's to be afraid of?


531
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,030
Just play.


532
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,720
What does this mean?


533
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,190
It says


534
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,410
"The Stolen Time" on your invitation.


535
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,130
I don't drink.


536
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,810
Foreign letters.


537
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,830
I can't read, I can't order.


538
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,980
The stolen time.


539
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,680
The stolen time.


540
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,590
Three clocks


541
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,940
hanging side by side.


542
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,820
Unusual.


543
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,630
There must be something evil in it.


544
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,220
It's called world clock.


545
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,480
It's for knowing the time of different time zones across the world.


546
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,400
Don't fool me.


547
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,540
How can time be different under the same sun?


548
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,200
Because the earth is round.


549
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,810
Forget it.


550
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,350
Well, what does Central Plain mean?


551
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,250
Central Plain


552
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,110
is one of the five time zones


553
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,030
the Central Observatory has divided the country into.


554
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,740
120 degrees east longitude is set as the standard time.


555
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,830
East longitude?


556
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,110
120 degrees?


557
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,640
Forget about it, OK?


558
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,670
Tientsin


559
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,590
is in the Central Plain time zone.


560
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,270
I've calmed down.


561
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,680
Let's talk.


562
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,410
What's the point of going the long way around


563
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,430
with trickeries?


564
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,770
I mean the clocks.


565
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,870
Can't it just say Tientsin?


566
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,890
Why is it made that way?


567
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,850
Excuse me.


568
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,960
Could I borrow the piano please?


569
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,610
Thanks.


570
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,460
Step 3:


571
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,020
If you can play a musical instrument,


572
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,320
you'll definitely pass off as a well-bred young lady.


573
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,240
These foreign trigrams are like ghost charms.


574
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,900
How can I remember them?


575
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,890
I can't do it.


576
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,260
You can't remember foreign trigrams,


577
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,370
what trigrams can you remember then?


578
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,250
Are you kidding me?


579
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,190
As a sorceress, I cut my teeth on this since I was a kid.


580
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,710
Like the zheng hexagram, the zong hexagram, the hu hexagram,


581
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,950
the ben hexagram, the cuo hexagram and the bian hexagram.


582
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,060
Apart from these hexagrams,


583
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,720
I can also draw charms.


584
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,030
To stabilize houses, get rid of diseases,


585
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,820
look for families or medicines,


586
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360
prevent miscarriages and save lives.


587
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,700
Just tell me,


588
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,660
do you want to be blessed with safety


589
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,580
or seek wealth?


590
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,930
The keys are divided into nine groups.


591
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,930
Group A to Group I are based on ten heavenly stems.


592
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,110
Omit the fact that there are only three keys in Group A


593
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,900
and one key in Group I.


594
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,570
Each of the seven groups in between


595
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,680
has twelve keys in it,


596
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,150
corresponding to twelve earthly branches.


597
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,390
The music score is composed for left and right hands.


598
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,800
The left hand is heaven


599
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,760
and the right hand is earth.


600
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,610
Based on this rule,


601
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,430
I changed the music score into one composed of heavenly stem and earthly branches.


602
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,650
See if


603
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,860
it's easier for you to memorize.


604
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,780
Watch the rhythm.


605
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,250
With deep affection.


606
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,000
Like a whisper.


607
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,430
I have great strength since I was a kid.


608
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,120
You can't turn a gong into a lute!


609
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,470
Just take it as if


610
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,410
you are going to


611
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,040
tell Brother Guo your innermost thoughts


612
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,380
in the still of night.


613
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,239
But how can I


614
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,159
say these things in front of others?


615
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,530
Shameless.


616
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,160
Since you've calmed down,


617
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,050
tell me


618
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,840
what I can do


619
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,510
to make you trust me again?


620
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,310
Turn the clock back.


621
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,030
So


622
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,590
is this the rhetoric you come up with after you've calmed down?


623
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,240
I'm just talking about


624
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,240
a solution to the problem with sincerity.


625
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,440
Look at that clock for England.


626
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,920
It is going backwards.


627
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,950
Isn't that the same as one hour stolen?


628
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,610
That's one.


629
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,900
Well, I didn't order a drink.


630
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,800
Drink No.1:


631
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Hypocrisy.


632
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,880
The answer is on the cocktail list.


633
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,270
So is this sincerity?


634
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,800
Go on please.


635
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,990
Has the clock for Central Plain stopped?


636
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,310
Yes.


637
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,360
Then that'll be...


638
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,770
two.


639
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,110
Drink No.2:


640
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,650
Silence is Gold.


641
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,100
Anyway, you don't think I'm sincere even if I tell you,


642
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,450
I'm not gonna tell then.


643
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,510
Who asked you to order a drink?


644
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,730
When did I order one?


645
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,520
I was looking at the clock for England.


646
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,670
It is going backward.


647
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,820
Isn't the word backward (dao) a homophone for stolen?


648
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,780
So I said one.


649
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,700
And then?


650
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,880
And then I gave the wrong answer and got punished with a drink.


651
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,350
Where's the drink?


652
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,250
You've drunk it.


653
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,970
The one named Hypocrisy.


654
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,740
Am I a hypocrite?


655
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,890
Look at the clock for Central Plain.


656
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:51,810
It's stopped.


657
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,410
Time is going by but the clock has stopped.


658
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,890
That's an hour earned.


659
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,100
Doesn't one and one equal two?


660
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,110
That makes sense.


661
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,710
But you still got punished with another drink.


662
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,380
Silence is Gold.


663
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,620
It seems


664
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,650
I won't be able to guess the answer


665
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,930
until I finish all the drinks.


666
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,550
Look at the time for America.


667
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,240
The hour hand and the minute hand are reversed.


668
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,160
None of the three clocks is normal.


669
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,600
So


670
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,160
the answer should be based on an overall consideration of all three clocks.


671
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,190
One,


672
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,300
two.


673
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,970
Three.


674
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,580
Drink No.3:


675
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,630
Crazy Margarita.


676
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,210
I have a solution.


677
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,370
I've looked at that cocktail list just now.


678
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,390
It only has 40 or 50 cocktails on it.


679
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,540
We'll just drink all of them


680
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,570
and the correct answer will be one of them.


681
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,740
You certainly can't finish them all by yourself.


682
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,830
I can't drink.


683
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,660
You happen to come to help.


684
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,690
Don't make me drink.


685
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,120
Alcohol


686
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
is a man's best friend forever.


687
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,840
Four.


688
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,950
OK.


689
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,750
Drink No.4:


690
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,970
Passionate Whip.


691
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,730
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.


692
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,560
How many kinds of drinks do you have?


693
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,250
Serve them.


694
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,980
700.


695
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,920
Drink No. 700:


696
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,440
Domineering Song Under the Heaven.


697
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,190
I...


698
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,540
No.17.


699
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,480
The Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transport is at No.17 of Jinshui Road.


700
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,110
23.


701
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,440
When I was studying in Deutsche,


702
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,940
I chose seat No.23 every time.


703
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,220
May 23,


704
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,030
the day my mother died.


705
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,830
Well,


706
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,750
here's to Mrs. Xiao.


707
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,250
21.


708
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,870
Article published on the 21st issue of Tientsin Daily.


709
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,730
By trainee reporter Xiao Lanlan.


710
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,200
The first published article


711
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,210
in my life.


712
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,490
Drink No.21:


713
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,960
Fresh Off the Boat.


714
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,690
67.


715
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,550
June 7,


716
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,050
the day we first met.


717
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,690
16.


718
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,610
On the sixth day of the first lunar month,


719
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,550
a new ship of the Grain Transport Chamber of Commerce left port.


720
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:14,790
I was there too.


721
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,900
We met on that day.


722
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,760
Just that you can't remember.


723
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,590
Drink No.16:


724
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Suddenly Like a Dream.


725
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,390
I also hate


726
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,480
what I'm like now.


727
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,070
Make trouble out of nothing,


728
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,780
endlessly.


729
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,820
Everything will be fine


730
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,310
as long as you believe me.


731
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,230
I've got the number.


732
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,750
12.


733
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,210
Drink No.12:


734
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,300
By a Narrow Margin.


735
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,210
Please.


736
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,270
Don't be afraid.


737
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,660
I'm here with you.


738
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,430
I am here with you.


739
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,400
No wonder


740
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,100
you are really a thickhead.


741
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,410
You haven't figured it out after such a long time.


742
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,420
As I told you,


743
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,140
the answer


744
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,130
is not set.


745
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,990
I can see you can hardly keep your eyes focused.


746
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,330
Well,


747
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,390
time is changing,


748
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,570
and the answer is changing too.


749
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,240
Now it's 8pm.


750
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,780
The Central Plain time zone stops at 7pm.


751
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,440
That's one hour stolen.


752
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,170
Time is going backwards for England,


753
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,060
that's one hour earned.


754
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,500
The hour hand and minute hand are reversed for America.


755
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,780
When they complete a circle,


756
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,050
namely 12 hours,


757
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,780
but actually that's just one hour.


758
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,450
Converted into a math formula, it is


759
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,810
one minus one plus twelve minus one


760
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,180
equals eleven.


761
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,380
Give me Drink No.11.


762
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,590
It's not enough to follow the path,


763
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,210
you must also have the brain in order to join the game.


764
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,240
Pay attention to how you look.


765
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,990
The show is not over yet.


766
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,340
So many people are watching you.


767
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,450
Hasn't the academy president left already?


768
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,600
What's the point of pretending?


769
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,180
I tell you what,


770
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,930
if Madam Zhou really agree to enroll you,


771
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:20,950
you can't live at your home anymore.


772
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,360
Have you decided what to tell your mother?


773
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,650
Are you kidding me?


774
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,190
As a sorceress, I live neither in the north nor south...


775
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,860
Lanlan.


776
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,790
Lanlan.


777
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,680
Are you all right, Lanlan?


778
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,010
Lanlan, why did you drink so much?


779
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,570
Because of the bastard Ding Mao.


780
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,510
You are a toad and bastard instead!


781
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,560
You even said Ding Mao is a bastard.


782
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,950
Come on, place her on my back.


783
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,190
Hold back your bad shit.


784
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,430
Come on, come on, come on.


785
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
You ba...


786
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:08,950
bastard!


787
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,580
You didn't do what I say!


788
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,130
What are you doing?


789
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,970
What do you want?


790
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:21,420
Why do you tie me up while it's Secretary General Ding who wants to join the game?


791
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,160
Ding Mao, isn't it said officials must follow the path?


792
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:27,690
Teach them about the path.


793
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,530
Didn't they say you must have the brain?


794
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:32,940
Use your brain.


795
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,820
I'm talking to you!


796
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,720
Do you hear me?


797
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,300
What on earth do you want?


798
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,480
It has nothing to do with him. Let him go.


799
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,140
It has nothing to do with me!


800
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,660
The number of chairs


801
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,450
is the number of guests I invite.


802
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,310
Today


803
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,740
I've only prepared one chair,


804
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,980
but two guests came.


805
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,610
Whoever comes is a guest.


806
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,780
Let's play together.


807
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,570
Well, don't you know how to count?


808
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,920
Aren't there two chairs here?


809
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,910
That one


810
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,280
is not for a living person.


811
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,650
I told you it has nothing to do with him.


812
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,930
1, 2, 3, 4,


813
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,560
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12.


814
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,540
If the watch hand ticks ten times


815
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:23,820
and you still can't answer it,


816
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,230
I'll fire the gun.


817
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,660
Ten and eleven are missing,


818
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,490
not a chicken or dog is left.


819
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,150
Well, what game are you playing again?


820
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,010
This is not a temple fair for the Lantern Festival.


821
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,350
Why did you give me a riddle?


822
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,760
You haven't had enough fun, have you?


823
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,910
OK.


824
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,210
Again?


825
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,690
Why do you talk so much nonsense?


826
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,630
A stinky monster.


827
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,550
Stinky...stinky...


828
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,690
stinky...stinky tofu!


829
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,610
No, well, potherb mustard!


830
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,330
My master's socks!


831
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,340
The riddle refers to a person.


832
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,170
A person?


833
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:02,900
Who's stinky?


834
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,720
Who's stinky?


835
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:04,930
Sorceress Zhang!


836
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,980
Your...


837
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,770
your uncle, your mother's brother, your whole family!


838
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,650
Karl Benz!


839
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,180
Karl Benz,


840
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,080
a Deutsche man,


841
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,370
inventor of gasoline internal combustion engine,


842
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,590
It was dubbed "a stinky monster"


843
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,510
when it was firstly invented.


844
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,720
Since you know internal combustion engine,


845
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,830
you must know gasoline as well.


846
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,880
No, it's the correct answer...


847
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,710
No, no!


848
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,910
Someone says


849
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,570
in the 100 years to come,


850
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,280
petroleum will decide who's the winner.


851
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,380
It's up to you to decide


852
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,110
who's the winner today.


853
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,860
Only one is left,


854
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,420
or not a chicken or dog is left?
