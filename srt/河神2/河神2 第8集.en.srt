00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,100
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2.]


3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,500
Let's come back to our story and continue.


4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,580
Previously, we talked about


5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,380
Gu Weiliang's case weighed heavily on Guo Deyou's mind


6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,900
and he sounded out Gu Ying repeatedly


7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,460
without having the heart to tell her his speculation.


8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,460
Little River God sneaked into the police station


9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,940
to interrogate Wang Meiren.


10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,500
A member of the corpse-salvage team pretended to be ghost and suddenly became blind


11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,100
due to inadequate protection.


12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,620
Ding Mao fell out with Guo Deyou


13
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,900
when he came to make an apology


14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,980
and the two of them made up in the end


15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,860
and investigated clues of the case together.


16
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,260
After discerning grievance by burning incense,


17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,700
Guo Deyou found Gu Weiliang's case


18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,820
was full of questionable points


19
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,460
but looked more like an accident.


20
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,380
Ding Mao reported Gu's case


21
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,140
to the governor


22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,140
which ended up being closed as an accident.


23
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,220
Wang Meiren revealed the mystery of Gu Ying's birth background.


24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,900
Guo Deyou took Gu Ying to the Gu's residence again


25
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,060
and the two of them tore up


26
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
the Fiery Bull Scroll in a fit of pique,


27
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,460
which led to


28
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,380
Miss Xiao's first encounter with Bai Sihu,


29
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,340
Guo Deyou's second entry into the Thousand Treasure House,


30
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,260
a lunatic woman's death after jumping off a building


31
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,580
and Little River God's move of burning incense again to discern grievance


32
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,180
mired in a labyrinth of riddles.


33
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,140
The principal master of Yishengmen Gang died


34
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,420
from something related to the bronze bull,


35
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,260
and a big-name diplomat died


36
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,580
from something related to the fiery bull.


37
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,060
Who knows


38
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,740
which big name's turn it will be?


39
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,060
Every one of them is so stuck-up


40
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,340
that they deserve the retribution!


41
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,140
Wouldn't we have to suffer


42
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,860
if the governor of the Nine Oxen Town bites the dust?


43
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,620
Indeed.


44
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,140
Lord of Heaven, bless us. Lord of Heaven, bless us.


45
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,620
Jianghu.


46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,300
Science.


47
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,140
Kung fu.


48
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,820
Truth.


49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,740
Nine statues of ox.


50
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,300
Two statues of tiger.


51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,180
One statue of rooster.


52
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,780
Lanlan.


53
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,340
Brother Niu.


54
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,180
What's up, Mr. Guo?


55
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,980
Secretary General Ding.


56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,660
Senior fellow apprentice.


57
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,300
As to the marriage…


58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,020
Guo Deyou.


59
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,860
Interviews.


60
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,340
It's killing me!


61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,860
The 12 gateways to suppress mountains.


62
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,260
Curve cut-off.


63
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,060
Therapy.


64
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,740
Lanlan.


65
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,820
I'm sorry.


66
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,260
You didn't save me.


67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,579
There must be no adulteration.


68
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,100
Hex.


69
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,060
River God.


70
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,820
Tientsin Mystic 2


71
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,740
Episode 8


72
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,140
Miss Xiao,


73
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm not paying you compliments.


74
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,860
Nowadays


75
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,860
no other newspapers could be like yours.


76
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,500
All they are after


77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,020
is money.


78
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,100
Even a matchbox-sized article


79
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,740
costs a lot of silver dollars.


80
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,700
The essence of journalism is to spread valid information.


81
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,260
The validity of information


82
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,420
cannot be measured by money.


83
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,020
You see, you see,


84
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,660
this is the difference between your states of mind.


85
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,300
Only you are


86
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,540
willing to place a notice


87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,860
on your newspaper for free to look for


88
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,340
that lunatic girl's family for her.


89
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,020
If she really finds a family member,


90
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,820
that'll be as good a blessing as building a bridge


91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,980
or repairing a road.


92
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,860
I'm flattered.


93
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,140
But…but…


94
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,540
isn't your newspaper's circulation


95
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,220
a little bit small?


96
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,460
Come in please.


97
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,340
Miss Xiao, look.


98
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,580
This is the girl.


99
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,300
Here, Miss,


100
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,500
let me help you get dressed into this.


101
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,820
What's going on?


102
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,220
Come back!


103
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,659
Come back!


104
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,340
Get…get out of the way!


105
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,100
Get out of the way!


106
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,860
What's there to look?


107
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,740
Incompatible as fire and water are,


108
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,500
they are both amorphous.


109
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,820
The amorphous are the most difficult to paint from time immemorial.


110
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,300
Look at this flame.


111
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,780
It looks amorphous,


112
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,820
yet it actually has a bone.


113
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,140
It is both vigorous and smooth,


114
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,420
both hard and soft.


115
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,540
It's Wu Shuosheng's authentic work.


116
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,780
Known as Immortal of Fiery Bulls,


117
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,740
He specialized in painting fiery bulls.


118
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,020
Well,


119
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,980
which dynasty did he lived in as a great painting master?


120
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,300
In terms of date of birth,


121
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,780
it's supposed to be Emperor Guangxu's reign.


122
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,260
In terms of the date of painting,


123
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,940
it is now.


124
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,340
I got it right.


125
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,540
This painting doesn't look so old.


126
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,580
All right.


127
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
I'll go and meet this painting master.


128
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,460
He's dead.


129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,659
Dead?


130
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,820
Four years ago, a big fire


131
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,659
burned his painting studio and him


132
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,900
into ashes.


133
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,060
This is


134
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,020
his last painting.


135
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,220
Immortal of Fiery Bulls…


136
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,740
Incompatible as fire and water are,


137
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,100
they are both amorphous.


138
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,940
Are you gonna sell it?


139
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,140
Maomao, he's not gonna sell it.


140
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,940
What shall I do?


141
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,900
Bastard Guo Deyou


142
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,659
dares to threaten me with marriage!


143
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,540
A toad and a mole cricket!


144
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,620
Who wants to marry him?


145
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,300
Whoever brings up the marriage again later


146
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,500
is a bastard!


147
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,260
…Is a bastard!


148
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,460
Lanlan.


149
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,500
Look at the flames on this painting.


150
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,380
Do they look like


151
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,700
the ones in your photo?


152
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,140
Where did you get it from?


153
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,299
From Wang Meiren.


154
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,539
Why is it in half?


155
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,179
That's why I said Guo Deyou is a bastard!


156
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,380
All right, all right.


157
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,740
You went to see Wang Meiren?


158
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,940
Didn't you two get into a fight?


159
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,380
Better make friends than make enemies.


160
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,100
Isn't she pitiable as well?


161
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,100
She also said she's gonna find out my birth background for me.


162
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,900
What birth background?


163
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,900
Gu Weiliang…


164
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,980
maybe my biological father.


165
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,580
I knew I was adopted ever since I was a child.


166
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,500
Although I didn't suffer


167
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,580
or endure any hardships,


168
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
who wouldn't want to know


169
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,860
who their biological parents are?


170
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,380
So I must


171
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,180
risk any danger


172
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,940
to look into this case.


173
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,380
Even Guo Deyou can't stop me.


174
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,100
That bastard.


175
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,420
I'll do that with you.


176
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,700
But with such a mess of clues,


177
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,260
where should we start?


178
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,580
This girl,


179
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,660
Gu Weiliang


180
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,140
and the Fiery Bull Scroll


181
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,740
must be somewhat related.


182
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Is there even a charm I've never seen?


183
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,220
This is the molecular structural formula of amino acid


184
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,900
discovered by a French chemist in 1806.


185
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,780
I detected a toxin from the pigments


186
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,660
of the Fiery Bull Scroll you gave me.


187
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,140
Unlike inorganic toxin,


188
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,500
this toxin is mainly made up of


189
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,460
amino acid.


190
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,060
That's to say


191
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,900
this is a biotoxin.


192
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,860
What kind of biotoxin?


193
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,300
I have no idea about that.


194
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,660
But such kind of toxin


195
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,220
can repress the activity of


196
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,380
sympathetic nerves.


197
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,860
Namely, a person wouldn't


198
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,140
react strongly after taking in the toxin,


199
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,900
but their stress function would fail


200
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,900
when they suffer a trauma.


201
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,540
What are you talking about?


202
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,060
That's to say


203
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,980
they wouldn't run away when they are in danger


204
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,940
or move when they are in pain.


205
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,580
That diplomat


206
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,420
was burned so badly on the day of the wedding,


207
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,300
but he didn't move.


208
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,620
It's very likely


209
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,300
he had taken in such toxin.


210
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,940
Would such a toxin


211
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,660
poison people if


212
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,020
it's mixed with tattoo pigment?


213
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,860
Theoretically speaking,


214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,780
most biotoxins


215
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,300
can be absorbed into human body through skin.


216
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,020
That girl could even get up


217
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,660
after jumping off a building


218
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,220
as if she didn't feel any pain.


219
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,100
We'll be able to know


220
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
whether that girl has toxin in her body


221
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,700
soon after the forensic doctor's autopsy.


222
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,300
Forensic doctor?


223
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,700
Isn't that what Ding Mao does?


224
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Can I take this?


225
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,100
Yes.


226
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,220
But you must be careful not to touch the thing inside…


227
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,460
What are you gonna do?


228
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,060
To reveal the truth.


229
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,740
I'm gonna reveal the truth.


230
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,820
I'm busy.


231
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,500
Don't forget to give back the vial to me.


232
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,940
Doctor Rong, it's such a late hour,


233
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,340
Secretary General Ding hasn't arrived yet.


234
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,740
Shall I


235
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,300
arrange patients with later appointments for you?


236
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,780
He'll come


237
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,860
when he should.


238
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,940
Why do you want to meet here?


239
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,500
I suddenly have an appetite for something cold and raw.


240
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,020
Why?


241
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,540
Are you afraid of running into your acquaintances?


242
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,660
How can I have acquaintances here?


243
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,060
Didn't you say


244
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,780
we'd only meet in the photo studio?


245
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,660
Our relationship won't be open and aboveboard


246
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,020
if we stay in the darkroom for long.


247
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,100
Someone replaced the painting


248
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,220
Commander Wu gave Gu Weiliang as a gift.


249
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
This is the toxin extracted from


250
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,140
the pigments of that painting.


251
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,940
Hasn't the case been closed?


252
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,900
Why are you still looking into it?


253
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,380
Brother Junyao said


254
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,500
this toxin


255
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,220
can destroy people's sympathetic nerves


256
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,380
and block pain


257
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,900
to make them lose stress reaction,


258
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,340
and Gu Weiliang


259
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,660
had no reaction at all on the day of the fire.


260
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,180
Junyao, Junyao,


261
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,500
it's him again.


262
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,420
You knew fully well something is not right


263
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,700
but did nothing.


264
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,660
Did you learn to play dumb


265
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,860
once you become Secretary General Ding?


266
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,740
Lanlan,


267
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,780
I'll hand in a resignation letter


268
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,540
as soon as the curve-off project is over.


269
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,340
I don't want to be a secretary general even for a minute.


270
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,740
You said our relationship is not open and aboveboard,


271
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,660
I also feel very guilty about that.


272
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,380
I also don't want our


273
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,460
secret relationship


274
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,420
to affect you


275
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,380
and make you upset.


276
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,940
By not open and aboveboard,


277
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,100
I mean we are not sincere enough to each other.


278
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,460
What do you mean?


279
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,300
Is there anything


280
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,100
you are holding out on me?


281
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,740
No.


282
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,540
Have you been here before?


283
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,020
Yes.


284
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,300
With whom?


285
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,180
Rong Aoshuang.


286
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,460
OK.


287
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,060
It doesn't matter


288
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,580
whom you met


289
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,500
or where you went.


290
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,020
What concerns me is,


291
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,100
why did you tell a lie


292
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,660
that you didn't have to tell?


293
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,100
Where are you going?


294
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,180
To the office.


295
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,100
Is this your office?


296
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,820
I came here to look into the case.


297
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,780
This is my job.


298
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,340
OK.


299
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,860
Well,


300
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,900
I have no say over your job.


301
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,100
Whether I look into the case


302
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,100
has nothing to do with you either.


303
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,300
You'll be in danger if you keep digging.


304
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,100
Gu Weiliang may be Gu Ying's biological father.


305
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,380
Gu Ying?


306
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,740
Even if there is a danger,


307
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,980
I won't let her face it alone.


308
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,700
I'm sorry.


309
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,740
It suddenly occurs to me


310
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,220
I've got something to see to.


311
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,620
I'm going to the newspaper office,


312
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,900
back to my office.


313
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,820
This is the founder of the academy.


314
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,940
Mr. Doubai.


315
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,140
Was this photo taken when the academy was just founded?


316
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,900
17 years ago.


317
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,859
Enlightenment Academy is a pioneer


318
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,020
in providing


319
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,619
Western-style education


320
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,980
to women


321
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,140
in Tientsin and even across North China.


322
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,579
Mr. Doubai's


323
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,700
contributions to Chinese women's modern enlightenment


324
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,780
cannot go unnoticed.


325
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,060
As a woman,


326
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,339
I admire


327
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,220
and appreciate him.


328
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,260
Is this your original intention of doing this exclusive interview?


329
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,300
Exactly.


330
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,780
By covering this story


331
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,820
I want more women to know


332
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,500
they can equip themselves with knowledge


333
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,900
to break through gender inequalities,


334
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,220
break free from the restraints


335
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,540
and embrace an even broader world.


336
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,300
Mr. Doubai would certainly


337
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,820
take your interview himself were he still alive.


338
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,020
Is the academy


339
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,940
still being run by the Doubai Foundation?


340
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,780
According to Mr. Doubai's last wish,


341
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,380
the foundation is still giving funds.


342
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
And President Zhou Moqing


343
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,900
is in charge of specific matters.


344
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,580
Women wearing men's pointed-collar shirt


345
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,740
is a precedent created by the Enlightenment Academy.


346
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,260
It caused quite a lot of controversy


347
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,860
when it was firstly implemented.


348
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,380
It seems you've done quite a lot of homework, Miss Xiao.


349
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,700
I'm flattered.


350
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,020
But a single stone cannot shake a river.


351
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,540
Up to this day,


352
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,540
the Enlightenment Academy is the only school


353
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,700
that promotes such a dressing style.


354
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,660
Continuous ripples


355
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,980
are bound to have echoes.


356
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,860
By the way, Mr. Bai.


357
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,980
I'd also like to


358
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,060
have a look at


359
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,620
the photos of previous years' students


360
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,100
to gather more materials


361
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,180
for my news story this time.


362
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,300
You've come at a bad time.


363
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,780
Some days ago,


364
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,140
the academy history museum had a renovation,


365
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,180
the student photo wall was not protected well


366
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,940
and a large part of it got stained.


367
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,660
The remaining photos


368
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,860
haven't been sorted out yet.


369
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,140
Shall I


370
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,580
invite you back when I'm done with the reorganization


371
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,980
and renovation?


372
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,700
I'm really sorry.


373
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,780
A new house has no spiders,


374
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,460
how can it have old cobwebs over the mortar and plaster?


375
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,540
There must be something fishy.


376
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,660
To say nothing of probing deeper,


377
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,940
it's hard


378
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,660
to even enter the academy again


379
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,300
as a reporter.


380
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,340
Are you gonna leave it at that?


381
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,900
It's me to blame.


382
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,140
I shouldn't have used news report as an excuse in the first place.


383
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,060
I'd probably have a chance


384
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,340
if I pretended to be a female student.


385
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,660
A female student?


386
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,540
Do you think I can pass off as one?


387
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,780
What are you laughing at?


388
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,220
This is no joking matter.


389
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,260
Do you think I'm joking?


390
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,300
Anyway, you


391
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,300
definitely can't go.


392
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,860
Xiao Lanlan.


393
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,820
Am I just a


394
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,500
sorceress who


395
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,660
neither reads nor studies


396
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,820
and knows nothing but practicing witchcraft in your eyes?


397
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,540
Do you look down on me


398
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,580
from the bottom of your heart?


399
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,100
I've told you why


400
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,980
I must look into this case.


401
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,500
So no matter what danger I'll face,


402
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,900
as long as there is the slightest clue…


403
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,140
Then you must do what I say.


404
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,260
Do everything I say


405
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
if you want to enter the academy.


406
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,340
Miss Xiao, I'm at your disposal.


407
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,980
Why is Mr. Guo giving us a treat


408
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,020
for no reason at all?


409
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,220
Mr. Guo and Secretary General Ding have just solved a big case,


410
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,060
he must have got a huge bonus.


411
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,380
No.


412
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,180
Just think about it,


413
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,660
is Guo Deyou someone who tends to give a treat


414
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,660
as you know him?


415
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,820
Indeed.


416
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,700
He counts it as losing money


417
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,580
if he doesn't pick up money when he's outside;


418
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,020
he counts it as a loss if he doesn't bum a meal off us


419
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,180
for three days.


420
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,660
Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo.


421
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,580
Mr. Guo.


422
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,020
You…


423
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,180
you've come.


424
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,100
Please take a seat inside.


425
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,540
Why are you guys here?


426
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,500
Didn't you ask someone to pass the word


427
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,780
that you are gonna give us a treat?


428
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,580
Me?


429
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,060
What did I say?


430
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,180
He cheated us again with yet another trick.


431
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,900
Only you believe him.


432
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,260
He asks us to come here to shoot the breeze with him


433
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,540
instead of guarding the river.


434
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,820
Damn it!


435
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,100
Why did he leave?


436
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,580
Mr. Guo.


437
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,420
For the sake of the smooth progression of the Phase 2 curve cut-off project,


438
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,900
I was forced to take such an unwise decision


439
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,020
to gather the river-guarding brothers here.


440
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,860
Hope you'll excuse me.


441
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,620
All the brothers are here.


442
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,900
Hold your horses, guys.


443
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,460
After the demolition blast,


444
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,460
our master


445
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,580
will come over at the earliest time possible


446
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,340
to give you guys an explanation.


447
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,580
Before that,


448
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,420
feel free to eat your fill and drink your fill.


449
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,780
Make sure you don't save money for me.


450
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,260
But you must do one thing:


451
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,020
Don't go out of this door.


452
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,820
Don't make things hard for me.


453
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,100
Yusi,


454
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,180
we've got even with you for what happened in the river last time.


455
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,660
Now isn't it shifty of you to lure us


456
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,820
away from our base this time?


457
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,140
We take you as a human being,


458
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,620
but do you trick us as if we were monkeys?


459
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,780
I'm gonna tear down your Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce


460
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,540
if the Dragon King Temple is inundated!


461
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,180
Mr. Guo!


462
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,700
Bro!


463
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,940
Don't, bro!


464
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,900
Bro, pack it in, pack it in.


465
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,180
Pack it in, pack it in.


466
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,700
Pack it in.


467
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,140
Pack it in, all right?


468
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,140
Mr. Guo!


469
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,940
Mr. Guo! Mr. Guo!


470
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Mr. Guo! Bro!


471
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,380
Mr. Guo!


472
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,100
I'm not running away,


473
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,220
OK?


474
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,020
Let's take a break.


475
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,140
Have a drink.


476
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,860
Act first and report afterwards.


477
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,180
If the temple is blasted for real


478
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,140
and the flood washes the Dragon King Temple away,


479
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,580
there's nothing I can do at all.


480
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,140
Secretary General Ding,


481
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,780
you are quite something!


482
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,220
Have you been addicted to putting on a show of


483
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,980
punishing your own people in the name of justice


484
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,180
ever since you became the secretary general?


485
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,300
Xiao Lanlan's father put on a false show,


486
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,460
now you've started


487
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,620
to play hardball against me!


488
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,340
Why?


489
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,740
I am the one who should be angry.


490
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,940
Why are you sulky?


491
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,180
If the project doesn't start as soon as possible,


492
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,540
the water level will drop


493
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,300
and the pollutants will flow back again.


494
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,500
The Phase 1 project which took so much effort to complete


495
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,060
will go to waste too.


496
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,820
By then,


497
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,820
the curve cut-off project will fail


498
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,300
and the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce will go belly-up too.


499
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,580
Why did you stop the blast then?


500
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,740
By calling off the curve cut-off project,


501
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,980
Ding Mao kind of got stuck.


502
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,060
This is such a clever move


503
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,500
of yours!


504
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,740
It's alive again!


505
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,540
I go up the heaven to pluck the full moon


506
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,380
and hold the goddess in the moon in my arms.


507
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,460
Roads and bridges are not for one man to walk on only;


508
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,980
Once one road is unimpeded, every road will be unimpeded!


509
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,220
You two take the most delight


510
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,780
out of this move today.


511
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
I heard that


512
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,020
quadrangle halma is a British thing


513
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,940
and hexagon checkers is a German trick.


514
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,060
You are learned.


515
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,660
German things


516
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,700
are all somewhat interesting.


517
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,100
Indeed.


518
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Although it's a child's game,


519
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,380
one's calculations are all on the board


520
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,980
with no offenses and defenses missing.


521
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,180
Such a small chessboard


522
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,340
can also make waves.


523
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
I'm not gonna


524
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,260
beat about the bush,


525
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,740
I'll get straight to the point.


526
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,660
Crazy Cui


527
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,420
died because of the curve cut-off project.


528
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,980
Gu Weiliang


529
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,460
was also received by him.


530
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,500
Why are both deaths


531
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,300
related to Ding…Ding…


532
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,260
Ding…


533
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Ding Mao.


534
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,700
…related to Ding Mao?


535
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,340
Don't you think it's strange and weird?


536
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,620
It doesn't matter if it's only weird.


537
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,980
What's strange about it is he can


538
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,380
crack the cases with uncanny calculations on both occasions.


539
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,420
He also makes himself


540
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,260
innocent on both occasions.


541
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,380
No matter how interesting


542
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,980
the German trick is,


543
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,780
it is only a game


544
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,220
for pastime.


545
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,260
With multiple fractures


546
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,140
and visceral ruptures,


547
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,700
even if she didn't die on the spot,


548
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,860
the pain would certainly cause a shock,


549
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,980
and she couldn't possibly get up


550
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,900
before walking a few steps and falling over again.


551
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,860
Crazy Cui's body broke into two pieces,


552
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,060
Gu Weiliang was burnt to death.


553
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,060
They both showed signs of not being afraid of pain.


554
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,140
Are the three cases related?


555
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,540
What's wrong?


556
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,540
She's still alive.


557
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,060
Her body is already stiff.


558
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,860
Are you crazy?


559
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,740
She may be in a deep coma or suspended animation


560
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,620
due to excessive loss of blood!


561
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,340
Such cases happened before.


562
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,940
The bodies woke up during autopsy.


563
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,900
She's already dead!


564
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,420
The dead deserves the utmost dignity.


565
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,300
All right.


566
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
You are worn out these days.


567
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,940
Let's go.


568
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,380
She was still alive.


569
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,820
I should have examined the body first.


570
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,180
I killed her.


571
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,060
I am here.


572
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,220
What makes you worried


573
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,740
that you came again in the middle of the night?


574
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,980
It's OK you are fine.


575
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,620
He's suffering from strong mood swings.


576
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
They've invited Dr. Rong here.


577
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,420
She's giving him physiotherapy.


578
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,660
OK, I'll go and have a look.


579
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,380
OK.


580
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,180
What smell is this?


581
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,460
Don't let me figure out what trick you are up to!


582
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,300
What happened?


583
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,740
Why is he in a stupor?


584
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,900
Deyou.


585
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,300
Deyou, wake up!


586
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,940
Deyou!


587
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,140
Why am I here?


588
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,060
Are you OK?


589
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,940
Did you get injured?


590
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,460
I remember…


591
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,540
I remember I went to see you…


592
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,740
Have you removed the bombs?


593
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,780
The bombs?


594
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,780
Did you really remove it?


595
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,900
I don't understand a thing you guys are saying.


596
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,100
Why was there a blast then?


597
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,940
My legs got stuck like hell.


598
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,860
I was almost drowned


599
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,180
if you didn't save me.


600
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,500
I got injured and was in a coma due to loss of blood,


601
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,580
I lost my eyesight as well.


602
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,580
You didn't save me.


603
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,660
I was almost drowned.


604
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,740
Why didn't you save me?


605
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,500
I did.


606
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,100
I went to save you.


607
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,220
That's why you left me behind.


608
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,940
I didn't!


609
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
The stone was so heavy


610
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,740
that I couldn't move it.


611
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,980
The currents were rapid underneath,


612
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,980
and that hole was inclined,


613
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,260
water would flow through it quickly.


614
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,420
You wouldn't be drowned.


615
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,260
You didn't save me.


616
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,500
People of the corpse-salvage team saved me!


617
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
I went, I went.


618
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,820
I searched through the whole river.


619
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,900
They said I'm a river monster.


620
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,060
I couldn't do anything, I…


621
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,660
They said I'm a river monster.


622
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,060
Do you know I'm paralyzed in my legs?


623
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,900
Just because of you.


624
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
I tried my best, I tried my best!


625
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,180
I can't walk anymore.


626
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,620
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


627
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,700
I'd certainly be drowned if you didn't save me.


628
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,740
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


629
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,460
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


630
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,940
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


631
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,340
I'd certainly be drowned if you didn't save me.


632
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,180
I'd certainly be drowned if you didn't save me.


633
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,660
You didn't save me. I was almost drowned.


634
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,500
I'd certainly be drowned if you didn't save me.
