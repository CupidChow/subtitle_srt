00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,420
Let's come back to our story and continue.


3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,300
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,460
Previously, we talked about


5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,260
Ding Mao met Rong Aoshuang in secret


6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,180
and fell into the illusion caused by Silver Bell Seal.


7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,310
Guo Deyou helped Fan Junyao deal with local ruffians


8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,830
and accidentally heard that Wang Meiren has confessed.


9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,880
Captain Fu took Gu Deyou and Gu Ying


10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,120
to Gu's temporary house to look for clues.


11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,100
Captain Zheng came to stop them.


12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,470
Guo Deyou took away the evidence in chaos.


13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,200
To continue to explore the river channel,


14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,310
Ding Mao asked Fan Junyao for help.


15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,060
Sorceress Zhang made preparations for the clay figurine's wedding.


16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,430
The people of the corpse-salvage team gathered together.


17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,120
Guo Deyou was in low spirits


18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,720
because of the mystery of Gu Ying's origin.


19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,960
The next stage of curve cut-off


20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,940
will flood the Dragon King Temple.


21
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,630
Ding Mao failed to reach consensus with Guo Deyou and his master


22
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,090
and left angrily.


23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,260
The corpse-salvage team, after hearing the news, pretended to be ghosts


24
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,930
and frightened the exploration team away.


25
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,210
And then


26
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,760
the corpse-salvage team is attacked and President Ding gives a gift.


27
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,420
Little River God discerns injustice again.


28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,519
Wang Meiren talks about the past.


29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,780
Jianghu.


30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,380
Science.


31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,180
Kung fu.


32
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,940
Truth.


33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,620
Nine statues of ox.


34
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,300
Two statues of tiger.


35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,180
One statue of rooster.


36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,580
Stubborn temper.


37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,420
Young Master.


38
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,460
Parents in Tientsin.


39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,140
Daughter.


40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,980
It's good that you are fine.


41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,860
The flood dashed against the Dragon King Temple.


42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,060
Allergy.


43
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,180
Born in the purple.


44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,780
Independence.


45
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,380
Guo Deyou.


46
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,900
Governor changes, but I'm still here.


47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,780
It has been over twenty years.


48
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
A wicked person with a hypocritical smile.


49
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,740
I'm willing to help you.


50
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,140
Bark of cork tree.


51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,060
Getting married.


52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,740
Fiery Bull.


53
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,860
River God.


54
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,980
Tientsin Mystic 2


55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,100
Episode 7


56
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,240
Let's make it clear first.


57
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,800
Your treat?


58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,780
Here?


59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,829
You despise this place?


60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,680
What made you


61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
suddenly change?


62
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,190
You are always stingy.


63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,980
But today you want to treat me here?


64
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,990
I won't eat.


65
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,780
You must have set a trap for me to fall into.


66
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,570
Look at you.


67
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,680
If you believe destiny, you won't live a good life.


68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,640
Since you don't eat,


69
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,730
I'll eat.


70
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,820
I feel


71
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,940
when it comes to marriage,


72
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,780
if a man is always passive,


73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,980
and the bride's side urges again and again,


74
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,580
it is


75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,780
outrageous.


76
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,470
Abracadabra.


77
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,240
Abracadabra.


78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,100
Evil spirit, come out.


79
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,700
You are not Guo Deyou.


80
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,350
Spit out Guo Deyou.


81
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,310
Otherwise I will let my mother take you.


82
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,150
Ying,


83
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,950
sorry for making you feel aggrieved.


84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,000
Waiter,


85
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,980
I want wine.


86
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,159
Today, I want to


87
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,320
drink some wine.


88
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,010
A phoenix coronet and official robes,


89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,870
heaven, earth, and parents on both sides


90
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,150
must be ready


91
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,980
to give witness to the wedding.


92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,480
It's easy to get a phoenix coronet.


93
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,720
Heaven and earth are always there.


94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,950
As for parents...


95
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,110
I have my mother,


96
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,280
and you have Mr. Guo Chun.


97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,520
So we have parents.


98
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,420
Right.


99
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,400
They are our parents.


100
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,830
He is closer to you than your biological father.


101
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,560
She is closer to me than my biological mother.


102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,830
I haven't seen my biological parents.


103
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,090
Then...


104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,650
Do you want to see them?


105
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,870
Of course I do.


106
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,170
Even in my dreams.


107
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,030
I wonder


108
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,140
what they look like,


109
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,700
what they do,


110
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,700
and how they act as parents.


111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,050
Deyou.


112
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,830
Can I ask you a question?


113
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,490
Go ahead.


114
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,050
When I ask you,


115
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,000
you have to answer.


116
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,240
You'd better not ask.


117
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,610
What's your question?


118
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,570
Think about it.


119
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,640
Otherwise I won't ask.


120
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,650
OK.


121
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,330
Just ask.


122
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,409
Can I have another portion of tofu pudding


123
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,560
to help my stomach digest food?


124
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,490
OK.


125
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,770
I want a portion too.


126
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,190
No!


127
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:09,900
We can order only one portion.


128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,770
I'll eat it.


129
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,880
Why? It's on me.


130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,400
The tofu pudding in this restaurant has daylily.


131
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,740
Did you forget that?


132
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,200
When we were young, we went to catch the grasshoppers in the daylily field.


133
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,990
After we came out,


134
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,490
pimples appeared


135
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,960
on your skin.


136
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,040
They scared me.


137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
Mr. Guo Chun said


138
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,840
daylily is an allergen to you.


139
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,420
You are not in good health.


140
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,280
Let me list


141
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,710
what you can't eat or drink.


142
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,180
Wine.


143
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Stone crab.


144
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,580
Dried sea shrimps.


145
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,420
Allergen?


146
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,180
Chinese toon.


147
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,940
Isn't that


148
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,860
what Ding Mao


149
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,450
talked about?


150
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,530
If you really want to marry her,


151
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,410
isn't it good to live a simple life


152
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,460
without sickness, disaster,


153
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,800
hardships, or suffering?


154
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,900
The man has been dead.


155
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,760
Don't make yourself gloomy.


156
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,410
If  he was her biological father,


157
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,010
will you tell her or not?


158
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,130
Give it to me.


159
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,840
Who wants this hot potato?


160
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,210
You have money to treat her to a meal,


161
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,350
but no money


162
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,080
for the clay figurine's wedding?


163
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,590
Why did I forget that?


164
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,130
You brat!


165
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,340
As soon as I talk about money, you run.


166
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,240
As soon as I talk about money, you run.


167
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,580
Come back.


168
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,800
Fu Laiyong let me


169
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,560
at the risk of losing his job.


170
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,970
Let's ignore conventional greetings


171
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,740
and make it short.


172
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,260
Apart from you, who else is familiar with


173
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,370
Mr. Gu's living habits?


174
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,100
His servants.


175
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,170
But we all listened to him


176
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,160
on everyday food and clothing.


177
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,140
We were very careful.


178
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,950
Did you change the cloth as he asked too?


179
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,100
Yes.


180
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,170
Fenglingxiang, a time-honored brand.


181
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,280
What is Mr. Gu allergic to?


182
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,460
Mostly plants


183
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,770
with fluff,


184
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,570
and pollen produced by colorful flowers and the like.


185
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,490
Fluff?


186
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,300
Green foxtail?


187
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,870
Something like that.


188
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,280
Something like that?


189
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,350
You haven't figured out such a crucial thing,


190
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,320
but you want to plead guilty?


191
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,180
I prepared the cloth.


192
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,930
I applied the ointment to him.


193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,790
All these clues are related to me.


194
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,990
Mr. Guo,


195
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,410
was that really an accident?


196
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm not sure.


197
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,300
There are still many things that are very strange.


198
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,880
Give me some time.


199
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,280
Don't plead guilty.


200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,690
Take care of yourself.


201
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,280
Where are you?


202
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,940
Are you all here?


203
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,840
Where are you?


204
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,740
Here.


205
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,910
I can't see anything.


206
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,090
Neither can I.


207
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:11,990
Who?


208
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,970
Don't swim blindly.


209
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,250
Don't panic.


210
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,010
Are you Mr. Guo?


211
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,550
Tread water gently. Tread water gently.


212
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,960
Pull the rope.


213
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,650
Mr. Guo.


214
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,750
Mr. Guo, I can't see you.


215
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,100
Grab the rope.


216
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,310
Where is the rope?


217
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,980
Am I blind?


218
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,010
Shut up!


219
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,980
I heard the porters say


220
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,520
that the diving team was going to arrange lines in the river at night.


221
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,370
I was afraid they would use foreign machines to discharge.


222
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,720
So I came here to inform you.


223
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,250
I didn't expect that they did this.


224
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,660
Mr. Guo, I can't say anything.


225
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,120
Tieniu, are we blind? Tieniu.


226
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,330
Don't panic.


227
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,120
Take it easy.


228
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,170
Mr. Guo,


229
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,540
they used these extremely bright lamps


230
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,970
obviously to deal with


231
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,000
our corpse-salvage team.


232
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,600
Ding Mao


233
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,520
was ruthless this time.


234
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,020
What's wrong, Tieniu?


235
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,680
Why did you stop?


236
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,510
Tieniu?


237
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,960
Mr. Guo.


238
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,200
What's wrong, Tieniu?


239
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,750
Mr. Guo.


240
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,560
Tieniu?


241
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,160
- Mr. Guo. - Tieniu?


242
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,550
Young Master,


243
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,040
the xenon lamp test was successful.


244
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,190
But


245
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,030
something went wrong.


246
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,050
What happened?


247
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,310
Those men of the corpse-salvage team


248
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,530
pretended to be ghosts.


249
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,390
They scared our divers under the water,


250
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,180
but when the xenon lamps flashed,


251
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,520
they became blind suddenly.


252
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,060
Do you think


253
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,980
we should arrange some doctors for them?


254
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,460
You are back.


255
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,600
You are going to get married,


256
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,620
so you should


257
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,390
use new bedclothes.


258
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,300
I don't know


259
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,710
what color of cloth you need and what should be paid attention to.


260
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,250
I brought them here for you to choose from.


261
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,640
Which bolt of cloth do you like?


262
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,530
I'll find people to make bedclothes for you.


263
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,920
I've sent


264
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,200
an eye doctor


265
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,280
to see those people.


266
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,200
Their sudden blindness


267
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,420
caused by the searching lamps is not serious.


268
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,080
They will be fine


269
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,980
after resting for a few days.


270
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,640
These bolts of cloth must be checked one by one, right?


271
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,660
Actually,


272
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,390
I want to investigate from the allergen.


273
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,440
All the pieces of cloth Gu Weiliang used


274
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,040
were bought from this shop.


275
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,760
So I took


276
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,240
all their goods in their shop


277
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,070
here


278
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
to see whether we can find any clue.


279
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,080
Soft.


280
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,910
No muscles and bones.


281
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,510
Just a good-for-nothing.


282
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,560
Don't dare to admit it when it causes trouble.


283
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,950
Look at this bolt of cloth.


284
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,250
Straight and stiff.


285
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,600
It looks decent.


286
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,089
It is a pity that both the technique and the materials used are too inferior.


287
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,500
It is really harmful.


288
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,920
This is good.


289
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,410
It feels smooth.


290
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,270
At first glance, it is a high-end product.


291
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,680
When a bastard wears the clothes made of this cloth,


292
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,599
he will look presentable.


293
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,230
It looks like your clothes.


294
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,540
Guo Deyou,


295
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,270
about the searching lamps,


296
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,280
we were indeed thoughtless.


297
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,810
But you guys pretended to be ghosts to scare my men.


298
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,220
You, the corpse-salvage team, did wrong first.


299
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,000
We pretended to be ghosts


300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,220
because you wanted to flood my Dragon King Temple.


301
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
I want to protect the Women's Academy.


302
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,470
Do you understand?


303
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,040
I don't understand.


304
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,940
Then what do you understand?


305
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,000
You can protect the Dragon King Temple.


306
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,530
Can't I protect the Water Transport Chamber of Commerce?


307
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,410
If the curve cut-off project can't be continued,


308
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,140
then the Water Transport Chamber of Commerce will be destroyed.


309
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,800
Right.


310
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,840
It's useless to talk to you about that.


311
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,250
You only have your own things in your heart.


312
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,870
Well.


313
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,810
What's the use of putting these blots of cloth together?


314
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,970
High-end cloth.


315
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,890
A wealthy family not only


316
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,980
uses fine cloth.


317
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,540
Without some Suzhou embroideries,


318
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,400
don't mention a diplomat,


319
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,320
even an accountant won't take a look at the cloth.


320
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,070
Well. Let's go.


321
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,760
Let's go to take a look at the embroidery workshop.


322
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,510
Since you brought the cloth here today,


323
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
let's investigate the case first.


324
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,540
As for the Dragon King Temple and searching lamps,


325
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,400
I'll get even with you later.


326
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,310
Plant dyeing is a craft handed down by my ancestors.


327
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,290
Recently, we received a big order for a happy occasion.


328
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,380
So we are working busily now.


329
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,560
This is dyed with sappanwood and safflower.


330
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,900
In normal times,


331
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,560
you can see examples of indigo dyeing.


332
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,480
The dyes are authentic indigoes from Xuanxian.


333
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,940
The best in plant dyeing


334
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,490
is traditional Chinese medicine dyeing.


335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,640
For example,


336
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,950
A set of sheets of cassia seed


337
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,530
can help you see and hear clearly


338
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,420
and have a good sleep.


339
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,830
Without doubt,


340
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,950
the goods Diplomat Gu Weiliang ordered


341
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,420
must be those with traditional Chinese medicine dyeing.


342
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,210
Definitely.


343
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,640
Lily embroidery threads for Mr. Gu's wedding


344
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,240
must be dyed with rare traditional Chinese medicine.


345
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,990
Miss Wang Meiren, the big star, came to pick it herself.


346
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,410
Didn't you make any mistake


347
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,460
during this process?


348
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,380
I can't make mistakes.


349
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,230
I earn money from repeat customers.


350
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,310
We don't do things


351
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,340
which will ruin our business.


352
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,710
Normally,


353
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,610
as Wang Meiren knew that Gu Weiliang was prone to allergies,


354
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,210
she came to pick the medicine herself,


355
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,000
and nothing should go wrong.


356
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,780
What you just said


357
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,740
reminded me of something.


358
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,210
We replaced a medicine


359
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,150
to dye this kind of yellow threads.


360
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,820
To produce this yellow color,


361
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,420
we can use the bark of cork tree which is cheap,


362
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,470
and we can also use Japanese knotweed which is more expensive.


363
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,510
Miss Wang chose the bark of cork tree.


364
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,430
Coincidentally, the bark of cork tree was out of stock,


365
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,610
so we replaced it with Japanese knotweed in private.


366
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,730
The bark is bitter in taste.


367
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,010
It is a medicine most in use to reduce internal heat and relax the bowels.


368
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,360
How could such a medicine in common use


369
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,180
be out of stock?


370
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:20,950
Right.


371
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,910
We felt puzzled too.


372
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,090
Those days, in all the medicinal material shops in Tientsin,


373
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,370
the bark of cork tree was out of stock.


374
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,800
But Miss Wang wanted the goods urgently


375
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,860
and we really had no other choice.


376
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,760
We thought


377
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,420
Japanese knotweed is more expensive.


378
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,020
So we didn't mention that.


379
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,260
Well.


380
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,500
Give me each portion of the threads


381
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,680
of all colors Wang Meiren


382
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,700
ordered here.


383
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,550
OK.


384
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,640
I need to take them to the police department for testing.


385
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,240
OK.


386
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,720
I'll prepare them for you right away.


387
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,760
The bark of cork tree was out of stock.


388
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,300
It was replaced by Japanese knotweed.


389
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,750
Japanese knotweed threads embroidered on the bed sheet,


390
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,800
which cause Gu Weiliang to have allergic reactions.


391
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,970
The anti-allergic ointment applied in large quantities for a long time


392
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,210
covered the smell of white phosphorus.


393
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,190
The ointment can relieve itching,


394
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,990
but white phosphorus is flammable.


395
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,260
The West Lake Hotel is not bright enough,


396
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,500
so Wang Meiren was asked to borrow


397
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,780
extremely spotlights from the film production team.


398
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,020
The brightness was enough,


399
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,360
but the temperature was too high,


400
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,670
reaching the ignition point of phosphorus.


401
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,560
So...


402
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,210
Everything was simply a coincidence?


403
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,580
But


404
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,430
why did Gu Weiliang stand there


405
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,400
letting the phosphorus powder burn without moving?


406
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,360
Something was wrong.


407
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,360
Who else was there?


408
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,320
Why did Gu Weiliang have allergic reactions?


409
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,480
Why?


410
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,760
The bark of cork tree was out of stock


411
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,290
and the embroidery workshop replaced it with Japanese knotweed.


412
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,320
So Japanese knotweed


413
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,000
was Gu Weiliang's allergen.


414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,030
That's the cause.


415
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,140
The bark of cork tree was out of stock in whole Tientsin.


416
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,340
Should Wang Meiren be blamed for that?


417
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,170
No.


418
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,350
Diplomat Gu Weiliang


419
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,110
had his style.


420
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,990
He wanted to shoot a modern film for his wedding.


421
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,080
The film


422
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,190
must be bright.


423
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,670
Definitely.


424
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,030
Miss Wang is a film star.


425
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,700
It's not difficult for her to get spotlights, right?


426
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,360
That's so easy for her.


427
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,440
So Gu Weiliang asked Wang Meiren


428
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,730
to tell her assistant


429
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,330
to borrow the lights from the film company.


430
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,950
It turned out to be like that.


431
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,130
After we trace the source,


432
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,890
can we


433
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,030
blame Wang Meiren in this case?


434
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,050
Can we?


435
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,940
Japanese knotweed,


436
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:41,900
the anti-allergic ointment,


437
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,730
and spotlights


438
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,010
were indispensable.


439
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,280
So the most reasonable explanation for this case is...


440
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,570
His luck has run out of its course.


441
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,640
He died of an unexpected disaster.


442
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,860
Your performed the cross talk


443
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,230
to make me believe


444
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,660
that it was an accident


445
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,330
that on his wedding day,


446
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,020
when his relatives and friends gathered to celebrate,


447
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,380
he was burned to death


448
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,660
on the stage.


449
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,210
Things are unpredictable.


450
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,380
If it's really an accident,


451
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,560
I will eat this desk.


452
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,740
Hello?


453
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,680
Yes.


454
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,460
Yes.


455
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:49,950
OK.


456
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,870
Governor, sorry for bothering you.


457
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,350
Release her.


458
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,190
Release her!


459
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,120
So you


460
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,520
believed that?


461
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,590
Things are unpredictable.


462
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,790
Hurry up.


463
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,690
Come on.


464
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,700
Help Vice Captain Zheng dismantle the desk.


465
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,680
Steam the desktop.


466
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,350
Braise the drawers in soy sauce.


467
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,190
The case is closed. The case is closed.


468
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,240
Let's eat meat in the evening.


469
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,870
Vice-Captain Zheng will eat the desk.


470
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,470
The case is closed.


471
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,690
Don't leave the nails behind.


472
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,080
With salt and pepper,


473
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,620
they taste crisp.


474
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,100
The nature of Gu Weiliang's case


475
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,960
was determined as an accident in the end.


476
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,130
As the receptionist,


477
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,800
although I was exempted from accountability,


478
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,160
I still think that behind the case...


479
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,920
Listen.


480
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,770
It seems that orioles are singing.


481
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,380
Perhaps they just flew away.


482
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,610
I think Gu Weiliang was not only to get married.


483
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,920
He seemed to meet someone.


484
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,540
You know what?


485
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,290
Orioles


486
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:33,930
are resident birds,


487
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,040
but some migrate.


488
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,010
I'm sorry.


489
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,230
I keep talking about the case,


490
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,890
making you disappointed.


491
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,640
You are not old enough


492
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,430
to listen to birds' singing to kill time.


493
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,670
Think about what you should do.


494
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,590
Don't waste time.


495
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,590
So you mean


496
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,120
you don't want me to investigate into the case anymore?


497
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,250
Didn't you tell me


498
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,220
the nature of the case has been determined?


499
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,500
Look at this lake.


500
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,810
It looks calm on the surface,


501
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,150
without waves.


502
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,010
But actually it is bottomless,


503
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,220
with undercurrents surging.


504
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,460
If you insist on competing with it,


505
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,450
you may not only be drowned,


506
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,430
but also bring disaster to


507
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,520
your partners in the boat.


508
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,500
I know


509
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,100
that you don't want me to investigate into the case anymore


510
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,730
because you worry that something behind Gu Weiliang is too deep.


511
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,770
We


512
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,800
have limited energy.


513
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,970
Choose important things to do with your energy


514
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,570
and give up those irrelevant.


515
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,920
Only in this way


516
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,200
can you put your limited energy


517
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,050
in the people and things you care about.


518
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,330
Otherwise, one day,


519
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,190
you will regret it.


520
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,610
Promise me two things.


521
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,000
First,


522
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,470
take good care of Lanlan.


523
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,500
Second,


524
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,060
don't do dangerous things.


525
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,860
The second thing


526
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,710
is also for Lanlan, right?


527
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,650
How is this meal?


528
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,850
When it comes to eating,


529
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,340
I, an excellent detective in Tientsin,


530
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,070
am absolutely second to none.


531
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,270
For example, the drunken duck of the Hefeng Restaurant


532
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
is very special.


533
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,590
The wine used


534
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,580
is the Shaoxing wine of many years' standing.


535
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,920
The duck


536
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,420
must be fried before being steamed.


537
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,460
The heat can't be high or low.


538
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,940
Sauce reduction should be made in time


539
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,340
so as to make the dish tasty.


540
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,180
Try it.


541
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,050
Vice-Captain Zheng caught the wrong person.


542
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,880
He can't


543
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,160
eat the duck.


544
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,630
Neither can I.


545
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,930
He has no credit to get.


546
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,600
I didn't make any mistake, so I won't be punished.


547
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,010
No reward or punishment.


548
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,480
This is the most peaceful.


549
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,190
So, Fu Laiyong, you are amazing.


550
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,880
No wonder governor of Tientsin changes,


551
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,970
but you are still there.


552
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,000
How about we order another dish,


553
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,410
dry-braised four treasures of duck?


554
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,770
I already ordered it.


555
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,630
When everyone is here, I'll ask the waiter to serve it.


556
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,100
When everyone is here?


557
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,960
Here he comes.


558
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,450
Secretary General.


559
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,180
You asked us to eat first,


560
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,400
so I didn't let Mr. Guo wait.


561
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,250
Since you are here, please take your seat.


562
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,150
I'll urge them to serve the dishes.


563
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,920
You drink tea?


564
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,160
Have you seen me drink wine?


565
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,100
She was released.


566
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,660
Tieniu and the others have almost recovered from their sudden blindness.


567
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,320
That's good news.


568
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,300
Wait, wait.


569
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,420
You two


570
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,440
are a perfect pair,


571
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
and you have the ability to divine the unknown.


572
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,660
Thanks to you, I could


573
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,690
make a turnaround.


574
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,160
I'll drink this cup of wine


575
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,380
to express my thanks.


576
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,540
Fu Laiyong,


577
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,400
we drank wine


578
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,940
and ate.


579
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,180
But even brothers keep careful accounts.


580
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,440
I assisted you in investigating into such a big case.


581
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,300
Do you want


582
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,410
to get over with it by just treating me to a meal?


583
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,570
Well.


584
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,720
Mr. Guo,


585
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,450
in the past,


586
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,620
giving you some money was nothing.


587
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,160
But nowadays,


588
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,230
I have to share the position with someone else.


589
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,050
I don't have


590
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,200
the final say.


591
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,820
Can you make ends meet by working for the police station


592
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,910
like that?


593
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,110
I will arrange a steady job for you.


594
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,520
When the time comes, you can move to a new apartment.


595
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,170
Why hasn't steamed pork liver and intestines


596
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,320
been served yet?


597
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,600
I'll go and take a look.


598
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,880
Why are they so slow?


599
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,720
You are so considerate.


600
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,190
How about


601
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,430
I rely on you to support me all my life?


602
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,390
I want to let Master live more comfortably.


603
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,920
I do that for the sake of the people of Tientsin too.


604
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,720
Don't pretend to be lofty.


605
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,340
Don't push me with the excuse of the people.


606
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,500
I am one of the people.


607
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,300
If you dare to plan to destroy the Dragon King Temple again,


608
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,310
the not too deep bond between us


609
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,740
will come to an end.


610
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,800
By the way,


611
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,740
don't investigate into Gu Weiliang's case anymore.


612
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,730
There's something deep behind.


613
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,460
Neither you nor I can deal with it.


614
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,390
I


615
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,990
just a common man.


616
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,910
Curve cut-off is none of my business.


617
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,510
I can't intervene in the case of the diplomat's death.


618
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,560
I just want to protect my temple


619
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
and those team members.


620
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,530
But whoever wants to dare to harm them,


621
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,150
no matter how deep the water is,


622
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,480
it won't scare me, Little River God.


623
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,100
How about we ask them not to serve dry-braised four treasures of duck?


624
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,340
Secretary General, you can't finish it alone.


625
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,760
I'm not very clever,


626
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,380
but I'm not a fool.


627
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,440
There must be a reason for Deyou


628
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,000
to work so hard to investigate into the case.


629
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,040
I'm not flattering myself.


630
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,500
I don't have to say he does that for me.


631
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,830
I know it's presumptuous to disturb you at this time.


632
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,500
but I really want to find out


633
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,000
whether the case Deyou investigates into...


634
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,860
Although the murderer hasn't been found,


635
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,929
Mr. Guo


636
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,230
proved my innocence.


637
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,880
I will be grateful to him all my life.


638
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,949
But what Mr. Guo


639
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,870
cares about most


640
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,110
is not to make a thorough investigation of the case.


641
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,500
You guessed right.


642
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,510
Weiliang


643
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,060
is probably your biological father.


644
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,670
You must have caused trouble.


645
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,910
Why are you hiding under my bed?


646
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,390
I dropped the magic whip into the latrine pit.


647
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,730
My mother was so angry.


648
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,330
She scolded me as if it's thundering.


649
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,250
I feel scared wherever I hide.


650
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,790
Only when I hide under your bed


651
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,260
can I feel secure.


652
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,690
Come out.


653
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,710
Your mother is not here.


654
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,120
The cake.


655
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,850
I specially went to the Guajia Temple to buy it.


656
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,210
How do you know I'm here?


657
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,350
You must have caused trouble.


658
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,390
You are amazing.


659
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,800
You are smart.


660
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,790
You have learned to meet someone.


661
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,150
You are the one who is smart.


662
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,010
You kept that from me.


663
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,450
Maybe


664
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,670
that diplomat


665
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,330
is not your father at all.


666
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,630
What if he is?


667
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,620
If he is my biological father,


668
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,070
I should be sad.


669
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,380
Why don't I have such a feeling at all?


670
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,630
The murderer openly


671
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,360
killed him by burning him.


672
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,410
Right.


673
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,010
He did that in such a hurry.


674
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,380
You haven't met Mr. Gu yet.


675
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,190
How did the police department deal with the case?


676
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,140
Even if I had to cook the desk


677
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,870
and eat it all,


678
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,490
I don't believe that Gu Weiliang died in an accident.


679
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,460
Commander Wu clearly wants to send the scroll of the Immortals of Harmony and Union,


680
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,250
but it was replaced by the Fiery Bull Scroll.


681
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,590
There must be a trick.


682
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,830
The crown prince was replaced with a cat.


683
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:45,270
She told the lie that the imperial concubine gave birth to an evil spirit.


684
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,020
In addition to hold a wedding ceremony,


685
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,640
Gu Weiliang came to Tientsin


686
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,630
to meet me actually.


687
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,720
Whether it is Secretary General Ding or Little River God,


688
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,520
if they know,


689
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,970
you have to kill.


690
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,660
Got it.


691
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,960
I will find the murderer before them.


692
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,400
The man who set fire


693
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,390
ruined Mr. Gu's career.


694
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,560
This murderer


695
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,800
is sinister and vicious.


696
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,620
Hacking him to pieces is not to be regretted.


697
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,950
Catch the murderer.


698
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,570
Don't let him say anything before he dies.


699
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,470
Got it.


700
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,320
If you determine to confirm her origin,


701
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,060
I'll do my best to cooperate with you.


702
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,300
Then I'll come straight to the point.


703
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,410
Well, Miss Wang,


704
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,330
Has Mr. Gu mentioned to you that


705
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,250
is there any article or statement


706
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,530
which can prove the child's origin?


707
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,260
For example,


708
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,410
a pendant,


709
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,140
birthmark,


710
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,260
key or something like that.


711
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,580
I've never heard him mention that.


712
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,500
OK. Great.


713
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,460
Thank you for your cooperation.


714
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,480
Why don't you leave?


715
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,310
You want to stay for dinner here?


716
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,790
You leave first.


717
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,920
I still have something to talk to Meiren for a while.


718
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,950
Meiren?


719
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,380
You call her by her name?


720
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,270
What's wrong?


721
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,490
Very good.


722
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,350
You guys talk.


723
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,960
I'm sorry that


724
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,690
I often come here to bother you.


725
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,650
It doesn't matter.


726
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,830
I won't stay here for long.


727
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,920
After you leave this time,


728
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,820
will you come back?


729
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,890
So many things happened.


730
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,710
It seems that Tientsin


731
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,400
is not a lucky place for me.


732
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,000
Excuse me for asking this.


733
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,660
How did you and Mr. Gu


734
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,520
get to know each other?


735
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,700
Fiery Bull.


736
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,320
What did you say?


737
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,260
Nothing.


738
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,840
Bull again.


739
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,270
Why did you take her scroll?


740
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,670
This gift from some dignitary


741
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:02,890
is valuable.


742
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,870
Drop it.


743
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,540
It must be related to the case investigation.


744
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,840
Does it have anything to do with Gu Weiliang?


745
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,810
I didn't know who my father is.


746
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,460
Now I know he may be my father,


747
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,870
but he has been killed.


748
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,430
Let's not talk about anything else.


749
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,370
I have to know how he died.


750
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,980
I'm telling you.


751
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,520
This case is


752
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,600
none of your business.


753
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,620
I'm telling you.


754
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,410
my investigation on my father's case


755
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,330
is none of your business.


756
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,530
Are they the same thing?


757
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,390
Aren't they the same thing?


758
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,300
Are they?


759
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,130
Aren't they?


760
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,150
Give it to me.


761
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,670
Is it enough?


762
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,400
Is there no end of it?


763
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,220
If you poke your nose into what isn't your business,


764
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,880
let's not get married.


765
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,220
Even if we get married, we won't get along well.


766
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,820
Guo Deyou,


767
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,510
remember what you just said.


768
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,100
If you or I who talk about getting married again,


769
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,380
the person will be the bastard.
