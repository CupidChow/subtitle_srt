1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,570
Everyone be quiet, please.


3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,340
At Mogudao's Evil Water Source,


4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,350
Guo Deyou's life hung on a thread


5
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,229
as he strove to defuse the bomb planted at the bottom of the river.


6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,400
That's where we left off last time.


7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,150
I've noticed some new faces in the audience.


8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,780
We're coming to a most exciting chapter.


9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,590
Our last storytelling session was quite a while ago.


10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,990
So let me give a brief recap of the previous chapters.


11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Tientsin, a place situated in the lower reaches of nine rivers,


12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,020
boasts three pontoon bridges and two customhouses.


13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,320
A grievance arose at the River-worshipping Ceremony


14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,630
to the embarrassment of Xuanwu, River God of the North.


15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,870
Mysterious cases occurred in succession


16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,860
since the emergence of the evil Mogudao Sect.


17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,030
Heroes of older generations having retired from the world,


18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,530
our valiant youths risked their lives to right the wrong.


19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,900
Unwilling to admit defeat, Lian Huaqing


20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,950
threw a bomb to the bottom of the poisoned Haihe River.


21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,810
Guo Deyou went to his death unflinchingly.


22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,220
Alas. Alas.


23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,720
The brave young man's fate hung in the balance.


24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,020
So, did a bomb explode


25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,490
at the bottom of the river?


26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,840
It did.


27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,039
But it wasn't the one Little River God Guo Deyou was defusing.


28
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,300
Lian Huaqing, the foxy leader of Mogudao,


29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,730
had put on the act as a diversion,


30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,510
as he had planted multiple bombs around the Evil Water Source.


31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,000
As a result, the toxic water spread out


32
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,400
and polluted the main stream and tributaries of the Haihe River,


33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,570
hence the shipping ban


34
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,600
and the closure of all rivers in Tientsin.


35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,920
Little River God survived the explosion,


36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,640
but was convicted of colluding with the evil sect to pollute the Haihe River.


37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,840
Wanted posters for him could be found in every corner of Tientsin.


38
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,550
After two court trials, he was sentenced


39
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,750
to the gallows on the execution ground in the western suburbs.


40
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,970
Someone was asking


41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,720
what happened to the other three heroes,


42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,770
that is, Ding Mao, Gu Ying and Xiao Lanlan.


43
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,460
OK. Let's come back to our story.


44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,660
Tientsin was destined to witness more


45
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,320
tumultuous changes.


46
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,620
Jianghu.


47
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,300
Science.


48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,140
Kung fu.


49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,820
Truth.


50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,740
Nine statues of ox.


51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,140
Two statues of tiger.


52
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,540
One statue of rooster.


53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,020
Governor.


54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,060
Mayor of Tientsin.


55
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,660
Commander in Chief.


56
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,140
River monster.


57
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,820
The Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce.


58
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,580
The vaccine.


59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,780
The murderer of my father.


60
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,900
Fan Junyao.


61
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,660
Physical therapy.


62
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,020
Curve cut-off.


63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,620
Over my dead body.


64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,180
I don't believe it.


65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,620
You've got to be kidding me.


66
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,579
I'm never afraid of anyone.


67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,860
River God.


68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,020
Tientsin Mystic 2


69
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,900
Episode 1


70
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,910
That ox.


71
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,290
Pull!


72
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,720
Here comes Little River God.


73
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,420
Tiger-head boat.


74
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,260
It's the tiger-head boat.


75
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,020
Look. Look.


76
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,030
Here comes River God.


77
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,530
Little River God has arrived.


78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,940
My master said we shouldn't answer


79
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,990
if people call us River God.


80
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,740
But as the captain of the Wuhe Corpse-salvage Team,


81
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,400
I had to deal with the monster


82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,680
in the river.


83
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,860
We had a similar incident not long ago, right?


84
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,159
Lian Huaqing, leader of Mogudao,


85
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,340
threw a bomb into the Evil Water Source,


86
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,600
trying to pollute the entire Tientsin with that highly toxic underground water.


87
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,420
How could I have sat on my hands?


88
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,110
In a fit of rage, I destroyed Mogudao.


89
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,280
After a few days of peace, a sea monster


90
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,690
had to come out to make trouble.


91
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,750
It seems that a great talent like me


92
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,920
is predestined to be busy.


93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,020
Well,


94
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,070
you guys are lucky today.


95
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,210
Let me show you how I subdued demons.


96
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,110
Soon after the nine oxen got into the water as baits,


97
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,310
I rushed aboard the double-tiger boat,


98
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,060
taking a firm grasp on my Golden Rooster Sea-stabilizing Spear


99
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,830
to destroy this demon


100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,820
for good.


101
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,620
I'm serious.


102
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,820
Oxen embody the element of earth. Nine oxen could stabilize water.


103
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,120
Tiger embodies the element of wood.


104
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,400
Wood counteracts earth.


105
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,170
On top of that, the golden rooster, a herald of daybreak, expels ghosts and yin.


106
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,960
There is always one thing to conquer another.


107
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,260
So I vanquished the sea monster.


108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,100
It's called when the nine oxen, two tigers and one rooster appeared....


109
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,730
River God would vanquish the sea monster.


110
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,350
So


111
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,040
you're familiar with this story then.


112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,340
Um, I heard about the part


113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,330
about Mogudao,


114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,790
but about the legend of the vanquishing of the sea monster


115
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,260
and about the role you played in it...


116
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,670
Let's get things straight.


117
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,290
The Ming Dynasty saw a total of 16 emperors.


118
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,930
During the Jiajing Era...


119
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,830
Are you done with your meal or not?


120
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,470
Stop talking big.


121
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,140
Finish your last meal.


122
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,630
According to the rules,


123
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,680
one should eat some plain boiled pork


124
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,860
before crossing the Bridge of Forgetfulness.


125
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,910
I'll leave the wine to you.


126
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,700
No, thanks.


127
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,840
This wine is for your departure.


128
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,060
It's not yet


129
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,660
my time to die.


130
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,410
Guo Deyou,


131
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,620
it's time.


132
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,789
Guo Deyou, the Chosen One of Mogudao,


133
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,650
shall be executed at 11:45 a.m.


134
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,850
for detonating a bomb and polluting the Haihe River.


135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,110
Without having my last meal,


136
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,570
I guess I'll become a hungry ghost.


137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,850
Maybe you could just shoot me dead.


138
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,390
A bullet would be much quicker.


139
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,010
In your next life perhaps.


140
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,130
Get reincarnated in a new body,


141
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,560
and you may perhaps be shot dead in the end.


142
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,720
But you're going to die a more painful death today.


143
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
The river monster must be hanged


144
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,580
in front of the people


145
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,100
to reassure them.


146
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,570
Alright.


147
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,810
I'll die the way some emperors died.


148
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,480
It'll be worth it.


149
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,760
Guo Deyou!


150
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,040
Guo Deyou!


151
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,770
Are you alright?


152
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm OK.


153
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,910
What about the bomb?


154
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,610
It was taken care of.


155
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,960
Go with Lanlan.


156
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,110
I'll carry Gu Ying on my back and get us out of here.


157
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,060
What happened?


158
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,400
How could it be?


159
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sure I disposed of the bomb.


160
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,180
Hurry.


161
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,390
Hurry.


162
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,670
Lanlan.


163
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,300
Hurry, Ding Mao.


164
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,970
Gu Ying.


165
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,890
Ding Mao.


166
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,740
It's normal for you to feel disoriented at first.


167
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,410
You'll get better.


168
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,400
You must continue your underwater rehabilitation.


169
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,470
You should have it twice a week.


170
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,160
You've got a press conference to attend,


171
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,210
so let's call it a day.


172
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,130
I'll send the recipe to your assistant.


173
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,330
You should avoid strenuous exercises at home.


174
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,650
This floral incense


175
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,210
might cause slight dizziness,


176
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,090
but it's quite effective in relaxing your nerves.


177
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,430
Don't worry.


178
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,700
River monster! River monster! River monster!


179
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,730
Nine oxen shall tear his body limb from limb.


180
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,940
Two tigers shall devour his flesh.


181
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,350
One rooster shall peck out this eyes.


182
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:54,870
River monster! River monster! River monster!


183
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,340
Rip his body up.


184
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,130
He's an evil follower of Mogudao.


185
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,110
He blew up the Evil Water Source.


186
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,990
He poisoned the water we drink.


187
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,370
River monster! River monster! River monster!


188
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,280
Condemned prisoner Guo Deyou,


189
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,930
the Chosen One of the nefarious Mogudao,


190
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,990
committed the most heinous crime of colluding with Mogudao


191
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,460
to detonate the highly toxic underground water


192
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,130
and pollute the Haihe River, leading to the fishing ban


193
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,270
and the shipping ban in Tientsin, and the misery of its people.


194
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,480
Today


195
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
he shall be hanged.


196
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,420
Hooray. Hooray. Hooray.


197
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,880
Therefore,


198
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,040
curve cut-off will be the most effective solution


199
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,710
to the pollution of the water source


200
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,010
and the resumption of fishing


201
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,450
and shipping in Tientsin.


202
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,970
This project must be launched.


203
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,160
Bravo.


204
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,400
Bravo.


205
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,020
Secretary-General Ding spoke


206
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,860
in such a beautiful bureaucratic tone.


207
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,620
The people of Tientsin have depended on the rivers for a living for generations.


208
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,310
But now you're proposing blasting the rivers to change their courses


209
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,490
on top of the fishing ban and the shipping ban.


210
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,570
Secretary-General Ding,


211
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,120
you're a genius at ruining people's livelihoods.


212
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,650
We have to deal with the pollution of the water source


213
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,720
precisely because we people of Tientsin depend on the rivers for a living.


214
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,940
Only by launching the curve cut-off project


215
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,970
will we be able to resume the operation


216
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,690
of all trades in Tientsin.


217
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,530
The people depend on the rivers for a livelihood,


218
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,090
and a high official like Your Excellency


219
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,330
depends on and exploits the people, right?


220
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,110
Why do all the shot points


221
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,650
of that river project you mentioned just now


222
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,020
happen to be located in the territory


223
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,830
of my Yishengmen Gang?


224
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,100
Your Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce


225
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,470
is so calculating.


226
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,060
Conducting curve cut-off to discharge waste water and form a new river


227
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,910
is the only way to clean up the mess


228
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,810
in a short time.


229
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,430
I don't understand your fancy terms.


230
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,900
All I know is


231
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,590
that you succeeded your father-in-law Xiao Yan


232
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,380
as Secretary-General


233
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,240
upon his death.


234
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,020
You've become ruthless on your way


235
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,090
to the position of Secretary General, huh?


236
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,200
What nonsense. What nonsense.


237
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,380
Sit down. You know what?


238
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,030
I can't tell which part of your speech


239
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,230
is true and which part is false.


240
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,460
Have you got anything else to say,


241
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,830
river monster Guo Deyou?


242
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,180
Don't build a grave for me.


243
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,420
It'd be unsightly.


244
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,960
Deyou.


245
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,660
Deyou.


246
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,530
Hurry. The original carrier of the vaccine has come to.


247
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,240
Deyou.


248
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,340
After you, Secretary-General Ding.


249
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,690
Bravo.


250
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,800
What a show!


251
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,100
What an amazing show!


252
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,540
I've never watched it in the theater.


253
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,020
Xiao Lanlan, the daughter of the former secretary-general,


254
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,960
shot at her boyfriend to avenge the death of her father.


255
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,690
Bravo.


256
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,760
Bravo.


257
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,780
You've got to kill me first


258
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,260
before you can carry out the curve cut-off.


259
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,050
Hurry.


260
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,150
Sedate her with two doses of tranquilizer.


261
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,940
We must protect the original carrier of the vaccine.


262
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,710
I'll knock the daylight out of you.


263
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,050
Get lost.


264
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,050
Miss Gu.


265
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,390
Miss Gu, please calm down.


266
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,290
Please calm down.


267
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,530
You haven't fully recovered


268
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,619
from your injuries at the Evil Water Source.


269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,730
Don't worry. This place is perfectly safe.


270
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,099
You've been in a coma due to excessive loss of blood


271
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,700
after the explosion of the Evil Water Source,


272
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,810
and you need a good rest to recuperate.


273
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,220
We've found


274
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,140
that you're immune to the Mogudao Virus


275
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,250
thanks to the inherent antibodies in your blood.


276
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,599
That is to say,


277
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,960
you are the Chosen One of Mogudao.


278
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,740
You can be discharged tomorrow


279
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,660
after we collect the last antibody samples.


280
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,940
Then you can meet


281
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,240
Little River God.


282
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:55,450
Hooray. Hooray.


283
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,580
I used to be a Taoist hermit


284
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,510
living in Wolonggang away from the world.


285
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,610
Since he became secretary-general,


286
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,680
Ding Mao has made some surprising moves.


287
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,880
First he cut off ties with the Xiao family,


288
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,120
and then he had Guo Deyou hanged.


289
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,070
I can't tell what actions


290
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,050
he'll take next.


291
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,550
Greetings, Governor.


292
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,440
Hello, Mayor Bai.


293
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:47,920
Hello, Commander-in-chief Wu.


294
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,490
I heard there was a ruckus at the press conference?


295
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,120
We had an accident.


296
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,080
It has been taken care of.


297
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,190
Accidental discharge could happen.


298
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,810
One can't be too careful.


299
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,820
And now


300
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,020
I've got two questions to consult with you,


301
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,390
Secretary-General Ding.


302
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,670
You're so modest, sir.


303
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,550
I'm all ears.


304
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,700
Sorry to interrupt.


305
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,940
The curve cut-off started with such a fanfare


306
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,220
and cost a fortune,


307
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,590
so when is it going to show results?


308
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,610
The curve cut-off


309
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,980
is the optimal solution jointly proposed


310
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,010
by German hydraulic and environmental experts


311
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,610
with collective wisdom and concerted efforts.


312
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,970
We'll see quick results within two periods


313
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,930
as long as the blasting works


314
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,790
and the channel excavation go smoothly.


315
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,160
I wonder if the promotion of the vaccine


316
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,170
might be hampered by the masses.


317
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,730
It's not surprising that the masses


318
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,880
have misgivings about Western medicine.


319
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,820
Soon I'll be headed for the vaccination site


320
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,490
for supervision and publicity in person.


321
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,280
Good.


322
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,560
It's better to gain popular support


323
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,250
than to appease popular complaints.


324
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,790
Secretary-General Ding, Commander-in-chief Wu,


325
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,710
I've figured it out.


326
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,820
While the three of us are worried sick over this,


327
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,060
our governor


328
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,220
remains cool and composed.


329
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,820
Why is that?


330
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,060
Why is that?


331
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,260
He has the situation well in hand.


332
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,890
He has a clear idea of the situation.


333
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,810
Secretary-General Ding.


334
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,050
What do you think


335
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,050
we should do to win public support


336
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,530
for the curve cut-off


337
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,890
and the vaccination?


338
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,200
I'd love to hear your opinion.


339
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,180
Don't take people's jobs away.


340
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,040
Don't ask them to foot the bill.


341
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,540
Governor,


342
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,610
when the next batch of vaccines arrives at the port,


343
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,790
the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce


344
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,200
will cover all the expenses of the vaccination and publicity.


345
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,520
Besides, I'll join hands with the salt merchants,


346
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,480
the tea merchants and other chambers of commerce


347
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,570
to subsidize in your name


348
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,750
the people whose livelihoods are affected


349
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,220
by the closure of the rivers.


350
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,840
How daring is our young man in his career!


351
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,470
What a pity that he's frustrated in love!


352
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,420
Everyone knows Zhuge Liang the mastermind


353
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:34,590
predicted like a prophet.


354
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,710
Bravo.


355
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,310
The channels have already been closed.


356
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,340
What?


357
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,090
The roads are blocked as well?


358
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,840
No, they're not.


359
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,440
All roads will be open to you


360
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,910
after you have a shot of vaccine and get your card.


361
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,450
We don't trust foreign injections.


362
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,050
We'll accept the bad luck if we fall ill.


363
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,520
But you can't stop us from going into town.


364
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,870
That's right.


365
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
And your injections are way too expensive.


366
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,990
The vaccine was introduced


367
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,870
from Germany by Secretary-General Ding.


368
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,750
It was developed


369
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,600
by his former college mentor,


370
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,010
a distinguished German medical authority.


371
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,100
How could you doubt his expertise?


372
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,830
You'll live in peace after getting a shot.


373
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,980
So the cost doesn't matter that much.


374
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,260
We won't have a shot even it's for free.


375
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,220
We want to go home.


376
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,950
What are you doing? Stand back.


377
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,230
Have a shot of vaccine and you can pass.


378
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,700
You can't pass without a yellow card.


379
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,390
The sky is so dark that even the birds won't come out.


380
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,980
They must know a funeral is going on.


381
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,510
I'll go and boil a bucket of water


382
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,000
for you to wash away the bad luck.


383
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,270
After having a shot of vaccine


384
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,420
and getting the yellow card,


385
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,020
you can go into town


386
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,580
and safely use the river water


387
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,560
for farming and daily cleaning.


388
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,890
But you mustn't drink it directly,


389
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,850
understand?


390
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,990
Who else has a yellow card?


391
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,750
Excuse me.


392
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,580
Your yellow card, please.


393
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,350
Out of the way.


394
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,820
This is a densely populated area.


395
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,300
I won't stop you if you have a yellow card.


396
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,280
If not, you'll have to get a shot over there first.


397
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,290
What difference will a shot make?


398
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,660
We could neither drink from the rivers


399
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,390
nor fish in them


400
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,480
even before this curve cut-off project.


401
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,780
So why would we pay to get this shot?


402
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,470
He's right. Yeah.


403
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,580
Secretary-General Ding issued this notice in person.


404
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,180
You refuse to have a shot?


405
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,460
Fine.


406
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,870
Return by the way you came, then.


407
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,150
What are you doing?


408
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,900
Don't talk about that darn secretary-general.


409
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,400
He signed the document that convicted Mr. Guo.


410
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,280
How dare he call himself the disciple of Old River God?


411
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,560
He's an ungrateful bastard.


412
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,870
Guo Deyou was a river monster of Mogudao.


413
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,410
Secretary-General Ding sacrificed fraternity to righteousness


414
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,720
by destroying the river monster.


415
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,150
They were fellow disciples. So what?


416
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,240
Yeah. After making this "heroic" move,


417
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,610
the entire Tientsin has fallen into the hands of the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce.


418
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,400
The Wuhe Corpse-salvage Team


419
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,620
has lost its captain,


420
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,260
and you became


421
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,410
their loyal watchdog.


422
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,630
How disgusting!


423
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,340
Out of the way.


424
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,910
What are you doing?


425
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,920
Out of the way. Out of the way.


426
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,750
Everyone stay back.


427
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,130
Out of the way. Stay back.


428
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,290
Stay back. Stay back. Stay back.


429
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,310
Out of the way. Move.


430
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,350
Is it a human or a ghost?


431
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,630
Mr. Guo.


432
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,750
Mr. Guo, it's me,


433
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,970
Tieniu.


434
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,340
Mr. Guo.


435
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,220
Deyou.


436
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,410
Guo Deyou.


437
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,430
River monster.


438
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,970
Go back.


439
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,650
Look at his face and hands.


440
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,180
Is that the Mogudao Virus?


441
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,890
Yeah.


442
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,620
I thought the river monster was the Chosen One of Mogudao.


443
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
How come he's infected, too?


444
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,910
Deyou.


445
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,130
Mr. Guo.


446
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,860
River Patrol, seal off this area.


447
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,470
Yes, sir.


448
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,810
Let no one in or out of this area.


449
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,880
The river monster has turned into a zombie.


450
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,530
What did they inject into his neck?


451
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,740
He stopped struggling instantly.


452
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,200
They disappeared.


453
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,780
Deyou.


454
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,210
The zombie marks on his body disappeared.


455
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,790
Deyou.


456
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,300
Deyou.


457
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,260
Everyone should go home now.


458
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,040
Go home.


459
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,260
Go home. Go home.


460
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,410
Go home. Go home.


461
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,090
Go home.


462
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,020
Man gets away from misfortunes.


463
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,000
Misfortune get away from man.


464
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,350
I hereby employ this good root


465
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,790
to pray for all mortal beings


466
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,340
to be safe from every calamity.


467
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,780
Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.


468
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,280
Ashes and dust float to heaven; the earth is the mother of all.


469
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,260
How dare you lie in a coffin?


470
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,840
Mother.


471
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,800
How dare you do something so ominous?


472
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,570
Stop.


473
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,780
It was an act, alright?


474
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,370
I'm sure that bomb was defused.


475
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,260
It can't have exploded again.


476
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,760
So that must have been a second one.


477
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,130
You mean there is more than one bomb


478
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,280
beneath the Evil Water Source?


479
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,090
Exactly.


480
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,720
I was underwater then.


481
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,340
How could I have survived


482
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,620
if I had detonated the bomb?


483
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,600
We were about to make it out of the cavern


484
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,650
when an explosion occurred from another direction.


485
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,150
The cavern caved in, and water


486
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,450
surged out instantly.


487
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,920
We got dispersed.


488
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,140
I see.


489
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,770
Have you got anything else to say,


490
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,130
river monster Guo Deyou?


491
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,930
Don't build a grave for me.


492
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,170
It'd be unsightly.


493
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,610
Just erect a monument to me.


494
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,630
In your dream.


495
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,030
Fortunately, I had excellent


496
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,690
breath-holding skills.


497
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,480
An ordinary man


498
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,340
would have been killed


499
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,490
by that iron hook alone.


500
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,240
The governor had to display power on assuming office.


501
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,450
I wouldn't have


502
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,500
played this scapegoat but for the sake


503
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,740
of my junior fellow disciple, Secretary-General Ding.


504
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,660
Be nicer to me, will you?


505
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,260
I'm nice to you, Deyou.


506
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,350
Isn't it comfortable, Deyou?


507
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,270
Yep.


508
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,570
Oh, right.


509
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,490
What the heck did you daub on me the other day?


510
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,900
I still feel itchy all over.


511
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,820
I used tortoise urine and isatis root,


512
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,250
high-quality pigments for drawing misfortune-dispelling symbols.


513
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,620
They look bright when freshly applied,


514
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,960
but disappear within two hours.


515
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,440
The vaccine wouldn't have taken effect


516
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,100
so quickly.


517
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,340
We should use more joss paper.


518
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,020
It'll look more convincing


519
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,880
when people come to offer their condolences.


520
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,810
Look at all this joss paper.


521
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,600
It's like snowflakes fluttering in the air.


522
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,780
Come on. It's not your own funeral.


523
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,670
I've painted your back.


524
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,820
Turn over, Deyou.


525
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,720
OK.


526
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,870
Brother Niu, we've got to rehearse the lines.


527
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,770
Come on.


528
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,650
Secretary-General Ding sacrificed fraternity to righteousness


529
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,740
by destroying the river monster.


530
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,570
No.


531
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,680
You've got to say it louder


532
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,470
so that I'll get worked up and push you.


533
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,840
Brother Niu, restrain yourself a little bit then.


534
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,120
Don't push me too hard.


535
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,690
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go over it again.


536
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,270
OK.


537
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,290
Let's rehearse in the courtyard.


538
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,910
If the painting is done,


539
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,080
go and lie in the coffin already.


540
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,680
Don't let others see you.


541
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,510
Gu Ying is really strong.


542
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,300
She'd been in a hemorrhage-induced coma for a long time,


543
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,100
yet when she came to, she almost gave


544
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,030
my medical staff a good beating.


545
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,200
The vaccine developed with her serum


546
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,760
surely worked wonders.


547
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,640
You gave me a shot of the vaccine?


548
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,820
Didn't we agree that it'd be an act?


549
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,290
Three doses of normal saline would do.


550
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,770
Why didn't you suggest the injection


551
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,930
of some yellow wine instead?


552
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,700
I'll pass on the wine.


553
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,930
Another liter of warm water, please.


554
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,960
OK.


555
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:09,370
Praise the sage Samantabhadra Bodhisattva!


556
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,260
Since he assumed office as Governor of Tientsin,


557
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,760
Ao Dan has got the water source pollution under full control


558
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,250
and exterminated the evil Mogudao Sect.


559
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,810
The curve cut-off project is being carried out in an orderly way


560
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,440
and the resumption of farming and fishing can be expected soon.


561
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,570
Since the distribution of the vaccine by the Governor's office,


562
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,680
no new cases of virus infections,


563
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,310
farm product infections or animal product infections have been reported.


564
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,190
According to the Tientsin Police Department,


565
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,030
the emergence of the river monster is but a false rumor,


566
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,820
and hence rumor mongering is strictly prohibited.


567
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,760
I saw him breathe his last on the execution ground.


568
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,700
Yeah. And he became a zombie.


569
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,750
With the shot of the vaccine,


570
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,280
he came back to life.


571
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,290
The foreign injection proves quite effective.


572
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,470
Now that it's given for free,


573
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,810
we might as well give it a shot.


574
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,040
Guo Deyou the condemned prisoner


575
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,160
nullified his hanging


576
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,270
with the help of his breath-holding skills.


577
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,850
He entered a state of suspended animation


578
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,520
and later showed symptoms of Mogudao Virus,


579
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,710
proving that he isn't the Chosen One of Mogudao.


580
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,280
Therefore, his arrest warrant shall be revoked,


581
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,330
and he shall no longer be identified as a member of Mogudao.


582
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,490
River monsters do not exist.


583
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,920
Rumors gain no credence from


584
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,680
the people.


585
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,040
As luck would have it,


586
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,120
our four heroes, namely,


587
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,200
Guo Deyou, Ding Mao, Gu Ying and Xiao Lanlan,


588
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,010
survived the explosion of the Evil Water Source.


589
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,190
But the explosion turned


590
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,030
the entire Tientsin into a mess.


591
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,360
Lian Huaqing had vanished and was nowhere to be found.


592
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,469
The new iron-handed governor


593
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:23,159
ordered Ding Mao to assassinate Xiao Lanlan's father.


594
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,550
Ding Mao carried out the order and successfully took Xiao Yan's place,


595
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,560
hence the animosity between him


596
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,630
and his girlfriend Xiao Lanlan, daughter of the assassinated official.


597
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,020
After falling into the toxic water badly wounded,


598
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,360
Little Sorceress Gu Ying miraculously survived


599
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,480
and showed no sign of infection.


600
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,230
Sure enough, her serum proved useful


601
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,110
in developing a virus vaccine, which was then put into production and distributed.


602
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,600
And Little River God Guo Deyou


603
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,610
put on a zombie show with the help of his friends


604
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,760
and was finally acquitted of his charges.


605
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,679
Ding Mao firmed up his official position.


606
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,409
Gu Ying was discharged from the hospital.


607
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,970
The tumult subsided to the satisfaction of all.


608
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,660
But Tientsin was to witness new mysteries,


609
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,550
and murder cases


610
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,850
would occur again.


611
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,990
Mr. Cui is really drunk.


612
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,010
We beg your forgiveness.


613
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,210
I'll foot the bill for any opera you request


614
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,680
next time you come to our theater, OK?


615
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,900
It's a deal, then.


616
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,500
Sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry.


617
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,040
What's going on?


618
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,020
Sorry.


619
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,820
How dare you spoil the fun of our birthday party?


620
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,100
Sorry. Sorry.


621
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,150
Now that Tientsin is ruled by the Grain Transporting


622
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,260
Chamber of Commerce,


623
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,250
you think you can treat our Yishengmen Gang


624
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,230
any way you please, huh?


625
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,960
Bastard.


626
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,240
How dare we do that?


627
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,970
We all know


628
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
that at least half of Tientsin


629
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,570
follows your lead, Mr. Cui.


630
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,820
Do you know why I'm here today?


631
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,290
We surely do, sir.


632
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,490
The peach-shaped birthday cake is being prepared in the kitchen.


633
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,350
Mrs. Cui,


634
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,810
happy birthday and many happy returns of the day.


635
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,620
Thank you.


636
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,100
So I won't bother you any more.


637
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,450
The dishes will be served in no time.


638
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,600
Hold on.


639
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,580
Say some more.


640
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,330
Your birthday greetings sounded even better than the opera.


641
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,530
Mrs. Cui, may you live a long and happy life


642
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,250
and may your fortune be as boundless as the East Sea.


643
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,590
Wonderful.


644
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,140
Wonderful.


645
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,690
Don't you feel ashamed to face your wife?


646
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,140
