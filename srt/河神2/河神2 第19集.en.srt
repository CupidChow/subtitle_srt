[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,010
Let's come back to our story and continue.


4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,170
Previously, we talked about


5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,740
Mayor Bai opened the coffers to relieve the anger of the popular discontent.


6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,660
But the coffers were empty.


7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,980
The governor asked Ding Mao to investigate the theft of the gold.


8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,220
Ding Mao inferred that


9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,980
the gold should have been stealthily substituted before it was stored in the coffers.


10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,820
During the investigation,


11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,460
the two parties who were in charge of the thing had never met.


12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,460
Guo Deyou found the Coffin Shop of the Huangs


13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,620
according to the boxes used for delivering the red leeches.


14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,060
But he found Carpenter Huang had died


15
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,580
and his corpse was in the self-sealing coffin.


16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,620
He died of the condemnation of the founder of his lineage.


17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,300
Guo Deyou concluded that


18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,220
the case of Carpenter Huang was related to the one of Nine Statues of Ox.


19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,220
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao went to the place of Director Lin.


20
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,820
They found he hid something.


21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,300
They asked his neighbors


22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,220
and then found there was something wrong with


23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,500
the timeline of the day when the gold bars were stolen.


24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,140
Guo Deyou and Gu Ying found that


25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,300
Carpenter Huang colluded with the grave robber


26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,220
to rob the tombs of his customers,


27
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,580
which ruined their achievements in Hell.


28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,140
It introduced that


29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,940
friends happened to meet in the brothel,


30
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,700
and the top prostitute died on her bed.


31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,780
The two cases are closely related, which leads to another puzzle.


32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,700
Chairman Ding wants to investigate further.


33
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,380
Let's see what's gonna happen.


34
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,780

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,460
Two statues of tiger.

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,700
One statue of rooster.


41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,500
On time

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,460
A man of long experience.


43
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,540
I'm supposed to do it.


44
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,780
I won't drink alcohol.


45

Episode 19


60
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,220
If it's the herbal coffin,


61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,480
when the grave robber digs it out,


62
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,320
even there's nothing in it,


63
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,580
he won't have a loss,


64
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,779
as long as he takes the coffin away.


65
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,050
Do you have it?


66
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,490
I don't have a whole coffin.


67
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,410
But if you want a bracelet


68
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,100
or sculptures of a lion or tiger


69
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,380
made of herbal woods,


70
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,340
I have some.


71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,070
Let me show you.


72
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,909
No. No. No.


73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,320
Well,


74
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
where do you get them?


75
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,470
There...there's a tomb robber


76
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,360
whose last name is Zhang.


77
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,540
He knows well of the sources of the herbal coffins.


78
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,740
His name is


79
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,150
Zhang Cheng...Zhang Cheng what...


80
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,990
Zhuan?


81
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,100
It's him.


82
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,190
Do you know him?


83
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,870
He's the eldest disciple of Philanthropist Li.


84
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,730
The name of Carpenter Huang is Huang Chengzhong.


85
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,690
His name is Zhang Chengzhuan.


86
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,190
They are the generation of "Cheng".


87
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,360
The seniority in their school hierarchy is named


88
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,110
in the order of


89
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,650
"Long, Feng, Cheng, Xiang, Song, Bai, Chang, Qing".


90
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,760
But according to the achievements these disciples have made,


91
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,510
their school might not be inherited to the generation of "Xiang".


92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,850
We wanna


93
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,600
ask Grave Robber Zhang about something.


94
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,970
How could we meet him?


95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,900
Where can you find


96
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,560
a grave robber?


97
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,510
Meet the daylight.


98
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,110
Meet the daylight?


99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,470
Grave robbers can only work at night, can't they?


100
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,390
What scares a grave robber the most


101
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,660
is the daylight.


102
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,770
At twelve thirty at night,


103
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,310
on the 15th of each month,


104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,890
grave robbers burn some paper-made money for some empty coffins.


105
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,450
And peers can meet each other


106
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,540
and exchange their experience.


107
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,330
It's called "meet the daylight".


108
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,020
Why should it be an empty coffin?


109
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,950
All the grave robbers will set up a tomb for themselves.


110
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,870
First, they could boost their courage


111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,220
and they wouldn't be scared of robbing a grave.


112
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,500
Second,


113
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,930
they always rob the tombs of others.


114
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,870
They themselves might die one day,


115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,110
which is called taking precautions beforehand.


116
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,800
Only insiders of a place


117
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,470
would know


118
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,730
where the normal tombs are


119
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,550
while where the empty ones set up by grave robbers for themselves are.


120
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,750
I think you know more than an insider.


121
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,250
Why not lead us the way?


122
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,790
What do you think, Maomao?


123
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,530
Maomao.


124
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,750
What do you think?


125
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,870
Okay. Okay.


126
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,780
Deyou,


127
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,410
do you think we can believe what an evil chicken said?


128
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,690
Since we've been here, we have to have a look.


129
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,360
Go.


130
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,600
Mr. Zhang?


131
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,920
Stop running. Come back.


132
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,730
Don't use concealed weapons, if you dare.


133
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,650
We can have a toe-to-toe fight.


134
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,470
I live neither in the south nor in the north.


135
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,580
I...live neither...


136
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,050
...neither...


137
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
I have nowhere to live.


138
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,380
Deyou, I can't stand this.


139
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,180
Zhang Chengzhuan,


140
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,800
he's visiting his own grave.


141
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,060
Paper money is always shaped like silver ingots,


142
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,450
copper cash, silver, gold or something else.


143
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,300
But,


144
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,290
Sorceress Gu, have a look at it. What's it?


145
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,020
I have no idea. I've never seen it before.


146
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,060
But the one isn't Zhang Chengzhuan.


147
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,600
How...how do you know?


148
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,160
You can smell something clearly when you're facing the wind.


149
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,020
What a strong smell of cosmetics!


150
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,300
You don't smell it, do you?


151
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,220
Yusi,


152
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,360
does my beard look unnatural?


153
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,260
Nope.


154
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,790
Young Master, if I meet you in the street


155
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,280
when you dress up like that,


156
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,950
I'll definitely brush past you.


157
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,500
Don't tell anyone about this,


158
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,650
especially Lanlan.


159
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,760
Rest assured.


160
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,300
What you're gonna do is serious business.


161
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,070
Childe,


162
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,860
I'm not familiar with you.


163
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,320
It's the first time you've come here, isn't it?


164
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,790
Exactly.


165
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,520
Are you coming for


166
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,690
the woman,


167
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,020
or do you need me to recommend one for you?


168
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,350
I'm finding a woman who has a mole on the pit of the stomach.


169
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,420
You mean Yuehong?


170
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,200
If you have enough time to wait.


171
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,060
They're all waiting for her.


172
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,300
If you can't wait,


173
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,360
I can recommend you other women.


174
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,490
I mean, are you here for Yuehong?


175
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,050
It's a woman?


176
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,170
Are you kidding, Sorceress Gu?


177
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,640
Do you think


178
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,600
those who stand within the area of about one meter of Little River God


179
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,650
are all women?


180
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,990
Business first.


181
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,610
It's the business.


182
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,280
Robbing graves is a Yin business.


183
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,650
The Yang Qi of women is so weak that they won't be able to do the business.


184
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,720
Even if the one you saw is a woman,


185
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,130
she definitely won't be a grave robber.


186
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,500
The woman burnt this in front of a grave.


187
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,460
Do you know what it is?


188
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,060
Someone is stealing things. It's a female thief.


189
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,420
Stop running. Chase after her. Come on.


190
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,250
It's a thief. Chase after her.


191
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,270
It's a great thing.


192
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,700
It's a scented tea ticket.


193
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,740
Scented tea ticket?


194
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,890
It's the scented tea ticket of Cangcui House. Oh, gosh.


195
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,920
Where's the female thief?


196
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,130
Why haven't I seen her?


197
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,090
Is the one who attacked us in front of the grave


198
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,840
a female thief?


199
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,010
Ying,


200
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,610
I am wrong about you.


201
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,570
Hurry and


202
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,690
go investigate it there.


203
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
She won't be able to run away.


204
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,640
You can go on.


205
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,800
If a prostitute in a brothel


206
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,970
meets a man who she has a thing for,


207
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,210
she will give him a scented tea ticket like this.


208
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,130
Then the man won't have to wait in line


209
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,350
when he goes to the brothel next time.


210
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,140
He won't have to pay for the tea either.


211
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,960
But the money he pays for the tea isn't a big deal.


212
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,010
I...I did see a shadow,


213
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,230
but she had run away.


214
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,380
Have you seen her?


215
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,250
She's there.


216
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,310
She's there.


217
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,150
Are you kidding me?


218
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,820
I haven't expected the female thief is too crafty.


219
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,420
She even has a partner.


220
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,490
They're playing hide-and-seek with us.


221
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,540
You're worng.


222
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,550
They're plaguing us by imaginary fears.


223
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,620
Sorceress Gu, I know you're an expert in breaking through a formation.


224
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,180
Hurry and catch her unawares.


225
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,390
She'll be utterly destroyed.


226
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,340
Be careful, Ying.


227
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,580
What matters?


228
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,630
This way.


229
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,890
The scented tea ticket can only be present


230
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,320
by the prostitute herself.


231
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,390
The brothel and procuress can't make the call.


232
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,930
What do you mean?


233
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,980
Those who can have scented tea tickets


234
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,640
must be popular among childes,


235
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,910
even though they're not the top ones.


236
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,080
In a brothel,


237
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,390
money doesn't talk,


238
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,430
but the scented tea ticket


239
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,420
in the pocket does.


240
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Little River God,


241
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,900
I think you've got


242
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,020
such a great thing this time.


243
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,140
What did you get?


244
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,050
I haven't expected


245
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,570
that female thief is the key to the case.


246
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,580
Whether I can take my revenge on the murderer of my master


247
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,500
depends on whether I can catch her.


248
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,560
It's a pity that I'm not able to leap onto roofs and vault over walls.


249
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,050
So, please help me, Sorceress Gu.


250
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,610
I'm leaving.


251
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,560
I'm about to find other clues.


252
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,060
Well,


253
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,530
Sorceress Gu is working so hard on the case,


254
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,220
so you should take care of the midnight snack.


255
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,640
A midnight snack? Let's go.


256
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,000
Is steamed creamy custard bun okay?


257
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,470
Pig elbows are better.


258
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,660
Pig elbows.


259
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,880
You're coming, Childe.


260
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,880
The old tradition again.


261
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,740
You want Yuehong again?


262
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,780
Please wait in patience.


263
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,700
You're the next one.


264
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,650
People who come here


265
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,990
should line up, shouldn't they?


266
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,000
It's so easy for you to say so.


267
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,110
He has a scented tea ticket.


268
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,710
Do you have one?


269
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,210
It won't take long.


270
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,020
Hurry up.


271
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,790
Why are you here?


272
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,369
Investigate the case.


273
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,270
Investigate the case.


274
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,089
You investigate the case in that?


275
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,940
I...I...


276
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,050
My...my...


277
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,359
my master has just passed away and it's still in the shivah.


278
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,339
Besides, I'm engaged.


279
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,369
I...


280
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,180
What about you?


281
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,490
I...


282
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,369
I'm both the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce


283
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,710
and the Secretary General.


284
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,820
It's normal.


285
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,560
I recall when we came here for the first time,


286
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,720
we had fun and enjoyed the food here,


287
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,190
which is so great.


288
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,600
I mean,


289
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,090
the one who had fun and enjoyed the food here when he first came here


290
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,930
was you.


291
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,330
I merely had a sleep here.


292
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,810
And I paid the bill.


293
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,670
I


294
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,810
don't like to owe anyone.


295
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,690
It's almost the time.


296
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,710
Let's go.


297
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,540
What?


298
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,460
We're going together.


299
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,070
You prefer this.


300
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,070
It's fine.


301
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,630
Let's go.


302
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,720
The boss of the steamed bun restaurant said


303
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,190
the one who bought steamed buns


304
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,050
isn't someone from an ordinary family.


305
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,610
So I start with a brothel.


306
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,310
Stop saying nonsense.


307
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,190
Where could we find


308
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,600
a woman who wore a cheongsam that couldn't cover her chest outside a brothel?


309
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,670
We both find the clues about Yuehong,


310
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,080
when you investigated Director Lin


311
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
and I investigated Carpenter Huang.


312
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,830
So...


313
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,110
Yuehong.


314
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,450
Maybe


315
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,650
the case of Carpenter Huang and the bank robbery


316
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,090
are closely related.


317
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,970
Yuehong.


318
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,590
Hurry and open the door.


319
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,870
Stop losing your temper.


320
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,870
What are you doing?


321
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,330
Don't you know the rules?


322
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,100
Move away. Move away. Move away.


323
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,110
Guo Deyou.


324
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,030
What's up? What's up?


325
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,780
Why are you shouting here?


326
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,320
Why do you come to a brothel since you're a woman?


327
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,810
I'm here for my man. Where should I go?


328
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,630
There're so many men here. Which one is the one you're finding?


329
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,280
What's up? What are you doing?


330
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,370
What are you doing?


331
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,860
Dude.


332
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,100
Swordswoman, this way please.


333
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,010
Dude, are you okay?


334
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,910
Swordswoman.


335
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,010
What's going on?


336
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,140
Swordswoman. Swordswoman.


337
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,900
What are you doing?


338
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


339
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,340
I'm sorry, Dude.


340
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,180
Are you out of your mind? -I'm sorry.


341
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,650
I'm sorry.


342
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,580
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.


343
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,040
Swordswoman.


344
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


345
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,070
Who are you? Get out.


346
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


347
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,000
Swordswoman.


348
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,700
What are you doing?


349
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,420
What are you doing?


350
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


351
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,720
Move away.


352
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,550
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


353
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,450
I'm sorry.


354
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,440
Swordswoman.


355
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,550
What are you doing?


356
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,280
Stop there.


357
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,310
Swordswoman.


358
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,110
Could you please stop? Stop, please, Swordswoman.


359
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,180
Guo Deyou.


360
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
Why is she coming?


361
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,330
It's fine. Calm down.


362
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,290
It's gonna be fine.


363
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,340
Even our fathers can't recognize us since we dressed up like this.


364
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,430
Why should we be scared?


365
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,540
Yeah, we don't have to be scared. We don't have to.


366
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,380
I'm not scared.


367
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,460
I'm not scared.


368
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,700
I'm not.


369
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,450
I...


370
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,970
Swordswoman. Swordswoman.


371
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,210
Swordswoman. Swordswoman. Swordswoman.


372
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,230
Swordswoman. Swordswoman. Stop. Stop.


373
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,000
Even though you've dressed up like this,


374
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,580
do you think I'm not able to smell the funk of Dragon King Temple?


375
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,340
Don't be anxious.


376
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,030
You asked me to catch the female thief


377
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,440
while you came to meet her here?


378
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,090
Ding Mao,


379
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,750
I haven't expected you're such a man.


380
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,000
I told you I wouldn't like to come here over and over.


381
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,730
But you brought me here anyhow.


382
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,310
I...


383
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,970
Rich persons like you are all bad guys.


384
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,050
Ying, listen to me.


385
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,110
It's totally different from


386
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,100
what you've witnessed.


387
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,510
You two are the same.


388
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,250
What have you done?


389
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,750
Why is she dead, Deyou?


390
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,110
It's kinda complicated. It's complicated.


391
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,030
Enough.


392
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,210
Don't get us wrong. We're here to investigate the case.


393
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,490
Right. We're investigating the case.


394
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,350
Waiter, come here.


395
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,250
Is she Yuehong?


396
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,790
Yes, she is.


397
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,440
That's where the murderer escaped.


398
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,400
And he's injured.


399
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,900
Maybe it's caused by the fight against the dead.


400
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,720
Yuehong.


401
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,240
You've met with a tragic death.


402
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,530
Sis, have some water first.


403
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,640
It's...


404
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,630
What a sin it is!


405
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,570
She died of the condemnation of the founder of her lineage.


406
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,540
Why do you say so?


407
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,590
Is there anything special?


408
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,790
There's Powder of Harmony between Yin and Yang in the tea pot.


409
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,390
I smelt it just now.


410
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,310
There are at least eight or ten bags of it in it.


411
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,470
who can stand


412
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,450
such a big dose?


413
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,950
My poor girl.


414
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,020
In our industry, a death like this


415
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,960
is called a carefree journey.


416
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,890
What's the ...Powder of Harmony...between Yin and Yang?


417
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,780
It's an aphrodisiac.


418
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,820
Or some kind of beverage.


419
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,060
The rules are broken.


420
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,980
It's the retribution.


421
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,900
What rules has she broken


422
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,370
so that she died of the condemnation of the founder of her lineage?


423
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,490
Yuehong


424
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,340
has a long-term lover outside the brothel.


425
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,650
She even refused to serve other customers because of the man.


426
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,860
She even gave the man a scented tea ticket.


427
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,210
She lost in her daydream that


428
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,610
the man would redeem her.


429
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,850
When I complained to her,


430
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,610
she always gave me something valuable to bribe me.


431
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,820
You know it.


432
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,490
The insiders in our industry


433
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,980
won't say no to money.


434
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,200
Okay.


435
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,080
I would regard she was kept by a man as a mistress for a long term.


436
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,130
Is the jade cicada


437
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,470
presented by her?


438
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,680
How do you know it?


439
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,790
How do you know it?


440
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,390
Who on earth are you?


441
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,740
When did you come in?


442
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,410
It seems the two cases should be merged together.


443
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,730
If I continue the investigation of the nine statues of ox,


444
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,530
maybe I'll be able to find the gold for you.


445
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,250
I won't trouble you.


446
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,470
I'll keep finding the gold


447
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,520
and maybe I can also find out the murderer of the nine statues of ox case.


448
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,870
Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo.


449
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,210
Have a look at it.


450
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,150
These things were broken by Miss Gu.


451
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,160
Have a look at it.


452
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,480
These things are not that expensive,


453
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,080
but


454
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,000
even if I don't ask you to compensate,


455
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,370
you'll compensate for it anyway


456
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,970
since


457
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,230
you're such a noble.


458
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,460
You should pay more or less, shouldn't you?


459
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,670
Look at


460
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,950
my subordinates who were injured.


461
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,430
I won't ask you to pay the medical fees for them,


462
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,280
They deserve it,


463
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,030
because they were unable to recognize such a violent swordswoman.


464
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,020
Who do you think is violent?


465
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,000
The price of a lame vase


466
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,110
overwhelms what I pay for my meals in a restaurant for the rest of the year.


467
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,840
Who do you think is violent?


468
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,790
Sis.


469
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,260
Lady.


470
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,240
The bill...


471
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,650
The bill...


472
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,380
Well,


473
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,430
well,


474
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,540
I'm about to notice the police station


475
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,690
and they will come to survey the scene.


476
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,040
So you should maintain what it is now.


477
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,470
As for the bill,


478
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,250
I'll send someone to pay the bill.


479
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,970
See. See.


480
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,510
A person of rank and status


481
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,980
is so generous.


482
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,670
A generous man doesn't care about trifles, does he?


483
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,080
You're so different from someone


484
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,020
who even wanted to share a scented tea ticket, even though he had got one himself.


485
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,130
What a terrible taste he has!


486
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,820
A scented... tea ticket?


487
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,260
A scented what?


488
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,970
You're leaving?


489
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,960
Secretary General, I'm seeing you off.


490
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,110
You'd better come here early next time.


491
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,640
What are you looking at?


492
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,490
Go and do whatever you should do.


493
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,240
Is there


494
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,440
anything wrong,


495
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,000
or do you forget to tell me anything?


496
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,900
I've told you everything.


497
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,230
Then I'll ask you one more time.


498
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,880
When did the milkman send you the milk?


499
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,730
At twenty to five.


500
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,500
When did you receive the gold?


501
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,650
At thirty past five.


502
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,820
The milkman gets up


503
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,560
when he hears the sounds of chopping in the steamed bun restaurant every day


504
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,520
and then he will send you the milk.


505
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,270
But that day, the steamed bun restaurant started business half an hour earlier than usual.


506
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,440
So he also sent you the milk half an hour earlier.


507
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,110
The time you got your milk


508
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,240
was about ten past four.


509
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,720
And you could set out at thirty past four.


510
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,930
So when you arrived at the place of receiving the gold


511
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,940
from your home


512
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,520
would be twenty to five at most.


513
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,380
The watch.


514
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,040
There was something wrong with my watch.


515
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,050
You said you would set your watch when you passed by the Big Clock every day.


516
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,590
If there had been something wrong with your watch,


517
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,120
why wouldn't you have found it?


518
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,940
You should have known it was half an hour earlier.


519
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,030
Why would you still go to receive the gold?


520
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,100
And you did receive the gold.


521
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,210
Why?


522
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,520
If you tell me the truth,


523
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,920
I might be able to help you out.


524
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,050
Think about it carefully.


525
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,060
You have a big family to support.


526
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,740
Sit down, please.


527
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,380
That morning,


528
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,070
I did feel it was a bit earlier than usual.


529
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,820
When I passed by the Big Clock, I was about to set my watch.


530
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,280
The street in Tientsin is so narrow


531
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,890
that I can meet you here.


532
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,000
Where's the money?


533
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,690
What?


534
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,480
You had fun with a prostitute without paying the bill.


535
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,400
A man like you


536
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,060
doesn't have any pocket money, does he?


537
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,460
Come on. Give me the money.


538
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,160
You've got the wrong person.


539
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,100
Don't pretend not to know me, Mr. Lin.


540
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,730
How could I confuse you with anyone else?


541
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,710
Even though I confuse your appearance,


542
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,210
I know well of your body.


543
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,510
Do you have a birthmark on your butt?


544
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,750
No, I don't.


545
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,030
Hurry and take off your pants. Then I can have a check.


546
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,050
How come you're taking off my pants?


547
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,960
Take off your pants, and then I can have a check.


548
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,730
Are...you out of your mind?


549
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,770
Pay back the money.


550
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,860
What are you looking at? Leave.


551
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,330
You're sick.


552
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,960
So I didn't set my watch that day.


553
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,880
The details of the timeline are minor.


554
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,380
You're in charge of the inspection of gold bars for storage.


555
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,900
You must have found


556
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,560
things in the box weren't the gold bars


557
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,230
but dry ice.


558
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,910
But you still wrote a deposit receipt


559
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,220
to that fake military officer.


560
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,880
So


561
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,950
If you did open the box and inspect the gold bars,


562
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
it means


563
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,840
you would be one of them.


564
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,310
No, I'm not.


565
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,320
I found something immediately that day.


566
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,200
There was someone who had done something to me.


567
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,790
Do you mean the time?


568
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,030
I'm not talking about the time alone.


569
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,950
And my stomach.


570
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,610
Your stomach?


571
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,400
When I was walking in the street that day,


572
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,070
I felt there's something wrong with my stomach all the way.


573
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,610
I was afraid I would delay the receiving of the gold bars,


574
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,270
so I didn't go to the loo.


575
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,280
I was suffering from the stomach pains


576
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,270
all the way.


577
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,190
I was looking forward to getting to the bank as soon as possible.


578
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,220
Officer.


579
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,220
That officer


580
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,780
seemed to waste the time on purpose.


581
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,080
He was dilatory in doing everything.


582
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,000
I couldn't stand any longer.


583
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,540
So...


584
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,140
Officer,


585
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,760
it's what Mayor Bai and Commander-in-chief Wu


586
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,790
have specially asked for.


587
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,770
Let's skip some minor procedures, shall we?


588
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,730
Put them in storage.


589
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,150
Did you eat anything special that day?


590
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,110
Why did you have loose bowels?


591
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,160
I ate nothing.


592
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,610
I used to drink a bottle of milk early in the morning.


593
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,590
Secretary General Ding,


594
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,060
I know


595
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,490
the theft of coffers is gross negligence.


596
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,310
That's a box of gold bars.


597
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,210
I won't be able to compensate even at the cost of my whole family.


598
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,000
It's my fault that I lied.


599
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,180
Secretary General Ding,


600
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,550
I'm begging you.


601
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,410
It's so hard for me to get where I am.


602
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,440
Please forgive me.


603
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,170
Please let me go.


604
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,990
Could you please keep it to yourself?


605
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,489
If there's someone who took advantage of you


606
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,409
to steal the gold bars,


607
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,969
I would definitely catch him.


608
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,250
But I won't cover for you.


609
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,420
Don't come here.


610
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,880
When I come to Tientsin,


611
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,950
what scares me the most is that people will look down upon me.


612
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,890
I don't want my families


613
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,300
to be despised.


614
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,540
The gold bars are missing.


615
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,650
If you keep investigating it,


616
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,570
I won't be exonerated.


617
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,050
Please leave now.


618
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,540
I want to die in a decent way.


619
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,010
Okay.


620
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,190
The gold bars aren't missing for real.


621
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,320
We could find them back.


622
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,920
I can help you.


623
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,030
If you lose your job,


624
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,430
we can find a more decent one.


625
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,200
The Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce...


626
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,270
the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce happens to


627
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,790
need someone who's experienced in banking management.


628
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,190
I hope the man


629
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,450
can be upright,


630
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,650
who can stick to himself,


631
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,300
no matter how much money he handles.


632
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,340
A man like this can be regard as a decent person.


633
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,140
How about it?


634
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,430
Are you interested in the position?


635
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,180
What I said


636
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,950
is true.


637
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,540
It's a spicy flavor.


638
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,720
The women in the Cangcui House would like it.


639
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,700
Are you kidding?


640
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,580
I, who is an extraordinary and specially privileged person,


641
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,120
pick it for you in person.


642
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,080
Who else would deserve it?


643
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,760
The one who deserves it


644
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,980
must be as gorgeous


645
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,260
and dazzlingly beautiful


646
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,280
as a national beauty.


647
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,320
Although you're not that pretty,


648
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,010
the charm of you


649
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,950
overwhelms me.


650
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,500
Just like the fried dough twists,


651
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,150
you can feel how delicious they are, as long as you have more tastes.


652
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:11,860
Come in.


653
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,450
Oops! Oops! Oops!


654
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,570
I'm inadequate to discipline my daughter.


655
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,340
I'm inadequate to discipline my daughter,


656
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,620
which offends you.


657
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,310
Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me.


658
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,550
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.


659
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,340
Forgive...forgive...


660
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,090
I have something to ask you.


661
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,710
It's not for me, is it?


662
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,400
A yellow weasel is coming in.


663
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,750
Listen to what you're saying.


664
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,250
How could you compare yourself to a chicken?


665
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:51,960
Stop.


666
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,030
Philanthropist Li only received four disciples


667
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,650
in total in Tientsin.


668
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,880
Two of them are lame, who are a man and woman respectively.


669
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,090
They harbor evil intentions.


670
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,270
When they were being apprentices,


671
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,800
the two of them played around together.


672
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,890
Later,


673
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,750
they stole the family heirloom of Philanthropist Li


674
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,900
and ran away.


675
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,560
And then,


676
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,590
the man started the business


677
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,190
of being a grave robber,


678
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,560
which was villainous.


679
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,220
While the woman


680
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,880
became a prostitute in a brothel.


681
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,830
In a word, neither of them had a happy ending.


682
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,240
It seems to be right.


683
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,290
One of the two disciples


684
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,660
is Grave Robber Zhang


685
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,200
while the other


686
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,240
is Yuehong.


687
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,100
How do you know it?


688
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,020
If a corpse is put in the coffin with jade in the nine parts of it,


689
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,320
the body of the dead person won't decay.


690
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,690
The Jiuqiao Jade?


691
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,640
The Jiuqiao Jade tends to be made in the shape of a cicada.


692
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,050
Think about it.


693
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,980
The jade cicada of that procuress...


694
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,200
-Is re-carved


695
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,570
with a gold pedestal,


696
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,360
but the shape of it is still a cicada.


697
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,450
Exactly.


698
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,690
Jade Cicada is something


699
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,710
in the mouth of a dead person.


700
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,080
How could anyone else get it, except a grave robber?


701
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,980
Carpenter Huang, Yuehong and Grave Robber Zhang,


702
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,120
they did the business of recycling herbal coffins.


703
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,190
So Yuehong could bribe the procuress with burial objects.


704
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,880
Well,


705
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,480
have a look at this.


706
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,690
Hurry...hurry...hurry...hurry


707
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,970
and throw it away.


708
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,760
Throw it away.


709
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,600
What's it?


710
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,260
One-inch Wood.


711
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,540
One-inch Wood?


712
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,460
There are four schools of grave robbers...


713
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,680
-Which are Banshan, Xieling, Faqiu and Mojin.


714
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,160
If you wanna ask more...


715
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,830
You...


716
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,620
...you know well of it, don't you?


717
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,050
No, I don't.


718
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,970
I don't.


719
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,510
You please.


720
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,170
Among the four schools of grave robbers,


721
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,730
the Banshan has the cruelest punishment.


722
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,590
When several grave robbers work together,


723
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,790
they'll have to move the stones which block the way towards a tomb away together.


724
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,480
Whoever becomes a betrayer


725
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,970
or embezzles the money


726
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,080
has to swallow the stones


727
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,390
inch by inch,


728
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,200
which is called filling the path leading to a grave.


729
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,700
Swallow the stones?


730
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,360
How?


731
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,200
Through his anal.


732
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,530
The stones will be plugged into his body through his anal until his belly is full.


733
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,080
The One-inch Wood


734
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,510
is used to punish someone by the founder.


735
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,640
It's the condemnation of the founder again.


736
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,560
If people from all walks of life


737
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,550
should be punished,


738
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,470
there will be a huge mess in Tientsin.


739
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,590
One may draw a tiger in so far as its skin， but it is hard to draw its bones.


740
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,570
One may know a man's face, but it is difficult to know his heart.


741
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,470
I mean,


742
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,200
Grave Robber Zhang and Yuehong


743
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,250
are a secret couple, which can't be known to all.


744
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,910
They colluded with Carpenter Huang


745
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,600
to do the unconscionable trade of second-hand coffins.


746
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,620
However,


747
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,610
the three of them failed to share the booty evenly and the couple wanted to kill the other.


748
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,820
The blood spattered the coffin shop


749
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,930
and Carpenter Huang died in a self-sealing coffin.


750
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,260
Men die in pursuit of wealth while birds die in pursuit of food.


751
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,210
Husband and wife felt estranged while friends killed one another.


752
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,570
Grave Robber Zhang had killed Carpenter Huang,


753
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,370
and he wanted to kill Yuehong too.


754
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,500
Yuehong picked up a fierce fight against him when she was dying.


755
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,000
Grave Robber Zhang was injured and he ran away,


756
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,840
so his blood was found on the window.


757
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,610
That's all?


758
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,510
If you wanna know what happened later, please wait and


759
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,620
listen to the next episode.


760
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,990
Don't keep us in suspense.


761
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,650
Do you know what happened later?


762
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,560
Nope. I feel it's so strange.


763
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,140
Why is the condemnation of a founder


764
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,550
so eye-catching?


765
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,530
Aren't the
nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster


766
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,330
more attractive?


767
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,310
If it's committed by a man,


768
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,910
then he slanders someone else.


769
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,870
Who else could he slander


770
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,770
but a founder?


771
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,920
A founder doesn't offend anyone else.


772
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,340
Do you think it's related to the two statues of tiger?


773
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,230
What's your opinion?


774
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,570
There're so many founders of all walks of life,


775
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,260
but no one could outweigh the Sixty Gods.


776
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,790
The Sixty Gods?


777
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,780
Among the Sixty Gods,


778
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,060
the first two are


779
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,750
Chen Cai and Geng Zhang.


780
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,600
One is the hero who fought against a tiger


781
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,480
while the other is Bingyin God.


782
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,150
Both of them are related to a tiger.


783
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,170
When the case of the
nine statues of ox is done,


784
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,320
it's the turn of two statues of tiger, isn't it?


785
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,570
Even a stupid donkey can find some fresh grass.


786
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,300
Who are you calling a silly donkey?!


787
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:54,960
Of course not.


788
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,630
I always think


789
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,160
there's something missing.


790
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,120
Think about it.


791
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,170
In such a complicated serial case,


792
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,450
the part of two statues of tiger followed the one of nine statues of ox closely,


793
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,240
which is also related to the


794
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,010
theft of the gold bars investigated by Ding Mao.


795
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,330
Grave Robber Zhang, Yuehong and Carpenter Huang


796
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,920
wouldn't be able to make it.


797
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:14,860
Mother,


798
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,230
besides Carpenter Huang Chengzhong,


799
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,150
and the grave robber and the prostitute


800
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,490
who are the two betrayers,


801
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,730
does Philanthropist Li have other disciples?


802
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,760
The carpenter has a junior fellow apprentice.


803
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,900
His name is


804
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,630
Liu Chengmao.


805
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,760
You won't know


806
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,070
how smart the man is.


807
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,470
But he paid less attention to his job.


808
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,610
He used to go downhill


809
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,340
to sing a song or watch a play.


810
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,320
He learnt how to make leather drums


811
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,310
from Philanthropist Li


812
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,420
and then joined a Chinese shadow puppetry troupe.


813
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,150
He went to play the Chinese shadow puppetry.


814
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,210
An old saying says that there will be no laggard one among the children of a brave or talented man.


815
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,050
Li Fengcheng is kind and focuses on charity in his life,


816
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,050
but he still has some lame disciples.


817
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,100
What do you mean lame?


818
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,280
A sorceress is good at some special dances.


819
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,880
A cobbler is good at making leather drums.


820
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,090
It's normal, isn't it?


821
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,140
Move. Move. Move. Move to the other side.


822
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,570
Move. Move. Move. Move. Move. Move.


823
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,880
What the hell do you know?


824
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,350
You're talking nonsense.


825
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:21,970
What are you gonna do?


826
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,870
Watch a Chinese shadow puppetry.


827
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:23,960
What do you intend to do?


828
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,680
What do you intend to do? What do you intend to do?


829
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,220
What do you intend to do?


830
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,200
Where are you going?


831
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,300
When was the last time


832
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,260
you saw Cobbler Liu?


833
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,440
A few days ago.


834
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,420
He drank some alcohol


835
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,020
and then showed off in front of me.


836
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,810
He said he made a fortune,


837
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,780
and he would buy my troupe later.


838
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,600
And he would also make shadow puppets of Liu Bei, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu for me


839
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,310
to requite me for my kindness over these years.


840
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,640
But in the end, I've never seen him.


841
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,130
He made a fortune?


842
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,280
Don't let me meet him again.


843
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,480
He made a fortune?


844
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,760
He has messed things up in my troupe over the years.


845
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,940
I have to find him to compensate me for the money I lost in these years.


846
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,000
That's the thread made of deer's sinew


847
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,150
which is used for measuring leather.


848
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,390
Is there anything special about it?


849
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,120
Scrape the sinew of roadster deer, deer or jail clearly


850
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,400
and dry it in the sun.


851
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,580
And then strike it to a soft one by a wooden mallet


852
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,920
and twist it to a thread.


853
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,140
It's simple to describe the process.


854
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,860
It becomes hard when it meets fire.


855
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,910
And it becomes sticky when it meets water.


856
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,770
An ordinary person won't be able to make it.


857
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,180
It can only be made by an exquisite cobbler.


858
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,740
Boss, have a look at the newly-coming leather.


859
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,080
Sure. I'm coming.


860
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,800
I said something wrong to you.


861
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,900
Maybe it's Cobbler Liu


862
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,800
who killed Yuehong.
