[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
Let's go back to the main story and continue.


4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,510
Previously, we talked about


5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,710
Tientsin guards searched and arrested Rong Aoshuang in the city.


6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,800
Ding Mao searched archives.


7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,000
Yusi extorted a confession from the official of the Ministry of Health.


8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,920
All people gathered and summarized clues in the Dragon King Temple.


9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,760
Then they learned that the hydraulic expert Siegmund


10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,230
was involved in all conspiracies,


11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,150
and the curve cut-off was


12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,360
a fraud to make Tientsin chaotic.


13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,390
Guo Deyou went to the physiotherapy clinic again


14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,790
and found Shangshui stones


15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,280
that he once saw in the refugee camp in the physiotherapy clinic.


16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,200
Guo Deyou learned the anecdote of praying for water


17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,840
of Tientsin folk sacrifice from Boss Lu.


18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,750
Ding Mao went to the Japanese restaurant


19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,240
to question Siegmund.


20
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,040
Siegmund hinted that Xiao Lanlan was in danger.


21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,880
Guo Deyou used his power


22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,840
and led others to find the shrine in which Xiao Lanlan was.


23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,360
At this time, Rong Aoshuang was holding a sacrifice ceremony.


24
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,470
All people rushed to the scene, and Rong Aoshuang wanted to control Ding Mao.


25
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,310
But Guo Deyou and Ding Mao had long broken the seal,


26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,680
so Rong Aoshuang died on the spot.


27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,310
At this time, the four doors of the shrine were closed, and fire was raging.


28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,120
Everyone tried their best


29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,590
to save Xiao Lanlan.


30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,910
In this case,


31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,120
the hero, new talent in the God world cut his wrist.


32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,160
One rooster suddenly appeared, while a group of demons came out together.


33
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,950
Since then,


34
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,190
River God has never appeared.


35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,000
Captain, are you OK?


36
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,039
Deyou, are you OK?


37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,509
Deyou, do you feel better?


38
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,190
Captain.


39
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,590
Captain, what's wrong with you?


40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,440
Wait for me.


41
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,080
Captain.


42
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,440
Have a rest. Have a rest.


43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,590
Captain Fu, are you OK?


44
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,590
Well, go away.


45
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,550
Look over there!


46
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,190
Captain.


47
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,190
What are you doing?


48
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,270
I need to expel the smoke from his lung.


49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,229
Thank you for your help.


50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,190
Thank you.


51
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,950
Your punch helped me a lot. Good job.


52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,680
Captain Fu, look over there again.


53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,160
No need. It hurts.


54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,949
Give me a light. Give me a light.


55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
It's important. Go.


56
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,110
Do you feel better?


57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Do you still need my help?


58
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,600
No. No.


59
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,270
Come on.


60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,750
Well, move your limbs.


61
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,880
Check whether any part can't move or not.


62
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Confucius said: "Yao is great


63
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,240
and noble


64
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,630
as a monarch. Only the heaven is the highest and biggest, but only Yao can learn from it."


65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,550
As a monarch.


66
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,880
A monarch...


67
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,750
River God.


68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,880
River God.


69
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,630
River God.


70
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,270
River God.


71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,110
River God.


72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,160
River God.


73
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,360
River God.


74
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,550
River God.


75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,960
River God.


76
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,390
River God.


77
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,520
River God.


78
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,630
River God.


79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,800
River God.


80
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,440
River God.


81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Tientsin Mystic 2


82
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,040
Episode 24


83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,920
A monarch...


84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,720
Tiber isn't Rong Aoshuang


85
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,040
but Fan Junyao.


86
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,320
Junyao.


87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,270
"â€¦as a monarch"


88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,790
is from "Tiber."


89
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:44,920
[Phosphate fertilizer]


90
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,159
That well is here.


91
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,000
Those people sacrificed the woman


92
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,790
who was born in the year of water,


93
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,480
namely Fan Junyao's mother here.


94
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,510
Is that a joke?


95
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,320
I heard from my family members that


96
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,670
the Fans went to Deutsche,


97
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,640
so Fan Junyao had been separated from his family members


98
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,040
and trained from Siegmund since then.


99
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,920
Both he and Rong Aoshuang


100
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,880
were dispatched by Gutenberg Association


101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,320
to China on mission.


102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,600
Rong Aoshuang's patients are all dignitaries.


103
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,790
She collected a lot of information for Gutenberg Association


104
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,600
by virtue of the mind control method Silver Bell Seal.


105
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,790
We were fooled.


106
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,830
Fan Junyao was ill-disposed from the very beginning.


107
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,440
Those men of few words always hatch sinister plots.


108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,440
How did you know these?


109
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,510
A girl who has lived in Deutsche since childhood


110
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,760
took her father's ashes back for burial.


111
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,550
Her father


112
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,790
was a servant


113
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,720
who went to Deutsche with Fan Junyao.


114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,550
She wanted to


115
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,480
have a look at the place where her father lived,


116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,230
but Fan's old house behind my house


117
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,110
was demolished long ago.


118
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,390
That girl from Deutsche found my house


119
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,320
and then knew that I'm Fan Junyao's cousin,


120
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,070
so she talked about matters of the Fan family with me.


121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,230
Her father told her these.


122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,320
So Fan Junyao took used Rong Aoshuang


123
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,160
to gather and burn those who worshiped nine oxen,


124
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,790
two tigers and one rooster


125
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,230
to revenge his mother?


126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,320
That girl from Deutsche came back


127
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,040
right after they died,


128
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,640
and as soon as you knew these,


129
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
you were caught.


130
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,920
Don't you think it's a coincidence?


131
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,110
But much more people were related to nine statues of ox,


132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,830
two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster.


133
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,880
Is he going to burn all the people to death?


134
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,400
He has so many white phosphorus bombs.


135
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,590
Why didn't he use white phosphorus bombs?


136
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,280
What else will he use them for?


137
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
If I were him,


138
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,200
I would use them in the Dragon King Fair.


139
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,710
1. 2. 3.


140
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,760
1. 2. 3.


141
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,880
1. 2. 3.


142
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,030
1. 2. 3.


143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,350
1. 2. 3.


144
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,550
Excuse me, can I hang the dragon lanterns here?


145
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,110
Yes.


146
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,520
Please have a look.


147
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,110
I don't want to hang them


148
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,080
in the wrong direction


149
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
and offend the Dragon King.


150
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,550
Just move them a little towards southwest.


151
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
Move dragon lanterns 2 cun towards southwest.


152
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,790
We are here to pray for rain and water!


153
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,350
Dragon King, please bring us happiness!


154
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,910
Here, Tientsin people sincerely sacrifice 9 dragon ships,


155
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,670
54 salutes


156
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,000
and 108 incandescent lights


157
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:55,230
to beg Dragon King to give us rain!


158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,640
Five Dragon Kings, please create lightning and wind


159
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,440
and widely make rain to assist Thunder God.


160
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:15,320
Water is the most essential in the world.


161
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,080
I use my charm to order you


162
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,520
to make the sun disappear and create rain now.


163
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:36,350
Dragons come out and then it thunders.


164
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,520
Fire the salutes.


165
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,400
Blessed rain falls.


166
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,670
Play the thunder drums.


167
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,280
Sacrifice dance begins.


168
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,910
Miss Xiao,


169
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,030
3 dragon ships have passed.


170
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,110
There are still 6 ones.


171
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,440
Is it reliable?


172
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,760
Are you sure the ship they boarded


173
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,000
is the one with white phosphorus bombs?


174
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,280
If that ship reaches the wharf


175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,880
and then explodes,


176
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,350
tens of thousands of people


177
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,150
who came for the Dragon King Fair,


178
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,280
including us


179
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,760
will all die,


180
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,080
so our plan must be perfect.


181
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,790
No problem.


182
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,080
Believe them.


183
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,440
They have been there by boat,


184
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,000
and brothers are also ready.


185
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,470
Once the gun is fired, they will come out from water.


186
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,110
You're indeed capable as you've made so many white phosphorus bombs,


187
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,960
but it was inevitable to bribe the wharf porters


188
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,470
for transferring the white phosphorus bomb launcher made in Deutsche


189
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,110
to the dragon ship and disguising it as a red paperpopper.


190
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,400
Of course we couldn't find it out in public,


191
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,590
but Yusi is well-connected in secret.


192
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,350
Sorceress Zhang would be absolutely asked for help


193
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,470
for Tientsin guards' such a large-scale sacrificial event,


194
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,470
so she must know that


195
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,200
a performance team was replaced temporarily.


196
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,150
What's more, this performance team


197
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,880
would neither perform lion dances nor walk on stilts


198
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,910
but brought so many cases of props,


199
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,520
so these cases


200
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,710
must be filled with white phosphorus bombs.


201
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,400
Therefore, as long as we knew which ship this team


202
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,880
would perform on,


203
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,080
we could know which ship has white phosphorus bombs.


204
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,080
A question


205
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,550
has pestered me for a long time.


206
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,080
Did you think about it?


207
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,150
Why was dragon included in the 12 zodiac animals?


208
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,670
Back then,


209
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,030
dragon might be an ordinary existence


210
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,400
as other 11 animals.


211
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,960
Since ancient times,


212
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,590
China and foreign countries had many records about the appearance of dragons.


213
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,960
Is the dragon really a legend?


214
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,230
Maybe there is a living vaccine that


215
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,790
can break the barriers among species


216
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,670
and make one creature simultaneously have


217
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,000
antlers,


218
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
camel's head,


219
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,080
rabbit's eyes,


220
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,110
snake's neck,


221
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,790
clam's belly,


222
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,710
eagle's claws,


223
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,840
bull's ears,


224
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,230
tiger's palms


225
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,840
and fish scales.


226
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,440
Beast!


227
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,000
What about human?


228
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,150
Can we grow wings and fly to the sky?


229
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,069
Can we dive into the deep sea


230
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,000
like fish?


231
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,920
Go to control the rudder


232
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,760
to keep the ship away from the wharf as far as possible.


233
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,760
Which ship is this?


234
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,400
Let me count.


235
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,590
Deer. Camel. Rabbit. Snake.


236
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,190
Clam. Eagle. Fish. Ox. Tiger.


237
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,920
The tiger-head ship is the last one.


238
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,040
Look!


239
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,430
The tiger-head ship is coming. That's the tiger-head ship.


240
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,190
I also have lots of questions for you.


241
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,520
But,


242
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,110
it's not the right time to ask now.


243
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,520
I'll ask you


244
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
in the prison.


245
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,920
You have doubted me


246
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,000
and listed my doubtful points one by one.


247
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,470
You were right.


248
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,800
Why didn't you stick to them?


249
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,920
Because I once helped Guo Deyou?


250
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,830
Because I said I liked Xiao Lanlan?


251
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,950
Fortunately, Tientsin people worship nine oxen, two tigers and one rooster,


252
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,400
not those 36 heavenly generals,


253
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,830
72 earthly soldiers and the like.


254
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,560
Otherwise it'll be exhausting for me to gather them.


255
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,710
Curve cut-off was the first step.


256
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,070
Thank Secretary General Ding


257
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,950
for trusting my supervisor Mr. Siegmund,


258
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,590
so we could carry out the curve cut-off work smoothly.


259
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Crazy Cui jumped out to stop it,


260
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,400
so he must die.


261
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,400
Yes.


262
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,680
In 1884,


263
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,230
Aspirin was introduced by German merchant


264
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,590
Farbenfabriken to China.


265
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,310
Back then, it was still called antipyrine.


266
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,000
German medicine


267
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,590
gradually gained its market in China back then.


268
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,520
People kindly called aspirin


269
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,040
Panacea.


270
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,070
But they didn't know


271
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,760
long-term or high-dose taking of aspirin


272
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,230
would cause inflammation of the gastric mucosa,


273
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,280
erosion and anabrosis.


274
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,280
As a famous Western-medicine doctor,


275
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,710
it was so easy for Tiber


276
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,710
to coax the face-saving Crazy Cui


277
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,640
who loved ostentation


278
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,400
to take large dose of panacea.


279
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,710
I proposed to Gu Weiliang


280
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,190
to photograph the whole wedding


281
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,070
as the last work of Ms. Wang


282
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,190
before her retirement,


283
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,190
but the West Lake Hotel was not bright enough


284
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,880
for the camera to photograph,


285
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,920
so it was natural for the star Wang Meiren


286
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,640
to borrow high-temperature lights


287
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,110
from the crew,


288
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,710
which was nice.


289
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,640
The three seniors planned to disguise Gu Weiliang's death


290
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,830
as an accident,


291
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,640
but you asked Wang Ziren


292
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
to replace Wu Zuonan's gift with Fiery Bull Scroll.


293
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,230
You included Gu Weiliang in the nine oxen as well.


294
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,950
Gu Weiliang was from Gutenberg.


295
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,070
Why did you kill him?


296
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,110
Roster of Gutenberg's Members in China


297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
In fact, Gutenberg


298
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,520
just wanted to penetrate China and profit from it


299
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,950
by cultivating elites.


300
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,760
That's too shortsighted.


301
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,680
How can such an organization achieve a great cause?


302
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,560
Only I can


303
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,590
make the best use of them


304
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,280
and totally change the world.


305
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,680
If Gutenberg disagreed,


306
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,070
I would


307
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,590
expose their membership roster


308
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,070
and their


309
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,880
superficial plans.


310
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,470
But only I keep the roster.


311
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,000
Mr. Ding.


312
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,590
Secretary General Ding.


313
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,400
Silver Bell Seal not only can relieve your pain.


314
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,070
Rong Aoshuang


315
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,920
had copied it for me long ago.


316
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
How about Ox Hoof Island?


317
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,430
How do you explain it?


318
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,560
We all know that education


319
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,920
is the best way to change a person.


320
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,520
But I think there must be a faster way,


321
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,430
such as complete change of his genes.


322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I didn't care whether it was the Dragon King Temple


323
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,160
or the Enlightenment Academy that would be flooded,


324
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,470
but I didn't expect that


325
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,110
you fought against each other for this,


326
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
performing a good show


327
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,640
for me.


328
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,680
The paint used by Bai Sihu for Gu Ying's tattoo


329
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,880
should also be extracted and purified from red leeches, right?


330
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,160
So were the medicine that Crazy Cui took


331
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,400
and the wine Gu Weiliang drank.


332
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,760
The red leech's paralysis function of central nerve


333
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,280
can also cause suspended animation.


334
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,640
I can make living life play dead,


335
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,160
but I can't allow the hypocritical soul to keep alive.


336
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,710
I always wanted to ask you


337
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,430
how it felt to kill a girl alive


338
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
on the dissection table.


339
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,560
First of all,


340
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,430
I let the three seniors who were highly respected in Tientsin


341
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,920
follow my way


342
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,760
to kill a diplomat together.


343
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,350
Then I made Captain Zheng who was eager for quick success


344
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,830
find three little people


345
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,000
to kill these three seniors.


346
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,070
As things got to this point,


347
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,040
the rest was simple.


348
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,830
I found a freezer manager


349
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,950
to freeze these three killers to death


350
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,760
and then throw their corpses again at the place I specified.


351
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,880
During this process,


352
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,110
I considered many ways like


353
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,190
phosphorus powder's spontaneous combustion,


354
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,190
magnesium powder's blast,


355
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,560
arc blast, magnetic detonation,


356
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,560
liquid ammonia poisoning, and liquid nitrogen freezing


357
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,920
and overcame a series of unexpected factors


358
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,640
to reach the conditions for fiery ox


359
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,310
and ox constellation.


360
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,560
It was not easy,


361
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,000
but full of fun.


362
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,000
The idea of using military payment to top up the treasury


363
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,190
was provided by me to Mayor Bai.


364
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,470
The idea of keeping the military payment in the bank for a period of time


365
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,830
to earn considerable interest


366
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,400
was also mentioned by me to Commander Wu.


367
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,520
The rest


368
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,920
depended on the Well-doer Li's four precious apprentices.


369
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,560
Of course.


370
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,590
Greedy man


371
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,590
won't live long.


372
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,560
Not everyone


373
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,190
is responsible for your mother's death.


374
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,400
Evilness


375
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,040
is collective.


376
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,920
Everyone has a hand in it.


377
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,830
No one can escape from it.


378
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,280
Captain of Silver Bull Vessel,


379
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,710
abbot of Shixi Temple,


380
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,190
the leather tycoon


381
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,590
and Tieniu,


382
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,110
what's wrong with them?


383
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,400
To gather nine oxen,


384
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,000
you've killed so many innocent people.


385
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,950
Innocent?


386
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,230
A dozen years ago,


387
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,190
the old River God said casually that


388
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,760
the sea monster was Drought Spirit


389
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,230
causing drought.


390
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,470
Many people believed him


391
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,190
and believed that the drought was caused by the sea monster,


392
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,000
So the woman born in the year of water was sacrificed.


393
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,160
Mom.


394
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
No!


395
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,560
Mom!


396
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,430
No, Junyao.


397
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,430
She was sacrificed for the damn nine ox, two tigers and one rooster.


398
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,710
Junyao.


399
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,000
Was that woman innocent?


400
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,640
Were those who killed her


401
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,280
innocent?


402
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,950
Drought Spirit is coming.


403
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,160
Drought Spirit is coming.


404
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,190
Hurry up.


405
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,070
Drought Spirit is coming.


406
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,590
Run fast, run back.


407
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,040
Run as farther as possible.


408
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,710
Hand here to the police.


409
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,710
Give Drought Spirit to Tientsin expert detective Fu Laiyong.


410
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,070
Be careful.


411
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,430
Line up, orderly.


412
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,400
Be careful.


413
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,680
Go down, go down.


414
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,000
Hurry up. Run.


415
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,040
Be careful.


416
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,760
The gunfire shows that the ship is very close to the wharf.


417
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,400
It seems that Gu Ying and Yusi have failed.


418
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,560
Captain Fu initiated the plan.


419
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,520
The one behind him


420
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,350
must be the transmission launcher of white phosphorous bomb.


421
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,920
It seems that only one cannon is connected.


422
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,640
It's too late. Go up and find a way.


423
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,000
Leave this to me.


424
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,430
Young master.


425
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,160
We'll be at the wharf soon.


426
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,520
Port side, the second cannon from the stern.


427
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,470
Yusi, raise the barrel.


428
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,560
I heard you are nicknamed


429
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,070
the Meanest Shark in Tientsin.


430
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,040
Wrong.


431
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,680
I'm the most extraordinary


432
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,800
Little River God in Tientsin.


433
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,880
You were trained at the Deutsche Military Academy since childhood.


434
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,560
I guess Ding Mao and I can't beat you even we join hands.


435
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,760
So I just gamble.


436
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,310
But coward as me


437
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,830
dares not bet too much.


438
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,280
So


439
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,590
I just bet on my life.


440
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,590
Fine.


441
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,710
You cheat in gamble


442
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,520
and spread soy beans in fight.


443
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,950
Even at the last moment of life,


444
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,800
you can't be a bit aboveboard.


445
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,190
Are you going to die like a villain?


446
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,350
This is River God?


447
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,640
Common people treat someone like you


448
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,280
as god!


449
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,800
Why should we allow such


450
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,590
stupid believers to live in the world?


451
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,280
Obviously there are more advanced lives


452
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,760
who can dominate the world.


453
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Their blood


454
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,000
is full of


455
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,430
baseness and evilness.


456
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,040
Only white phosphorus bomb


457
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,880
can burn them clean.


458
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,950
Magnesium powder's explosion


459
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,710
needs to meet the content requirement of 20 mg per cubic meter


460
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,280
with an ignition point of 520 degrees.


461
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,230
But sulfur needs


462
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,400
to meet density requirement


463
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,190
of 2.9 milligrams per cubic meter only.


464
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,469
The burning point is only 190 degrees


465
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,760
I didn't plan


466
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,080
to launch that little white phosphorous bomb.


467
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,040
Because the ship itself


468
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,670
is a giant white phosphorus bomb,


469
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,560
strong enough to destroy the entire wharf.


470
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,909
Just a little static spark


471
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,760
will ignite the entire ship's white phosphorous bombs.


472
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,080
The ship is so close to the wharf.


473
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,630
If you fire, you can blow it like firing cannon.


474
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,230
Fire!


475
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,630
Revenge your master.


476
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,230
Blow up this ship by the way.


477
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,760
Let the companions on this ship,


478
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,470
people on the shore and me


479
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,320
die with the old River God.


480
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Master loved you,


481
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,630
raised you up and taught you skills.


482
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,840
How about you?


483
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,430
You even dare not even revenge him!


484
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,280
Dust blast


485
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,190
won't make people die right away.


486
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,840
They will experience the burning of skin first


487
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,630
and suffocate.


488
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,230
When they thought they would be saved,


489
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,840
the second explosion would occur.


490
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,280
Your master


491
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,080
had a painful death.


492
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,360
Stop beating it.


493
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,040
It's fake. Did you see it?


494
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,950
Oh, mine!


495
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,040
Come up now.


496
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,950
Pretended Draught Spirit to scare us?


497
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,000
I was wrong.


498
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,670
Beat him.


499
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,190
I'm sorry.


500
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,000
Don't let him move.


501
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,630
Stop beating him.


502
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,870
Come.


503
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,710
Mao,


504
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,080
put clothes on.


505
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,520
Keep warm. Come on.


506
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,000
You who don't know how to swim


507
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,390
even learn to fight like others do?


508
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,080
Take it away.


509
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,080
Go.


510
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,670
Stop. Stop.


511
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,600
Go back soon.


512
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,470
Let them retreat, retreat.


513
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,670
Don't let them get near the wharf.


514
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,760
OK. Hurry up.


515
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,320
Retreat quickly.


516
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,320
The plan could be perfect.


517
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,800
All the hatred and evilness


518
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,080
can be eliminated.


519
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,320
You will regret this.


520
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,710
I regret why I didn't shoot just now.


521
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,040
Ying.


522
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,390
Ying.


523
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,870
Ying.


524
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,470
Ying.


525
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,560
Ding Mao.


526
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,560
Yusi.


527
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,430
They really believed


528
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,390
these red paper pieces could bring good luck


529
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,430
just as they really believed


530
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,000
by pushing a woman into the well


531
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,560
and hitting her with red stones


532
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,190
could solve the drought.


533
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,080
Nine oxen, two tigers and one rooster are just superstition.


534
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,230
But I can use science


535
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,390
to make them all real.


536
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,910
I want them to usher in destruction


537
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,520
in the most pious moment,


538
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,390
rooster time, rooster day, rooster month and rooster year.


539
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,190
So rooster indicates the time.


540
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,360
Maybe.


541
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,870
Girl.


542
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,630
Girl. Yusi. Girl.


543
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,040
Girl, hurry up.


544
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,910
Girl.


545
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,760
It's the monster in the pool.


546
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,910
You raised it, right?


547
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,600
Ignore it.


548
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,280
It's a failure.


549
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,560
Fertilizers can save lives.


550
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,000
But I won't save people.


551
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,040
I come back to plant a seed,


552
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,280
plant a new life


553
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,840
to replace


554
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,280
ignorance and backwardness.


555
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,320
Deutsche is great?


556
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,710
Europe is great?


557
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,520
Those with blue eyes and white skin are great?


558
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,870
You don't know yet.


559
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,760
You are the miracle in the history of human evolution.


560
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,040
Lian Huaqing.


561
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,320
Deyou. Deyou.


562
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,000
Girl.


563
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,800
Deyou.


564
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,080
Corpse-salvage team.


565
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,430
Save him. Hurry up.


566
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,080
Hurry up.


567
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,390
Go, hurry up.


568
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,870
Gu Ying. The Chosen One.


569
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,710
Somatic cell has too strong regeneration and metabolism.


570
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,390
Implanted cells are completely rejected.


571
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,710
Experiment failed.


572
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,360
Lian Huaqing,


573
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,080
candidate for the Chosen One.


574
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,040
48 hours after implantation,


575
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,710
reverse rejection happens.


576
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,190
Normal somatic cells are gradually invaded by implanted cells.


577
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,390
Veterinary signs are shown.


578
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,950
Experiment failed.


579
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,360
Guo Deyou,


580
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,430
candidate for the Chosen One.


581
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,560
72 hours after implantation,


582
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,600
no obvious abnormality is found.


583
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,230
The implanted cells are expected to be accepted by the somatic cells.


584
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,430
Parasitic form is initially completed.


585
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,910
I finally found a qualified sample.


586
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,360
Real human evolution


587
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,230
has already started.


588
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
My master said


589
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,230
when people call us River God,


590
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,840
we couldn't agree with them.


591
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,390
But once we promised others,


592
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
we must keep our promise.


593
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,910
I promised Tieniu that


594
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,630
the corpse-salvage team won't fall apart.


595
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,710
As long as I'm still alive,


596
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,950
we brothers are always a family.


597
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,950
I promised master to guard the Dragon King Temple.


598
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,870
As long as I'm still alive,


599
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,520
Master Dragon King's incense won't be cut off.


600
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,280
I promised Ding Mao


601
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,560
to be the godfather of his child.


602
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,000
As long as I'm still alive,


603
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:31,870
I'll teach him to swim


604
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,280
to catch turtle in the river for efficacious presage.


605
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,600
I promised to marry you


606
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,560
when I was young.


607
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,190
Even if I can't be a success,


608
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,280
I must be your husband,


609
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,840
as long as I'm still alive,


610
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:03,320
and no mater whether I am alive or not.
