
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]



00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,110
Let's come back to our story and continue.



00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,670
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]



00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,440
Previously, we talked about



00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,150
Gu Ying parted with Sorceress Zhang.



00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,350
The mother and the daughter cried.



00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,960
Guo Deyou asked



00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,520
Guo Chun about the cause of death of Gu Weiliang.



00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,470
Xiao Lanlan and her father reunited.



00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,390
Ding Mao was paying a visit to Hu Haijiang,



00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,440
However, a blast suddenly occurred.



00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,680
Guo Chun, Xiao Yan and Hu Hiajiang



00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,710
died in the blast.



00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,070
In Dragon King Temple,



00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,360
Guo Chun's funeral procession was held.



00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,230
Guo Deyou kneeled down before his dead body.



00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,000
Xiao Lanlan dumped Xiao Yan's bone ash.



00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,520
Fan Junxiao accompanied



00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,680
Ding Mao to inspect Hu Haijiang's cell.



00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
While they got smashed out by a suspicious electrician.



00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,400
In Dragon King Temple,



00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,630
Niu Tiechun broke up with Guo Deyou.



00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,310
Guo Deyou found magnesium powder while checking Guo Chen's room.



00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,910
The building worker is highly suspicious in Guo Chen's death.



00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,400
Then



00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,680
with suspects dead, the six went through fate disasters.



00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,430
Guo Deyou kept vigil at the wake,



00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,400
while Niu Tiechun got caught in a trap.



00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,510
Where are you going?



00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,630
Do you remember



00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,800
why the Buddha head is here?



00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,270
There was a flood that year.



00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,160
The temple in the mountain was washed out.



00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,310
The head of the stone statue fell down



00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,680
and rolled into Dragon King Temple.



00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,400
What's strange of the story?



00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,910
It's strange that



00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,110
the Buddha head



00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,470
landed right at the court,



00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,440
with no one hurt.



00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,160
Dragon King was not disturbed by it.



00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,240
The Buddha was beheaded by destiny.



00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,520
Dragon King avoided mishap by destiny.



00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,750
The God and the Buddha



00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,750
have their own fates,



00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,320
let alone the mortals.



00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,470
This is karma.



00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,960
I can't dodge the bullet



00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,360
and you can't help me with it.



00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,520
Stop taking revenge for me.



00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,960
Master.



00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,630
I saved your life.



00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,390
I need you to stay alive.



00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,600
Do it for me, okay?



00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,070
Jianghu.



00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,790
Science.



00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,830
Kung fu.



00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,950
Truth.



00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,200
Nine statues of ox.



00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,950
Two statues of tiger.



00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,350
One statue of rooster.



00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,000
Cousin.



00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,790
Master.



00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,950
Uncle Guo.



00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,480
Filial sons and grandsons.



00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,110
The Ox mansion.



00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,790
Chemistry.



00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,000
Arc blast.



00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,070
Search!



00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
Not taking me as your brother?



00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,200
Affection ends when people depart.



00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,270
Evidence.



00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,040
Toughness.



00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,880
Master.



00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,390
River God.



00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,200
Tientsin Mystic 2



00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,230
Episode 14



00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,350
You can't see the wire here



00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
if you don't check carefully.



00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,270
The electrician converted the circuit into parallel,



00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,070
so the two wires share one switch.



00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,320
It's like rail switch.



00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,040
If one is broken,



00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,070
the other won't be affected.



00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,510
Amazing.



00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,070
The court is an electric field now.



00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,480
While I am walking,



00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,600
the voltages between my legs are different,



00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,480
so the current will flow through my body.



00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,200
The charge distribution in the electric field is uneven.



00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,230
The area around the grounding cable



00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,720
has the greatest amount of electricity.



00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,830
My goodness.



00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,159
Tientsin City has been educating the public on electricity for more than ten years.



00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,600
We've seen quite a few electric shocks.



00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,720
But none of them are as terrible as that.



00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,510
Joule Thief



00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,830
is an adapted resistance.



00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,640
This.



00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,440
What it steals is electricity.



00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,830
To be exact,



00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,550
it's a simple



00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,790
self-excited oscillation boost circuit.



00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,270
So the Thief you are talking about is this thing.



00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,320
Secretary General Ding,



00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,000
can you explain in a more easy way?



00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,510
It's like a dam.



00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
First, it stores the electricity



00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,640
it intercepts.



00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,200
And then when the gate is open,



00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,830
the amount of electricity suddenly increases.



00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,550
Now it's easier to understand.



00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,920
Different power plants have different electricity equipment,



00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,720
and different output voltages.



00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,350
Tientsin Power Plant



00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,789
use Germany equipment



00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,150
with 220V and 50Hz.



00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,590
Joule Thief can shortly



00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,230
increase the voltage three to five times,



00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,670
so the center voltage of the electric field



00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,400
can reach 600 to 1000KV,



00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,910
which is enough to create an arc blast.



00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,320
But



00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,590
I thought you said it was



00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
a gas blast.



00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,400
Arc blast



00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,320
is an air blast.



00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,670
It happens when arc pierces through the air.



00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,910
It can be that powerful?



00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
The energy



00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,080
generated by an arc blast



00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,320
can reach to the temperature as high as 30 thousand degrees.



00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,280
It can even melt metals.



00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,840
Hold it.



00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,840
The high temperature brought about by the blast



00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,710
can degauss artificial semi-permanent magnet.



00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,000
My guess is right.



00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,470
This is a magnetic needle.



00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,030
What does it look like to you?



00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,760
A compass?



00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,150
Exactly.



00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,110
The bomb is hidden in the gift box.



00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,230
The trigger is exactly the magnetic needle.



00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,910
Normally, the magnetic needle stays still,



00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,440
so there won't be a blast.



00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,910
But if it gets close to a



00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,200
magnetic field with repelling pole,



00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
the magnetic needle will be deflected.



00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,350
And



00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,910
I guess there's also



00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,150
a magnet in the field.



00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,520
I'll go find it.



00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,640
Miss Xiao.



00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,960
I've moved all the relics here.



00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,590
Please check later.



00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,080
If you need to take care of anything else,



00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,790
just let me know.



00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
Thank you.



00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,110
Young Master said



00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,640
he arranged Master's hiding spot.



00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,910
Now that he's dead,



00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,110
he's too shamed to see you.



00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,110
The driver ran away.



00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,840
It's found in his room.



00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,280
It must be the real gift



00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,110
that Master prepared for you.



00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,280
The driver switched it.



00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
For your safety,



00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,790
I decided for myself



00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,520
and unboxed it in advance.



00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,230
Sorry about it.



00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Thank you.



00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,710
I don't care how police do their job.



00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,400
All brothers from Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce have been spread out



00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,960
searching for the driver and the electrician.



00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,590
I'll let you know as soon as I get anything.



00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,520
Okay.



00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,920
This way, please.



00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,070
Miss Xiao.



00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,880
Is he your father's driver?



00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,280
What about him? Do you recognize him?



00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,280
The workman who built	heated brick beds for Dragon King Temple.



00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,760
Are you sure?



00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,710
Absolutely.



00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,830
What the hell?



00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,590
Look at what you did.



00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,680
These are all proofs.



00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,520
Be careful with what you do.



00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,110
No matter what,



00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,230
at least we got



00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,040
all three suspects.



00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,350
Right,



00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,400
this is the electrician who hit you.



00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
He deserved it.



00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,470
It's our bad.



00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,950
We were one step behind.



00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,070
The perpetrators of the three explosions were all murdered.



00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,920
And



00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,640
the dead bodies were all found



00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,640
in busy places with high foot traffic.



00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,800
It's not hiding the bodies.



00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,680
It's like exposing the bodies to the public.



00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,680
Contraction of a great many of arrector pili muscles.



00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,160
What muscles?



00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,640
Goose bumps.



00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,000
A great many of goose bumps.



00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,190
Goose…



00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,110
Captain, how to spell goose bumps?



00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,920
You must be kidding me.



00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,160
The color of the livor mortis is bright red.



00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,190
Draw a circle first.



00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,560
These are all features of those who were frozen to death.



00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,520
Frozen to death?



00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,470
But the weather is not freezing at all.



00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,430
Were the dead bodies clothed



00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,470
when they were found?



00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,950
Yes, they were dressed neatly.



00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,230
That's strange.



00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,760
Normally,



00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,880
when the temperature of the human body drops to



00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,160
about 25 degrees Centigrade,



00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,760
thermotaxic centre of the brain



00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,430
will regulate excitability to dissipate heat.



00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,160
Skin's blood vessels dilate.



00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,230
Inside the body,



00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,680
the blood with higher temperature



00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,190
will flow to the blood vessels beneath the skin's surface.



00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,560
Shell temperature



00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
will be high



00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,470
because of the inflow of warm blood.



00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,280
So the human will have heat response.



00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,350
Therefore,



00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,400
before frozen to death,



00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,000
a human will have abnormal undressing behavior.



00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,190
No wonder.



00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,880
In the coldest days of a winter, there are always some drunkards who are dead



00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,920
on the street because of frost



00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,310
with clothes taken off.



00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,590
Conjunctival congestion.



00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,110
Festering skin.



00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,590
These have nothing to do with freezing out.



00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,190
My guess is that they



00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,040
were knocked out by something that caused fester of skin



00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,400
and then frozen to death.



00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,640
Quite impressive.



00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,560
Impressive.



00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,430
You can check other evidence



00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,350
and maybe the case will be cracked.



00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,430
What evidence?



00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,830
I will show you.



00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,040
This is what Niu Tiechun took away from Dragon King Temple.



00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,040
Oh, right.



00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,830
You haven't gone to see the old River God, have you?



00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,710
You are so busy keeping eyes



00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,760
on the case,



00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,830
and even got yourself hurt.



00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,040
These are extenuating circumstances.



00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,760
What's the situation in Dragon King Temple?



00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,880
Don't mention it.



00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,230
The police have all gone there. But they can't do anything



00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,710
but got shut outside.



00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,160
Little River God



00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,560
is like mad.



00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,040
Anyone who tries to investigate the case



00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,310
will be thrown out.



00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,590
A human



00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,590
can endure hardship



00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,400
with a limitation.



00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,880
Once you go over the limitation, you will fall apart.



00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,400
Little River God seems



00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,640
all funny and happy every day.



00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,430
But now he's just holding it up.



00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,880
Now he's fallen apart.



00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,400
It's gonna take time for him to recover.



00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,710
Magnesium powder.



00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,070
That's quite beautiful.



00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,640
The flash light of a camera



00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,400
is the combustion of magnesium powder.



00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,230
I get it.



00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,520
The smoke



00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,800
when reporters are taking picture.



00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,230
It always gives me a startle.



00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,920
Write it down.



00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,310
Dragon King Temple.



00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,830
Dust blast.



00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,160
Look at our detective.



00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,470
He just found the modus operandi



00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,230
without even checking the scene of the crime.



00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,230
I said it before.



00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,000
The case is so close to be cracked.



00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,160
You don't need to analyze this thing.



00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,280
A sir named Fan Yao or what,



00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,920
I can't recall his name,



00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,400
provided a clue



00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,800
while claiming the body with Miss Xiao.



00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,640
He said Secretary General Xiao was die of something



00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,280
related to magnetic force



00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,350
or bomb explosion.



00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,950
Are you referring to Fan Junyao?



00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,760
Yes, that's the name.



00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
That dude



00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,800
was so annoying.



00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,040
He's very interested in the festering skin



00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,070
you mentioned earlier.



00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,230
And he asked a lot of questions.



00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,400
I mean…this dude



00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,350
has nothing to do with the case.



00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,830
Why was he



00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,880
being so nosey?



00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,520
Keep this in mind.



00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,350
From now on,



00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,880
the investigation information of the case



00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,800
has to be kept inside the station.



00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,950
It's confidential from the public.



00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,800
Got it.



00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,520
Not just from the public.



00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,880
I will be careful with it even inside the station.



00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,400
There are some people



00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,070
that you need to be wary of.



00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
Let's go.



00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,400
This way.



00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,710
Captain, you don't want to take a look?



00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,520
Miss Xiao.



00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,000
You can go by without pickles.



00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,350
But you can't go by without steamed buns.



00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,950
Meat-skin bun from Tong Yicheng.



00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,070
Have a taste.



00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,520
I'm not hungry.



00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,040
The stuffing



00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,710
is made by cutting up meat



00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,000
and then sprinkling it with sesame oil



00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,830
with a sprinkle of crab and shrimp roe



00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,400
and finally mixing minced scrambled eggs.



00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,760
Come on. Have a try.



00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,710
The rich eat steamed meat bun



00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,110
with three delicacies, shrimp meat and lamb.



00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,520
The meat-skin bun is for the poor.



00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,070
Although there's no



00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,350
fancy stuffing,



00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,590
it's tasty enough.



00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,800
Lanlan, just have a try.



00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,070
Is Sorceress Zhang



00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,680
found?



00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,880
This is a joke, right?



00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,310
Since Uncle Guo was gone,



00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,800
Guo Deyou has shutting himself



00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,880
inside Dragon King Temple.



00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,190
I'm just so worried that if there's something up with him.



00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,430
You came to see me



00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,280
because you're worried about me as well, right?



00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,350
Of course.



00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,590
I'm not worried if you're crying out loud.



00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,680
But you keep it all inside without showing anything



00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,800
and suffer on your own. That's most worrying.



00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,040
I don't have time for that.



00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,160
The case is occupying my mind.



00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,590
Mr. Hu,



00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,640
Old River God



00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,830
and my father



00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,190
all died in explosions at the same time.



00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,430
All three perpetrators were frozen to death.



00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,230
Six deaths.



00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,430
It's obviously that



00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,710
someone designed it.



00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,400
Like



00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,950
some kind of rite.



00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,040
Stop wondering.



00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,590
Conserve your energy for more important things.



00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,880
Have some more.



00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,040
Or I'm going to



00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,430
finish all the buns.



00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,350
Delicious.



00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,590
What are the pins for here?



00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,230
They are the places of the three blasts



00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,830
and the places where three frozen corpses were found.



00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,040
The Ox mansion.



00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,470
What?



00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,920
The twenty-eight mansions of the Chinese constellations with eight northern mansions.



00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,520
The second mansion, Ox.



00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,230
There are six stars of the Ox mansion.



00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,470
The three here are Altair.



00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,310
The three here are Vega.



00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,920
Dragon King Temple.



00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,000
The prison where Mr. Hu was held.



00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,430
And the restaurant where I had my birthday dinner.



00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,560
These three places



00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,190
were the locations where blasts occurred.



00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,040
Altair is Yang.



00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,160
Yang means thunder. Thunder refers to explosion.



00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,040
These three places



00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,710
are where three frozen corpses were found.



00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,950
Vege is Yin.



00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,590
Yin means frost. Frost refers to cold.



00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,310
It is some kind of rite.



00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,190
Bronze Ox. Fire Ox.



00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,950
Now the Ox mansion.



00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,590
Ox again.



00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,590
The tale of ox, tiger and rooster is true.



00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,560
The sea monster is going to show up.



00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,520
There's no devils or ghosts.



00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,680
But someone is trying to make the tale



00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,280
real.



00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,950
Someone is mystifying it.



00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,920
One can't commit



00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,160
so many cases alone.



00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,280
The criminals must be a group of powers.



00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,710
How did the tale of ox, tiger and rooster



00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
come out?



00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,280
The statues of ox, tiger and rooster suppressing the sea monster.



00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,110
It's an old saying.



00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,040
Can't tell the exact time.



00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,040
Lanlan.



00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,710
I'll go eat another bun.



00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,350
I'm not a forensic expert.



00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,760
But anyone who studies chemistry



00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,280
can tell the fester



00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,520
right away.



00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,350
The three corpses in the police station



00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,160
have brown,



00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,430
gelatineous and liquefied wounds.



00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,350
That's a typical liquid ammonia corrosion.



00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,590
What about conjunctival congestion?



00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,110
After liquid ammonia vaporized,



00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,520
The high level of ammonia burned mucous membrane of human body.



00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,350
That's why there's conjunctival congestion.



00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,520
You mean



00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,640
the dead died from ammonia-induced intoxication?



00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,590
No.



00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,680
There's no saponification of fatty tissues shown in the dead body,



00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,710
which means the intoxication is mild,



00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,470
not lethal.



00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,110
So how did he die?



00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,680
He was frozen to death



00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,800
in low temperature



00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,110
after intoxicated by ammonia.



00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,160
Liquid ammonia



00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,590
is the most common refrigerant used in freezers.



00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,880
The first scene of the crime



00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,470
is a freezer.



00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,280
You confirmed



00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,160
immediately after Gu Weiliang was burned



00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,400
that it was spontaneous combustion of phosphorous.



00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,000
You found the red biotoxin in



00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,560
the women's college.



00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,880
And this time, you found out it was



00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,590
liquid ammonia that corroded the wounds.



00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,190
You're in part of all the three cases.



00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,040
And you happened to find all key clues.



00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,110
That's quite impressive.



00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,400
It's not a big deal.



00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,280
Chemistry



00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
is my major.



00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,310
If I couldn't see the problems,



00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,590
then I would be not professional.



00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,310
Chemistry.



00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,680
What about



00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,950
magnetic bomb



00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,190
and the circuit design of xenon lamp?



00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,920
Are they the knowledge of chemistry?



00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,950
What do you mean? What are you trying to say?



00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,310
Dust blast, arc blast and magnetic bomb.



00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,760
These require not just science knowledge,



00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,230
but accurate calculations.



00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,230
So it's not what



00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,680
the building worker, electrician or the driver who just had general knowledge



00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,040
could do.



00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,280
So you are suspecting me?



00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,560
You are suspecting me.



00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,360
Righteous, selfless.



00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,230
Giving in silence for



00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,909
your sweetheart cousin



00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,949
with no attempts.



00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,630
Indifferent to romantic love.



00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,630
But ambitious of serving the country worthily.



00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,389
Full of pity, tenderness and mercy for the common people.



00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,840
Fan Junyao.



00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,080
Are you faking it too much?



00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,950
Who told you I'm indifferent to Lanlan?



00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,870
How you do know I have no attempts?



00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,430
That's far too blunt of you.



00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,430
Fine.



00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,950
If you have solid evidence,



00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,470
go ask the police to take me.



00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,870
If not,



00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,470
you're not welcomed here.



00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,630
Secretary General Ding.



00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,150
You're not welcomed here.



00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,840
Don't look at me.



00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,320
My wife made too much.



00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,080
She asked me to send it to you.



00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,520
You don't deserve to have it at all.



00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,520
That's salty as shit.



00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,710
Your wife made it? Are you kidding me?



00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,710
I made it.



00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,560
What? Are you being picky?



00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,560
Then I'll take it back.



00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,150
It's not lethal.



00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,120
I was a bit impetuous getting physical with you.



00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,390
No, it's just okay.



00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,670
Master Guo would want you to



00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,230
see his coffin out.



00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,840
It should be you



00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,520
to hold the coffin.



00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,320
I've confirmed it at the police station.



00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,600
The building worker is dead.



00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
I have some clues.



00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,950
If you want to look it up, then let's do it.



00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,840
If not,



00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,320
give me a reason.



00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,430
Think clearly before answering me.



00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,190
I'm tired,



00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,870
annoyed,



00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,360
and lazy.



00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,760
No reasons.



00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,080
You are always calculating



00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,670
inside,



00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,080
without showing it.



00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
I often go into your trap easily.



00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,520
That's no big deal.



00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,000
You are my brother.



00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,360
I'm fine with it.



00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,560
But it's different this time.



00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,430
You are not taking me as your brother



00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
on holding it back.



00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,320
Fine, I have nothing else to say.



00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,190
I'll carry the two bags of ash in the court out for you.



00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,040
Taking on any work.



00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,150
You think you can bear anything?



00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,390
In Tientsin City, there are more than ten freezers



00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,430
including the government's and private-owned.



00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,710
Which one are you asking about?



00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,230
This is the sea offal mixing in seafood box.



00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,430
Some kind of oncomelania.



00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,120
It can only be found in Nanyang goods.



00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,710
Tell me who imported Nanyang goods.



00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,520
I'll make some inquiries.



00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,520
The owners of Dong Hai and Hui Chang are from Jiang Su.



00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,800
They import Nanyang goods all year round.



00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,080
Lately…



00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,710
And there's one more. What is it?



00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,390
First.



00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,360
First Freezer.



00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,470
Nothing else?



00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,320
Bro, we have many goods and ships at the dock.



00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
But we've made contact with



00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,120
all the goods.



00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
Including First Freezer,



00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,230
who always chooses to unload goods in the middle of nights.



00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,520
If you don't think us reliable,



00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,190
just take the money back.



00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,710
Thank you.



00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,470
Let me know if you need anything.



00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,840
Do we need to tell the police?



00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,870
If the police steps in,



00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,040
there's no revenge any more.



00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,190
That son of a bitch.



00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,760
I will kill him.



00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,870
Brother Niu.



00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,760
Since you're here,



00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,870
take some shrimp back.



00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,800
We are doing an investigation.



00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,950
It smells like feet.



00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,870
Where is the smell from?



00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,080
It's not from the paper.



00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,800
It's the ink of newspaper.



00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,430
If it's not for the ink,



00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,280
the newspaper must have been eaten up by bugs.



00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,280
Let alone being preserved for so long.



00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,040
I've been reading



00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,120
the mosquito-sized characters for a whole day.



00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,630
My mind is full of mosquitoes now.



00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,360
Get up.



00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,040
I want to have a rest.



00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,430
You have contact with so many people.



00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,470
Why is it taking so long for you



00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,870
to find a sorceress?



00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,630
Since I knew Gu Weiliang



00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,080
might be my real father,



00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,950
I couldn't stop the thought



00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,120
of finding out where I came from.



00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,080
But later,



00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
after Uncle Guo was gone,



00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,190
I started to realize that



00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,630
it's no use if I find out about it.



00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,600
I need to prove that I was not born from a rock crack?



00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,470
So



00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,710
you stop?



00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,710
Just let it be.



00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,670
If he was my real father,



00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,840
I will burn paper money in front of his tomb



00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,950
at festivals,



00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,910
to thank him for bringing me into this world.



00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,280
God of drought makes its appearance.



00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,670
A great drought occurs in Tientsin.



00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,360
The folks worship the Dragon King.



00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,560
to reduce the drought.



00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,360
The tale of ox, tiger and rooster was also mentioned here.



00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,190
They just made it up.



00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,040
When something's up,



00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,870
they go the same old way.



00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,840
I know the spells on asking for water as well.



00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,360
The folks, they just believe the thing.



00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,470
They not only worshipped the Dragon King.



00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,430
Some even worshipped the statue of ox, tiger and rooster.



00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,870
What are you doing?



00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,150
Who do you try to scare?



00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,040
You.



00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,800
What the hell are you



00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,910
doing outside in the middle of the night?



00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,150
I have to stick a juju on you.



00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,840
Who would stick a juju on the forehead?



00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,870
You need a smart juju



00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,630
on your forehead.



00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,840
You're too silly.



00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,000
You slipped out



00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,040
to Dragon King Temple pretty fast.



00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,230
She didn't even have a bite of your food.



00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,600
But you just offered selflessly.



00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,360
You are making things up.



00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,710
I didn't go to Dragon King Temple.



00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,150
That would be something new



00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,280
if you didn't go there.



00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,150
It's no use going there.



00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,360
Guo Deyou doesn't talk to anyone.



00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,800
Let's not talk about him any more.



00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,800
I have hard feelings myself.



00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,800
Yesterday,



00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,910
I got a good wine.



00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,470
And I was thinking about



00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,190
drinking the wine with Guo Chun.



00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,600
I was ready to go for him.



00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,520
The minute I got up on my feet,



00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,470
I realized I had nowhere to find him.



00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,280
Do we have jobs to do recently?



00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,320
After you finish eating,



00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,320
go find the tools



00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,230
we used to use for drought for me.



00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,080
We're going to get a big job in a few days.



00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,430
If the drought goes on,



00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,390
there will be no grain.



00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,910
Eat the food when we can still have it.



00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,910
The heaven



00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,950
has no sympathy for human beings.



00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,190
So many people died.



00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,870
But he didn't even shed a tear.



00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,630
Haihe River



00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,670
is going to dry up some day.



00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,670
Check here.
