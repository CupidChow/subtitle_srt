00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
Let's go back to the main story and continue.


4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,510
Previously, we talked about


5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,000
Guo Deyou and Xiao Lanlan,


6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,110
directed by the boss of Thousand Treasure House,


7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,640
went to the hospice,


8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,390
knowing that Gutenburg could enter China


9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,680
because of the recommendation of the three respected elderly.


10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,600
To prevent Gubenburg from destroying China,


11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,280
the three respected elderly coming forward courageously


12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,840
killed Gu Weiliang, the agent of Gutenburg in China.


13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,760
In order to look into the nine oxen,


14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,070
Guo Deyou was stung by leeches carelessly.


15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,200
Fan Junyao helped to cure him.


16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,840
To figure out her identity, Gu Ying checked the midwife's Record Book.


17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,040
With the doubts in her heart unknotted,


18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,720
the truth seems not so important.


19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,400
Looking back on


20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,840
the hows and whys he combined with the mysterious man,


21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,720
Captain Zheng found out the mysterious man was Rong Aoshuang.


22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,470
Not only did Rong Aoshuang hide around Ding Mao to


23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,880
do something strange secretly,


24
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,560
he was also directly related to Lian Huaqing,


25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,150
the head of the bandit chieftain of Mogudao.


26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,270
The governor is powerful.


27
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,560
Zheng Simian died.


28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,910
Gu Ying and Guo Deyou discussed the case.


29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,200
Thanks to Sorceress Zhang's directions,


30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,470
they knew that the oxen case


31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,190
still had three oxen unfound.


32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,910
Tientsin was in a chaos,


33
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,400
which led to


34
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,440
Guo Deyou bravely exploring the self-sealed coffin.


35
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,680
Chairman Ding went to Longcheng stockade village.


36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,800
Serial punished murder case.


37
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,310
Two brothers worked together


38
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,550
playing tricks wisely.


39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,680
The Hegu constellation


40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,039
can rule a vast area from the ninth heaven to Changli Mountain.


41
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,160
There are two trees in your yard.


42
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,080
They're a pair of ox horns,


43
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,310
conflicting with the God of the golden ox,


44
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,310
Liu Jiangsheng.


45
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,360
Cut them down!


46
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,550
Leave the tree stump seven inches high


47
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,590
and cover them with red cloth.


48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,590
It'll be fine.


49
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,950
What can I do, sir?


50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,000
Let me have a look.

My family name is Niu.

I want to change it to Ma,


54

my mother's surname.


55
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,229
I am filial.


56
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,509
Even my father wants to change his surname.


57
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,080
OK OK OK. I can help you.


58
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,760
Ox.


59
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,680
Can you help me tell my fortune?


60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
Is there ox in the eight characters of my horoscope?


61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,680
Ox.


62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,630
Wait a moment.


63
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,760
I will tell you in a while.

My third uncle was born in the year of tiger.


66
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,759
My wife was born in the year of rooster.


67
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm wondering


68
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,830
if my zodiac can be changed.


69
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,080
My relatives born in the year of ox have been dead,


70
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
leaving those born in the year of tiger and rooster only.


71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,390
One by one.


72
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,910
Zodiac, the eight characters of the horoscope


73
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
and surname can all be changed.


74
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
Don't worry.


75
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,270
According to Jincheng police office's another statement,


76
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
the drought is more and more serious.

Besides,


79
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,520
rumors about the
nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger, one statue of rooster


80
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
are distorted words to incite misfortune.


81
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,960
Anyone who believe in and spread them


82
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,440

You

don't need to entangle yourself with it.


111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't believe in the rumors.


112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,760
The nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster


113
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
are all about superstations.

Don't panic.


115
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
Just put your money


116
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,790
into the bank.


117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,950
Let's go. Quickly.


118
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,920
Isn't he Wu Youyi,


119
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,670
the fur trader?


120
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,320
So he is!


121
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,270
He built up his fortune from scratch, just with a bundle of cattle hide.


122
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,320
From scratch?


123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,230
His younger cousin is the captain of the police.


124
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,790
It's the collusion between government and businessmen.


125
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,270
Unexpectedly,


126
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,070
the abbot of the Stone-rhinoceros Temple


127
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,510
died in the temple.


128
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,640
Seemingly,


129
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,920
the siren can't be suppressed.


130
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,720
Say it again.


131
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,440
It goes like this.


132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,790
The stone-rhinoceros


133
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,950
refers to stone ox.


134
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,480
With a stone ox to calm the water,


135
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
the siren is angry.


136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
Of course people will worship the stone-rhinoceros.


137
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,880
But unexpectedly, the abbot of the Stone-rhinoceros Temple


138
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,160
died in the temple.


139
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,830
It seems that the siren


140
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,350
is hard to suppress


141
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,230
Another ox died.


142
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,550
It's the captain of the Silver-ox ship,


143
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,640
who was hanged on the ship, dead.


144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,200
Gold, silver, bronze and iron


145

OK?


161

I want to withdraw it now.


162
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,640
I want to withdraw it now.

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,550
Today


168
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,390
Mayor Bai appears personally to open the coffer,


169
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,550
also hoping you can make real reports


170
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,320
to make the rumor that the coffer is empty


171
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,760
collapse to itself.


172
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,320
Mayor Bai.


173
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,350
He is right.


174
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,880
Please take it easy!


175
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,230
You can deposit and withdraw


176
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,480
in each bank of Jincheng smoothly.


177
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,600
Open it.


178
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,270
OK.


179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
There must be something wrong.


180
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Don't take photos.


181
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,920
No photos!


182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
No photos.


183
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,720
Stop him.


184
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,830
Don't take photos! Don't take photos!


185
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,390
What do you think?


186
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,230
It sounds so melodious just like being played by the immortals.


187
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,350
Two crickets


188
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,350
are both presented by others.


189
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,670
Both of them are said to be a king insect.


190
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,390
Which one is true?


191
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,270
The most melodious one must be the best one.


192
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,320
Only the invincible one


193
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,040
is the king.


194
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,160
I don't know much about insects.


195
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,350
It's hard to tell.


196
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
Each of you have your own idea.


197
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,230
How to deal with it?


198
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,720
It's simple.


199
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,200
Close them in a jar.


200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,670
The survivor


201
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,480
is the king.


202
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,270
With them killing each other,


203
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,909
I will only have one cricket.


204
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,520
With both of them alive,


205
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,110
neither is a king insect.


206
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,960
With one alive,


207
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,110
you will have the king insect.


208
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,590
Reasonable!


209
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,440
Fight!


210
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,790
Fight!


211
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,280
Fight!


212
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,280
Fight!


213
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:11,440
It's a hard fighting, rarely seen,


214
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:20,350
as fierce as dragon with tiger.


215
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,280
Wonderful!


216
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
Besides watching the fight of insects,


217
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,590
what else can I help you?


218
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,910
To be frank,


219
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,080
The nine oxen case stir the whole Tientsin into a tempest.


220
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,150
Lots of people gathered at bank to withdraw gold,


221
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,640
only to find that there this no gold in the bank.


222
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,840
Mayor Bai


223
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,080
turned to me to borrow some gold.


224
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,520
Without hesitation, I offered him timely help


225
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,840
at the loss of my life.


226
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
He borrowed gold from me


227
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,230
and I ordered people to send it to them the next day.


228
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
He told me it was just a token gesture


229
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,280
and he would return it to me in ten days.


230
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
Guess what?


231
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,880
It's gone!


232
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,470
Time to issue pay is approaching.


233
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,790
But I have nothing


234
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,710
to pay for the ten thousands


235
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,470
soldiers.


236
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm in a panic.


237
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,150
Commander Wu.


238
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,110
We usually call each other brother.


239
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,790
Speaking of money,


240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,790
you call me Mayor Bai.


241
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,670
With the governor here, I will speak frankly.


242
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,000
Borrowing only for ten days,


243
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,790
I promised you 1% interest charge


244
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
which is higher than that in the black market.


245
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,470
If it hadn't been the 1% interest charge,


246
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,910
would you have helped me timely


247
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,150
at the loss of your life?


248
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,960
You lent gold to him


249
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,670
and allowed him to return it in ten days.


250
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,840
Yeah.


251
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,400
The gold is lost. He can't return it.


252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,080
You don't have money to issue pay.


253
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,910
Right.


254
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,790
The bank has empty coffer.


255
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,880
The army has no money to pay the soldiers.


256
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,110
It seems that Tientsin is going to be in a chaos.


257
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,670
If so,


258
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,320
I will be upset.


259
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,440
Secretary Ding.


260
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,840
Do you know the story of Liu Bei borrowing Zhao Yun


261
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,640
to recruit soldiers in Xuzhou?


262
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm waiting for your grant instructions.


263
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,350
It was at that time when Cao Cao attacked Xuzhou.


264
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,550
In hot haste


265
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,590
when it's extremely dangerous,


266
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,000
Liu Bei borrowed Zhao Yun from Gongsun Zan to help recruit soldiers.


267
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,350
The present situation in Tientsin is just like that in Xuzhou then.


268
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,960
The governor means


269
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,840
you are Zhao Yun, brother Ding.


270
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,640
It's quite suitable for you


271
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,840
to look for the gold.


272
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,960
We are sworn friends for life or death.


273
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,840
With him investigating in it,


274
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,760
I feel relieved.


275
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,710
No. No.


276
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,790
Governor, it's beyond my capacity.


277
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,030
Combined with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce,


278
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,030
brother Ding was skillful in fighting against the drought,


279
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,550
thinking carefully with everything concerned.


280
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,150
As for the case of Gu Weiliang,


281
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,640
if it hadn't been that brother Ding judged the case as clearly as God,


282
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,030
it would have been hard for me to explain


283
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,280
the Fiery Bull Scroll that I sent.


284
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,230
Young and promising.


285
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,790
with lots of great achievements.


286
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,880
There are many capable people under the command of the governor.


287
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,320
It's not my turn.


288
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you know Guan, Zhang, Ma and Huang?


289
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,000
Governor, do you refer to


290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei,


291
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,760
Ma Chao and Huang Zhong?


292
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,910
At that time,


293
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,440
Liu Bei had already had two valiant generals, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.


294
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,910
Why did he still choose Zhao Yun?


295
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Zhao Yun isn't in the teeth of the storm,


296
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,760
he can keep out of the affair.


297
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,520
With fair justice,


298
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,470
we feel relieved.


299
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,640
Please don't decline.


300
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,320
OK.


301
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,960
Since the governor treats me so kindly,


302
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,960
I will accept it.


303
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,200
With you involved in it,


304
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,550
everything will change greatly.


305
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,670
Wonderful!


306
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,470
Both of them are dead.


307
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,200
Who?


308
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,550
Of course it's the carpenter, Huang Chengzhong.


309
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,470
The well-doer, Li Fengcheng


310
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
only has one apprentice


311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,910
who is promising,


312
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,790
so he passed him


313
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,840
the unique handicraft, the medicinal eaglewood.


314
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,590
Guess what?


315
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,550
He uses the medicinal eaglewood to make coffins.


316
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,150
Medicinal eaglewood coffins.


317
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,640
How clever he is!


318
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,000
The partial tone of coffin


319
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,150
is to get promoted and make fortune.


320
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,350
It's really auspicious business.


321
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,440
Right?


322
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,030
With handicraft and moral,


323
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,640
yet


324
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,280
his business didn't go well.


325
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,550
And his life became poorer and poorer.


326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,790
Why?


327
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,840
Why?


328
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,880
Why?


329
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,760
He did something that is harmful to his virtue.


330
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,350
His coffin shop is filthy,


331
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,840
dangerous to go inside.


332
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,200
Yeah.


333
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,230
How is it filthy?


334
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,880
Carpenter Huang kept the corpse.


335
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,470
It's said that


336
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,000
those who run coffin shops


337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,110
keep corpse to


338
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,520
solicit business.


339
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,000
More than one person has seen that,


340
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,230
at midnight,


341
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,960
he pulled a cart with a coffin which has ever been buried into his shop.


342
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,470
They are not empty coffins.


343
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,710
Besides,


344
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,640
he didn't work during the day


345
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,470
but made coffins at night.


346
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,280
Yeah.


347
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,440
So he did.


348
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,760
It's nearly afternoon.


349
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,400
The sunshine is not so strong.


350
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,640
Deyou.


351
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,590
What about going again tomorrow at noon?


352
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,840
Since we're here,


353
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,110
it would be in vain if we didn't go inside.


354
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,080
I...


355
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,670
Let's go.


356
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,280
I won't enter. Deyou.


357
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,910
I won't go inside.


358
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,760
I will treat you crab after the check.


359
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,030
If it hadn't been that I provided the clue,


360
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,440
you wouldn't have come here to look into the case of the nine oxen.


361
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,910
It is better for the doer to undo what he has done.


362
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,520
Go ahead.


363
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,710
I just get myself involved to help you solve the case as well.


364
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,150
It must be right.


365
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,350
It's the taste of the medicinal eaglewood.


366
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,350
It smells so familiar.


367
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
The water that is used to soak the wood is still warm.


368
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,320
This is the bee wax.


369
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,960
During summer, in the mourning hall at home,


370
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
The coffin seam has to be sealed closely with it


371
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,550
in case of the smell dispersing.


372
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,840
It's sealed with wax


373
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,150
and nailed.


374
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,910
Usually, these are the procedures


375
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,280
for burial.


376
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,520
As a new coffin in the coffin shop,


377
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,839
why bother with these procedures?


378
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,000
Could it be possible that someone keeps the corpse?


379
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,830
It can't be.


380
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,400
From putting in storage to opening it,


381
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,040
is there anybody coming again?


382
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,430
No.


383
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,280
The seal is in perfect condition.


384
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,350
Let me introduce it to you.


385
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,190
The Security level, the depth of the wall


386
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
and the type of lock cylinder


387
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,110
accord with the highest standard of the bank security.


388
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,680
The security guards work in shift all around the clock


389
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,190
and report every one hour.


390
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,310
It's impossible to make error.


391
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,070
Hmm.


392
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,950
It's cold inside.


393
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,280
The walls are deep


394
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,350
with first-rate ventilating devices.


395
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,310
Cold temperature is good for


396
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,040
keeping the precious metal and notes for long.


397
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,190
So


398
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,520
the temperature in the coffer is a little lower than that outside.


399
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,000
When did you find the gold bar was stolen?


400
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,520
The second afternoon after the gold bar was sent here.


401
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,830
Who was in charge of it?


402
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,000
Me.


403
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,680
I know the coffer very well.


404
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,470
So today it's I who help you look into it.


405
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,470
OK.


406
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,310
Tell me what happened that day in detail.


407
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,190
OK.


408
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,680
At 5:30 a.m.,


409
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,160
I arrived at the meeting place on time,


410
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,070
got on the military vehicle


411
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,640
and contacted with the gold stockman of the army.


412
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,880
Then


413
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,350
we escorted the gold


414
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,950
together to Jincheng Bank


415
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,040
without stopping during the way


416
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,920
or seeing any suspicious people.


417
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,110
When the military vehicle arrived at the back door of the bank,


418
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,520
it was 6:00 a.m.


419
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,430
Why was it the back door?


420
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,950
Mayor Bai and Commander Wu specially told us


421
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,710
to have normal procedures


422
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,430
but not to make it known by others.


423
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,040
So the gold was put in storage from the back door.


424
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,280
And then?


425
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,400
After we arrived at the coffer,


426
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,830
everything was done according to the procedures.


427
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,710
It was checked and sealed.


428
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,590
The gold was put in storage at 6:15 a.m.


429
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,040
When we opened the coffer to check it at 6:00 a.m. the next day,


430
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,070
we found the gold was gone.


431
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,350
The box is broken.


432
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,110
The cash transport box has sealing design.


433
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,590
It can't be.


434
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,950
It's true.


435
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,920
Here is a seam.


436
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,760
The gold bar wasn't stolen in the coffer.


437
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,950
What?


438
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,190
Before putting in storage,


439
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,110
it had been stealthily substituted with dry ice.


440
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,400
Dry ice?


441
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,640
With the gasification of the solid dry ice,


442
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,230
the air pressure in the confined space of the box will rise,


443
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,280
leading to a tiny seam on the top of the box.


444
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,430
The gasified dry ice evaporated from the tiny seam.


445
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,070
With the help of the good ventilating system,


446
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,070
it disappeared totally.


447
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,560
Isn't it true that


448
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,800
the ice will change into water?


449
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,950
Dry ice is not ice


450
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,760
but drikold,


451
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,310
which is a commonly-used coolant in freezer.


452
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,400
Freezer?


453
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,950
It's still freezer.


454
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,230
Sir, a group of soldiers come


455
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,040
to ask for the gold bar.


456
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,230
Soldiers?


457
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,590
Mr. Lin, it's him.


458
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,160
Who is in charge?


459
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,950
I'm here to take the gold.


460
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,920
Excuse me,


461
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,590
I'm in charge.


462
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,190
What's up?


463
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,710
It's the pay day tomorrow.


464
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,880
All the pay has been kept in your coffer.


465
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,470
If you don't give the gold,


466
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,800
the soldiers outside


467
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,000
can't be calmed.


468
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,880
Commander Wu knew the situation of the bank.


469
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,430
We just found the gold bar was secretly substituted.


470
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,520
Now we are helping look into it.


471
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,110
Substitute?


472
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,160
It was me who escorted the gold here.


473
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,310
You mean


474
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,520
there is something wrong with me.


475
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,830
How could you make a false countercharge?


476
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,680
You escorted it?


477
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,680
Go to


478
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,400
ask the man who take the gold here


479
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,800
and make it clearly.


480
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,710
It's me.


481
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,160
You?


482
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,280
If you don't believe it,


483
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,880
ask the soldier who sent the gold that day here to recognize me.


484
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,950
He is supposed to know me.


485
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,590
Haven't you two


486
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,190
seen each other?


487
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,000
No.


488
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,800
Lord.


489
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,430
This is Secretary Ding,


490
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,560
designated by the governor specially


491
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,160
to investigate the theft case.


492
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,760
Commander Wu knew it.


493
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,430
I am...


494
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,830
Secretary Ding,


495
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,230
Military orders can't be opposed.


496
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,000
Today my task is to withdraw the pay.


497
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,560
I didn't mean to make it difficult for you to solve the case.


498
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,400
Was it you who sent the gold that day?


499
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,350
Yeah.


500
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,280
Did you see him?


501
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,190
No.


502
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,880
When and where did you meet?


503
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,110
At 5:30 a.m. at the Katun church.


504
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,560
Both the time


505
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,110
and place are right.


506
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,230
It's also the same bank.


507
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,070
But they two didn't see each other.


508
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,190
Secretary Ding.


509
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,430
I think


510
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,830
there must be one lying.


511
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,710
Could it be that it was not this bank?


512
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,760
It was here.


513
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,680
Yeah.


514
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,920
Lord.


515
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,710
Do you have the deposit receipt?


516
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,590
It'll be clear after the deposit receipt is seen.


517
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,230
This...


518
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,830
I did write this receipt.


519
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,350
It can't be.


520
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,710
It's true that I didn't see him.


521
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,470
Since the deposit receipt was written,


522
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
it suggested that you received the gold.


523
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,760
Commander Wu


524
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,350
doesn't want to make it known.


525
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,230
So does Mayor Bai.


526
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,950
Secretary Ding,


527
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,760
please look into the back workers carefully.


528
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,230
If it is delayed too long,


529
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,950
the soldiers may keep up a fuss about it.


530
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,070
Whoever can't bear it.


531
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:29,950
Let's withdraw.


532
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,070
Yes, lord.


533
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,230
Lord.


534
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,590
Take it easy!


535
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,920
Just go back.


536
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,590
Hmm.


537
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,230
He escorted the gold to the bank by himself


538
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,520
and this man wrote the deposit receipt by himself.


539
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,160
How couldn't


540
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,430
they see each other?


541
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,950
Who did they see?


542
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,680
The thief.


543
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,520
One. Two. Three.


544
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,760
Put more efforts.


545
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,280
Anxious.


546
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,280
I'm so anxious.


547
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,230
I'm wondering where Mr. Zheng


548
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,710
was transferred


549
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,800
suddenly?


550
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,160
Only I myself supervise


551
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,350
all the life-and-death cases in Tientsin.


552
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,000
I have to decide everything.


553
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,430
Everything is up to me.


554
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,520
I'm so worried.


555
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,040
People are worried about the timely rain


556
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,520
and the crops are worried about harvest.


557
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,680
Anxious!


558
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,280
It sounds good.


559
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,880
You are number one now!


560
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,040
How could you say this?


561
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,710
I had just finished helping Secretary Ding look for the gold.


562
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,430
Now I'm here to help you look into the case.


563
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,430
But you still tease me.


564
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,640
Captain, the coffin is so hard to lever open


565
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,040
just like the drowned clam.


566
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,310
These are the authentic Yama coffin seal nail


567
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,350
hammered for 81 times


568
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
to


569
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,800
avoid being opened even under the ground.


570
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,350
I don't believe it.


571
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,430
Deyou.


572
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,640
Can't we be in a hurry?


573
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,760
For the robbery of the gold,


574
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,950
Secretary Ding is waiting for my advice.


575
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,880
If you still can't open it, I will deduct your salary.


576
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,230
One, two, three.


577
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,400
Gosh!


578
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,640
What a sudden smelly smell!


579
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
We didn't expect it.


580
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
The medicinal eaglewood is good wood,


581
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,590
airtight.


582
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,830
The seam is sealed by bee wax.


583
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,280
And the room is full of flavor of medicine.


584
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,430
Of course we can't smell it.


585
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,430
What are you doing?


586
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,520
You.


587
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,070
Go.


588
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,350
Hurry up. Go inside.


589
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,520
Go.


590
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,760
Hurry up.


591
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,680
Captain.


592
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,280
Who is he?


593
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,470
He said he knew the shop keeper.


594
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,430
As neighbors, of course he had ever seen him.


595
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,110
Carpenter Huang is unsociable,


596
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,800
seldom talking with others.


597
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,640
Go to recognize it


598
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,710
and tell who is lying inside.


599
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,680
Lord.


600
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,310
It's so smelly. Can it still be recognized?


601
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,040
Yeah. It's Carpenter Huang.


602
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,190
It's so rotten


603
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,400
while you know who he is just with a glance.


604
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,470
You're guilt, right?


605
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,800
Tell me if you did it.


606
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,950
What do you mean?


607
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,000
Lord.


608
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,470
Carpenter Huang lost two front teeth.


609
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,590
It's said that they were broken when he was working.


610
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,230
All the neighbors know it.


611
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,190
What?


612
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,950
Go to have a look.


613
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,920
Go ahead.


614
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,590
Yes.


615
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,560
It lacks two front teeth.


616
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,110
Go away.


617
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,710
Go away.


618
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,640
Quickly.


619
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,280
Hmm.


620
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,950
if


621
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,760
there weren't the robbery of gold,


622
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,560
this would be a big case.


623
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,230
Now it can be just seen


624
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,710
a revengeful murder among civilians.


625
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,070
We still need to


626
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,800
pay more attention to the robbery of gold.


627
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,590
Both the army and the bank put pressure on me.


628
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,560
Carpenter Huang


629
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,000
helped the person in charge of the freezer make concealed boxes.


630
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,000
The person in charge of the freezer


631
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,760
killed three murderers of the ox case.


632
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,950
The person in charge of the freezer died


633
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,230
followed Carpenter Huang.


634
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,830
Isn't it suspicious?


635
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,190
You mean


636
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,280
it has something to do with the nine oxen, right?


637
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,000
Isn't it a big case?


638
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,040
Absolutely it is a big case.


639
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,920
What a pity!


640
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,310
You're very busy repairing the tiles on the roof.


641
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,520
Worried!


642
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,590
Crabs are worried to crawl wildly.


643
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,760
Shrimps are worried to have the wrong target.


644
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,430
No.


645
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,310
Worried!


646
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,230
Mr. Guo,


647
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,040
I'm not worried at all.


648
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,470
You feel so bad.


649
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,520
Can you still eat crabs?


650
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,470
Secretary Ding is still waiting for me


651
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,560
to look for the gold with him.


652
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,190
I can.


653
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,040
You must keep your promise to me.


654
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,710
You often help others handle funeral affairs,


655
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,470
seeing many violent deaths and wronged deaths.


656
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,350
How could it be?


657
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,350
I've never seen anyone dead so miserably,


658
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,350
hammering the Yama nail for himself.


659
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,470
He was condemned


660
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,590
to put himself in the coffin,


661
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,190
which is called self-sealed coffin.


662
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,640
Self-sealed coffin?


663
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,400
An investigator specially appointed by the governor?


664
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,880
You are rising up


665
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,070
rapidly, right?


666
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,310
Hot potatoes


667
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,880
on me!


668
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,280
They're not hot potatoes but gold bars.


669
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,350
Mr. Guo.


670
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,110
Hello.


671
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,800
Is it true that you can get gold for looking into the case?


672
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,830
Then I can also investigate it.


673
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,070
OK. Go ahead.


674
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,710
I just want to go on looking into the nine oxen case.


675
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,520
Mr. Guo. Take some green onions.


676
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,190
No need. Who are you?


677
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,760
How is your case?


678
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,190
The man who made the container to hold leeches has been found.


679
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,070
He is a carpenter.


680
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,190
What did you find out by investigating him?


681
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,430
Nothing.


682
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,160
When I found him, he was rotted.


683
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,800
And it was he who sealed himself


684
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,680
in the coffin.


685
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,710
It seems that the cases are separated


686
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,230
or related to each other.


687
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,070
Complicated.


688
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,350
We can always find a way out after figuring them out.


689
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,280
I am asking you here to help me find a way out.


690
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,470
If the gold can't be found,


691
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,880
we won't have time to look into the nine oxen case.


692
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,190
Secretary Ding.


693
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,640
All the nine oxen have been dead.


694
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,400
Now


695
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
we need to figure out the two statues of tiger.


696
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,110
Mr. Guo.


697
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,230
So many people


698
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,280
crowd in one yard.


699
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
It's nothing.


700
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,160
The upper part is worse.


701
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,560
Upper part?


702
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,310
The respected live in the lower part in Tientsin.


703
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,190
In the south, it is the foreign settlement.


704
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,920
It's worse towards the north.


705
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,230
If you really want to


706
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,000
know about the hardships of people,


707
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,760
you need to go to the shacks in the north.


708
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,680
I thought


709
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,560
the Dragon Temple was the worst.


710
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,760
Who


711
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,280
insisted on moving here to pay respect for master?


712
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,350
Hard to drive away.


713
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,520
Are you sure a bank supervisor lives here?


714
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,110
Yusi followed him home.


715
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,760
Yeah. It's here.


716
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,310
Painted with gold lacquer,


717
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,830
the fecal pellets seem precious.


718
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,520
Secretary Ding,


719
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,070
why are you here?


720
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,520
I want to ask you some questions.


721
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,520
OK.


722
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,640
Come in, please.


723
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm sorry.


724
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,230
There isn't tea left in my house.


725
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,469
I'm going to borrow some.


726
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,670
It doesn't matter.


727
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,600
No need to borrow.


728
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,760
We don't have tea.


729
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,870
OK.


730
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I'm really sorry


731
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,190
for my poor service.


732
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,760
No. We just take liberty to visit you.


733
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,469
We're supposed to tell you in advance.


734
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,949
Mr. Lin, you're working in a bank.


735
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,080
But your life


736
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,389
is poorer than me, who is working in the
corpse-salvage team.


737
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,280
I am ashamed.


738
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,360
My family isn't rich.


739
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:57,910
With parents to raise


740
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,630
and brothers and sisters to afford to school,


741
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,360
it's better for me to be thrifty.


742
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,520
Facing the south, the house is light and spacious.


743
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,230
Yeah.


744
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,230
Living alone,


745
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,430
it's good for me to live simply.


746
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,630
Today we come to


747
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,040
ask you about


748
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,390
the details of receiving the gold that day.


749
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,470
OK.


750
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,710
All the details


751
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,360
include your personal life.


752
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,870
Personal life?


753
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,470
OK.


754
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,230
Start from your living habits.


755
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,950
I live a common life.


756
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,630
On that day,


757
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,150
I did everything as usual.


758
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,600
I got up at 4:30 a.m.


759
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,000
and then got washed.


760
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,080
At 4:40 a.m,


761
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,150
the milk boy sent me milk.


762
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,000
After everything was ready,


763
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,950
I left house at 5:00 a.m.


764
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,800
I didn't go to Jincheng Bank directly that day


765
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,600
but went to Katun Church,


766
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,670
which was appointed with the soldier.


767
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,230
It's right 5:30 a.m when I arrived there.


768
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,040
Was there anything wrong with the time?


769
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,470
Absolutely not.


770
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,080
The milk boy comes on time every day.


771
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,630
He is sure to send the milk at 4:40 a.m.


772
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,710
And I am used to


773
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,710
checking my watch


774
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,870
when I pass the bell tower each time.


775
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,430
The error


776
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,150
is fewer than five minutes.


777
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,840
Have you had the meal?


778
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,710
What's boiling in the pot?


779
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,870
Lotus-nuts sweet soup.


780
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,870
Dried lotus nuts or fresh lotus nuts?


781
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,520
Dried.


782
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,600
Dried lotus nuts are not easy to stew.


783
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,360
How long have you stewed it?


784
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,600
I didn't notice it.


785
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,320
Usually, it depends on the cracks on the lotus nuts


786
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,600
to see if it's cooked well.


787
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,080
Yeah, the lotus nuts need to be boiled to have cracks.


788
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,560
Otherwise it tastes bitter in the core.


789
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,430
Yeah.


790
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,080
That's all. Let's go.


791
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,320
He is going to have the meal.


792
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,230
You also want to share some?


793
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,950
Thank you! Sorry to bother you.


794
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,000
Take care.


795
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,870
Tell me your doubts.


796
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,150
Talking about the lotus-nuts sweet soup suddenly,


797
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,430
you must have thought something is wrong.


798
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,320
Good.


799
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,080
You have made progress.


800
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,560
I just think it's strange.


801
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,910
How can someone remember the time


802
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,870
so clearly?


803
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,870
It seems that whatever he does,


804
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,080
he looks at the time on his watch.


805
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,800
You mean


806
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,910
he over overemphasized the time.


807
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,870
He is so rigorous.


808
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,600
It's surprising that he didn't know how long he had boiled the lotus-nuts sweet soup.


809
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,230
What about taking him back for investigation?


810
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,600
What are you doing?


811
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,320
Tell me


812
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,000
if you send milk to the man on the second floor on time every day.


813
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,800
Who are you?


814
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,950
I'm asking you.


815
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,430
Do you send milk on time every day?


816
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,280
Have you ever inclined to be lazy?


817
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,710
What are you doing?


818
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,760
Let me go.


819
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,280
How do you know he is the milk boy?


820
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,840
Look at here.


821
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,950
Clearly, he left these milk stains


822
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,910
when secretly drinking the milk in a hurry.


823
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,390
Bullshit!


824
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,560
I didn't drink.


825
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,080
Let me go. You refuse to tell me, right?


826
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,470
You refuse to tell me, right?


827
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,760
You refuse to tell me, right?


828
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,280
Little kid,


829
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,470
we want to ask you some questions.


830
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,950
You can refuse to answer them.


831
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,910
But


832
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,560
we will tell your family


833
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,360
what you did.


834
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,910
Tell me


835
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,840
when you send the milk every day.


836
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,670
I don't know the time.


837
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,760
Anyhow, when the steamed bun restaurant starts to chop up stuffings, I will get up.


838
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,230
The milk car is on the street corner.


839
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,320
After taking the milk,


840
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,870
I first send it to the man on the second floor.


841
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,150
It's the same every day.


842
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,910
Is instant-boiled meat


843
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,710
only served by Yongyuande Restaurant?


844
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,910
Must you go to have Guobacai


845
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,950
in Dafulai Restaurant?


846
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,280
Won't you eat roast duck


847
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
out of Zhengyangchun Restaurant?


848
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,230
So


849
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,320
talking about the steamed buns in Tientsin,


850
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,150
must you go to Go believe Restaurant?


851
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,870
I want to ask you why...


852
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,710
Though my shop is small,


853
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,670
it ranks number one


854
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,670
among those shops in the streets north and south.


855
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,910
I want to ask you, on that morning...


856
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,840
Steamed buns with spiced pork,


857
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,190
steamed buns with three delicacies,


858
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,320
steamed buns with vegetable stuffings such as bean sprouts are all enjoyed by people in this yard.


859
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,430
On that morning,


860
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,470
why did you chop up the stuffings half an hour in advance?


861
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,190
Because of a woman.


862
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,000
Steamed buns with spiced pork, three delicacies,


863
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,950
and vegetable stuffings. One trayful for each type.


864
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,190
No need to give me change.


865
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,190
Elder sister.


866
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,320
Sorry to trouble you.


867
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,280
Go on.


868
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,190
The steamed buns with spiced pork, three delicacies...


869
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,470
I ask you about the woman.


870
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,840
The woman...


871
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,600
It was


872
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,910
at about 3:30 a.m before 4:00 a.m


873
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,080
when we were still sleeping


874
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,150
that someone knocked at the door loudly.


875
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,320
I opened the door.


876
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,710
She asked for 100 steamed buns.


877
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,390
I still wanted to sleep for more time.


878
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,470
As you can see,


879
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,760
my mercenary wife


880
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,520
forced me to get up to work.


881
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,360
So I got up


882
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,560
30 minutes earlier than usual


883
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,150
to chop up stuffings.


884
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,280
It's the only time?


885
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,390
Yeah.


886
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,670
How is the woman like?


887
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,630
The woman,


888
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,600
let me tell you...


889
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,190
She can't be a decent woman,


890
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,840
right?


891
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,080
I didn't see her clearly.


892
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,320
No.


893
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,560
I didn't see her at all.


894
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm decent.


895
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,560
How could I see her?


896
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,080
Since you didn't say anything,


897
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,040
how can you talk with them?


898
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,040
Hurry to work.


899
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,910
Just enjoy when they're hot.


900
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,520
It's so late. You still take food to Gu Ying.


901
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,950
I want her to go to the coffin shop with me later.


902
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,470
So I must feed her stomach first.


903
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,360
You need my help to investigate the robbery of gold.


904
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,430
I also need a helper


905
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,560
to investigate the case of the self-sealed coffin.


906
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,230
Lord.


907
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,040
What's up?


908
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,760
She wore a cheongsam.


909
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,120
Cheongsam?


910
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,710
The woman who bought 100 steamed buns


911
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
wore a cheongsam.


912
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,080
Here.


913
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,600
The cheongsam has a hole here.


914
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,000
In the middle,


915
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,870
there is a port-wine mark.


916
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
You really looked carefully.


917
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,950
No. I didn't look carefully.


918
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,390
It's conspicuous.


919
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm a decent person.


920
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,630
Boss. You're really skillful.


921
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,910
The buns taste better than those of Go believe.


922
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,280
Thank you for your praise.


923
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,390
Welcome to come frequently.


924
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,360
It's not suitable.


925
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,630
Really.


926
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,390
It's not suitable.


927
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,080
The woman is not decent.


928
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,840
She smelt very fragrant.


929
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,430
Fragrant.


930
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,150
Take care.


931
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,760
Come here often.


932
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,390
Stealing Yama's lock under the ground,


933
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,520
how dare you come to the heaven to steal peaches?


934
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,000
You didn't see him clearly during the day,


935
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,600
so you come again at night to talk about the old days with him.


936
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,560
Stealthily.


937
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,950
He must be killed by you, right?


938
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,560
I dare not.


939
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,150
I dare not kill him.


940
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,470
It's so dark here. The police station is bright.


941
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,430
Let's go there to have a talk.


942
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,910
No no no. Brother and sister.


943
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,040
I just thought Carpenter Huang was dead,


944
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,320
and there would be nobody in his shop.


945
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,560
So I come here to see


946
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,910
if there is something


947
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,520
that I can take away.


948
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,950
This is a coffin shop,


949
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,280
not a coffer.


950
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,800
What are you interested in?


951
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,320
To tell you the truth,


952
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,870
the business Carpenter Huang did


953
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,430
was harmful to his virtue.


954
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,230
He deserved it.


955
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,040
Say it clearly.


956
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,320
Anyone who can buy a medicinal eaglewood coffin


957
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,320
must be wealthy.


958
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,470
For anyone who bought a coffin from his shop,


959
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,520
he was quite clear of the time


960
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:08,600
and place


961
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,950
of the burial.


962
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,320
The he informed the tomb raider


963
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,840
and dug out the coffin at night,


964
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,190
pulling up the nails on the coffin


965
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,600
and taking away the burial objects.


966
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,840
So you thought


967
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,280
there were still some burial objects left in the coffin


968
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,230
and you came to have a look, right?


969
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,870
Yeah.


970
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,280
Please forgive me.


971
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,710
I didn't kill him.


972
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,560
Was I fierce just now?


973
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,080
More fierce than my mother.
