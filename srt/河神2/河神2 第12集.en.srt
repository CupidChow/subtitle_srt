
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]



00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,070
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]



00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,590
Previously on the story.



00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,670
It was mentioned last time that:



00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,150
Ding Mao got the final clue to enter the game.



00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,640
Gu Ying's identity was exposed.



00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,430
She distracted the guys in black



00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,760
in order to get Xiao Lanlan out of trouble.



00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,110
When she got to the rooftop of a dangerous building,



00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,120
she found the secret of Bai Sihu.



00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,360
Bai Sihu tattooed a painting of flame on Gu Ying's back.



00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,440
Gu Ying discovered the real identify of Bai Sihu.



00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,120
Fan Junyao went to the Dragon King Temple to seek help.



00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,440
He and Guo Deyou snuck into the Enlightenment Academy to save Gu Ying.



00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,070
Zhou Moqing's men



00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,110
captured Bai Sihu and Gu Ying.



00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,910
Following Zhou Moqing,



00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,520
Guo Deyou went through the secret door in the library.



00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,470
On the other side,



00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,400
Ding Mao was taken to the crystal palace



00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,200
and formally entered the game after being interrogated.



00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,040
When Gu Ying lost her mind,



00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,080
and Ding Mao felt all at sea,



00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,790
Bai Sihu broke in.



00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,150
Everybody was poisoned and could not take actions.



00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,520
Bai Sihu committed murder crazily,



00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
while Guo Deyou cracked and won the game.



00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,110
Following the opening of the crystal palace's gate,



00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,310
there came



00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,590
Fu Laiyong taking the credit,



00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,790
Xiao Lanlan getting in hospital,



00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,430
Ao Dan giving a warning,



00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,510
and something else occurring as the wedding day is coming in Dragon King Temple.



00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,190
Tientsin Mystic 2



00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,360
Episode 12



00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,160
Thank you, Mr. Fu.



00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,190
Thank you.



00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,520
Sir,



00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,670
their symptoms of poisoning



00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,520
are not serious.



00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,829
However, these female students



00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,000
have been controlled by drugs for long,



00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,829
so it might take some more time



00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,829
for them to recuperate.



00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,440
A cohort of soldiers



00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,550
suddenly came from the concession



00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,550
and secretly arrested Wu Shuosheng.



00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
He looks gentle and polite,



00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,550
but always did



00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,030
something unethical and villainous



00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,470
behind our backs.



00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Don't judge a man



00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
by his looks.



00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,270
Exactly.



00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,720
Fortunately, we found them in time.



00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,110
Those who went down to enjoy themselves



00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,959
have survived



00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
because they didn't lose much blood.



00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,350
Thank goodness.



00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,200
All of them are well-known and respected personages.



00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,550
If something bad happened to any of them,



00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,350
everything we did would have been in vain even if the case is solved.



00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,550
See?



00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,640
How do I look?



00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,720
You look vigorous.



00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,230
Gosh,



00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,760
I forgot to stand on my tiptoe.



00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,950
If more reporters come and take photos of me later,



00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,159
don't forget to remind me



00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
to stand on tiptoe.



00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,950
What are you doing?



00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,110
Why the heck are you standing on tiptoe?



00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,320
Lower, much lower.



00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,640
Clear all the reporters.



00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,160
Inform all the newspaper offices



00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,790
that nothing should be written



00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,880
about this.



00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,070
Yes.



00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,950
Congratulations for solving another curious case



00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,040
and making new contributions, Mr. Fu.



00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,270
Thank you.



00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,270
If it weren't for



00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,230
Mr. Zheng who came to the site in time



00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,920
and turned the tide



00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,040
after we finished



00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,070
all the work,



00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,830
we wouldn't have gained



00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,510
such great achievement.



00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,510
I'm flattered.



00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,510
However,



00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,070
the superior wants us to suppress the whole matter.



00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,920
After all...



00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,640
Stop.



00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,350
I know.



00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,320
This contribution



00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
can be made but not mentioned.



00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,670
It's not the first time.



00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,760
Got it.



00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,440
How cannot this contribution be mentioned?



00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,230
If the governor hides this case well,



00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,830
and gives enough respect to the foreigners in the French Concession,



00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,670
we will get closer to the foreigners, won't we?



00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,640
The governor will remember what you did for him.



00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,350
Stop taking photos!



00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,830
What are you doing?



00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Impolite.



00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,480
Miss Xiao,



00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,480
the cops are clearing the reporters.



00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,670
You'd better go back to the newspaper office.



00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,830
What are you doing here?



00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
Young Master thought



00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,510
that the superior would not allow this to be reported,



00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,510
so



00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,480
he asked me to convince you to go back.



00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,230
Now



00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,670
he's more and more familiar with the way of doing things in this regard.



00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,550
Young Master worries about you.



00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,070
How is he doing



00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,230
right now?



00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,790
Dr. Rong is treating him.



00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,040
Don't worry.



00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,510
Well?



00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
Have you had fun in Beijing?



00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,390
Is the Gate Building magnificent?



00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,160
However magnificent it is,



00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,230
it must have not satisfied you daring soul.



00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,000
How dare you lie to me?



00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,600
It's spicy!



00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
I want to go home, Deyou.



00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,080
I want to hit people



00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,960
as soon as I get the smell of a hospital.



00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,550
Go back home?



00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,030
The doctor said



00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,880
that tattoo covers most part of your back,



00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,760
so the poison should be cleaned up before you leave.



00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,030
I have a tattoo now.



00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,840
Will you despise me?



00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,230
What are you talking about?



00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,440
I despised you



00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,910
even when you had no tattoo.



00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,350
Enough.



00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,710
I...



00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,640
I want to discuss something serious with you.



00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,080
Something serious?



00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,110
It's about our marriage.



00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,150
Bastard!



00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,030
What's up?



00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,760
We had a deal



00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,150
that whoever mentioned the wedding first



00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,400
would be a bastard, didn't we?



00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,590
You are a bastard, Deyou!



00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,640
Bastard!



00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,670
Go ahead.



00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,110
Gu Weiliang has a key.



00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,520
What key?



00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,080
You have a lock, don't you?



00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,590
What happened to the key?



00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,110
It was lost.



00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,080
Where was it lost?



00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,080
It was lost in the river.



00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,960
I've dived to look for it seven or eight times,



00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,790
but it is never found.



00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
Come on!



00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,150
Just as what your mother



00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,880
said about this…



00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,670
Miss Wang?



00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,670
I'm here to visit Miss Gu.



00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,400
I'd like to



00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,470
talk with her privately.



00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,520
What are you doing?



00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,150
What are you doing?



00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,910
What are you doing?



00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,520
You don't want to make a living? Pulling down the temple?



00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,440
You are about to get married,



00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,000
but you don't have a new house.



00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Since Gu Ying doesn't despise you



00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,470
and is willing to marry into the temple,



00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,080
you should have a decent house to live in.



00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,470
Nice, Tieniu,



00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,400
you are quite sensible.



00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,520
Then why don't you also make a heatable brick bed in Master's room



00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,440
so that he won't suffer from his arthritis in winter.



00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,520
You are telling me?



00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,960
Look, the plaster is transported here.



00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,880
Since we are going to make a heatable brick bed,



00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,790
we need to make a hot one.



00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,670
It's better to be as hot as an alchemy stove



00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,790
in cold winter.



00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,590
Do you hate Master or what?



00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,150
You want to burn Master to practice alchemy?



00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,470
Leave me a removable brick



00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,080
when my room is painted.



00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,710
A removable brick?



00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,550
What are you going to do with it?



00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,350
I want enough room to stash my egg money.



00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,110
Got it.



00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,470
In the mainstream Western medical science



00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,550
medicaments are used to paralyze the pain nerves.



00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,000
But it's hard to avoid



00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,590
the organic damages



00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,910
to the organs.



00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,670
The treatment by Silver Bell Seal



00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
starts from the brain,



00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,520
develops and enlarges the spiritual power



00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,440
to resist



00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,320
damages and pains.



00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm sorry, Miss Xiao.



00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,880
This is all that I can disclose to you.



00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,440
If you want to know



00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,000
more about new medical treatments,



00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
I can recommend you some psychotherapists



00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,710
or hypnotists.



00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,960
Dr. Rong,



00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,470
actually I'm here



00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,710
not only for an interview,



00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,230
but also experiencing the treatment myself.



00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,840
Sorry,



00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,710
we only accept patients with symptoms.



00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,710
If you just feel curious about this...



00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,960
I have a severe insomnia.



00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,640
Actually, I'm not that confident



00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,150
in every judgment



00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,550
I made.



00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,590
The more I'm afraid that something will happen,



00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,280
well...



00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
the more likely it is to happen.



00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,960
How do you feel now?



00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,590
Your insomnia



00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
results from something you are afraid of in your mind.



00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,030
Thank you.



00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,200
You should be regarded with respect.



00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,470
You are brave and prudent.



00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,760
You are young and promising!



00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,150
Thank you.



00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,110
I'm flattered.



00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,200
Mr. Ding,



00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,470
do you think our friendship



00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,670
went through life and death?



00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,110
Yes.



00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,760
Fine, pal.



00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,910
Please accept my gratitude



00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,150
for saving my life.



00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,280
You are welcome.



00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,400
It is Mr. Bai.



00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,230
Mr. Bai.



00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,040
If it weren't for your comprehensive consideration



00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,160
and quick investigation,



00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,589
I would have



00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,760
lost my life.



00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,109
You are welcome, Mr. Bai.



00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,310
Don't treat me as an outsider.



00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,190
Forget Mr. Bai



00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,160
and Mr. Ding.



00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,400
From now on, we are family.



00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,190
Is that so, my brother?



00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,400
Mr. Wu is right.



00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,230
My pal,



00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,590
if you need me for help in the future,



00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,640
just tell me.



00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
Heavenly God!



00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,800
Let the governor be the witness!



00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Today the three of us



00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,230
will become sworn brothers.



00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,040
And have a blood oath.



00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,310
Mr. governor,



00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,230
which opera are you performing?



00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,470
Allow me to introduce him,



00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,800
this is Wang Ziren,



00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,830
the second son of Wang Ximiao,



00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,430
President of Tianjin Tea Business Chamber of Commerce.



00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,040
Nice to meet you.



00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,920
Maybe you guys



00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,950
have met Mr. Wang.



00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,040
I have a bad memory



00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,560
that I can't remember people's names.



00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,590
How about giving me a hint?



00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
The commander has a painting,



00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,710
which is in Mr. Wang's mansion.



00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,310
A painting?



00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,430
A painting?



00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,800
Painting...



00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,590
"The Two Immortals of Harmony and Unity".



00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,590
I...



00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,310
Take a look at my painting.



00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,230
"The Two Immortals of Harmony and Unity" by a great artist in the Ming Dynasty.



00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,230
May you and your wife live a long life in harmony and unity.



00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,350
Isn't this the Fiery Bull Formation



00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,040
at the battlefield in the Warring States Period?



00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,950
How can you give it as a gift?



00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,760
This painting is greatly ferocious.



00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,280
You switched it with the Fiery Bull Scroll?



00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,950
My wife,



00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,110
my primary wife,



00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,280
and even my mistresses,



00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,830
have been blaming me for a whole month.



00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,430
They said



00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,400
I would die from carelessness this life.



00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,830
I know



00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,230
that everyone present wanted to laugh at me that day.



00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,760
However, they dared not



00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,160
because I had this.



00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,590
But from then on,



00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,160
I couldn't sleep well every night,



00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,880
My pal.



00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,070
Do you know why?



00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,040
I'm sad.



00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,190
I'm upset.



00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,560
I think I disappointed Mr. Gu.



00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,950
I did harm to him.



00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,520
If it weren't because that I took the wrong painting,



00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,830
Mr. Gu and his wife would have been the two immortals of harmony and unity.



00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,950
However, I was careless for the time being.



00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
I gave them the Fiery Bull Scroll



00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,470
and watched Mr. Gu



00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,950
burn to death.



00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,830
Not to mention that he was dead,



00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,280
Ding Mao was even held responsible for this,



00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,470
and the curve cut-off was delayed.



00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,430
Whose fault was it?



00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,310
It was his fault.



00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,070
Whose fault was it



00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,160
that we had to sound Ding Mao out?



00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,190
You



00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,430
murderer.



00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,470
Watch the floor!



00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,190
I'll clean it.



00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,920
You made a hole in it.



00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,190
I'll change the floor.



00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,230
It is made of the scented rosewood from Hainan.



00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,800
Is it made of the scented rosewood



00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,560
from Hainan, Mr. Governor?



00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,640
It's OK.



00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,070
The governor said it's OK.



00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,800
Who asked you to switch the painting?



00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,760
I want my father.



00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,640
Dad!



00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,400
Who



00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,760
asked you



00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,520
to switch it?



00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,310
When I was



00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,400
studying abroad,



00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,280
I joined a fraternity.



00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
There was a tradition of playing adventure games.



00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,470
If a mission was accomplished,



00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,430
I could get higher privileges.



00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,520
Before Gu Weiliang got married,



00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,800
I received the order from the fraternity to switch the painting.



00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,430
I thought...



00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,160
I thought it was just a game.



00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,000
A game?



00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,950
Was it fun?



00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,830
You can't kill me.



00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,710
You can't kill me.



00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,310
My father is the president of the Tea Business Chamber of Commerce...



00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Watch the floor!



00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,710
The governor said it's OK.



00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,760
Watch the carpet.



00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,950
Mr. Ding,



00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,350
you are the son of a president too?



00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,430
Yes,



00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,470
I'm the son of a president.



00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,430
But,



00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,400
I'm the eldest son of the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce,



00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,590
the lifeblood in Tianjin.



00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,040
It seems a little different



00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,040
from this guy from the tea business.



00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,350
Different?



00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,190
Something's different.



00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,640
I'm not the President's son.



00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,040
I'm the President.



00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,230
You should be regarded with respect.



00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,430
You are brave and prudent.



00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,470
You are young and promising!



00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,350
This is my initiation into your group.



00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,280
Please take good care of me in the future.



00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,040
When it came to the blood oath,



00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,470
the governor brought us blood.



00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,280
He doesn't want us to hurt ourselves.



00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,000
Exactly.



00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,160
Since the governor cares about us,



00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,310
the three of us



00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,040
should bow to him, am I right?



00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,070
Thank you, Mr. Governor.



00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,160
Thank you, Mr. Governor.



00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,160
My son!



00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,590
My son!



00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,110
My son!



00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,760
What happened to you?



00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,400
My son!



00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,950
My son!



00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,520
Wake up, my son!



00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,680
My son!



00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,040
My son!



00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,160
My son!



00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,040
It's a little late today.



00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm still busy.



00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,680
Make it tomorrow.



00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,430
When I was four or five years old,



00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,470
I found a little bird in the yard.



00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,800
It was grey,



00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,230
and its wing got injured.



00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,040
I tried



00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,230
to show it to my father.



00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,760
It was not out of my mercy on it,



00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,350
and it didn't seem to be out of my curiosity either.



00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,230
Anyway,



00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,400
I just wanted to show it to him.



00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,310
His face



00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,800
looked particularly,



00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,520
particularly strange.



00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,110
From then on,



00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,400
however kind



00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,000
or amiable



00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,470
he was,



00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,430
I would feel a little frightened



00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,590
as long as I recalled what happened that day.



00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,710
I'm afraid



00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,230
that everyone in this world



00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,040
would have another face.



00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,110
So I've never had real trust in anybody,



00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,280
except one person.



00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,350
This guy, however,



00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,350
lied to me too.



00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,070
I know



00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,470
that no matter how I apologize to you,



00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,000
I can't make up for what happened in the past.



00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,070
But I promise you



00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,400
that I will definitely live up to your trust in the future.



00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,830
So I'd like you to promise me something.



00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,560
Please marry me.



00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,470
This is what I planned to request a long time ago.



00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,110
I'm sorry



00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,800
for talking about this all of a sudden.



00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,110
It's a little hasty.



00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,920
I'll get the flowers and ring ready.



00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,590
May I



00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,560
put my trust



00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,230
in you again?



00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,310
Of course.



00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,430
What do you mean by nodding like this?



00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,830
Nothing.



00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,430
So,



00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,560
you won't move anymore?



00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,310
No.



00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,950
In that case, to whom does that apartment belong?



00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,400
What apartment?



00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,400
The one about which we had a deal,



00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,430
with lights



00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,070
and a telephone.



00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,040
It's yours.



00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,590
It's a wedding gift for you.



00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,160
Well, how about you get it cashed



00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,350
together with the staff and vehicles?



00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
Your business won't get delayed, will it?



00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,190
No.



00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,950
Since such a big accident occurred to the Enlightenment Academy,



00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,310
it is closed



00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,350
and said to be moved soon.



00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,470
So the river channel will still go through there.



00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,950
You rushed here in a hurry



00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,350
just to deliver this message?



00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,430
Well,



00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,470
I proposed to Xiao Lanlan.



00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,280
You were so anxious to propose for marriage?



00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,590
Nonsense.



00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,310
It's a real man's responsibility



00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,350
to get married and settle down.



00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,800
You are better



00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,470
than Deyou.



00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,590
Congratulations, Master.



00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,950
You have to make another wedding payment.



00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,470
Your weddings can be held together,



00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,830
so that I'll just need to make one.



00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,560
Why don't you ask us



00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,350
to get married to the same wife?



00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,710
Nonsense.



00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,110
Master,



00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,560
you don't have to make the wedding payment.



00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,190
Just let Deyou do it.



00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,400
I should take more care of you.



00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,470
I'm not the only one you should take care of.



00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,880
You are supposed to visit him.



00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,830
If the river isn't clear,



00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,280
and the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce doesn't revive,



00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,110
I'll be ashamed to meet him.



00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,640
He's old.



00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,230
There's not much time left for him to expect you.



00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,040
I'm old too.



00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,160
I'm tired.



00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,590
It's time to lie down.



00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,280
Just say you want to sleep.



00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,950
Don't talk nonsense.



00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,830
What's wrong with Master?



00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,190
I don't know.



00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Recently he's always been talking something pessimistic.



00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,560
That sounds annoying.



00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,920
By the way,



00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,920
I've asked Fan Junyao



00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,520
to test the paint on the Fiery Bull Scroll



00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,310
and the tattoo on the girl who jumped off the building.



00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,000
Both of them contain a kind of neurotoxin,



00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,040
which is extracted from some kind of red leech.



00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,470
Mr. Fu checked Bai Sihu's painting room



00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,040
and found a lot of red leeches of that kind.



00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,710
I've seen many leeches,



00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,040
and I know they are toxic,



00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,470
but it's my first time to hear about this red leech.



00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,710
We are still investigating



00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,950
the source of this leech.



00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,400
However, it is known



00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,880
that this red leech's toxin



00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,230
can slow the human sympathetic reflexes.



00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,230
Sympathetic...



00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,190
reflexes?



00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,920
What are you doing?



00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,160
You withdrew your hand



00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,950
because you felt the pain.



00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,800
This is how sympathetic reflexes work.



00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,190
However, if the sympathetic reflexes are slowed,



00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,160
a human will lost the ability of stress response.



00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,280
For example, after Gu Weiliang's body started burning,



00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,430
he didn't struggle.



00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,760
The girl who jumped off the building



00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,470
could tolerate the pain of undergoing an autopsy.



00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,520
In this case,



00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,590
Crazy Cui



00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,590
had no expression on his face



00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,800
when he was cut into halves.



00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,280
So the red leech's toxin



00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,070
appeared in every case.



00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,430
Bai Sihu keeps red leeches.



00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,880
Hong Sihu keeps white leeches.



00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,830
Bai Sihu also keeps white...



00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,070
I got it.



00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,590
Bai Sihu is the key



00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,280
to the whole case.



00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,110
Everyone knows that Bai Sihu is the key,



00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,590
but he died inexplicably



00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,070
in the prison of the French Concession.



00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,280
No testimony can be confirmed.



00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,830
All the clues have gone to a dead end.



00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,110
It doesn't matter where those clues have gone.



00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,040
The point is that we have to solve the case.



00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,400
You just said



00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,800
the sympathetic...



00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,520
The sympathetic reflexes.



00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,230
The sympathetic reflexes.



00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
Come on, slowly.



00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,190
Don't hit yourselves, come on.



00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,800
Here I am.



00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,080
Don't blame me.



00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,360
A young couple are going to live in this room in the future,



00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,320
so it's inappropriate for you to lie down like this.



00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,760
I'm sorry.



00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,040
We are going to get you to another room to sleep.



00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
One, two, go.



00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,670
Up.



00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,470
The water is coming!



00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,710
Exactly,



00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,390
the prosperity grows like rising wind and water.



00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,320
Is the time right?



00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,950
More or less.



00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,760
Sorceress Zhang figured this out.



00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,430
That's all.



00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,800
Mr. Guo.



00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Dragon King Temple



00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,760
is just a tiny place.



00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,360
Well,



00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,360
you corpse-salvage team has occupied some room here,



00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,150
and the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce has occupied some room there.



00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,280
So you left



00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,870
people I invited behind?



00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,120
How could you guys do that?



00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,760
Let me take a look.



00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,710
OK, go ahead.



00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,430
Mr. Huang from the coffin workshop,



00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,520
Granny Tang who walks on stilts,



00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,670
and Master Tian who plays the monochord.



00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,320
Exactly.



00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,390
They have nothing to do with Mr. Guo!



00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,840
The corpse-salvage team



00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,430
has a close relationship with Mr. Guo, don't you think so?



00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,470
Come on.



00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,320
Come with me!



00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,470
You brat.



00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,840
You, you brat.



00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,230
Brat,



00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,560
where are you taking my censer to?



00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,760
Where are you taking my censer to?



00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
Where are you taking my censer to?



00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,710
Let me ask you a question.



00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,390
You are taking advantage of the safety in numbers, aren't you?



00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,600
I'm not afraid of that, you know.



00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,080
Today I'd like to tell you,



00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,670
you should give priority



00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,190
to those people I invited.



00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,390
You can just go back and take a rest.



00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,320
We are sure to get everything



00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,120
ready and lively for you,



00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,870
OK?



00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,710
Why did you invite Matchmaker Xie too?



00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,560
Don't you know we always fight each other



00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
as soon as we meet?



00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,950
Well, have you



00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,280
figured out the order



00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,670
of the six ceremonies



00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,870
of betrothal and marriage?



00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,950
And what about the gift money?



00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,190
Haven't you figured out a number yet?



00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,230
Miss Wang?



00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,430
You are here right in time. So I don't have to invite you here.



00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,950
Tomorrow is my wedding,



00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,360
please come to dinner, OK?



00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,870
Your wedding?



00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,630
The wedding of Gu Ying and me.



00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,560
We are getting married tomorrow.



00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,670
Congratulations.



00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,840
What can I do for you?



00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,840
Nothing.



00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,000
Since tomorrow is your wedding,



00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,800
you might be quite busy.



00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,560
So I'm leaving now.



00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,390
Wait a minute.



00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,390
Wait a minute.



00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,870
As you haven't told me what you tried to say,



00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,080
I might feel upset at my wedding tomorrow.



00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,230
If you have something to say, just get to the point.



00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,910
I found this



00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,320
when I was going through Weiliang's belongings.



00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,520
After thinking over and over again,



00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,430
I want to tell you something.



00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,360
He used to major in painting arts



00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
when he was studying abroad.



00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,230
He loved to sketch things he saw



00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,390
at ordinary times.



00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,360
Well,



00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,230
this is just a sketchbook.



00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,520
Mr. Gu



00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,670
visited Dragon King Temple?



00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,320
Add less water



00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,670
to the putty.



00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,710
It gets clotted.



00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,470
Come on.



00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:14,840
Here.



00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,520
Mr. Guo.



00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,560
There!



00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,950
Pass it, come on.



00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,840
Look at you,



00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,230
your work is finished?



00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,760
What are you doing?



00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,230
What are you doing here?



00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,040
Nothing.



00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,390
You don't supervise



00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,320
the construction outside.



00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,710
What are you doing here?



00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,190
I'm on it.



00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,230
I'm on it.



00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,040
Why do you make so many medicine packets today?



00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,080
You prepared them for your grand disciple?



00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,630
Thunders also occur on sunny days.



00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,910
It's right



00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,230
to get more prepared



00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,080
for everything.



00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,320
Just go get married.



00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,630
Don't ask



00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,150
about anything else.



00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,430
Mr. Gu visited the Dragon King Temple?



00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,710
However low the ignition temperature of phosphor is,



00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,000
it is at least 40 degrees Celsius.



00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,710
How come the West Lake Restaurant was that hot?



00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,040
Gu Weiliang died of the auto-ignition of phosphor indeed.



00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,520
You were hiding in your room without showing up



00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,190
at Mr. Guo's wedding.



00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,710
And today you were absent



00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
when the seats and duties were arranged.



00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,360
In your childhood, you always came here once you felt unhappy.



00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Today I think



00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,950
that if i can find you here,



00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,710
that means you are unwilling to marry me at all.



00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,600
I feel grieved



00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,080
when I recalled how my mother



00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,870
got busy with things



00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,320
crazily and noisily like a donkey.



00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,390
It is just my own wishful thinking.



00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,910
Since you are unwilling to marry me,



00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,760
my mother and I would feel embarrassed.



00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,120
If you keep pretending to cry, that's indeed embarrassing.



00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,600
My mother taught me all of this,



00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,670
and I also feel hypocritical.



00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,910
But she insisted that I pay a visit.



00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,190
You know,



00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,080
if you are Gu Weiliang's real daughter,



00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,910
is it appropriate for you to marry me?



00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,600
It turns out



00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,910
that I might be out of your league



00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,710
if I'm identified as a beautiful swan someday.



00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,430
Deyou,



00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,360
even if the blessing book



00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,430
confirms that I'm his real daughter,



00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,630
you are the only one I'd accept in this world.



00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,870
Blessing book?



00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,080
When Wang Meiren visited me in the hospital,



00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,870
she told me



00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,600
that she knew the name of the midwife who delivered the baby of the Gu family.



00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,840
It was virtuous to work as a midwife.



00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,760
After a delivery, she would record the information



00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,360
about the baby and the family



00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,080
and compiled it into a blessing book.



00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,470
When she died,



00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,080
she would bring the blessing book to the King of Hell,



00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,910
and then she could be reincarnated in a good family.



00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,950
As long as I can find this midwife,



00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,520
and ask her to check the blessing book



00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,910
to see if there's any information inside



00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,870
that matches mine,



00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,280
I'll know if I'm a beautiful swan.



00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:56,950
Deyou,



00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,430
if you really don't want me to find her,



00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,840
just tell me.



00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,600
As long as you want to,



00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,230
I'm willing to find her with you.



00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,600
It is better



00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,950
to make things clear.



00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,710
Look,



00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,630
there's putty everywhere on the ground.



00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,560
How should I clean it away?



00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,910
Cleaning it away would be a waste of time.



00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,320
When my daughter gets married tomorrow,

my daughter might suffer a lot after she's married.



00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,760
Well, I'll boil some water first



00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,560
and disinfect this dirty temple.



00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,190
Master.



00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,760
Please listen to the Corpse-salvage Song.
