00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]


2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,039
Let's come back to our story


3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,300
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,400
and continue.


5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,580
Previously, we talked about


6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,100
Ding Mao investigated the case with injuries.


7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,780
He got to know that the electrician was supposed to be the culprit of the case of "Mr. Hu".


8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,910
Xiao Lanlan found some clues in the scene of the explosion


9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,450
and she asked Fan Junyao for help.


10
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,110
They two probed the scene


11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,990
and they confirmed the father of Xiao Lanlan died of electromagnetic explosion.


12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,980
Yusi found Xiao Lanlan


13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,620
and told her that the driver of her father had the suspicion of killing him.


14
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,820
Later, the corpses of the electrician, driver and plasterer


15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,550
were found on the streets one after another.


16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,010
Ding Mao found the causes of death of the three persons were the same.


17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,060
They died of cryogenic burns.


18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,170
Gu Ying comforted Xiao Lanlan,


19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,690
and she inadvertently found that the case of them conformed to the statues of ox.


20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,060
Ding Mao and Fan Junyao discussed about the case.


21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,450
Ding Mao suspected that Fan Junyao had something to do with the case.


22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,430
Guo Deyou obeyed the order of his master,


23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,990
so he wouldn't investigate the case of the three elder men publicly.


24
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,300
Tieniu and Niqiu investigated the case secretly.


25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,820
Tieniu sneaked into the refrigeration house and hid himself,


26
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,350
which allowed him to find


27
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,459
that old friends had died and gone forever.


28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,190
A dangerous situation appeared in Tientsin


29
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,000
Guo Deyou expressed his condolences


30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,330
and intended to break through the cage again.


31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,450
Young Master,


32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,200
all departments are waiting for your plan for the drought.


33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,120
The two leaders of the warehouse in the east


34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,110
have been sitting in the lobby for two hours.


35
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,320
I said I wouldn't meet them.


36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,130
The electrician, driver and plasterer,


37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,600
were confirmed to be the murders


38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,970
of the three explosion cases,


39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
but those who


40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,260
are related to the three persons


41
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,860
haven't been found yet.


42
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,320
You mean, what should weâ€¦


43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,090
Investigate harder.


44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,270
Increase the police forces, expend the scope and shorten the time.


45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,280
I'll arrange as you command.


46
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't fully focus on investigating the case,


47
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,820
since you're also the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.


48
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,990
Do mess up your own business.


49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,880
Take care.


50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,800
Jianghu.


51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,340
Science.


52
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,140
Kung fu.


53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,660
Truth.


54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,079
Nine statues of ox.


55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,380
Two statues of tiger.


56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
One statue of rooster.


57
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,540
Mr. Guo.


58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,620
Siegmund.


59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
Master Guo.


60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,420
Tieniu.


61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,060
I'm a pretty good swimmer.


62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,020
Eh.


63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
Accomplish your own business.


64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,540
The Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce.


65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,580
Chairman Ding.


66
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,320
It's all my fault.


67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,279
I wish you a happy voyage.


68
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,300
Deyou.


69
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,839
My friend can swim as well as you.


70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,840
River God.


71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,060
Tientsin Mystic 2


72
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,980
Episode 15


73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,930
The river has dried up so severely.


74
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,460
How could anyone drown in it?


75
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,490
How?


76
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,020
The cases happen one after another.


77
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,370
It's too aberrant.


78
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,220
Isn't he Tieniu of the Corpse-salvage Team?


79
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,820
Nope.


80
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,560
An "ox" died again.


81
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,470
The guard is about to be broken through and a sea monster is coming.


82
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,870
A sea monster?


83
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,940
Move away. Move away. More away.


84
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,950
Policemen are coming.


85
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,490
Come on, cordon off the area.


86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,350
What are you looking at? What are you looking at?


87
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,420
Stop it.


88
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,060
Move. Move.


89
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,150
Move. Move. Move.


90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,880
Move. Move.


91
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,970
Step back. Step back.


92
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,060
Dismiss. Dismiss.


93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,380
You don't think it's a serious case, do you?


94
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,500
Dismiss. Dismiss. Dismiss.


95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,480
Who do you think you are?


96
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,380
Niqiu,


97
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,050
what do you say?


98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,570
Why do the members of the Corpse-salvage Team


99
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,940
not know you?


100
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,210
Don't let Tieniu lie down here anymore.


101
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,420
Yeah.


102
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,260
How come Brother Niu would lie down here?


103
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,420
Buddies, let's help


104
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,110
lay Tieniu in a coffin.


105
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,610
Step back.


106
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,230
Deyou.


107
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,120
Brother Niu said


108
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,510
he would avenge the death of Master Guo.


109
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,200
Beside him,


110
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,890
all the members of the Corpse-salvage Team are investigating the case.


111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,830
Will it be that


112
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,010
Brother Niu died today,


113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,180
tomorrow I will die


114
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,740
and so will they the day after tomorrow?


115
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,140
Are you able to lay all of us in the coffins?


116
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,700
Go back home and have a rest.


117
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,250
Deyou, you should go back.


118
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,670
-Mr. Guo.
 -Deyou.


119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,530
Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo.


120
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,240
Deyou.


121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,590
His families have yet to come. What are you doing?


122
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,740
I have to bring my friend back.


123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,470
The case happened just now.


124
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,330
The corpse of him will be brought to the police station.


125
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,930
Release me.


126
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,140
Don't embrace me.


127
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,810
I said you're not qualified for it.


128
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,570
Brother Niu doesn't have a friend like you.


129
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,390
Release him.


130
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,870
Release him. Release him. Release him.


131
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,450
Release him.


132
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,240
Release him. Let him go.


133
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,730
Mr. Guo, you'd better leave first.


134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,230
We'll deal with the thing here.


135
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,200
You should go.


136
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,130
It's the first time I've witnessed that the Little River God was so frustrated.


137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,290
Whoever will feel frustrated, when something like this happens to him.


138
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,250
Leave. Everyone should leave here. 
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.


139
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,280
Everyone should leave here. Everyone should leave here.


140
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,090
Move. Move. Move.


141
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,730
What's happening?


142
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,010
Why should we have a meeting this late?


143
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,890
We've overcome almost all the difficulties of the grain transport.


144
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,180
Who knows the river would dry up?


145
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,910
We transport grain through rivers.


146
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,120
Now the river has dried up.


147
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,530
The elders are so worried.


148
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,520
They wanted to have a meeting with you earlier,


149
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,370
but they haven't seen you for a few days.


150
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,290
When you meet them later,


151
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,480
they'll definitely scold you.


152
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
You have to understand it.


153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,340
Well, invite Mr. Siegmund


154
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,640
here tomorrow.


155
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,790
I have something to talk to him.


156
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,940
Young Master, the apartments


157
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,850
we rent for these Germen


158
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,710
are empty.


159
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,400
Where are they?


160
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,450
They have left without a notice.


161
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,690
I've checked the departure record.


162
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,350
Mr. Siegmund and his assistant


163
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,440
have already returned to Deutsche.


164
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,970
Why haven't you told me earlier?


165
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,130
Spill it out.


166
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,810
I've


167
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,070
told you earlier.


168
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,250
But you didn't pay attention to my word at that time.


169
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,870
It's all my fault. I didn't watch them carefully.


170
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,280
Let's go.


171
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Take your time, Young Master.


172
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,270
I'm sorry. I'm late.


173
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,960
When a crisis happened to the Chamber,


174
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,880
we couldn't find our chairman.


175
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,590
It's so ridiculous.


176
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,240
It's my negligence.


177
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,480
I'll try my utmost to


178
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,690
deal with the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce.


179
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,780
Deal with what?


180
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,470
Do you know what happened to the Chamber?


181
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,310
You've been the Secretary General of the government,


182
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,760
so you condescend to be our chairman.


183
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,130
Sixth Brother,


184
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,830
we can talk about


185
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,550
what has happened to the Chamber,


186
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,220
and I'm about to deal with it immediately.


187
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,010
What's it?


188
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,690
See, I've told you all.


189
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,970
He didn't know what it is at all.


190
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,450
They're receipts of futures.


191
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,290
The stockpiles won't be a big problem.


192
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,410
If we fail to deliver them,


193
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,670
we'll lose the initial freight at most.


194
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,400
But our future goods are all


195
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,810
grains and fruits.


196
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,210
If we fail to deliver them,


197
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,750
we'll have to store them in our warehouses.


198
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,080
If these goods go rotten,


199
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,190
we'll have to pay the compensation three times of the payments for goods.


200
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,560
The rule has come into force


201
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,290
since grain transport appeared.


202
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,890
The future goods are the key of grain transport.


203
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,650
How are


204
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,730
the goods now?


205
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,780
They've started to go rotten.


206
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,850
Chairman wouldn't


207
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,220
predict the drought, would he?


208
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,100
If it were about the drought alone,


209
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,090
it would be the calamity caused by God.


210
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,490
Then I would say nothing about it.


211
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,800
But he has issued the order to suspend the delivery.


212
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,400
How could he do this?


213
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,150
He promised to reopen transportation


214
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,300
when the cut-bend project was done this month.


215
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,710
But what happened?


216
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,120
What happened?


217
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,570
When your father was alive,


218
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,260
he would suspend half of the delivery at most


219
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,500
to ensure the other half.


220
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,060
Encouraging both natural and man-made disasters,


221
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,900
grain transport


222
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,810
might be ruined.


223
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,790
These days,


224
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,520
Young Master has been investigating the case day and night.


225
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,210
He doesn't wanna see that Director Hu was killed in vain.


226
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,510
He has been the chairman for a short time,


227
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,860
so there's a lot he doesn't understand.


228
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,260
I'm the one who you're supposed to blame.


229
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,060
I know everything


230
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,210
while I failed to stop him.


231
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,420
You should punish me.


232
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,430
Forget it. To punish you?


233
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,580
Who do you think you are?


234
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,140
Besides, don't mention Director Hu later.


235
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,550
If it hadn't been because of him,


236
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,500
Director Hu couldn't have been locked up, could he?


237
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,710
Sixth Younger Brother.


238
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,590
The post of Chairman


239
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,180
can't fall vacant.


240
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,120
But you can't serve as a chairman


241
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,530
without doing anything.


242
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,100
So, everyone,


243
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,240
what else could I do to help you?


244
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,270
Go into liquidation based on the odds.


245
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,190
Go find a good accountant.


246
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,730
Don't settle the accounts by mistake.


247
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,990
Dismiss.


248
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,450
Go back and take care of one's own warehouse.


249
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,260
We won't make it. We can only suspend the delivery.


250
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
Then report to the Chamber of Commerce.


251
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,680
Dismiss.


252
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,440
You can keep indulging him.


253
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,490
Chairman Ding,


254
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
after I compensate for the goods,


255
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,200
the my entire family


256
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,180
can die of it,


257
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,910
thanks to you.


258
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,430
You can leave.


259
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,070
Young Master.


260
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,070
Close the door.


261
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,570
You didn't allow me to investigate your case.


262
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,390
I promised.


263
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,630
But now Tieniu died.


264
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,740
I wanna investigate his case.


265
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,050
It's what I owe to him.


266
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,860
If you agree,


267
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,870
you should give back the ability of discerning grievance by burning the tobacco pipe to me.


268
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,410
Otherwise,


269
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,730
you could let me die in that box.


270
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,320
What the hell!


271
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,880
The Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce you founded at the cost of your lives


272
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,230
will be ruined


273
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,910
by me eventually.


274
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,810
Get up.


275
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,680
Get up.


276
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,330
Deyou.


277
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Mum, he hasn't woken up.


278
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,060
He's vomiting. It's good for him.


279
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,130
He is back to life.


280
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,060
The tobacco pipe is empty.


281
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,980
You regard yourself as a chimney, don't you?


282
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,670
If my mom hadn't filled you with three pots of strong tea,


283
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,190
you wouldn't have seen the Dragon King but King of Hell.


284
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,390
I worry about you every day.


285
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,310
I can neither have a good sleep nor enjoy a meal.


286
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,310
But I failed to stop you from doing this.


287
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,000
Stopping the investigation of the case is not a big deal,


288
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,410
but now you even wanna kill yourself.


289
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,630
If you do wanna investigate the case,


290
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,360
you should light the tobacco pipe for your master


291
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,570
and propose a toast to him


292
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,370
to let him know the whole story.


293
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,480
If you don't wanna investigate it,


294
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,870
you won't have to kneel down here.


295
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,340
Loyalty and filial piety


296
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,940
won't be expressed by kneeling down.


297
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,270
Daughter, let's go.


298
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,160
The running water won't stop flowing by a cut.


299
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,790
Spiraling smoke won't be stopped by a broken fan.


300
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,550
A person


301
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,330
should learn how to accomplish his own business.


302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,730
Yusi.


303
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,970
What's wrong, Young Master?


304
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,570
It's okay.


305
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,700
You're free to go. Thank you.


306
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,700
Why Yusi gave it to me is that


307
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,770
he worried about you.


308
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,250
You shouldn't blame him.


309
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,930
Now that you had written it,


310
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,210
why did you have to knead it?


311
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,870
It's merely a letter of resignation, isn't it?


312
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,830
I have no idea.


313
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,800
You arranged a place for my father


314
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,820
to hide himself,


315
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,380
so you didn't dare to meet me, did you?


316
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,240
I have no idea.


317
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,940
How will you deal with the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce?


318
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,560
I have no idea.


319
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,360
When will you leave?


320
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,120
Next month.


321
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,440
Can you finish dealing with


322
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,600
what you're doing


323
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,450
in a month?


324
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,050
I can submit two letters of resignation.


325
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,740
What else can I do?


326
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,980
I've also ordered a steamer ticket for you.


327
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,830
But


328
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,500
I thought


329
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,500
you wouldn't leave with me.


330
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,690
Do you owe me a letter of resignation?


331
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,820
"I've been tired of


332
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,640
everything happened in Tientsin.


333
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,580
The overseas land is waiting for me.


334
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,140
I want freedom.


335
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,540
Now I wanna resign from my job as


336
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,350
the fiancÃ© of Xiao Lanlan who's the only daughter of the Xiaos.


337
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,700
I hope my successor


338
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,020
could cherish the orphan girl


339
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,030
who's alive in the world without a family,


340
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,220
and treat her well.


341
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,280
Don't leave her behind."


342
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,680
Lanlan,


343
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,570
don't investigate the case anymore.


344
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,580
Go with me, will you?


345
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,380
The murder sent me a gift


346
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,540
on my birthday,


347
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,340
which I didn't like at all.


348
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,470
Before I


349
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,500
sent it back,


350
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,420
I wouldn't go anywhere.


351
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,750
I promised you


352
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,840
that I would protect your father,


353
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,740
but an accident happened to your father.


354
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,970
I also promised Uncle Hu


355
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,230
that I would take care of the Chamber of Commerce,


356
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,240
but it fell apart.


357
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,530
I spared no effort


358
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,020
to solve the case,


359
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,560
but


360
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,120
the murderer was dead


361
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,100
and the clues were disrupted.


362
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,080
So why should I stay here?


363
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,320
You don't wanna accomplish those things, so nothing is done.


364
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,630
Lanlan.


365
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,530
Lanlan,


366
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,470
go with me.


367
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,670
If you don't promise me this,


368
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,520
I'll be able to achieve nothing.


369
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,680
Will you promise me?


370
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,700
You wanna unburden yourself with all the responsibilities,


371
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,620
which is your choice.


372
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,200
But if you want me to


373
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,390
do the same as you,


374
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,510
I can just say sorry to you.


375
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,330
I'm really not able to


376
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,020
encourage you


377
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,970
who are about to give up on everything.


378
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,450
I'm sorry.


379
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,430
We do care for one another,


380
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,530
but being sorry for each other is unnecessary.


381
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,170
You can


382
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,190
consider me coming here as seeing you off.


383
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,540
Chairman Ding,


384
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,350
I wish you a happy voyage.


385
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,320
Miss Xiao. Miss Xiao.


386
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,990
I'm begging you.


387
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,590
Please go persuade Young Master one more time, will you?


388
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,530
If he leaves,


389
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,130
he won't be able to come back anymore.


390
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,040
If there aren't streets and roads outside,


391
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,110
people won't suffer from the bitterness of farewell.


392
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,210
He's free to choose where to go.


393
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:36,970
Miss Xiao.


394
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,190
Let him go.


395
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,960
Several days have passed. Why do you come so late?


396
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,380
You can't drink alcohol, can you?


397
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,470
The liquor was made in the year when I was brought back by my master.


398
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,030
Even though I can't drink alcohol,


399
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,040
I have to drink it for him


400
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,020
to accomplish his will.


401
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,720
In fact,


402
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,740
I'm here to say goodbye.


403
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,210
Where are you going?


404
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,470
Deutsche.


405
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
I wanna do some medical research quietly for several years.


406
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,580
It's pretty good.


407
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,080
What about you?


408
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,180
I just wanna live a quiet and peaceful life.


409
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,700
It's also pretty good.


410
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,450
To do some researches?


411
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,390
Isn't it because you failed to handle what you're doing


412
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,670
and you wanna escape from here?


413
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,640
You wanna live a peaceful and quiet life?


414
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,730
Since you're over concerned,


415
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,210
how could you make it?


416
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,170
I could.


417
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,920
And I would for sure.


418
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,140
The severe drought in Tientsin is none of my business.


419
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,640
And the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce doesn't belong to me.


420
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,810
Why couldn't I live a peaceful life?


421
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,270
How did your master die?


422
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,190
I know what you're worrying about. Do you still feel quiet and peaceful?


423
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,560
You don't at all.


424
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,390
I don't have the right to take care of the thing


425
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,199
while you refuse to do.


426
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,620
Let's propose a toast of the beat Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce.


427
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,070
I'm not able to solve the case while you refuse to do it.


428
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,530
Let's propose a toast to the murderer at large.


429
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,750
To Director Hu.


430
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,190
To Tieniu.


431
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,620
What are you talking about?


432
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,620
Master,


433
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,670
you're coming at a right time.


434
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,199
I'll pour the liquor for you.


435
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,280
Well, Master,


436
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,230
I hope you can be more vigorous, though you're aged.


437
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,489
What are you saying? Is our master an elderly?


438
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,320
You can't say anything sweet, can you?


439
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,429
Master,


440
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,800
if you drink the shot of liquor,


441
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,320
you will be as versatile as the young garlic shoot


442
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,990
which is blooming in March.


443
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,610
How could you compare our master to a flower?


444
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,270
Master is supposed to live long and remain


445
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,450
as strong as the evergreen pine and fir tree, and the ever-flowing East China Sea.


446
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,730
Cheers.


447
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,390
What do you intend to do?


448
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,860
Talk to me.


449
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,970
When it comes to what I can do,


450
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,430
I'm not able to fish corpses


451
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,590
while my ability of discerning grievance by burning the tobacco pipe has gone.


452
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,510
I'm wondering


453
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,920
I might have to change my profession.


454
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,250
Grinding beans and selling soya-bean oil are fine.


455
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,740
Selling deep-fried dough cakes and making bean curd are also good.


456
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,520
As long as I'm full, each profession will work.


457
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,890
As for me,


458
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,430
I used to be a forensic student, didn't I?


459
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,990
I have to be a doctor.


460
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,360
I intend to go back to Deutsche


461
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,750
to learn internal medicine, surgery and general family medicine,


462
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,860
as the old saying says, "Live and learn".


463
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,630
Okay.


464
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,490
Then I wish you


465
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,660
would achieve academic excellence.


466
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,540
I wish your business would be booming.


467
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,340
To our master.


468
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,900
We wish everything would go as you expect,


469
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,820
and you would be lucky and healthy.


470
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,420
I only have one word,


471
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,170
which is to live a good life.


472
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,050
Don't make me worry about you two.


473
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,630
I feel I'm like a pool of slime.


474
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,700
What are you talking about?


475
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,890
In my eyes,


476
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,560
you're the pillar of the city.


477
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,300
Can you leave without caring about anything?


478
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,480
Can you leave all these affairs behind?


479
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,810
Senior Brother,


480
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,100
where are you going?


481
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,430
I'm here, ain't I?


482
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,340
Come back.


483
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,180
Please.


484
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,710
Don't leave here.


485
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,060
You're able to build this silly box


486
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,980
while you don't dare to show up.


487
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,590
What a coward!


488
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,410
Do you think the silly thing


489
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,160
could trap me?


490
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,960
What the hell?


491
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,050
Deep-fried dough cakes and bean curd jelly.


492
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,420
Freak you off.


493
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,150
I'm the River God.


494
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,590
I know


495
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,310
you care for me,


496
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,120
so you don't want me to investigate the case.


497
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,220
But I care for you too.


498
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,320
So I have to do it.


499
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,080
You saved my life


500
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,040
and raised me up.


501
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,360
I'll definitely live a good life.


502
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,760
When we will meet in Hades,


503
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,060
I could explain it to you.


504
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,550
Please wait and see.


505
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,260
Without the ability of discerning grievance by burning the tobacco pipe,


506
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,230
I would also make it.


507
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,910
My pal couldn't have been drowned.


508
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,280
He's as a good swimmer as I.


509
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,290
It's Tieniu's autopsy report.


510
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,130
He had burns all over his body,


511
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,280
including his respiratory tract.


512
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,970
He was thrown into the river after he died.


513
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,830
Besides,


514
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,260
we found this


515
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,230
in his stomach.


516
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,950
"Yi Leng"?


517
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,260
It seems a hand covered his arm


518
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,110
when he burned.


519
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,710
So there was a handprint left.


520
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,420
Two clues,


521
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,880
each of us takes care of one respectively.
