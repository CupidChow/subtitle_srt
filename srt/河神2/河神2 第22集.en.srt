[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,230
Let's come back to our story and continue.


4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,440
In last episode,


5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,190
feeling indignant,


6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,720
Carpenter Huang killed tomb raider Zhang.


7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,560
Cheating Carpenter Huang,


8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,560
Yuehong intended to revenge for tomb raider Zhang.


9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,470
Then shadow play Liu arrived.


10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,440
Seeing shadow play Liu kill Yuehong by himself,


11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,520
Carpenter Huang escaped from the window with pain.


12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,710
Hearing the death of shadow play Liu,


13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,390
Carpenter Huang also died.


14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,440
It's a pity that they four of the same school


15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,870
all died.


16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,150
Based on the pithy formula left by Carpenter Huang,


17
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,590
Guo Deyou looked for the gold.


18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,310
Diving to the tomb in the water and breaking the mechanism,


19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,720
he found the tomb was suspicious.


20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,750
Diving to the tomb again, he found the source of the tomb.


21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,470
When opening the mechanism, he fell into a narrow passage.


22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,310
Unexpectedly, Gu Ying also fell inside.


23
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,750
Trapped in the water dungeon, they were in great danger.


24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Hearing of it, Ding Mao stopped the physical therapy,


25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,110
sending divers to search and rescue them.


26
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,400
As a result,


27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,470
he was in a magically changed realm and got instructed.


28
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,840
The real murderer withdrew. Two tigers died.


29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,590
Guo Deyou entered the dreamland realm


30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,630
to ask the murderer for the silver bell seal.


31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,910
Jianghu.


32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,800
Science.


33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,440
Kung fu.


34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,229
Truth.


35
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,080
Nine statues of ox.


36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,120
Two statues of tiger.


37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,960
One statue of rooster.


38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,520
Crippled.


39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,600
Rong people.


40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,390
Grateful.


41
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,240
Tortoise.


42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,520
Full the stomach first.


43
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,000
Build a factory.


44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,110
Underwater therapy.


45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,190
Take it seriously.


46
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,829
Take it easy.


47
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,720
White phosphorus bomb.


48
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,880
Just a joke.


49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,360
Life.


50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,110
Worthy.


51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Ying.


52
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,440
River God.


53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,360
Tientsin Mystic 2


54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,360
Episode 22


55
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,790
Uncle Guo made the rules that,


56
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,350
when someone of the Dragon Temple died,


57
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,480
a piece of red cloth was to be tied on this rope.


58
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,070
Look. This belongs to Tieniu,


59
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,830
broad and thick.


60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,720
This belongs to uncle Guo.


61
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,270
I need to tie it closely in the middle.


62
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,040
These two belong to us


63
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,670
with the same length and depth.


64
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,159
They're matched, right?


65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,510
I need to tie them together,


66
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,000
next to uncle Guo.


67
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,070
Deyou, give me a hand.


68
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,640
Guo Deyou.


69
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,760
You didn't keep your words.


70
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,390
You promised to


71
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,830
keep your life given by uncle Guo.


72
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,880
It's not your life,


73
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,110
but uncle Guo's.


74
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,510
How could you give it up so easily?


75
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,270
You are not filial.


76
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,320
The Haihe River is in a drought at present.


77
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,510
Common people living on water live a hard life,


78
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
helplessly seeing


79
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,830
the river which gave birth to and brought them up hit by disasters.


80
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
As the Little River God,


81
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,110
how could you neglect it?


82
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,350
You are not loyal to the Haihe River.


83
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,070
So many brothers in the corpse-salvage team are waiting for you in hunger.


84
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,950
Tieniu has just died.


85
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,350
If you also died,


86
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,600
it would be likely that they would be part with each other.


87
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,390
You're not responsible for the corpse-salvage team.


88
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,790
As for me,


89
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,670
it's just a paper of marriage,


90
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,040
unrealized.


91
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,760
Anyhow, you have done lots of heartless things to me


92
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,350
since we were young.


93
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
If you died,


94
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,000
you would be disloyal, unfilial,


95
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
heartless and irresponsible,


96
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,230
good-for-nothing.


97
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,840
You are still my Deyou.


98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,640
I have thought so since I was young.


99
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,080
Anyhow,


100
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,790
it's worth


101
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,960
dying with you today.


102
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,000
Little River God.


103
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,110
Little River God.


104
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,080
Guo Deyou. Mr. Guo.


105
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,200
Little River God. Mr. Guo.


106
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,790
Little River God.Little River God.


107
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,590
Master Guo.


108
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,910
Guo Deyou. You bastard.


109
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,790
Master Guo.


110
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,590
Bastard.


111
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,350
Guo Deyou.


112
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,960
Mr. Guo.


113
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,790
Guo Deyou.


114
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,350
Lord Guo.


115
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,000
Mr. Guo.


116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,520
Lord Guo.


117
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,150
Little River God.


118
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,790
Guo Deyou.


119
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,470
Little River God.


120
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,280
Guo Deyou.


121
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,030
Little River God.


122
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,150
Guo Deyou. Guo Deyou. Guo Deyou.


123
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,880
Little River God.


124
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,230
Guo Deyou. Guo Deyou.  Guo Deyou.


125
00:10:59,230 --> 00:10:59,960
Deyou.


126
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,080
Deyou.


127
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
Deyou.


128
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,200
When I was in the water,


129
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
nobody could stop me.


130
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,790
Ying. Wake up.


131
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,030
It's open. We can get out.


132
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,110
Don't behave like this.


133
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,910
Open your eyes.


134
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,440
Don't pretend. I promised to marry you.


135
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,080
Ying.


136
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,200
Let's order 50 tables for guests instead of 30 tables in Dengyinglou Restaurant,


137
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,880
OK?


138
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,670
Gold bracelet. Gold rings. Gold hair clasp.


139
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,670
God necklace. Gold hat.


140
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,550
Isn't it shiny?


141
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,910
Ying. Get up.


142
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,520
Get up. OK?


143
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,400
Let's eat sweetened baked wheaten cake.


144
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,280
Ying.


145
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,320
Give me.


146
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Feed me. You want me to eat it by myself?


147
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,550
Just dream it.


148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,960
Let's eat it outside.


149
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Is there anybody in the water?


150
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,840
Yeah.


151
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,640
Pull. Pull.


152
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,790
Pull.


153
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,840
Did you take the sweetened baked wheaten cake here?


154
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,910
Childe.


155
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,000
We found them,


156
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,000
safe and sound.


157
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,320
All the divers have dived in.


158
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,760
The gold bards


159
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,520
and they two


160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,670
can be taken out of the water soon.


161
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,590
They two?


162
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,520
Is Gu Ying also there?


163
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,200
Unexpectedly, there is also a land route.


164
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,350
I don't know how she found it and went inside.


165
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,520
Without this route,


166
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,520
there is no way to carry the gold out.


167
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,520
Eventually the gold robbery case is solved.


168
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,840
It's time that you had a rest.


169
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,470
Rest?


170
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,960
With the case of the nine statues of ox, two statues of tiger and one statue of rooster unsolved,


171
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm afraid Secretary Ding can't rest.


172
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,790
Opening the box with gold bars lightly,


173
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,910
I heard a loud noise.


174
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
A big hole appeared on the ground


175
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,520
and I fell down.


176
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,520
It's a dark,


177
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,000
long and narrow passage.


178
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
I tried


179
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,710
extremely hard


180
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,470
to hold the wall of the passage.


181
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,590
I was just in a relief


182
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,790
when I saw a sad black face.


183
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,320
Fixing my eyes on him,


184
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,000
I found he was Deyou.


185
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,230
"Don't be afraid", I said.


186
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,710
I am coming."


187
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,470
However,


188
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,590
if he hadn't asked me for the orientation diagram,


189
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,350
we wouldn't have fallen down.


190
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,550
Falling like flying,


191
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,230
my ass was rubbed nearly smoky.


192
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,960
Luckily, it is a water dungeon.


193
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,400
The 2-centimeter-thick board on the hole


194
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,470
was smashed by me.


195
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,710
You are really brilliant.


196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,760
It's a rotten tung wood.


197
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,080
Without mechanism made by medicinal eaglewood,


198
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,710
it was well-doer Li who left a way out for the tomb raiders.


199
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,150
Deyou risked his life to save me.


200
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,080
So he did.


201
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,400
Yet you made great contributions.


202
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,520
Without the route found by you,


203
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,150
the gold bars wouldn't have been carried out.


204
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,640
Plus vaccine,


205
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,520
I have saved Tientsin for twice.


206
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,880
Is there a reward for me?


207
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,670
I will present you a medal of


208
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,760
the honorary citizen.


209
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,550
A medal of the honorary citizen?


210
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,030
What's it about?


211
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,910
It's to prize those who


212
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,590
have made great contributions to Tientsin.


213
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,400
It's better to reward me a pork leg.


214
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,640
Right? Deyou.


215
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,910
What are you doing?


216
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,470
You…


217
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,550
What are the pink particles on your hair?


218
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,520
With the physical therapy unfinished,


219
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,790
I left when my hair was still wet.


220
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,520
The salinity was separated out on the hair.


221
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,550
Shadow play Liu was dead


222
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,030
to make Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei souled.


223
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,790
Salt.


224
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
Salt from the powder crystal rock.


225
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,880
It's a rare salt only produced in the Western Regions.


226
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,310
Rong people have used it for physical therapy


227
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,520
for thousands of years.


228
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,310
It can't be seen in other places in Tientsin.


229
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
There is also this kind of salt on shadow play Liu's hair.


230
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,400
It shows that he had ever bathed in this pool.


231
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,470
Rong Aoshuang


232
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,710
even said goodbye to me this morning.


233
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,310
How slippery he is!


234
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,280
He escaped so fast.


235
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,830
Only after being opened can we know


236
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,280
if the watermelon is ripe.


237
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,400
Check carefully.


238
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,640
Untie him quickly.


239
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,830
President Wang.


240
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,590
What's wrong with you?


241
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,040
How do you know him?


242
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,470
No.857 in Xihua Industrial Park.


243
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,280
No. 857 in Xihua Industrial Park.


244
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,520
Is he bewitched?


245
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,280
According to the nine chapters of rules of the nine stars,


246
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,430
all the ghosts will be executed.


247
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,190
Shut up.


248
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,520
He was bewitched by the silver bell ring.


249
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,070
Did he mention


250
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,760
Xihua Industrial Park just now?


251
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,920
It's so familiar.


252
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,430
Brother Junyao's fertilizer factory


253
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,070
is in Xihua Industrial Park.


254
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,710
No.857 in Xihua Industrial Park.


255
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,000
In this factory,


256
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,830
people don't work during the day


257
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,430
but at night with the machine running noisily.


258
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,800
With the light on at night,


259
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,710
it can't be decent business.


260
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,400
What does the factory make?


261
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,760
I don't know.


262
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,710
Usually it's strictly guarded.


263
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,310
The industrial waste is carried away by special trucks.


264
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,280
Is it possible that Rong Aoshuang


265
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,710
is inside?


266
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,920
Who?


267
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,310
It is making arms and ammunition privately.


268
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,000
Surely it is.


269
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,710
Really a big business.


270
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,280
What can we do now?


271
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,230
Go out


272
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,350
or continue investigating?


273
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,040
Follow me.


274
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,070
Go on.


275
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,350
Go.


276
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,310
What are you doing?


277
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,520
Locust.


278
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,760
Locust.


279
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,040
Locust.


280
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,280
My good brother.


281
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,920
Why are you here?


282
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,920
I'm your elder brother, cricket.


283
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,710
Don't you remember me?


284
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,110
We haven't seen each other for seven to eight years.


285
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,190
This is your second brother, flea.


286
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,590
Look. Locus has been so tall.


287
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,640
Cricket.


288
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,350
Locust.


289
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,800
Unexpectedly, we can meet locust here.


290
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,070
Locust.


291
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,560
Are you busy?


292
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,350
We just come to have a glance at you. Goodbye!


293
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,040
Locust. Unexpectedly, you have changed.


294
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,950
I will play with you next time.


295
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,110
All the gods above the heaven,


296
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,280
please bless me wisdom, brilliance and peace.


297
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,400
No no no.


298
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,560
Sitting here doing nothing,


299
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,160
it's no use no many how many times I read the Great Compassion Mantra.


300
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,640
Something buzzes in my mind.


301
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,470
All the gods above the heaven,


302
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,590
please bless me wisdom, brilliance and peace.


303
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,880
What's the noise?


304
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,280
Didn't I tell you?


305
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,470
It's buzzing.


306
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,190
Alarm.


307
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,590
It's alarm.


308
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,470
So it is.


309
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,920
I need to go to find Deyou.


310
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,800
Let me go with you.


311
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,760
I've promised to Ding Mao and Guo Deyou.


312
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,430
Tonight


313
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,350
let me protect you.


314
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,950
You protect me?


315
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,950
I... I...


316
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,560
This way, please.


317
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,920
Locust.


318
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,070
We are in a scorpion cave now.


319
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,430
Don't worry. Keep calm.


320
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,310
Wait for chance to go out.


321
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,400
Where are we?


322
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,400
Do you have fire?


323
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,520
No need to be afraid. It's just a dummy.


324
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,710
What are you afraid of?


325
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,680
Am I afraid?


326
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,880
Why can't the match be lit?


327
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,280
Try hard.


328
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,560
It's bright.


329
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,070
I used to use dummy to have trial explosion.


330
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,590
Later I found


331
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,000
it's better to use real people.


332
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,880
Mayor Bai grabbed the gold with me.


333
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,280
Then I made him shut up in this room.


334
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,110
Now you come.


335
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,280
It's your fault


336
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,470
to find the gold too late.


337
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,070
Commander Wu.


338
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,760
Do you know that you are making arms and ammunition privately?


339
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,430
White phosphorus bomb.


340
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,070
It's rarely seen.


341
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,950
You happen to


342
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,830
have the chance to watch the explosion of white phosphorus bomb so closely.


343
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,000
It's just like having an operation on your ass.


344
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,230
It's eye-opening.


345
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,920
What's white phosphorus bomb? Is it dangerous?


346
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,070
Its main material is white phosphorus bomb.


347
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,590
Once it's burnt, it will keep burning


348
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,950
with only bones left.


349
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,160
Let me watch the explosion.


350
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
What's wrong?


351
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,710
Throw the bomb!


352
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,280
Hurry to leave.


353
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,000
Lock the plant area.


354
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,070
Nobody can get out of here.


355
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,710
No you can't show off.


356
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,190
I scare you to death.


357
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,110
Didn't I tell you to watch them carefully?


358
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,430
You...


359
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,000
I...


360
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,350
I just thought


361
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,560
if you could recognize my shoe and take it for me,


362
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,560
you must be my Deyou.


363
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,280
If not, you're a tortoise.


364
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,830
Can't I recognize it?


365
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
There isn't another girl in Tientsin


366
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,190
having such big feet.


367
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,800
I...


368
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,470
It's so dangerous here.


369
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,470
How could you take them here?


370
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,350
We asked to come by ourselves.


371
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,640
He is not to blame.


372
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,950
Yeah. They're worried about you.


373
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,110
Can't they do that?


374
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,920
Let's walk separately.


375
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,680
Gather at the gate.


376
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,950
Go go go.


377
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,760
It's easy for white phosphorus to burn.


378
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,160
Don't shot if there is still alternative.


379
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,920
Yes.


380
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,470
The newly-born mice


381
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,470
are active all the time.


382
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,280
Didn't I tell you to stay in elder cousin's office?


383
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
You ungrateful tortoise!


384
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,880
If it hadn't been me,


385
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,040
you would have been bombed into meat paste.


386
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,710
Do you know white phosphorus bomb?


387
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,590
Meat paste.


388
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,880
Are you kidding?


389
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,230
How could it be that I don't know phosphorus?


390
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,590
Do you believe that I can set a fire...


391
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,560
Let's go.


392
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,190
I...


393
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,040
Don't move.


394
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,760
Stop.


395
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,920
So many. Are they


396
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
all white phosphorus bombs?


397
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,230
How do you know the president of the tea Commerce Association?


398
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,310
I promised to work with him


399
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,070
to investigate Wu Zuonan and Bai Jiwen.


400
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,040
Are you crazy? How dare you investigate them?


401
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
Don't you want to live?


402
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,920
Not only do I want to know about


403
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,230
Wu Zuonan and Bai Jiwen,


404
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,160
but also I want to know about you.


405
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,190
About me? I did nothing.


406
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,520
Wang Ximiao's son,


407
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,310
Wang Ziren


408
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,160
was killed by you, right?


409
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,400
Bullshit.


410
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,680
Let's go.


411
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,280
Gold censer, silver incense,


412
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,800
a large bowl with rising smoke.


413
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,190
With red sorghum and water to worship the god,


414
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,590
I'm in front of a large number of mounted and foot soldiers.


415
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,710
Watch out your back.


416
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,520
With swords, spears, two-edged swords and halberds to kill the sun and moon,


417
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,920
it's red everywhere.


418
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,520
Hurry up.


419
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,880
I didn't kill him.


420
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,350
It's Wu Zuonan who shot him.


421
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,000
I couldn't stop him in that condition.


422
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,470
You can't kill me.


423
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,830
My father is the president of the tea commerce association.


424
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,760
If you don't believe me,


425
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,040
I can do nothing.


426
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,880
I believe you.


427
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,190
Be careful.


428
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Thank you.


429
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,830
In front of a large number of mounted and foot soldiers...


430
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,710
Brother Junyao,


431
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,800
for your saving my life,


432
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm sure to


433
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,280
reward you with Chinese hamburgers later.


434
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,190
Go go.


435
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,110
Hoe could it be that you are still trapped here？


436
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,470
Listen.


437
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,920
I saved them just now.


438
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
It's just about Chinese hamburger.


439
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,760
Don't mention it again.


440
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,520
Don't cut in.


441
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,710
They were almost beaten to death just now.


442
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,920
Only a Chinese hamburger?


443
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,350
Add an egg, OK?


444
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,110
Check there. Quickly.


445
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,000
Go go go.


446
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,950
Hurry up. Hurry up.


447
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,920
Quickly.


448
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,430
This way. Don't go there again.


449
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,560
Quickly.


450
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,470
Go.


451
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,190
How could it be?


452
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,310
It's an dead end.


453
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,590
Phosphine.


454
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,830
It's the waste gas from producing white phosphorus,


455
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,880
which is poisonous.


456
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,600
And then?


457
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We die together?


458
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,360
Hurry to come up with a way.


459
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,870
Wet your clothes and cover on your mouth.


460
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,800
Hang on and escape when it's in a chaos.


461
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,000
Here you are.


462
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,760
What do you use to cover?


463
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,520
Deyou.


464
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,230
The poisonous gas is leaking. Be on the alert.


465
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,760
Go.


466
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,320
Hurry up.


467
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,040
Quickly.


468
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,560
In front of a large number of mounted and foot soldiers.


469
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,320
Take off your clothes.


470
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,040
Open the door. Open the door.


471
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,760
Get out of the way.


472
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,040
Commander Wu.


473
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,910
You have to stay inside tonight.


474
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,280
I will report to the governor and the Beijing government tomorrow.


475
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,080
Don't worry. Commander Wu.


476
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,000
Without me,


477
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,560
the governor seems to have no gun.


478
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,910
He is ardent to me.


479
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,470
Even though he knows I am making arms and ammunition privately,


480
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,080
he knows that I just want to make some money.


481
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,150
What happened?


482
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,150
Who threw the bomb?


483
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,870
Be careful.


484
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,430
Watch those inside carefully.


485
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,390
Get those who run away.


486
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,190
Yes.


487
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,520
All over the factory,


488
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,320
except this one that was burnt,


489
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,390
the rest are all semi-finished


490
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,910
or empty ones.


491
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,190
They carried away the bombs under our eyes.


492
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,520
How capable they are!


493
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,840
What's this?


494
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,150
It looks like two tigers without heads.


495
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,230
Tiger head with ear of wheat,


496
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,150
one of the four famous antique walnuts.


497
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,560
A pair of tiger heads.


498
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,800
A pair of tigers without heads.


499
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,040
They can make up two tigers.


500
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,360
Bai Jiwen is in charge of money.


501
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,840
Wu Zuonan is in charge of guns.


502
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,190
Without money and guns,


503
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,120
Tientsin will be in a chaos.


504
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,800
It turns out that they are the two tigers.


505
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,560
Captain.


506
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,910
I found it in the office.


507
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,150
Tai Bo.


508
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,280
This ordnance factory


509
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,870
is jointly operated by Wu Zuonan and Tai Bo.


510
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,600
Tai Bo.


511
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,600
It sounds so familiar.


512
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,760
He is the doctor trained in western medicine


513
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
who prescribed aspirin to Crazy Cui.


514
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,800
On the prescription,


515
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,320
the aspirin is overdose.


516
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,950
Taking too much aspirin


517
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,470
will lead to the bleeding of gastric mucosa.


518
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,670
A doctor trained in western medicine.


519
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,150
We have been played for so long.


520
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,600
Maybe Tai Bo


521
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,800
is Rong Aoshuang.


522
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,840
Bloot flower.


523
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,150
It's a herbal plant growing in Spain


524
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,870
with its smell


525
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,190
inhibiting to nervus centralis.


526
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,390
So it's also called hypnosis flower.


527
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,470
Aromatherapy extracted from it


528
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,000
is the key to make the silver bell seal work.


529
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,040
Having been in the same room for so long,


530
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,840
unexpectedly,


531
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,230
I didn't find that


532
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,710
the murderer is around me.


533
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,560
Master.


534
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,120
Lanlan's father.


535
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,190
Uncle Hu.


536
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,520
They shouldn't have been dead.


537
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,190
Move aside.


538
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,630
The couch


539
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,910
feels comfortable.


540
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,840
Feeling comfortable,


541
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,360
people are easy to make mistakes.


542
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,710
It's not your fault.


543
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
The couch is to blame.


544
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Chop it for firewood.


545
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,520
Enough.


546
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,520
Count me.


547
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,560
Unexpectedly I believed her so much.


548
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,230
I'm sorry for Lanlan.


549
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,150
In the past,


550
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,520
I always treated Ying to some rotted peaches and apricots.


551
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,710
I was so mean.


552
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,000
Looking back,


553
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,360
we can see life is really short.


554
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,120
It's hard to avoid some mistakes.


555
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,800
Don't take it too seriously.


556
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,950
Be conscientious for big event.


557
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,360
Be conscientious for big event.


558
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,150
I always think it looks odd.


559
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,190
Odd.


560
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:25,950
If you can't stand on your feet,


561
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,390
I can support you with my hand.


562
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,600
Come on.


563
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,280
For any bump and cut,


564
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,520
I can care take care of you.


565
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,600
Cut.


566
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,840
There is a cut on the first joint of of Rong Aoshuang's left little finger.


567
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,000
It's a new cut.


568
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,320
She said it was scratched.


569
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,040
The cut is regular in size with the same width in each side.


570
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,840
There is invagination from the surface.


571
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,230
It must be tightened by a thread or small rope.


572
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,670
It was the last time I saw her.


573
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,230
I can feel that she didn't want me to see her cut.


574
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,120
The planar graph and the photo of the coffer


575
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,000
are both here.


576
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,520
Just wait.


577
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,870
I did everything according to your order.


578
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,430
I killed her,


579
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,870
my younger sister.


580
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,840
You told me that


581
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,000
if I killed Yuehong,


582
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,870
I could have all the gold bars.


583
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,760
I asked you to kill her.


584
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,120
But I didn't ask you to spoil her.


585
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,670
Disgusting!


586
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,710
The gold bars are mine.


587
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,320
Give them to me.


588
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,320
Nine oxen and two tigers are all dead.


589
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,190
Who's the rooster?


590
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,670
What's wrong with you?


591
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,280
After returning alive from the water tomb,


592
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,190
there seems


593
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,320
something wrong with my body.
