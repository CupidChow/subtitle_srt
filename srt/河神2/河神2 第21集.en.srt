[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]


3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,390
Let's come back to our story and continue.


4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,540
Previously, we talked about


5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,670
Ding Mao came to the lab of Fan Junyao to seek help.


6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,470
Water flowed out of the gold-transporting military vehicles.


7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,280
It was proved that Puppeteer Liu got involved in the gold robbery.


8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,930
Then, news came that Liu Chengmao of the Shadow Play Troupe died.


9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,770
As expected, Puppeteer Liu died punished by the Shadow Play Master.


10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,160
The president of the Tea Dealers' Guild provided clues for Xiao Lanlan.


11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,910
Xiao Lanlan began to suspect Ding Mao a bit.


12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,370
Gu Ying found the remaining deer sinew string by the side of the street.


13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,440
The four of them went explore the street in the night and found the fake bank.


14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,580
Niqiu came to see Guo Deyou to talk about a good deal.


15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,710
He told Guo that the offeror would pay with gold.


16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,950
Hearing this, Guo Deyou resorted to a small scheme


17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,320
to lure Carpenter Huang to rob the coffin late at night.


18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,910
Thus, the gold robbery case was cracked.


19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,310
This led to the following happenings.


20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,360
Family members fight against one another and the whole clan is wiped out.


21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,280
Guo Deyou trespasses on the forbidden ground three times.


22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,010
Little Sorceress encounters


23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,830
the fatal love again.


24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,420
Be careful.


25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
Senior apprentice brother, hurry!


26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,230
Shake a leg, you two! Don't dawdle.


27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,970
Zhang Chengzhuan and junior sister apprentice were in love secretly.


28
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,210
This is a violation of the rule.


29
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,570
The rules established by our master mustn't be broken.


30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,259
However, considering he is our eldest fellow apprentice,


31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,950
we did nothing to stop him.


32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,240
Whenever he made any money,


33
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,289
he would gamble it away.


34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,910
He was always chased and beaten by his creditors.


35
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,450
Eldest brother apprentice!


36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,690
Leave him alone!


37
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,210
Leave! Leave!


38
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,790
Go away quickly!


39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,840
No matter how our master lectured him and persuaded him,


40
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,270
he wouldn't awake up to his errors.


41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,259
Instead, he went from bad to worse.


42
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,540
He colluded with Yuehong.


43
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,320
Senior brother apprentice.


44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,370
They stole the family heirloom of our master.


45
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,210
Fearing that our master might be aware of it, they eloped.


46
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,090
We couldn't wash our dirty linen in public.


47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,329
Though our master didn't report this to the police,


48
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,100
he felt depressed


49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,020
thinking his disciples stole his family heirloom, the jade seal.


50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,180
In less than one year since the affair, our master passed away.


51
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,810
Since then,


52
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,970
we have been destined to get our come-uppance.


53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,340
Jianghu.


54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,700
Science.


55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,540
Kung fu.


56
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,180
Truth.


57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,860
Nine statues of ox.


58
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,540
Two statues of tiger.


59
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,300
One statue of rooster.


60
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,380
Bro Deyou, I won't quarrel with you anymore.


61
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,180
The president


62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,140
The director


63
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,260
Fellow apprentices of the same master


64
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,460
The divine creation goes down to the north water.


65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,900
The whorehouse area


66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,180
Let's fish a coffin out of water.


67
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,260
I dare not do it.


68
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,100
You need not fear anything.


69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,860
Baked wheaten cake with sugar


70
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,940
I believe.


71
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,700
Little River God


72
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,820
Secretary General Ding


73
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,260
Waterside dwellers live on what is provided by water.


74
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,580
River God


75
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,500
Tientsin Mystic 2


76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,459
Episode 21


77
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,080
Later,


78
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,960
my youngest apprentice fellow Liu Chengmao and I


79
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,520
started careers of our own respectively.


80
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,830
He joined the shadow play troupe.


81
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,130
I started a coffin shop.


82
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:56,290
I applied the herbal-wood-making craft taught by our master


83
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,890
to make coffins.


84
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,150
However, the wicked Zhang Chengzhuan


85
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,310
cast his greedy eyes on me.


86
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,980
Recently, has there been any herbal wood coffin?


87
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,030
Can't the grave digging business satisfy you?


88
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,630
Why are you casting your eyes at these second-hand coffins?


89
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,300
You are short of moralities.


90
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,240
Morality is not the only thing I lack.


91
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,420
I am also short of money.


92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,870
You won't tell me right?


93
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,140
Fine.


94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,820
Then I will have to


95
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,740
have a meeting with our master.


96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,730
How dare you?


97
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,990
Let go of me.


98
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,100
Come on, don't be impulsive.


99
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,000
Get your hands off me.


100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,820
Sorry, senior brother apprentice.


101
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,740
Look at you!


102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,340
You have been careless during work.


103
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,880
Here is the wood chip in your hair.


104
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,820
Bro Chengzhuan.


105
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,930
Please don't, Bro Chengzhuan.


106
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,770
It grows when the tide comes


107
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
to shape a whirlpool.


108
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,640
Two dragons hold up the water


109
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,260
to conceal it.


110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,100
If I remember correctly,


111
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,490
the coffin of our master seems to beâ€¦


112
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,780
No! Please don't!


113
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,260
As for all those goods you sell,


114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,630
make a list of the buyers for me later.


115
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,380
The place where the coffins are buried


116
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,659
and the time when they are buried


117
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,450
should be clearly indicated.


118
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,740
Have a good rest to recuperate.


119
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,130
I will come to visit you in a few days.


120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,360
No need.


121
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,440
Just do your own things.


122
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,030
I was scared.


123
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,290
I was really scared of him.


124
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,300
Every time, against my conscience,


125
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,610
I divulged the information about the buyer to him.


126
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,680
Then he went to dig the grave


127
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,850
to make the easy money.


128
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,350
Except the coffin,


129
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,780
have you ever made the seafood crate?


130
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,210
Has the crate caused trouble?


131
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,210
Tell us


132
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,250
what happened exactly.


133
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,770
It was also he that made me do it.


134
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,850
I can only make coffins.


135
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,300
I have never made any seafood crate.


136
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,970
I don't know how to make it.


137
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,710
I forgot that


138
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,050
you don't have the full set of teeth


139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,590
and can't eat shelled food.


140
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,820
Do you still remember that


141
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,260
on the list of the coffin buyers,


142
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,760
there are the names of a lot of prominent figures.


143
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,570
If they come to know that


144
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,920
you divulged their information


145
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
to cause the corpses of their family members to be exposed in the air.


146
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,360
You should know what will happen to you.


147
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,820
Come on.


148
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,409
Fill my cup.


149
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,610
I had no choice, but to make a batch of crates for him


150
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,530
with the herbal wood.


151
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,520
According to what you said,


152
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,210
they also forced you to rob the gold, right?


153
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
Our master taught us the workmanship


154
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,500
not to enable us to do this.


155
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,050
I was born under an ill star.


156
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,780
I am living a dog's life.


157
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,890
Second brother apprentice, if you think


158
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,430
I deserve to suffer in the sporting house.


159
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,670
I can't contradict.


160
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,810
But I can't blacken our master's name.


161
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,830
After we finish this, I will redeem myself.


162
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,860
Then I will be a decent person.


163
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,380
In this way, I will save our master's face.


164
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,970
In my opinion,


165
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,210
it is a waste for second brother apprentice to make coffins


166
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,640
with his workmanship.


167
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,620
If second brother apprentice gets the gold,


168
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,250
he will have enough to eat and drink and can concentrate on his crafts.


169
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,290
The he will definitely


170
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,360
become a great carpenter who builds temples and bridges.


171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,540
He will surpass the carpentry master Lu Ban.


172
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,040
We will know whether he can surpass Lu Ban or not after giving it a try.


173
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,620
Make one identical to what is in the photo.


174
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,500
Even if you are very capable


175
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,870
and are on a par with the carpentry master,


176
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,130
how come you knew


177
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,590
the army will transport gold for the bank?


178
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,210
Moreover, where did you get


179
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,200
the six-wheeled green vehicle?


180
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,510
Zhang Chengzhuan gave us all the information.


181
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,390
He told us the time, place


182
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,730
and the contact.


183
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,680
The contact


184
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,900
is Director Lin?


185
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,050
Yes.


186
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,400
He was the most important factor.


187
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,430
So we figured out his living habit


188
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,800
and tampered with his watch.


189
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,530
Director Lin synchronizes his watch with the big clock every time he passes it.


190
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,050
To make him arrive at the place


191
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,140
where he would pick up the gold half an hour earlier,


192
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,850
we must do something to his watch first.


193
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,040
As a puppeteer, Liu Chengmao has nimble hands.


194
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,280
Thus he would handle this.


195
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,040
He would set forward Director Lin's watch by half an hour


196
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,770
and wake him up purposefully.


197
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,720
That was not enough.


198
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,360
Yuehong went to buy 100 steamed stuffed buns


199
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,800
so that the owner of the bun shop


200
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,270
had to get up half an hour earlier than usual to chop the filling.


201
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,210
The milk boy also arrived half an hour earlier


202
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,430
to deliver the milk to Director Lin


203
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,860
to make sure he wouldn't find the time was wrong.


204
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,360
But the robbery,


205
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,530
we also had to make Director Lin drink


206
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,070
the milk mixed with the croton juice.


207
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,530
Thus, he would give up opening the crate to check upon the gold.


208
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,560
There was another thing.


209
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,220
If Director Lin set his watch by the big clock as usual,


210
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,830
he would find the time was wrong.


211
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,220
Thus, Yuehong waited for his arrival in the location of the clock tower


212
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,140
to stop him from synchronizing his watch.


213
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,170
For the next, we only needed to carry out our plan


214
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,050
and disguised ourselves as the military officers to cheat Director Lin.


215
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,710
Then we seized the gold successfully.


216
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,750
We finally cleared up the gold robbery case.


217
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,720
Now tell us why you killed Tomb Raider Zhang.


218
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,680
I have told you.


219
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,970
He broke the rule!


220
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,950
Without letting us know, Zhang Chengzhuan


221
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,750
hid the gold in the waterborne tomb of our master.


222
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,930
Don't worry.


223
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,770
As long as the four of us don't divulge the mnemonic,


224
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,840
the army wouldn't find the tomb of the old man.


225
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,720
Have you moved the master's coffin?


226
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,370
It got in the way.


227
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,800
So I moved it out.


228
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,620
What?


229
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,420
Do you have issues with my doing?


230
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,080
Bro Chengzhuan, I beg you to


231
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,580
put our master's coffin back.


232
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,740
The old man is very rich.


233
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,530
But he left nothing to you. So why do you care about him?


234
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,670
He just left you dealing with the damn wood.


235
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,120
However, you knelt down before the right person today.


236
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,670
From now on, don't call me bro anymore


237
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,780
and call me daddy


238
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,830
or grandpa.


239
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,430
Then I will bestow some gold on you.


240
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,190
You also killed Yuehong, right?


241
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,700
I didn't intend to kill her,


242
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,940
but she tried to kill me.


243
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,870
Is he inside the coffin?


244
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,930
I didn't kill him purposefully.


245
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,300
He attempted to kill me.


246
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,960
Iâ€¦


247
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,050
He deserves to be killed.


248
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,340
He promised to redeem me.


249
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,710
But I have been helping him financially.


250
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,270
Now,


251
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,830
I can set my mind at rest.


252
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,290
You killed him. What will you do next?


253
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,820
I will escape.


254
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,230
Where will you go?


255
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,300
Brother apprentice, if you trust me,


256
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,580
I will help you.


257
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,990
This place will be uncovered sooner or later.


258
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,750
Go with me.


259
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,690
Go to take shelter in my place.


260
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,710
I didn't know when she drugged me.


261
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,750
When I came round later,


262
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,990
I found myself tied up in the Cangcui House.


263
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,119
Brother apprentice,


264
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,670
since you killed and sealed him in the coffin,


265
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,030
I will


266
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,000
kill you by sealing your anal opening


267
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,920
to revenge him.


268
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,140
I was not cheeky enough to see a doctor.


269
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,270
So I found one charlatan in the night fair


270
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,600
to take out the one-inch wood.


271
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,550
The bleeding hasn't been stopped.


272
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,960
There is supposed to be the visceral rupture.


273
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,010
He fell down just now, which worsened his injury.


274
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,350
Let's take him to the hospital.


275
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,370
Things have got out of hand.


276
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,610
Everything has got into a mess.


277
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,620
There is no hope for me.


278
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,860
I can't survive.


279
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,630
Now our eldest brother apprentice has died.


280
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,310
Will you


281
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,590
take the gold


282
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,170
and leave with me?


283
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,250
Do you want me


284
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,680
or the gold?


285
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,330
Don't think that his death


286
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,610
will give you a bigger share of the gold.


287
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,150
His share


288
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,130
will go to me.


289
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,920
As for your proposal to me,


290
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,960
I am afraid I can't lower myself


291
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,230
to accept it.


292
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,190
If Liu Chengmao hadn't come to see Yuehong suddenly


293
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,820
and she hadn't hidden me under her bed hurriedly,


294
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,440
I wouldn't have escaped death.


295
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,700
Yuehong.


296
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,300
Yuehong.


297
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,330
Open the door quickly. Stop being petulant.


298
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,740
Liu Chengmao has died.


299
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,940
He died?


300
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,460
All of us have died.


301
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,750
I am glad they all died.


302
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,020
At the beginning of our apprenticeship,


303
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,470
I don't think


304
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,780
either of us was treacherous


305
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,700
or evil.


306
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,500
But I didn't know when we took the wrong step


307
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,350
and embarked on the wrong track.


308
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,000
No, we didn't take the wrong step,


309
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,240
but missed our feet instead.


310
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,170
We fell into the abyss of greed


311
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,330
and kept falling down for all the past years unknowingly.


312
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,000
Now, we deserve to break into pieces.


313
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,280
It serves us right.


314
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,010
After we die,


315
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,760
we can go to ask for our master's pardon


316
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,770
and kneel down before him.


317
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,480
Mr. Guo,


318
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,910
as the Little River God,


319
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,090
you can really see things through like god.


320
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,900
Like my master,


321
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,980
you care about this river


322
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,220
and have respect for it.


323
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,140
May I make bold to


324
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,890
beg you to bury my master where he was buried previously?


325
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,780
I will pay the price with my worthless life.


326
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,260
I want to fulfill my master's wish of sleeping eternally in the Haihe River.


327
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,690
I, Huang Chengzhong


328
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,170
will slave for you in the next life.


329
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,130
Where is the waterborne tomb?


330
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,670
Come closer.


331
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,640
It grows when the tide comes to shape a whirlpool.


332
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,510
Two dragons hold up the water to conceal it.


333
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,200
The blissful heavenly music leads the right way.


334
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,890
The divine creation


335
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,810
goes down to the north water.


336
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,860
When did you see I wear such stuff?


337
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,850
Mr. Guo, I know you are good at swimming.


338
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,000
So I don't worry you will get into danger under the water.


339
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,820
However, I am afraid that your body can't stand the coldness.


340
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,800
The coldness is severer in the waterborne tomb


341
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,760
than under the ordinary water.


342
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,780
This jetty stone armor is the heirloom of our corpse-salvage team.


343
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,610
So you must put it on.


344
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,630
Are you sure this is the place?


345
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,360
The first two lines of the mnemonics say,


346
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,700
it grows when the tide comes to shape a whirlpool


347
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,690
and two dragons hold up the water to conceal it.


348
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,660
As long as it rains in our Tientsin City,


349
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,380
water will flow into this river from the north and the south


350
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,860
to form the whirlpool.


351
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,900
I have consulted with the geomancer.


352
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,820
I was told that


353
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,820
the north and the south mountains here


354
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,610
happen to reveal the geomantic omen of two dragons holding up the water.


355
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,470
Thus, the waterborne tomb is definitely here.


356
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,490
Besides, as you can see,


357
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,990
now the water level is so low


358
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,550
that the shallow-water terrace built for the tomb construction is exposed now.


359
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,660
It is over there ahead.


360
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,900
Nonetheless,


361
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,390
I can't understand the last two lines of the mnemonics.


362
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,570
The blissful heavenly music leads the right way.


363
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,900
The divine creation goes down to the north water.


364
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,390
Mr. Guo.


365
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,400
Though the business of our corpse-salvage team is not booming now,


366
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,770
we need not lower ourselves to raid the tomb.


367
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,750
It is not easy to get items out of the waterborne tomb.


368
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,220
Who told you I would go down to salvage things from the tomb?


369
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,460
I promised someone


370
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,130
to put the coffin back.


371
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,090
Put it back?


372
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,390
Come on. Give the gear to me.


373
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,310
You will really dive into the water?


374
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,780
In one hour,


375
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,380
if I am not back,


376
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,980
you should look for me following the buoys.


377
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,730
Mr. Guo,


378
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,580
I, I dare not.


379
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,760
Then you can tell Ding Mao


380
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,190
that the thing he wants is under the water here.


381
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,100
My mother-in-law sings the


382
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,830
the River-worshipping Ceremony song every year.


383
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,200
This is easy for me.


384
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,370
The character "dang" stands for the gong.


385
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,040
The character "gou" stands for the drum.


386
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,920
The character "qiu" stands for the cymbal.


387
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,070
The demon inhabits the mountain.


388
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,060
It wants to occupy my body.


389
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,610
The ghost lurks under the water.


390
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:05,700
It wants to eat my soul.


391
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,590
I feed them with my heart


392
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,850
and satisfy them with my spirit.


393
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,340
When all is over,


394
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:27,190
they will return to the Great Void.


395
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,750
There is still suffering in the world.


396
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,440
Good deeds should never be ceased.


397
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,360
So this coffin is only a dummy.


398
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,410
The blissful heavenly music leads the right way.


399
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,680
The divine creation goes down to the north water.


400
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,260
The heavenly music.


401
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
Down to the north water.


402
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,690
Down to the north water.


403
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
Ying.


404
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,830
You are a tortoise.


405
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,790
What?


406
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,100
You talked to me first, so you are a tortoise.


407
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,530
At such a time, why are you still talking such nonsense?


408
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,090
Why are you here?


409
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,050
To look for the gold.


410
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,780
You can find the gold here?


411
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,700
Carpenter Huang told me that


412
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,000
his fellow apprentice Zhang Chengzhuan


413
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,540
hid the gold in Li Fengcheng's tomb.


414
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,460
Isn't Carpenter Huang dead?


415
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,700
Yes, he is now.


416
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,170
But he wasn't back then.


417
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,500
The heavenly music refers to the drum of the Philanthropist Li.


418
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,100
It is on the layer above.


419
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,760
It is a stone drum mechanism.


420
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,390
After I unlocked it, I found the dummy coffin.


421
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,580
There is nothing


422
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,610
but a sentence persuading people to do good deeds.


423
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,680
The divine creation goes down to the north water.


424
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,880
The real coffin chamber is hidden deep under the north water.


425
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,380
If the water level hadn't been low due to the draught,


426
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,230
I wouldn't have made it into the dummy coffin chamber.


427
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,800
You are really like a tortoise.


428
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,210
You don't walk, but swim.


429
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,490
How did you make it here?


430
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,030
Only when incanted before the grave of the deceased,


431
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,010
will the requiem spell come into play.


432
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,670
Someone has hired my mum to incant the spell by the river


433
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,960
and paid my mum with gold.


434
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,690
After thinking about it,


435
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,230
I realized that only Philanthropist Li's tomb


436
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,250
is in the Haihe River.


437
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,660
I guess it might have something to do with the gold robbery.


438
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,560
You guess what?


439
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,220
With the letter of apology


440
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,110
and the orientation chart the client gave my mum,


441
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,330
I really found the entrance.


442
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,800
I covered a distance of 1,000 meters to arrive here.


443
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,460
This tomb is really skillfully dug.


444
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,320
Why is the orientation chart necessary for incanting the spell?


445
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,940
Of course. I will show it to you.


446
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,110
Take this.


447
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,160
Why did you take this out?


448
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,330
Don't you want to see the orientation chart?


449
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,690
We fell into the ghost steelyard.


450
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,420
What, what steelyard?


451
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,510
It is a kind of mechanism built in the tomb passage.


452
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,690
If the weight increases or reduces a bit,


453
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,220
the arm of the steelyard will tilt


454
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,290
and the tomb raiders will fall down.


455
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,810
You mean we are the weights, right?


456
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,550
When was this thick slate closed?


457
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,150
As soon as we fell into the water, it was closed.


458
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,540
Don't worry.


459
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,330
Niqiu know I am here.


460
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,060
I also left the bouys.


461
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,560
But Niqiu can't swim.


462
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,910
Take breaths mildly and tread water lightly


463
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,640
to conserve your strength.


464
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,560
No matter what happens,


465
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,410
don't waste your energy on shouting.


466
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,680
Hurry!


467
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,110
Chop-chop!


468
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,610
They went down from here.


469
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,890
One hour has passed, but they didn't come up.


470
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,040
Hurry up!


471
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,380
Give me your clothes.


472
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,130
Come on, the clothes.


473
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,970
Hurry! Hurry!


474
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,590
Shake a leg!


475
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,330
Take care!


476
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,610
Got it.


477
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,280
Even the little river god can't live without air.


478
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,180
Breathe out the air.


479
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,460
Don't hold your breath.


480
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,530
Why don't you breathe?


481
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,750
It doesn't matter you exhale a breath.


482
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,690
I told you not to make a noise.


483
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,350
I am practicing my underwater skills.


484
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,720
They are really useless.


485
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,320
Even I have found the way in.


486
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,560
They are all tortoises.


487
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,000
You said you covered 1,000 meters to make it here.


488
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:25,790
If it were so easy for people


489
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,670
to find the tomb of Philanthropist Li,


490
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,760
it would have been plundered by the tomb raiders.


491
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,890
If you hadn't got the orientation chart


492
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,300
and got lucky,


493
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,840
you wouldn't have been able to make it here.


494
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,250
Mr. Guo! Mr. Guo! Mr. Guo!


495
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,560
Mr. Guo! Mr. Guo!


496
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,610
Has he been found?


497
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,550
We searched everywhere, but didn't find him.


498
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,230
Go on with the search!


499
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:44,740
OK!


500
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,430
How about you guys?


501
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,610
We didn't find Mr. Guo, either.


502
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,380
It is impossible.


503
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,660
The buoys can be seen at the mouth of the cave. He must be in there.


504
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,360
Go on searching!


505
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,320
Keep searching! Hurry!


506
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,960
OK.


507
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,010
It is fine.


508
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,040
I,


509
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,670
I am willing to


510
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,040
take my last breath


511
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,380
with you.


512
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,370
Stop saying the ominous words.


513
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,100
I am sorry.


514
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,700
In our childhood, I ate up all the medicinal candies


515
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,820
stored in Eldest Brother Clay Doll's box.


516
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,490
If I intended to hide them seriously,


517
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,830
even my master couldn't find them.


518
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,110
I,


519
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,120
I just hid them there for you to find.


520
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,750
Second brother,


521
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,760
I won't quarrel with you anymore.


522
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,300
Yes, we won't quarrel.


523
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,990
Come on. Put all your weight on me.


524
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,780
Stop talking.


525
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,470
This is the last time for you to go through the rehab underwater.


526
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,710
After the course of treatment comes to an end,


527
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,880
I will arrange a massager for you.


528
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,170
You have to persist in daily muscle relaxation.


529
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,710
Sorry to have troubled you over this period of time.


530
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,570
It is my job.


531
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,390
After the braces are removed,


532
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,010
my work will be finished.


533
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,980
I will say goodbye to you soon.


534
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,470
Why are you acting so sentimentally?


535
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,970
You made me feel that we would never meet again.


536
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,240
What is wrong with your hand?


537
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,060
I am sorry.


538
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,910
It used to be dressed with the gauze.


539
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,710
But the gauze got loose soaked in the water.


540
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,310
How did you get injured?


541
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,250
It is not a big deal.


542
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,470
A couple of days ago,


543
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,710
I got my hand cut by the broken glass out of carelessness.


544
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,630
Broken glass?


545
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,590
But your wound doesn't seemâ€¦


546
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,230
Young master.


547
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,030
Mr. Guo has been underwater for several hours


548
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,690
and hasn't come up.


549
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,550
The members of the corpse-salvage team has dived into water several times,


550
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,660
but failed to find him.


551
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,140
Come on.


552
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,200
Secretary General, take care.


553
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,880
The members of the western-style diving team,


554
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,270
dive deeper into the water in pairs.


555
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,870
Dive deeper by five meters every time till reaching the bottom of the water.


556
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,130
Report to me every 20 minutes.


557
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,730
Medical team!


558
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,440
Medical team!


559
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,660
Medical team, set up a rescue point


560
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,260
every hundred meters.


561
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,240
When they come up out of water, give them treatment immediately.


562
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,270
Hurry!


563
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,190
Corpse-salvage team,


564
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,300
search the area five meters under the water


565
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,320
horizontally.


566
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,400
Report to me every 20 minutes.


567
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,970
Yes, sir!


568
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,920
Hurry up! Chop-chop!


569
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,530
Hurry! Hurry!


570
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,810
Everybody, try your best!


571
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,740
Western-style diving team, medical team and the corpse-salvage team.


572
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,700
You blew me away.


573
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,010
Secretary General Ding, you stay calm facing the emergency,


574
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,090
which is really a heroic practice.


575
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,320
Don't be too anxious.


576
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,410
Yusi, go keep an eye on it.


577
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,100
OK.


578
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,100
Actually, you need not worry.


579
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,280
Mr. Guo was born under a lucky star,


580
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,750
so he would come out of danger for sure.


581
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,040
Xia Mohai.


582
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,110
Yes, Captain.


583
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:13,810
Come on.


584
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:14,580
Hurry!


585
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,000
-Get our men into action. Hurry! -OK. Copy that!


586
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,110
Stay safe, all of you.


587
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,070
Don't worry.


588
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,570
You go left and I will go right.


589
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,270
OK.


590
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,340
Sesame pods grow notch by notch on the stalk.


591
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,220
All of them are packed with white sesame seeds.


592
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,350
When the sesame seeds become ripe,


593
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,130
they squeeze the pod open to look outside.


594
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,410
Don't talk.


595
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,300
Doâ€¦not fall asleep.


596
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,150
Ying, look at me.


597
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,520
Ying.


598
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,610
Second brother,


599
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,510
I want to eat the baked wheaten cake with sugar.


600
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,330
It is filled with sesame seeds inside.


601
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,750
When it is bitten, the sesame seeds will got scattered about.


602
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,050
Ying! Ying!


603
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,480
Have they been found?


604
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:48,980
Captain Fu.


605
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,580
Move more men and boats here.


606
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,840
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!


607
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:52,670
Hurry!


608
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,080
Get more men and boats to work. Hurry!


609
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,740
Hurry up!


610
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,750
Don't be too anxious, young master.


611
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,460
Don't be so worried.
