
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]



00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,420
Let's come back to our story and continue.



00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,420
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]



00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,500
Previously, we talked about



00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,660
Guo and Ding resorted to a little scheme



00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,780
to obtain the clues leading to the next step of the game.



00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,460
Gu Ying infiltrated into the Enlightenment Academy successfully



00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,020
and began to gather information.



00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,500
Guo Deyou took the mooncake made by Hefeng Restaurant to Gu Ying.



00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,260
Sorceress Zhang provided clues accidentally.



00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,540
Gu Ying found the files of the students of the Enlightenment Academy.



00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,220
While she was passing a message,



00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,299
she found Chen Siru was bullying someone weaker than her.



00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,940
Thus, Gu Ying volunteered to help the bullied.



00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,380
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao entered the underground casino.



00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,180
Chen Siru and Gu Ying led the dance in the auditorium.



00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,340
On one side, the thunderstorm was advancing stealthily.



00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,260
On the other side, the clouds were gathering unknowingly.



00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,120
On one side, life hinges on one single move.



00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,740
On the other side, death comes at the end of the tune.



00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,020
This is the prelude to the following happenings.



00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,200
Sorceress Gu ran into danger and Ding Mao got into trouble.



00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,930
Little River God got trapped in a plight on his way.



00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,910
The Immortal of Fiery Bulls got frightened in the boudoir.



00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,060
Great stories are written by the literary talent.



00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,260
Where is the earthly paradise?



00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,940
Jianghu.



00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,620
Science.



00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,420
Kung fu.



00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,180
Truth.



00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,180
Nine statues of ox.



00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,060
Two statues of tiger.



00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,620
One statue of rooster.



00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,900
Chen Siru



00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,940
Mr. Ding.



00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
Be careful.



00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,620
When did you take the money?



00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,940
The Crystal Palace.



00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,140
Wu Wenmei



00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,220
When you call helpers, you have to listen.



00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,540
Involuntarily.



00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,700
I do not believe.



00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,060
Secret.



00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,860
Are you serious?



00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
Replace.



00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,820
River God.



00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,900
River God.



00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,100
River God.



00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,940
River God.



00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,380
Tientsin Mystic 2



00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,100
Episode 11



00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,570
Going further,



00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,380
you will be on your own.



00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,220
You mustn't take anyone with you.



00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,330
Take care.



00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,440
The fan surface is covered with poison.



00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,060
Be careful.



00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,500
Well,



00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,540
the letter has clarified everything.



00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,020
The murderer



00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,320
has been bullied for long and couldn't bear it anymore.



00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,500
Thus, the murderer applied poison to the fan surface



00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,900
to kill the victim.



00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,890
The facts of this case are very clear.



00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,850
Captain.



00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,940
Things have gone wrong, Captain!



00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,540
Have you been chased by a dog?



00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,300
Why are you in such a hurry?



00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,140
Well.



00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,420
Natasha who wrote the letter is gone.



00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,700
Who?



00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,620
It is the person who wrote the letter.



00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,020
Her name is Sophia.



00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,010
You are really something, Old Chap Xia.



00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,120
You have come to know so many foreign girls.



00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,490
Did you say she is Daria?



00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,700
Yes, it is her. She disappeared.



00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,180
We have searched every nook and cranny,



00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,010
but failed to find her.



00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,210
I got it.



00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,090
Now in this case,



00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,330
the murderer has fled to escape the punishment.



00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,100
Bring the letter, the poisonous fan and the corpse back to



00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,380
the police station.



00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,560
Let's go back.



00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,800
Bros, pack up.



00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,620
Handle it with care.



00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,520
These are all exhibits.



00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,920
Check the items carefully.



00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,630
Don't leave anything behind.



00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,700
Be careful, all of you!



00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,730
So you and your men are leaving now?



00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,290
What can a letter prove?



00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,790
Miss Xiao.



00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,390
We policemen's case-investigating procedures are



00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,630
stakeout, blocking, feeling out the situation and ruling out suspects.



00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,100
Today we are here



00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,210
to feel out the situation



00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,430
and rule out the suspects.



00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,540
As for the stakeout



00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,760
and suspect interception,



00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,159
we will take action tomorrow.



00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,860
Be careful. Be careful.



00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,690
Pull it to the other end.



00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,190
You are worried that with the big picture being unclear,



00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,110
if the investigation is carried on,



00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,010
you may offend people. Am I right?



00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,420
Well.



00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,409
Miss Xiao.



00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,140
We are old friends.



00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,120
All the students here



00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,850
come from influential families.



00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,390
Ms. Zhou, president of the academy



00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,180
is a prominent figure



00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,970
among the upper classes of Tianjin.



00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,020
Thus, I am prudent when investigating the case.



00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,880
You should do the same with your report.



00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,960
I think that



00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,820
you should write your report about



00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,610
after facts about the case are ascertained.



00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,020
Captain Fu,



00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,840
sorry to have troubled you



00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,520
to come here.



00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,470
President Zhou, never mind.



00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,070
It is our duty.



00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,120
When handling a case, we policemen of Tianjin



00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,480
conduct stakeout and blocking, feel out the situation and rule out suspects.



00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,620
In terms of stakeout, we lay low



00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,990
to silence all gossipers.



00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,010
Speaking of feeling out the situation,



00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,800
we put our hearts into



00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,790
removing your trouble and dispelling you worries.



00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,450
For this,



00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,670
I really should thank you.



00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,590
It's my pleasure. It's my duty.



00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,790
It is true that people seldom



00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,390
know difficulties of the police work.



00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,610
Therefore,



00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,820
let's help each other.



00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,750
Right. Right.



00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,550
I can see it is late now.



00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,080
You'd better go have a rest.



00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,360
Tomorrow,



00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,350
we will carry out the investigation in full swing.



00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,950
I am off.



00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,100
Thank you for your hard work!



00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,840
By the way,



00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,060
Miss Xiao,



00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,100
need I wait for you



00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,870
in the ferry place?



00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,340
No, you need not.



00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,710
I want to talk with President Zhou



00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,990
for a little longer.



00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,550
OK.



00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,730
The cold wind blows when night comes



00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,460
and the waves are big in the deep water.



00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,020
Miss Xiao, take care on your way.



00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,100
Thank you!



00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,540
Let's call it a day!



00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,000
Miss Xiao,



00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,730
nice to meet you.



00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,610
President Zhou,



00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:43,760
nice to meet you, too.



00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,980
Thank you!



00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,920
You should thank it.



00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,930
It is a stuffed dice.



00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,430
You can roll any points you want.



00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,750
You have only one dice.



00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,410
How can you ensure you will roll a triple six?



00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,190
You should know I was not the only one who cheated.



00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,560
They outdid me in cheating.



00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,760
They got two such dices.



00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,440
You prepared the two packs of dices.



00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,580
How can you prove that you didn't cheat?



00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,590
How dare you cheat in such a game?



00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,250
I bet my life, bro.



00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,850
When two lives were involved,



00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,450
I couldn't afford to play fair.



00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,590
I must go to the wharf alone.



00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,080
Otherwise, the previous efforts will be wasted.



00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,120
Remember to come back for a meal.



00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,920
The meal will be on the master.



00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,160
You are finally back.



00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,480
Gu Ying and Lanlan…



00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,260
To safeguard the reputation of our school,



00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,670
Miss Xiao, I hope that



00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,970
you won't hurry to cover this case.



00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,150
Don't worry.



00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,810
However, this murder occurred suddenly.



00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,920
Could I interview



00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,270
any other student present on the crime scene?



00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,240
The student present on the crime scene.



00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,020
Did you mean



00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Qiao Jing?



00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,100
Let go of her!



00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,560
Who did you mean?



00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,270
Is it the third daughter of the Qiao Family



00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,870
or the sorceress?



00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,790
Miss Gu,



00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,590
you disguised yourself as the daughter of a rich family



00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,440
to steal the students' files.



00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,940
What is your purpose?



00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,100
Fine.



00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,440
Such being the case,



00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,790
I will be frank with you.



00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,220
Over the past five years,



00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,720
a total of 426 persons have been reported missing



00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,570
in the major newspapers of Tianjin.



00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,110
Among them,



00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,520
fifty-nine



00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,730
are young girls.



00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,080
So you think those fifty-nine missing persons



00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,490
are somehow connected with our academy?



00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,220
If this had been true,



00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,850
before you investigate us,



00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,510
our school would have been long closed.



00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,600
Among the missing young girls,



00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,070
fifty were diverse



00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,540
in backgrounds.



00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,400
However, nine of them



00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,700
were at school age.



00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,980
Moreover,



00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
based on their family backgrounds,



00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,270
they just met the admission requirements of your academy.



00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,380
If you want to know



00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,980
whether they have connections with us,



00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,310
you can ask the persons who put the notice in the newspaper.



00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,640
You have expected this.



00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,850
Therefore,



00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,640
the families of the missing girls



00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,670
all



00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,520
denied that



00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,740
they were



00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,600
the students of your academy.



00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,700
Since the parents have denied it,



00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,660
Miss Xiao,



00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,960
you are wronging us.



00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,840
Those nine students



00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,960
went missing in four different school years.



00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,200
Also, four years ago,



00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,760
Mr. Doubai passed away



00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,510
and you took over his position.



00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,030
I want to know



00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,370
the secrets hidden



00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,970
in your academy.



00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,630
In this academy,



00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,510
there are really secrets you want to know.



00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,870
However, it is a pity that



00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,920
you will have no chance to know them.



00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,720
Untie me as we run.



00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,870
Chase them!



00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,090
Hurry to chase them!



00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,090
Go hide yourself there.



00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,720
OK.



00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,300
You leave first.



00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,910
You go find a place to hide.



00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,870
When the daytime comes,



00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,050
the students will show up.



00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,080
Then you will be fine. Got it?



00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,780
How about you?



00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,680
I,



00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,550
I am capable of martial arts.



00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,410
So you need not worry about me.



00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,050
I…



00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,370
I will go.



00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,090
Gu Ying.



00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,010
I am the sorceress.



00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,830
I will head neither north nor south.



00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,910
It is late.



00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,280
Why are you still hanging out there?



00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
Do you have some respect for the rules?



00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,200
Daria.



00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,530
What are you doing?



00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,250
Put down the knife.



00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,290
Mr. Bai.



00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,440
Wenmei.



00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,720
Are you talking to me?



00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,020
The president ordered me to kill you



00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,640
and then impute the crime to her.



00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,349
However, I am your elder brother.



00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,980
I don't have the heart to kill you.



00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,329
So Chen Siru was the one who died.



00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,430
She found it out.



00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,960
So she must die.



00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,610
Wait for me.



00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,190
I will finish this soon.



00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,860
After I finish this,



00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,590
we will go home together



00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,930
and go back to the countryside.



00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,870
I will draw a bull.



00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,500
You will watch me draw it.



00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,680
When the hibiscus blooms,



00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,530
we will set out.



00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,830
Before we leave,



00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,070
I have something to attend to.



00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,660
They bullied you.



00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,280
I will revenge you.



00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,550
Tonight the moon is full.



00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,040
The Crystal Palace must be filled with guests.



00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,640
This day finally came.



00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,370
I have been waiting for it for long.



00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,840
You died.



00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,010
They must die, too.



00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,680
You are back.



00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,790
You are back to present flowers



00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,540
to them.



00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,200
Why are you doing this?



00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,660
Don't be scared.



00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,650
I have got a kind of drug.



00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,020
I will grind it into powder and sprinkle it over the blade.



00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,960
When I poke the blade into your skin,



00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,240
you won't feel any pain.



00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,950
You won't feel hurt at all.



00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,950
You are not my elder brother.



00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,700
My,



00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,210
my elder brother is Guo Deyou,



00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,080
the Little River God.



00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,570
In normal days, when I draw pictures,



00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,410
you always stand aside quietly,



00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,310
watching me, right?



00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,820
What is wrong today?



00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,490
Why are you so talkative?



00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,390
Four years ago,



00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,050
they bullied you.



00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,290
But I didn't know.



00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,150
I was lost in drawing.



00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,200
So I failed to protect you.



00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,690
My heart



00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,510
got broken.



00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,030
I intended to burn my drawing studio and myself



00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,930
to join you in the other world.



00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,410
But I couldn't.



00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,070
I have to stay alive.



00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,990
Even if I have to conceal my real name



00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,550
and do the dirty work for them,



00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,700
I must revenge you.



00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,880
I stopped being Wu Shuosheng.



00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,630
You…



00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,910
You are Wu Shuosheng?



00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,710
A fire burnt up



00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,690
and buried the past.



00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,660
Wu Shuosheng was obsessed with drawing.



00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,340
He didn't take care of you.



00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,220
But Bai Sihu is different.



00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,040
He will stay by your side forever



00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,940
to guard you.



00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,960
Just bear the pain.



00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,170
It will be over soon.



00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,690
In a while, if anyone comes to make a fuss,



00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,650
you need not be scared.



00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,640
You only need to watch.



00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,450
I will revenge you.



00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,620
Gu Ying.



00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,030
Gu Ying.



00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,090
It is us.



00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,660
Why



00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,680
are you two here?



00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,290
We are worried about you.



00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,120
Are you all right?



00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,200
Where is Ying?



00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,530
As expected, the president is involved in the missing person case.



00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,070
Gu Ying asked me to hide here.



00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,410
She ran in that direction.



00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,370
I couldn't stop her.



00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,640
So you intended to go to Beijing



00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
to widen your knowledge, right?



00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,170
Why are you so reckless?



00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,260
Bro Guo, don't be anxious.



00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,100
How can I not be anxious?



00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,060
She is my wife-to-be.



00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,220
You are also



00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,070
as reckless as her



00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,350
and a part of this.



00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,220
Why don't you focus on your own business?



00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,760
Why must you have a hand in this?



00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,910
Guo Deyou.



00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,140
I will



00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,420
take the blame.



00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,660
However, have you ever thought



00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,450
why Gu Ying has kept you in the dark?



00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,650
You are not the only one.



00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,250
Ding Mao is the same.



00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,680
You two always



00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,770
keep things to yourselves



00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,050
and never let us know anything.



00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,380
Gu Ying has been worried about you.



00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,100
Now you are worried about her.



00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,220
I…



00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,990
Why haven't you noticed her feelings before?



00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,220
I…



00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,200
If anything bad happens to Gu Ying,



00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,120
I, Xiao Lanlan



00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,490
will pay with my own life.



00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,700
Lanlan, stop saying that.



00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,560
Don't hurt each other's feelings.



00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,520
Shut up!



00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,120
I am telling you.



00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,610
If Ying gets hurt a bit,



00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,680
hurting your feelings will be the minimal consequence.



00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,730
Take her away quickly.



00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,030
There is the red powder around the corpse.



00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,010
It must be done by Bai Sihu.



00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,360
He didn't do it as you ordered.



00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,010
Let's go.



00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,290
You like the embroidery doll the best, right?



00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,940
You said that



00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,080
you would look like her when you got married.



00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,600
This is the embroidered wedding garment I made for you.



00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,230
It is embroidered with



00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,750
the hibiscus flowers you like.



00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,510
She is not prepared for you.



00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,680
Take her away.



00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,520
President Zhou!



00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,540
President Zhou!



00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,160
I have done enough for you.



00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,720
Please fulfill my wish this time.



00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,210
Please let me keep her.



00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,610
Take her away!



00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,520
She is my younger sister!



00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,020
She is my younger sister!



00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,140
She is my younger sister! Don't touch her!



00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,020
She is my younger sister! Don't touch her!



00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,310
Don't touch her!



00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,260
Beauty, I will pick you.



00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,610
Your skin is so delicate.



00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,930
Drink!



00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,390
Mr. Ding, welcome to the earthly paradise,



00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,730
the Crystal Palace.



00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,320
This way please.



00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,880
Fire and water can be united.



00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,160
Bro Ding,



00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,310
give it a try.



00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,110
I have the leg disease.



00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,200
So I can't drink.



00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,310
Fine.



00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,190
It is just entertainment.



00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,920
Drink or not.



00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,030
Do as you like.



00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,430
That is the spirit.



00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,880
Why are you here?



00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,290
For money



00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,130
or for power?



00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,850
Or for something else?



00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,150
For something else.



00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,590
Get in there.



00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,590
Leave one man to watch him.



00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,570
Take this girl away.



00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,710
What is the purpose of the curve cut-off?



00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,010
Since Mr. Ding assumed office



00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,560
as the secretary of the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce,



00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,380
murders have been committed successively.



00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,920
What is the reason?



00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,380
I don't know.



00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,750
I am tracking down the murderer.



00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,820
You are hiding something from the governor.



00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,530
No, I am not.



00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,240
How did Xiao Yan die?



00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,970
I killed him.



00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,680
I wanted to take his place.



00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,730
How about the diplomat Gu Weiliang?



00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,220
He died accidentally.



00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,100
He died accidentally?



00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,220
Yes.



00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,480
He was wronged and died.



00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,880
I will shoot you with this gun.



00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,840
Are you scared?



00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,740
Yes, I am.



00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,110
Then you must tell me the truth.



00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,770
I have told you the truth.



00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,580
Mr. Ding, are you all right?



00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,050
You drank up the liquor too soon.



00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,780
It is normal for you to be like this at first.



00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,320
You will get used to it after drinking it several times.



00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,040
Bro, to join in the game.



00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,320
you have gone through a lot.



00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,179
I am afraid you must be shocked.



00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,290
Come on.



00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,600
Let me help you



00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,900
dispel your fear.



00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,710
Miss.



00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:55,820
Miss.



00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,930
Listen to me, Mr. Kong.



00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,600
We should do the math this way.



00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,410
The America provides technologies.



00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,080
The UK takes charge of transportation.



00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,480
What should we do?



00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,880
We only need to supervise them.



00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,500
Drink this, too.



00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,860
Come on, President Tao.



00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,050
To happy cooperation! To happy cooperation!



00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,150
Come on, gal!



00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
President Tao, open your mouth.



00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,350
You must put your finger in it.



00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,290
So pretty!



00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,570
Don't think about it.



00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,940
She is for Bro Ding.



00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,840
OK. All right.



00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,650
Bro Ding,



00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,610
she is yours.



00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,230
He has fallen out with Miss Xiao.



00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,450
Why is he still self-restrained?



00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,140
What nonsense!



00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,210
-Gu Ying. 
-Even if he didn't fall out with Miss Xiao,



00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,420
he should be allowed to have some fun.



00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,620
Well, what are you doing?



00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,860
Gu Ying. Gu Ying. Gu Ying.



00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,880
Mayor Bai.



00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,540
Gu Ying.



00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,520
You didn't understand Bro Ding.



00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,010
He isn't into that girl.



00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,840
Gu Ying.



00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,610
Then what should we do?



00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,520
It is easy.



00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,610
Change for another one.



00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,500
All people present on the site,



00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,180
me included,



00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,870
are sinners.



00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,580
Sinners.



00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,330
It doesn't matter.



00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,730
Today



00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,380
you will have a good chance to atone for your crimes.



00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,510
A good chance.



00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,210
You are a sinner.



00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,910
You, too.



00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,420
You abandoned yourself to vice.



00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,580
You associated with the evil people.



00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,810
You aided the evildoer.



00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:15,960
You are a liar.



00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,440
You are lascivious.



00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,910
Mayor Bai,



00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,270
you are so greedy.



00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,810
Commander Wu,



00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,840
you are despotic.



00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,200
You are all bad persons.



00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,580
Younger sister.



00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:26,980
You.



00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,370
You are not my sister.



00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,300
We are all sinners.



00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,000
Hibiscus flowers.



00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,520
Hibiscus flowers.



00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,190
Hibiscus flowers. Hibiscus flowers.



00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,710
Your favorite hibiscus flowers.



00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,050
Ying.



00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,180
Hibiscus flowers.
