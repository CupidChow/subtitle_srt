00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,500
Let's come back to our story

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,180
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,580
Previously, we talked about

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,220
that the romance of Nie Xiaoqiu and Mrs. Cui is broken.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,540
Mrs. Cui told the whole story to Guo Deyou.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,020
Father of Xiao pretended his death to deceive the public.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,300
Xiao Lanlan and Ding Mao had a sweet date

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
in the photo studio.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,380
When Guo Deyou and Ding Mao discussed about the case,

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,820
they found there might be some hidden facts

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,580
of the "Crazy Cui" case.

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,820
In the wild countryside, certain mystery man fed the fishes in the pond.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,620
At the quayside, Secretary General welcomed the diplomatist.

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,540
Captain Zheng escorted Nie Xiaoqiu

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,340
to the mansion of the governor under guard

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,140
to copy the play of "Bronze Sparrow Terrace",

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,500
which introduced a long story.

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,300
Little River God caused a huge disturbance in the Jianghu.

20
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,260
Sorceress Zhang urged to ask for a harmonious union.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,900
Old friends had a reunion in the Dragon King Temple.

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,260
There was chaos happening all over Tientsin.

23
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,259
Jianghu.

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,860
Science.

25
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,620
Kung fu.

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,260
Truth.

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,139
Nine statues of ox.

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,660
Two statues of tiger.

29
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,460
One statue of rooster.

30
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,740
A diplomatist.

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,660
I won't film anymore.

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,620
There's always a volunteer who will swallow the bait.

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,340
Mom.

34
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,180
Foreign trash.

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,700
Germany.

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,540
Commander Wu.

37
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,660
Mayor Bai.

38
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,500
Your last name is Gu while mine is Zhang.

39
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,180
Relieve pain.

40
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,940
Play the role.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,420
The one is killed by me.

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,580
Father.

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,380
I admit my destiny.

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,340
The Silver Bell Seal?

45
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,220
River God.

46
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,020
River God

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,380
River God.

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,220
River God.

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,420
Tientsin Mystic 2

50
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,460
Episode 5

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,840
It's the first time I've observed you, Little River God, in such a close distance.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,770
You do have a dignified appearance.

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,650
I can dimly feel your sorrow through your expression.

54
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,150
Are you worrying about the people and country?

55
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,200
Get down to business.

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,790
Miss Gu.

57
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,290
In a place like Tientsin,

58
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,920
which place can be counted as one where heroes or great men appear?

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,390
The Dragon King Temple.

60
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,800
Dragon King Temple is built to respect the Dragon King,

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,590
so who common people believe in the most

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,060
is the Dragon King. Am I right?

63
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,960
Nope.

64
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,010
They believe in the Elder River God, Master Guo.

65
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,930
Master Guo has a high virtue and glorious name.

66
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,970
He's supposed to prolong life joyfully to cultivate his mind

67
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,130
and keep away from secularity.

68
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,019
Of course.

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,580
Except Master Guo,

70
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,140
could I find any other talent who is influential enough

71
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,250
in Tientsin,

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,470
can sort out the mess,

73
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,540
and will be objected by no one as long as he makes a decision

74
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,140
in the Dragon King Temple?

75
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,970
Do you have to find?

76
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,170
I get your point.

77
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,260
You must have some bad intentions.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,230
Brother Guo, to tell you the truth,

79
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,420
the chemical fertilizer plant of mine

80
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,640
has started production now.

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
But folks around my plant

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,670
have a huge prejudice against my business.

83
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,780
They think the water flowing out from my plant is poisonous,

84
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,060
which has contaminated the land.

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,720
What's more,

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,680
they've found plenty of local rogues

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,890
to make a mess in my place every day.

88
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,910
I wanted to give them some money

89
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,940
to sort out the mess at first,

90
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,950
but they refused to leave.

91
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,600
I'm a businessman

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
but not someone who will take in these idlers.

93
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,510
Brother Guo, could you help me deal with it?

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,690
Haven't you told me that

95
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,920
you would talk with Second Brother Guo

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,200
about strategies related to the rise and fall of the nation?

97
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,310
Nope.

98
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,280
Everyone should be responsible for the rise and fall of the chemical fertilizer plant.

99
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,620
If the chemical fertilizer plant can run well,

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,840
what could ordinary people fill their bellies with?

101
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,180
If they fail to fill their bullies,

102
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,200
how could they live a happy life?

103
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,610
If they aren't able to live a happy life,

104
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,659
isn't it closely related to the rise and fall of a nation?

105
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,370
Well, I'm just someone who retrieves corpses from the water.

106
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,100
The river is blocked now,

107
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,760
and it's hard for me to do my own business.

108
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,580
I can at most care for something that happens to my neighbors.

109
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,880
So I won't be able to care for your foreign plant.

110
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,320
Besides,

111
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,100
you could ask policemen for help, if rogues made a mess.

112
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,110
Otherwise,

113
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,760
you can go to ask Secretary General Ding

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,000
who knows the important principle thoroughly and cares so much for the country and people for help.

115
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,300
I've thought about it.

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,670
If Secretary General Ding comes to deal with the thing,

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,340
that'll be a big deal.

118
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,960
The thing happens among ordinary people

119
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,840
should be dealt with someone who knows well about it.

120
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,890
Such a small dispute that happened in the Jianghu

121
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,450
can definitely be settled by you.

122
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,220
First,

123
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,460
we don't have a long-standing friendship.

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,740
Second,

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,050
I don't have problems with those rogues.

126
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,290
I favor no one

127
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,590
except for law and order.

128
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,640
Ordinary people have no proof to prove

129
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,540
your chemical fertilizers are poisonous,

130
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,970
while why should I believe in your big speech

131
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,440
that your chemical fertilizer plant is beneficial to the country and people?

132
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,920
You're right.

133
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,710
I use the water of the Haihe River

134
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,250
to irrigate the vegetables and fruits in my experimental fields

135
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,040
and I also apply chemical fertilizers on them.

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,409
You can see how well they're growing

137
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,200
and you can know whether I'm telling the truth

138
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,220
as long as you have a bite.

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,880
Where are they?

140
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,670
Not this one.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,690
That one.

142
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,300
I've eaten them up on my way.

143
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll provide the Dragon King Temple with all vegetables you need.

144
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,450
Will it work?

145
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,720
You should take care of your vegetables first.

146
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,860
It's mine.

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,820
It's mine.

148
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,500
It's mine.

149
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,460
It's mine.

150
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,800
It's mine.

151
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,350
Mr. River God.

152
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,460
Are you sure?

153
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,480
Of course.

154
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,830
I won't punch you. Come here.

155
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,750
Will you live up to your words?

156
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,180
When have I ever lied to you?

157
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,080
Come on, come here.

158
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,530
It's none of my business, is it?

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,290
If it weren't I who led you the way,

160
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,440
how could you earn the money?

161
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,780
It's none of my business, is it?

162
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,690
You're asking for some tuition fees, aren't you?

163
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,110
Sesame Oil Shop of the Zhous is time-honored.

164
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,710
Second Brother has gone there to be an apprentice.

165
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,270
Tips of two days will enable him to earn that money back.

166
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,300
I don't get it.

167
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,930
Why will such a pretty girl like you

168
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,530
chase after a man

169
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,640
who doesn't care for you at all?

170
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,520
The river has been blocked, so the corpse-salvage team has nothing to do.

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,500
I can't let Second Brother Guo suffer from hunger.

172
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,770
Is it possible for Guo Deyou

173
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,630
to suffer from hunger?

174
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,380
To tell you the truth,

175
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,750
your dear Second Brother Guo hasn't

176
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,539
worked there,

177
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,490
and he has embezzled the tuition fees

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,850
after he got them back.

179
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,450
Are you sure?

180
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,470
Of course.

181
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,750
He did a right thing.

182
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,180
What a genius of geniuses he is!

183
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,060
How could he grind beans

184
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,790
to make sesame oil,

185
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,010
Mom?

186
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,080
Okay, fine, fine.

187
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,740
From now on,

188
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,390
I won't care whether he's a genius of geniuses or an ordinary person.

189
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,100
You can chase after whoever you like.

190
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,600
When I adopted you anyhow,

191
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,540
there was a worthless bronze lock on you

192
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,780
on which you original last name was engraved.

193
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,030
Your last name is Gu.

194
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,590
I, whose last name is Zhang,

195
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,790
won't take care of you anymore.

196
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,460
You're my mother for sure.

197
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,320
Have a seat. Have a seat.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
I don't deserve it.

199
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,180
I don't.

200
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,920
Mom,

201
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,480
you know well of Second Brother since his childhood.

202
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,580
If I get married in Shanxi or Guangdong and Guangxi,

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,140
who will take care of you in the rest of your life?

204
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,120
We two will company you by your side,

205
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,460
and then you'll have nothing to worry about.

206
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,770
It's because I know well of him since his childhood,

207
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,290
I know the most clearly what he can achieve.

208
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,740
I won't count on him to take care of me.

209
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,410
As long as he doesn't make a mess for me,

210
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,030
I'll regard it as his big achievement.

211
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,950
What are you talking about, Mom?

212
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,360
I'm saying it.

213
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,580
You have to believe me.

214
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,010
You ask him to come here and discuss about your marriage.

215
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,250
See whether he dares to come or not.

216
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,250
You

217
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,940
haven't told him why I invited him for a meal.

218
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,740
The joss stick shop in the Qianmen asked me

219
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,910
for some amulets from me yesterday.

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,580
Mom, Second Brother,

221
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,790
you two can have dinner first.

222
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,390
I'm leaving.

223
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,350
You.

224
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,580
I get to know why you dared to have the meal.

225
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,540
Are you kidding?

226
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,780
I dare to eat my last meal of my life.

227
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,380
What else don't I dare to do?

228
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,670
Bean curd mixed with chopped green onion means poverty and blankness.

229
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,520
Boiled crab cover means

230
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,700
you won't listen to me, will you?

231
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,590
Nope.

232
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,020
But I'm as firm as it.

233
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,460
She's like a big fish in a little pond.

234
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,260
You'll put up with her, won't you?

235
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,220
Sure.

236
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,140
Your daughter adores me.

237
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,840
I…

238
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,540
The quick-fried pork tongue with scallions

239
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,460
implies being glib.

240
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,630
The pigskin jelly in sauce implies

241
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,040
I don't know what shame is.

242
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,180
I have to tell you the truth today.

243
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,310
The matrimonial home should be one house with two courtyards.

244
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,810
Gold bracelets, gold ear rings and gold rings

245
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,470
are necessary.

246
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,270
On the wedding day,

247
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,020
twenty banquets in the Dengying Building is a must, which is nonnegotiable.

248
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,910
I have one thing to ask you.

249
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,160
Which childe do you want to blackmail?

250
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,000
If you are a childe, you're wealthy or influential.

251
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,350
If my daughter, Gu Ying,

252
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,460
were smart enough to fall in love with someone else,

253
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,340
I wouldn't have to discuss about it with you today.

254
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,940
When do I promise to marry her?

255
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,960
Guo Deyou,

256
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,230
you've been wasting the time of my daughter, Gu Ying for so many years.

257
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,700
You're being glib

258
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,680
and you refuse to marry her.

259
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,110
I don't agree with what you said.

260
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,780
What do you mean wasting her time?

261
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,400
I'll marry Ying sooner or later.

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,260
But for the requests you've made,

263
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,820
I won't promise.

264
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,250
Okay. Fine.

265
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,190
You mean you'll refuse the marriage, won't you?

266
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,410
When I'll get married

267
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,880
isn't your call to make.

268
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,270
Now, I'll let you know

269
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,090
whether I can make the call.

270
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,530
Little River God, congratulations. Congratulations.

271
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,380
Congratulations. Congratulations.

272
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,610
Congratulations, Little River God.

273
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,880
Master Guo,

274
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,610
you have to keep a brick in your house

275
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,830
and hide some money for tobacco and wine,

276
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,110
but you don't have to bury them too deep.

277
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,190
A secret place will work,

278
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,410
which you know alone.

279
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,190
Young Master Guo,

280
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,310
when you sleep with your girl,

281
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,550
you should put a pillow under her waist.

282
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,570
It's helpful.

283
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,040
If she fails to be pregnant,

284
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,450
you can come to me for medications.

285
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,790
They will definitely work.

286
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,180
You're brilliant.

287
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,460
Awesome, I mean.

288
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,250
You've nailed such a big thing

289
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,110
without saying a single word.

290
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,280
You don't even notice your friends, do you?

291
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,500
What? What are you talking about?

292
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,390
What do you mean?

293
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,570
You're pretending. You are.

294
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,810
All people in Tientsin, except the deaf,

295
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,670
have already known you're going to get married with Gu Ying.

296
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,550
Son of a bitch.

297
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,410
Master Guo. Master Guo.

298
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,570
What do you make

299
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,000
the tea with, hot water

300
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,690
or the bitter water in your stomach?

301
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,140
You'll have the tea I make for you.

302
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,700
Otherwise, I'll be furious enough to hurt you.

303
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,820
As an old saying goes,

304
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,990
one has to be nice to someone else, in case they will meet in the future.

305
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,530
Sorceress Zhang is

306
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,660
clearly forcing me.

307
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,330
I haven't said I wouldn't marry her daughter.

308
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,910
But why did she have to make it known to all in Tientsin?

309
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,720
A calamity can be avoided

310
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,920
while it's extremely hard to refuse unreasonable demands of an elderly lady.

311
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,970
Now that they don't dislike and avoid you,

312
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,760
you should get married to her daughter.

313
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,910
Master,

314
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,280
I think the Dragon King Temple is the only place

315
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,220
where I can get some peace and quiet.

316
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,880
Why are you saying so?

317
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,810
You two are supposed to be a couple.

318
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,560
It's your destiny and you won't be able to change it.

319
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,850
How come you're dispensing so many medicines?

320
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,150
Do you prepare them for your grandchildren?

321
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,900
Thunder might crash in a sunny day,

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,170
so one has to take all reasonable precautions, which won't be in vain.

323
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,820
Someone is coming. Go answer the door.

324
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,060
Why can't I hear the knock?

325
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,990
Miss Wang,

326
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,660
why are you here?

327
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,780
A dish from Boyu Restaurant.

328
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,190
It seems I get what you prefer.

329
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,050
It tastes the best in Tientsin.

330
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,670
You've promised to invite me for fish stew with steamed bun.

331
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,140
How long has it been?

332
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,190
I can't wait.

333
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,240
So I invite you first.

334
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,670
Please come in. Come in, please.

335
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,020
Master.

336
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,230
Master.

337
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,140
Master.

338
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:09,930
Master.

339
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,380
I have no idea where he's going.

340
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,500
He disappeared when I was distributing these dishes.

341
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,860
Fine. He doesn't have the luck to enjoy these dishes.

342
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,700
Let's enjoy ourselves.

343
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,200
Miss Wang,

344
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,440
my life is boring.

345
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,660
I neither see a movie nor read a newspaper.

346
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,640
Have you filmed anything new recently?

347
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,880
Mr. Guo never reads a newspaper,

348
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,930
but you're always mentioned in a newspaper.

349
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed.

350
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,010
I don't

351
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
make movies now.

352
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,490
Are you retired?

353
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,280
I don't make movies anymore,

354
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,840
but I'm going to act in an opera.

355
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,060
I'm here to send you a ticket.

356
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,440
It's an opera

357
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,339
about a sweet marriage of lovebirds.

358
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,579
I'm going to watch it. I will.

359
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:16,800
I have no idea

360
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,530
who will

361
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,390
play the bridegroom?

362
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,080
Looking at the picture,

363
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,930
I can't imagine he's

364
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,780
such a big shot all over the world.

365
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,830
Haven't you fetched him?

366
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,810
Why do you act like it's the first time you've seen him?

367
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,530
It's dark and rainy that day.

368
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,980
The brim of his hat almost covered his face,

369
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
so I didn't see what he looks like at all.

370
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,880
He's mysterious.

371
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,470
This diplomatist

372
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,450
has a complicated

373
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,540
overseas background.

374
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,330
Of course.

375
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,190
I'm in charge of the whole reception thing

376
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,590
of him in person,

377
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,830
which was specially assigned by the governor.

378
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,990
He's made such ostentation

379
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,570
for getting married?

380
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,880
Or else?

381
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,800
Ying's biological father?

382
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
It's just my guess.

383
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,150
I haven't got the conclusion yet.

384
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
Do you have any proof?

385
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,630
Twenty-one years ago,

386
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,700
when Weiliang was in Tientsin, he had a daughter

387
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,770
who was abducted when she was a newborn baby.

388
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,240
She hasn't been found yet.

389
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,680
Ying is twenty-one-year-old now.

390
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,080
But at that time,

391
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,130
Mogudao had been abducting children all over Tientsin.

392
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,240
There were so many families that lost their children.

393
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,740
But why does Miss Gu have the last name, Gu?

394
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,400
Why her last name is Gu is that her mother…

395
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,560
The last name of her mother is Zhang.

396
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,570
I come here this time not only to send you the invitation

397
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,390
but to ask you to investigate

398
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,290
whether Miss Gu has something to prove her identity.

399
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,280
If they're long lost father and daughter,

400
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,710
it will be a good thing for them to get a family reunion.

401
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,620
It's getting cold. Have it.

402
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,280
A wedding can be held like this, can't it?

403
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,910
What a western style it is!

404
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,940
There's a thing.

405
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,480
I…

406
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,180
…I just wanna tell you randomly.

407
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,590
You…

408
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,130
…you don't have to listen to it so carefully.

409
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,730
It's perfect everywhere,

410
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,210
but why don't they prepare a feast?

411
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,280
All the dishes are cold. And there isn't a pork elbow.

412
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,440
Then I'll have some bread.

413
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,380
It's a cake.

414
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,520
Nope.

415
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,820
Maybe it's not the time.

416
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,910
They might serve you some hot dishes at the right time.

417
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,520
Nope.

418
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,020
Two days ago,

419
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,810
when Wang Meiren sent me the invitation,

420
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,860
she said something to me. She said…

421
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,630
Foreign shit.

422
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,600
Wait a second.

423
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,710
I propose a toast to you.

424
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,300
Okay.

425
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,100
Please.

426
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,410
Three seasons of the Fos Port,

427
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,530
so there should be three paintings.

428
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,870
It's one of them.

429
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,650
Rau'Shee

430
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,950
is a French commercial artist.

431
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,250
Although his painting skill is incredible,

432
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,850
he boasts high production.

433
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Most of his paintings are commercial goods in circulation,

434
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,720
whose commercial value is greater than their artistic value.

435
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,850
It's said that

436
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,450
his lover is a famous actress,

437
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,440
which is the same as the bridegroom today.

438
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,930
Do you also know Gu Weiliang?

439
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,290
When I went to study in Germany,

440
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,720
it's Mr. Gu who recommended me and chose the university for me.

441
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,340
I felt he

442
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,970
had a dignified appearance and he's like a jade tree in the wind at that time.

443
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,780
The temperament seen from his face

444
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,570
showed he wasn't an ordinary person.

445
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,330
Unsurprisingly, when we meet again,

446
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,540
he's already been a diplomatist

447
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,440
who has also got married to a super star.

448
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,100
But looking at me,

449
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,280
I've achieved nothing.

450
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,540
Time promises opportunities.

451
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,570
You're still young.

452
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,580
I know there're so many high officials and noble lords coming here today.

453
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,710
Why not ask Diplomatist Gu to recommend you to them?

454
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,270
It might benefit your chemical fertilizer business.

455
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,180
One will look fabulous when he's dressed up well.

456
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,350
The aged man looks pretty vigorous when he's dressed up well.

457
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,560
But Wang Meiren doesn't love him, does she?

458
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,970
He's old enough to be her father.

459
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,700
Father?

460
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,430
I'm talking about a father thing, ain't I?

461
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,590
Your last name is Gu. So is his.

462
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,440
Why not accost him?

463
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,430
Maybe he's really your biological father.

464
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,910
Are you kidding me?

465
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,670
I don't have the luck.

466
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,560
If he's my father,

467
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,590
then Wang Meiren will be my…

468
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,700
Are you taking advantage of me?

469
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,230
Nope.

470
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,310
Mr. Bai Jiwen, the mayor of Tientsin,

471
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,290
presents a cash gift of six hundred silver dollars.

472
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,580
Mr. Wu Zuonan, Commander in Chief of Tientsin Command,

473
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,950
presents a cash gift of eight hundred silver dollars.

474
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,370
Congratulations. Congratulations.

475
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,200
Mr. Gu,

476
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,020
I'll send you a meagre present to show my blessing.

477
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,460
It's the calligraphy of the well-known calligrapher,

478
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,850
Mr. Yu Youren.

479
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,920
It's "prosperity brought by the dragon and the phoenix".

480
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,500
Please accept it.

481
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,860
You're welcome, Mayor Bai.

482
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,200
The calligraphy

483
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,170
is the most appropriate to be hung

484
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,150
in the matrimonial home of my extraordinary Second Brother.

485
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,230
You're wrong.

486
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,070
I'm more than extraordinary.

487
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,160
Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

488
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,310
Black characters on a white background

489
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,230
don't mean good fortune in such a big day.

490
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,260
Take it away. Come on. Take it away.

491
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,110
Take it away.

492
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,480
You should leave.

493
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,660
Let me show mine.

494
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,690
It's the painting of the union of an immortal couple from a well-known artist in the Ming Dynasty.

495
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,340
I wish your wife and you can have a harmonious union lasting a hundred years.

496
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,010
Isn't it the tactical deployment of troops of fire bulls

497
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,690
in the Warring States Time?

498
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,610
How can it be sent as a wedding gift?

499
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,410
What misfortune it means!

500
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,820
I…I…I

501
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,620
I…

502
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,830
Mr. Gu,

503
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,370
Commander Wu hopes

504
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,250
Miss Wang and you

505
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,300
can live a prosperous life

506
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,280
and you can have a successful and bullish official career.

507
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,010
Congratulations. Congratulations.

508
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,030
Commander Wu is thoughtful.

509
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,660
The guy is so shrewd.

510
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,020
What a big speech

511
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,880
he's made!

512
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,120
Please, come in.

513
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,910
Please, Diplomatist Gu.

514
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,510
Please, Commander Wu.

515
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,500
Diplomatist Gu, please.

516
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,760
When Mogudao had been abducted children all over Tientsin in those years,

517
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:14,850
that Gu…

518
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,160
Diplomatist Gu was in Tientsin.

519
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,500
You guess what?

520
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,000
His newborn daughter was lost.

521
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,720
Do you think it's a coincidence?

522
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,540
And then…

523
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,340
Mayor, move.

524
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,450
Mr. Gu.

525
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,870
Mr. Gu, take off your clothes right now.

526
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,890
Mr. Gu.

527
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,510
Why is he standing still?

528
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,730
Come on, figure out something.

529
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,300
Get some water. Hurry up.

530
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,020
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

531
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,620
Let's go. Let's go.

532
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,380
Water. Water.

533
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,060
I get some water. Hurry up.

534
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,250
Madam, let's go.

535
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,390
Hurry up. Hurry up. Go upstairs.

536
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,470
Captain, don't get mad.

537
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,130
The death of the diplomatist

538
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,960
is a big case,

539
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,860
but you know,

540
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,250
if you solve it,

541
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,850
that will be a big achievement.

542
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
What a group of douchebags!

543
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,200
Go investigate the case.

544
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,680
All of them have gone out.

545
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,760
The police station is almost empty.

546
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,710
What are you doing?

547
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,180
What on earth are you doing?

548
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,650
Captain Fu,

549
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,750
I've heard you're short of hands.

550
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,440
The governor specially sent me to help you out.

551
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,520
We can be partners

552
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,510
to solve the case of the diplomatist.

553
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,790
Then I can be close to you, can't I?

554
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,880
It'll be convenient for us to discuss about the case.

555
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,120
It's…

556
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,250
Vice-captain Zheng, you're entrusted with the mission at the critical moment, aren't you?

557
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,470
You'll go through a lot.

558
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,240
There's a big mess in Tientsin.

559
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,250
The police station is even short of some helpful dogs.

560
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,270
Listen, the words of you make me feel like I'm a dog.

561
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,470
See what I've said. I was wrong.

562
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I mean

563
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,540
there's a dog that went crazy to fight for a bone

564
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,460
against someone two days ago.

565
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,580
Was the bone it fought for that delicious?

566
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,790
You know what?

567
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,200
It choked to death.

568
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,760
What a pity!

569
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,740
Now that you don't have to feed it,

570
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,820
does it mean you, Captain Fu, can have more to eat?

571
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,350
Take it here.

572
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,370
The chair is good.

573
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,730
Nope. What…what is it?

574
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,910
I'll have to sit face to face with you,

575
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,120
and then

576
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,530
I can't hear

577
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,260
each of your words clearly.

578
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,800
Why are you wiping it?

579
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,010
I wiped it just now.

580
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,510
Stop. Stop.

581
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,840
Captain, it's…

582
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,370
They've crossed the line.

583
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,140
Where's my name board?

584
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,830
Hang it up.

585
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,340
The first round of wheat hasn't been harvested, not to mention the second round.

586
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,020
His eldest brother hasn't got married yet.

587
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,690
How can Guo Deyou get married now?

588
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,380
It's not in line with the tradition. Don't you think so?

589
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,010
Listen to me.

590
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,760
I won't trouble you

591
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,850
with the marriage of his big brother.

592
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,540
I'll take care of

593
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,460
finding the family by marriage, making the Longfeng Card,

594
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,310
sending betrothal gifts and holding the wedding feast,

595
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,170
while you should be generous to pay the charge.

596
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,940
The goose cage, drinks and beverages, wedding cakes and pork elbows

597
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,670
are all necessary, I'm telling you.

598
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,940
A bachelor has plenty of silver dollars in his pocket

599
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,480
while he will have only broken pots when he gets married.

600
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,780
Eldest brother is enjoying his bachelor life.

601
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,870
Why should he get married?

602
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,010
What?

603
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,610
You didn't allow me to have a meal in your place.

604
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,400
And I'm not allowed to have a meal in my place, am I?

605
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,510
You wanna enjoy your meal, don't you?

606
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,330
Then you have to save your nonsense.

607
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,810
Master, I always respect the elderly.

608
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,660
Do you think whether I should retort

609
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,070
or not now?

610
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,860
Since Ying is not here now,

611
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,910
we have to talk
frankly and sincerely.

612
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,110
It's my daughter who has a poor taste

613
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,220
that will have a thing for a toad like you

614
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,910
who can accomplish nothing.

615
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,340
If I don't fear to waste the time of Ying,

616
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,550
I won't allow her to get married to you

617
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,860
in a poor place like your house.

618
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,820
Master, listen to what she's said.

619
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,520
Fine.

620
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,040
Well, give the date of birth and the eight characters of a horoscope

621
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,870
of Ying to me.

622
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,330
Do you fear that she will bring bad fortune to you?

623
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,380
Getting married is a huge thing of a lifetime.

624
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,850
I have to follow the traditions.

625
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,090
Don't I have to ask for the date of birth and the eight characters of a horoscope

626
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,350
and pick an auspicious occasion to decide the day?

627
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,170
Don't you know

628
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,860
that both Ying and you were brought back by your master?

629
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:20,790
Now that Ying doesn't know hers,

630
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,620
why can you know yours?

631
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,330
Master.

632
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,430
Master.

633
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,180
When did you bring Ying back?

634
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,160
It's been a long time. I can't remember.

635
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,520
The eight characters of a horoscope should be divined based on the date of birth.

636
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,890
When she was brought back

637
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,660
has nothing to do with it.

638
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,220
We'll sleep on the same bed.

639
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,370
Shan't we have to know each other well?

640
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,780
You two have grown up together.

641
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,310
What else do you wanna know about her?

642
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,100
Even if we have the friendship of a lifetime,

643
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,470
I wouldn't know all of her thoughts.

644
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,100
Maybe that diplomatist

645
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,430
is the biological father of Ying.

646
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,450
Who?

647
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,040
Who are you saying?

648
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,640
Is…is…is…

649
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,880
is that one who has been incinerated into ashes?

650
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,760
Does Ying know it?

651
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,230
I haven't told her yet.

652
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,960
It's fine. It's great.

653
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,890
Actually, if he didn't die,

654
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
it would be a great family reunion, wouldn't it?

655
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,670
Now he's dead,

656
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,390
don't tell her anymore.

657
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,670
Have you had enough?

658
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,070
Eat, eat, eat. What you know is to eat.

659
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,520
You're listening to us without a response. Can you stand it?

660
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,590
You've had enough.

661
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,280
I'll bring the chicken

662
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,080
back to Ying.

663
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,560
Everyone wants a peaceful and happy life.

664
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,120
Don't make a mess.

665
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,840
Lighting a candle when going out and walking on a bridge to cross a river,

666
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,600
you're not the one

667
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,120
who could try his utmost to achieve something

668
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,850
more than a decade ago.

669
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,240
You should know

670
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,820
what you could accomplish.

671
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,490
Don't screw it up.

672
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,450
Master, what did the sorceress talk about?

673
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,240
What happened more than a decade ago?

674
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,390
What did you screw up?

675
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,820
Take care of your marriage thing.

676
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,100
Don't inquire about

677
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,470
anything else.

678
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,300
Secretary General Ding.

679
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,000
Thank you.

680
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,639
Why don't you bring me salt water this time?

681
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,580
Because you haven't made an appointment for treatment.

682
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,600
I don't delay your later schedule, do I?

684
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,090
Nope.

685
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,010
The later patients can wait.

686
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,900
Okay.

687
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,000
I'll make it short.

688
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,040
You've told me earlier

689
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,659
that the Silver Bell Seal can focus on the details of memories,

690
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,429
so I wanna…

691
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,389
Don't you wanna

692
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,270
use the Silver Bell Seal to investigate a case?

693
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,699
What?

694
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,639
A Rong person can foresee the future?

695
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,159
Secretary General Ding,

696
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,790
if you wanna investigate the case,

697
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,350
you'd better go to the police station.

698
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,420
I can only cure a patient here.

699
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,170
I'm here for my cure.

700
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,450
Failing to solve the case

701
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,050
is my worry.

702
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,590
I happened to give some help for the investigation of the "Crazy Cui" case,

703
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,830
which was quite unintentional.

704
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,850
Okay. I've just mentioned it.

705
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,070
Don't think too much about it.

706
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,070
Sorry to bother you.

707
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,790
What I mean is that

708
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,030
here's the place to cure patients,

709
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,840
so what I can give here is a treatment.

710
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,320
But in some other places,

711
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,000
maybe

712
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,180
I can talk with you about something else

713
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,610
except work.

714
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,380
Okay.

715
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,380
Mom, I haven't seen him the whole day.

716
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,430
He must go to investigate the case.

717
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,050
Investigate the case.

718
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,890
If he goes to investigate, he'll meet Wang Meiren for sure.

719
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,620
Wang Meiren is a widow now.

720
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,130
There's always a lot of disputes happening to a widow.

721
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,540
What are you going to do?

722
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,230
I'm going to put up an Exorcism Talisman for Guo Deyou.

723
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,640
Don't do it. Sit down.

724
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,650
I don't get it.

725
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,780
What kind of enticing spell have been cast that can make you have a thing for him?

726
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,130
If you have time,

727
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,300
you'd better put up a Life-changing Talisman for yourself.

728
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,070
It can't be changed.

729
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,740
I'm destined to

730
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,850
get married to Guo Deyou in my life.

731
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,840
It's not your call to make.

732
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,870
If your families

733
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,470
had taken good care of you,

734
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,410
maybe you would have been a descendant of a prestigious family.

735
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,760
Second Brother has also said so.

736
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,810
He said the last name of that diplomatist is Gu

737
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,830
and so is mine.

738
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,820
Maybe we are families.

739
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,610
You're daydreaming, aren't you?

740
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,490
It's the first time I've officially met you, Secretary General Ding.

741
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,500
I find you

742
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,020
do have a dignified appearance

743
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,330
and you're like a jade tree in the wind.

744
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,560
Your expression shows…

745
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,840
Could you say anything new?

746
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,480
The cut-bend project is a perfect model of the blend of both human wisdom

747
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,620
and the well-being of the people.

748
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,840
I'm flattered.

749
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,180
You're not at all.

750
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,100
When I was in Germany,

751
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,080
I had heard you specially invited some hydraulic experts

752
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,130
to supervise the cut-bend project in Tientsin.

753
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,350
I do respect.

754
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,270
You were in Germany?

755
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,800
I haven't mentioned it.

756
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,040
I majored in industrial chemistry at Berlin Institute of Technology.

757
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,260
Why I come back home this time

758
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,370
is mainly to bring the whole chemical industry of Europe

759
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,720
back to Tientsin,

760
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,880
which can be counted as following your example.

761
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,350
I don't deserve your praise.

762
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,200
The chemistry and general science of Berlin Institute of Technology

763
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,320
rank the first class all over the world.

764
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,200
I've just learnt a little knowledge of forensic medicine

765
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,930
at Humboldt University.

766
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,140
Humboldt University?

767
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,850
Did you live in

768
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,650
Charlotenburg?

769
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,850
I lived in the Kantstrasse.

770
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,060
Did you?

771
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,260
Then I might have encountered you

772
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,290
when I had a meal in the Peking Restaurant.

773
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,530
Do you mean the restaurant with the post of

774
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,340
"Neither the elderly nor the young will be cheated" on its gate?

775
00:38:59,340 --> 00:38:59,980
Exactly.

776
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,860
I'm telling you

777
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,330
that restaurant has gone out of business.

778
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,740
Now there's a barber shop.

779
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,090
It should have gone out of business.

780
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,750
Should it?

781
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,180
Every time I checked out, they overcharged me.

782
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,520
And they said it's rounding off.

783
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,540
That's true.

784
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,820
I quarreled with them over it.

785
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,360
Do you know what they said?

786
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,580
You're a child or an elderly?

787
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,440
Do I imitate perfectly?

788
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,740
You're a child or an elderly?

789
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,510
Yes, you do.

790
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,950
Let's talk about the case.

791
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,620
It has the same trace as the powder left at the scene.

792
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,440
Gu Weiliang did die of spontaneous combustion of phosphorus powder.

793
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,170
Even though phosphorus powder has a lower ignition point,

794
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,150
it is at least forty degrees.

795
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,070
The West Lake Hotel isn't that hot, is it?

796
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,530
How could the murderer make it?

797
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,280
We don't know about it.

798
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,650
Since the combustion was full,

799
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,140
there must have been a mass of phosphorus powder on Gu Weiliang.

800
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,680
The smell of white phosphorus is similar to garlic.

801
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,470
How could he fail to nose it out?

802
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,540
Hurry up. Come on. Hurry up.

803
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,820
Hurry up.

804
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,670
Hang in there.

805
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,640
When were the lamps installed?

806
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,660
The day before the wedding day.

807
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,880
They were lent by the assistant of Mrs. Gu

808
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,030
from the film company

809
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,250
and installed temporarily.

810
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,980
Secretary General Ding.

811
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,440
Secretary General Ding.

812
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,080
Please have a look at it.

813
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,790
You don't have to look at his.

814
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,890
Mine is a mercurial thermometer.

815
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,780
The temperature below the lamps is forty-six degrees.

816
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,740
Forty-six and a half degrees.

817
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,920
My result is more accurate with the bigger size.

818
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,710
Half of a degree higher?

819
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,410
Yep.

820
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,080
Forty-six and a half degrees. -Forty-six degrees.

821
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,720
Half of a degree is enough to trigger the combustion.

822
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,670
Why is your result half of a degree higher than mine?

823
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,010
The result is accurate because of its size.

824
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:21,710
Let me have a look.

825
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,570
Give it to me. Give it to me.

826
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,660
Why should I show you?

827
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,640
Give it to me. Give it to me.

828
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,440
What's it?

829
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,960
It's the anti-allergic medicines of Weiliang.

830
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,860
Does Mr. Gu have an allergy?

831
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,870
It's his old weakness.

832
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,620
He had been suffering a relapse of his allergy

833
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,120
a few days before the wedding day,

834
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,620
so he specially went to visit a doctor

835
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,920
who was said to know medicines the most in Tientsin

836
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,520
and got a folk prescription.

837
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,250
He had to apply a bottle of the medicine on him every day.

838
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,970
Listen to me.

839
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,950
Pull it horizontally, and you can block the gate.

840
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,060
Pull it aslant, and people can go through it easily.

841
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,890
Don't pull it aslant.

842
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,660
Pull it horizontally.

843
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,750
Pull it aslant.

844
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,220
Have you ever seen anyone pulling it aslant?

845
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,750
If it's pulled horizontally, how can people go through it?

846
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,160
How can it be pulled aslant?

847
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,800
Pull it aslant.

848
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,380
Pull it horizontally.

849
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:52,950
Pull it aslant…

850
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620
Secretary General Ding, you're coming.

851
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,770
Come here. Come here. Come here. You should make the judgement.

852
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,750
How can the warning line be pulled, horizontally

853
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,840
or aslant?

854
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,210
It should be pulled vertically.

855
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,780
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

856
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,350
There's something wrong

857
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,200
with the plaster.

858
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,780
What's it?

859
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,920
I'm just the foreign shit.

860
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,780
I don't know about it.

861
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,030
You're a chemist who does your own business,

862
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,600
but not a loafer who's in charge of some sluggards.

863
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,750
How can't you know about it?

864
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,030
For someone like me,

865
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,030
it's hard to do my own business.

866
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,100
I can at most care for something that happens to my neighbors.

867
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,110
I can give you some help

868
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,190
for your case.

869
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,070
But the death of Diplomatist Gu is closely related to the rise and fall of the nation,

870
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,800
shouldn't everyone take his own responsibility?

871
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,040
Something related to the prosperity of the nation is significant.

872
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,770
You can go to find Secretary General Ding

873
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,140
who cares for the people and wins the popular support.

874
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,230
Leave

875
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,210
me behind.

876
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,960
Brother Junyao.

877
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,270
The case that happened among the people

878
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,890
should be investigated by someone who knows well about it.

879
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,680
I'll follow nothing

880
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,470
but the generally acknowledged truth.

881
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,140
For you,

882
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,550
the diplomatist dying on his wedding is a big case

883
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,660
while my chemical fertilizer plant stopping work and production

884
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,450
is a minor thing.

885
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,230
It's easy to deal with it.

886
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,700
The leader of those rogues, Shi,

887
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,620
has been the card parent of my master for decades.

888
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,190
Tell him to meet me in the market

889
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,430
near the wharf.

890
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,630
Do you remember

891
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,610
what I burnt here last time?

892
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,260
Phosphorus.

893
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,160
Exactly.

894
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,850
The plaster has a pretty high content of phosphorus.

895
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,250
When phosphorus was separated,

896
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,490
it would accumulate at the surface of his skin.

897
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,840
-And then it would burn due to the heat of the lamps.

898
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,330
It's so easy to

899
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,020
kill someone directly

900
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,670
by a poison, knife or gun.

901
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,590
Why should it be that devious?

902
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,090
Go ask the murderer.

903
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,360
It's the first time I've observed you, Brother Junyao, in such a close distance.

904
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,330
You do have a dignified appearance and you're like a jade tree in the wind at that time.

905
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,890
I can dimly feel your sorrow through your expression,

906
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,230
but you're wise for sure.

907
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,180
Please have a look at this one.

908
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,320
What's it?

909
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,310
The one I got in the trash can of Gu Weiliang that day.

910
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,250
Why haven't you told me earlier?

911
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,740
Do you trust Captain Zheng?

912
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:35,730
A letter without a word.

913
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,820
A childish trick.
