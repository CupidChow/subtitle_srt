[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,550
Let's come back to our story and continue.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,510
Last time

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,800
we knew that Sorceress Zhang urged Guo Deyou to get married.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,470
The news of Guo Deyou's marriage was spread throughout the city.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,640
Wang Meiren paid a visit,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,720
announced her marriage with Diplomat Gu

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,000
and told Little River God

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,120
her guess of Gu Ying's origin.

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,070
Wang Meiren's wedding ceremony was held in the West Lake Restaurant

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,230
with all the guests

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,070
and friends gathering there happily.

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,790
Unexpectedly,

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,520
Gu Weiliang was incinerated under the watchful eyes of people.

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,280
According to the test, Fan Junyao found that

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,590
Gu Weiliang died from auto-ignition of phosphorus powder.

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,040
Captains, Fu Zheng and Zheng Fu

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,430
were ordered to supervise and handle the case.

20
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,240
Guo Deyou showed a letter with invisible letters.

21
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
The purpose of Gu Weiliang's coming to Tianjin

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,150
is not simple.

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,360
As a result,

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,080
Chairman Ding got lost in the secret area.

25
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,630
Guo Deyou found some clues in Mr. Gu's residence.

26
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,630
The relationship between master and apprentice broke up. And brothers fell out with each other.

27
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,360
The explorer dived into the river, scared out of their wits.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,000
Jianghu.

29
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,759
Science.

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,400
Kung fu.

31
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,120
Truth.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,229
Nine statues of ox.

33
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,270
Two statues of tiger.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
One statue of rooster.

35
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,160
Irrigationist.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,190
Captain Zheng.

37
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,190
Commander in Chief.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,160
Is it easy?

39
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,520
Phosphorus.

40
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,720
Xenon.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,390
It happened tens of years ago.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,750
Dad.

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,720
A bad temper!

44
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,910
Subconscious.

45
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,030
The only way.

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,190
A good wish!

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Conceal.

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,720
You must choose one!

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,960
Curve cut-off.

50
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,000
Tientsin Mystic.

51
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,320
Tientsin Mystic 2

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,160
Episode 6

53
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,190
In the name of marriage,

54
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,750
Gu Weiliang's real purpose

55
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,910
is to see the person mentioned in the letter.

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,630
Close as husband and wife,

57
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,750
they're not honest to each other,

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,630
no better than strangers.

59
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,750
Although their marriage is a cover,

60
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,270
how do you know

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
there isn't real love between them?

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,000
Real love. Real love.

63
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
It must be real

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,240
without anything fake.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,880
Right.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,550
When you get along with people,

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
you focus on sincerity.

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,320
It's really admiring.

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,630
Don't play at me.

70
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,470
No. I'm sincerely convinced.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,600
By the way,

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
I...

73
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,760
It seems that I haven't finished the task that the commander in chief ordered.

74
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,510
I need to deal with it now.

75
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,040
Why didn't you mention that?

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
Huntun is almost ready.

77
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,480
It just came to my mind.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll eat with you next time.

79
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,390
Where are you going?

80
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,000
My office.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
Mr. Ding, you're here.

82
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,070
Come in, please.

83
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,150
What did I see just now?

84
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,470
Silver Bell Seal can create illusion, right?

85
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,440
It's not so powerful.

86
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,790
It just helps to create

87
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,110
the suitable environment to ascertain the inner truth.

88
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,840
What you saw

89
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,960
are the memories and thoughts in your deep brain.

90
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,880
Why did you

91
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,400
use Silver Bell Seal on me

92
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,670
without my permission?

93
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,440
Isn't it your purpose

94
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,840
to come here on invitation this time?

95
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,710
Sit down.

96
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,350
You're trapped

97
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,470
in a fixed thinking set.

98
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
You're right.

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,230
All the clues now

100
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,910
are like an endless loop,

101
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
which I can never get out of.

102
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,470
What about trying this?

103
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,110
Use the Silver Bell Seal to test me again

104
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,470
to see if there is anything missed.

105
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
No matter how many times I test,

106
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,790
the result is the same.

107
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,670
If

108
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,910
I failed to help you find the clue that can break the loop,

109
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,710
maybe the clue

110
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,000
hasn't appeared yet.

111
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,000
Green hands need to experience much

112
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,880
and be taught to behave well.

113
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,280
Bamboo one. Bamboo nine.

114
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,400
Either it's a complete sequence from one to nine or bamboo one,

115
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,590
it has nothing to do with the flush

116
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
of character tiles.

117
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,030
Here it is.

118
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,790
Useless.

119
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,280
Wait a moment.

120
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Pung.

121
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,670
Here is the fifth character tile.

122
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,790
Win.

123
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,440
Dealer, flush, joker, a complete sequence of character tiles from one to nine with the fifth character tile.

124
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,440
Awesome!

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,280
Without my complete sequence from one to nine and bamboo one,

126
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,200
you can't have a complete of character tiles.

127
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,590
Irrelevant.

128
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,760
The world is small.

129
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,960
Everything is related to each other.

130
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,710
The necessary tile is crucial to a planned move.

131
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,150
It's better to make things convenient for each other.

132
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,110
Leave one side of the net open

133
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,110
and you will get help some day.

134
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,030
All concealed hand, twice.

135
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,520
Flush, four times

136
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,640
Mixed one suit, twice.

137
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,320
A completer sequence from one to nine, twice.

138
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,110
Get the fifth character tile, twice.

139
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,640
None dealer from east and west, 64 points each.

140
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,030
As the dealer, Mr. Guo claimed a title to help you win, four times.

141
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,080
256 points.

142
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,550
I claimed a tile and help the dealer win,

143
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,200
your loss is also on me.

144
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,470
You deserve the title of Little River God,

145
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,960
knowing the rules, considerate.

146
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,030
In Tianjin,

147
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,150
Mr. Guo is still honorable.

148
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,550
Let's stop here.

149
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,030
We've played for a long time.

150
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,230
Later,

151
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,470
my friend, Mr. Fan who runs the chemical fertilizer plant

152
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,670
will send the money to your residence.

153
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,110
Losing the game, so you stopped it. You're a real man.

154
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,150
Green hands need to experience much.

155
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,030
We've played for a long time

156
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,880
with much experiences.

157
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,030
No need to experience more.

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,790
We're all friends.

159
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,840
Welcome to play here often.

160
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,230
Wait a moment.

161
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,760
Having played for such a long time

162
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
with much money lost,

163
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,760
why didn't you mention anything about

164
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,640
my chemical fertilizer plant?

165
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,280
OK.

166
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
Lord Shi, Lord Liu said that he couldn't come for dinner.

167
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,470
The case of the diplomat's burning is solved.

168
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,760
He has to be on duty in the police office.

169
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,030
Is the murderer caught?

170
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,840
Yeah.

171
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,880
The murderer has been put into prison.

172
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,910
An actress killed her husband.

173
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,840
The murderer is the film star, Wang Meiren.

174
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,840
The play

175
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,400
is interesting!

176
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,280
What're you doing here?

177
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,670
Is it suitable for you to sit here?

178
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,320
Shuang.

179
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,320
The Little River God is here to ask for the pay.

180
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,320
It's not right.

181
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,030
With the river locked down, the corpse-salvage team has no business.

182
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,760
Your office

183
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,150
is much bigger and more comfortable

184
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,350
than that of Fu's.

185
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,960
However, speaking of handling a case,

186
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,760
you are more muddled than him.

187
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,640
Do you have any idea?

188
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,790
Why do you think

189
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,910
Wang Meiren is the murderer?

190
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,520
The cloth that caused Gu Weiliang's allergy

191
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,520
is bought by Wang Meiren.

192
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,280
The anti-allergic unguent

193
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,110
was applied by Wang Meiren herself.

194
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,400
The high temperature lamp that ignited the phosphorus powder

195
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,910
was borrowed by Wang Meiren from the film company.

196
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,880
She was judged as manslaughter.

197
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,030
Is she wronged?

198
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,590
You good-for-nothing!

199
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,880
Eventually I know why we can't catch the murderer.

200
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,670
The devils

201
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,590
have hidden in comfortable places.

202
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,200
It's not true.

203
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,790
It's a sunny day.

204
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,670
They have run out

205
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,350
to the streets, wandering for food.

206
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,470
Be careful!

207
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,470
I'm

208
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,030
just like a turtle in the river.

209
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,110
With such a rarely-seen case, I want to see the murderer.

210
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,550
She has confessed it.

211
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,350
Only after I see her can it work.

212
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,280
For any big cases in Tianjin,

213
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,590
they must be judged by the God River,

214
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,880
which is convincing.

215
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,550
Wang Meiren is an important criminal.

216
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,150
According to the regulation, you can't see her.

217
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,350
According to the regulation,

218
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,030
I need to review the murderer.

219
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,550
However, I haven't reviewed her yet.

220
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,760
How can it be solved?

221
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,790
What a coincidence!

222
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,550
I was ordered to supervise the case,

223
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
whether to close it,

224
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,640
it depends on me.

225
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,230
My God.

226
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
You come from a higher position?

227
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,520
Aren't you deputy?

228
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,320
When did you become principal?

229
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,910
Offending your superior,

230
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,710
what's the trickery in your floral gut?

231
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,790
I have to keep my gut for the official position,

232
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,470
how could I decorate it with flower?

233
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,080
I mean the governor

234
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,910
wouldn't like the case being unsettled, spreading.

235
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,880
After all, the one burnt to death is an official.

236
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,760
Idea, wing, change package.

237
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,710
Handmade noodles with diced meat.

238
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,350
Fry it in a string in case it falls apart.

239
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,350
The cake collapsed, which must fall apart.

240
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,000
What're you talking about?

241
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,590
Food.

242
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,760
Captain, it's extinguished.

243
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,109
Having worked for the devils for some time,

244
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,280
you don't know who is your leader.

245
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,520
Get out of the way!

246
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,160
Check the exhibits. It's confidential.

247
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,880
Without my permission,

248
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,400
nobody can go inside.

249
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,110
Yes, sir.

250
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,760
Yes.

251
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,400
It's confidential.

252
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,640
Quickly.

253
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,350
Why do you follow me here?

254
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,160
Are you kidding?

255
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,230
Do you really view me as a ladder?

256
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,160
A ladder is more obedient than you.

257
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,310
OK.

258
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,800
Then I'm leaving.

259
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,400
Now I feel a little faint.

260
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,070
I can't get down from the window.

261
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,190
I will walk through the door.

262
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,950
Stop.

263
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,950
Don't make a noise.

264
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,470
Don't touch anything.

265
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,430
What about touching you?

266
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
What about touching you?

267
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,680
Touch you! Touch you!

268
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,000
Hey,

269
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,710
why do you come here?

270
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,920
Sit aside.

271
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,470
Captain Fu.

272
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,520
How are you doing these days?

273
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,640
Hmm, it's a long story.

274
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,680
For these years,

275
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,110
I'm nearly principal.

276
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,800
Unexpectedly, Mr. Zheng came.

277
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,040
Alas!

278
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,000
All my efforts are in vain.

279
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,800
I become a punch-bag.

280
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
If I had known it,

281
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,830
I would have followed my cousin

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,680
to do business of fur between the south and north.

283
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,470
Does your cousin make a fortune?

284
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,800
Yeah, big fortune.

285
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,400
However, I heard that

286
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,160
not everything went smoothly these days.

287
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,190
Hmm.

288
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,760
Captain Zheng.

289
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,400
I...

290
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Captain Fu is...

291
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,590
You...

292
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,430
Don't...

293
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,760
What a coincidence!

294
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,280
Buddy,

295
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,230
unexpectedly, we meet here.

296
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,560
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

297
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,710
Buddy,

298
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,520
unexpectedly, we meet here.

299
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,640
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

300
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,640
Thank you, I can understand it.

301
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,470
You're right.

302
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,310
I didn't understand the words before.

303
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,000
In order to figure out your argot,

304
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,680
I did make some efforts.

305
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,760
Idea, wing, change package.

306
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,560
Handmade noodles with diced meat.

307
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,110
These words mean the enemies put pressure with high-ranking official,

308
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,310
so it's hopeless to see the murderer.

309
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,640
Fry it in a string in case it falls apart.

310
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,470
Guo means…

311
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,590
The scab is here to scramble the territory, we need to cooperate with each other.

312
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
Later I said

313
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,710
the cake collapsed, which must fall apart.

314
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,950
It means

315
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,430
you're right and I will help you.

316
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,310
I am the enemy

317
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,680
and scab.

318
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,230
As a civil servant,

319
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,640
is it suitable for you to offer help like this?

320
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,430
Judging from your question,

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,470
you really regard me as the deputy captain.

322
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,950
It's unquestionable for you to supervise the case.

323
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,520
But they two…

324
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,310
Mr. Zheng,

325
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,560
you haven't been here for long,

326
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,680
knowing little of things

327
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,880
in Tianjin.

328
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
What do you mean?

329
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,800
All the nine rivers flow into the sea with good and evil mixed up.

330
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,680
It's extraordinary.

331
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,640
Officials are usually in responsible for the suppression of the demons and devils.

332
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,430
Then they must

333
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,110
first tell the demons

334
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,640
and devils.

335
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,110
People in various trades get involved with the officials.

336
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,800
How can you tell the monsters and demons?

337
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,160
What if you can tell them?

338
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,400
The River God and Sorceress deserve the title.

339
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,560
Once you get lost at night,

340
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
you have to rely on them.

341
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,520
The case has been solved. I don't need to rely on anybody.

342
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,830
You didn't report the case to me.

343
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,230
How could you say that it has been solved?

344
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,110
Gu Weiliang's identity is special,

345
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,830
which is related to the security of the country.

346
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
The details of the case has caused panic,

347
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,920
which is related to the safety of people.

348
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,880
Can't the governor

349
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,640
suppress the evil?

350
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,880
It's the governor's order?

351
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,190
The I must follow it.

352
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

353
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,470
Shuang. Bang. Come in!

354
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,000
Be careful!

355
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,280
The exhibit has been taken away. Don't you leave?

356
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,230
Yeah!

357
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,560
You first.

358
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,310
It's in vain.

359
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,710
Let me see what it is.

360
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,800
It's none of your business.

361
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,640
I will beat you.

362
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,040
Let's see it together.

363
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,430
Let's see it together.

364
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,470
Let me take it.

365
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,190
There is nothing.

366
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,070
You take it.

367
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,110
I see.

368
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,040
It's the cricket's cinerary casket.

369
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,680
Well.

370
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,190
Let me take it.

371
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,190
Nine-meter dive.

372
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,640
30 minutes' operation.

373
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,040
Based on such working efficiency,

374
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,430
we're likely to get

375
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,640
the data of the second stage soon.

376
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,760
Don't be too optimistic.

377
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,640
The visibility under water is very low.

378
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,070
Common illuminant needs to cost big wattage

379
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,430
to transmit through 10-meter water.

380
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,880
It's more likely for the lamp to break down

381
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,310
with the clash of cold and heat,

382
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,190
thus increase the risk of electric shock.

383
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,000
It's said that

384
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,880
there is a kind of chemical gas

385
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,160
which can give off low-temperature cold light.

386
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,040
I don't know chemistry.

387
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,710
If necessary,

388
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,680
I can help you

389
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,880
get in touch with the experts from Germany.

390
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,520
On behalf of the people in Tianjin,

391
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,760
thank you for your support of the curve cut-off project.

392
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,070
You should thank the support of modern technology.

393
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,040
Science and technology has changed people's living dimensionality.

394
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,230
We have never imagined that

395
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,680
we can walk so fast, fly so high

396
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,190
and dive so deep.

397
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,430
People's living space

398
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,800
is becoming more and more expansive.

399
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,800
Yeah.

400
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,560
More science and technology are needed in China.

401
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,140
Facing the current situation, I would like to dedicate myself to serve the country.

402
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,590
Common as I am, I am still ready to take actions to make contributions.

403
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,230
This is a Tang poem from the Chinese poet Chen Zi' ang.

404
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,070
He is the same as you, still thinking of devoting to the country in the face of danger.

405
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,350
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,110
You have a better understanding of the Chinese culture than me.

407
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,760
China used to be very fascinating.

408
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:49,760
You voted the river way scheme

409
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,400
to protect the women's college.

410
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,950
To clean up the river,

411
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,590
it needs certain flow velocity.

412
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,830
It's good that

413
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,280
we found another route

414
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,000
that can meet the drop height.

415
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,950
It only needs to tear down a broken temple.

416
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Dragon King Temple?

417
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,710
Is there another scheme?

418
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,710
You must choose one

419
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,040
from the Dragon King Temple

420
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,070
and the women's college.

421
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,350
If the decision is made,

422
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,920
the surrounding inhabitants must be evacuated soon.

423
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,190
[Dragon King Temple]

424
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,880
In 1898,

425
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,110
English Chemists Ramsey and Treffers

426
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,830
separated a gas from the liquefied air,

427
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,190
excited

428
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,430
magnificent strong blue light with the discharge tube

429
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,470
and named it xenon

430
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,280
which can release cold light source

431
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,110
with low temperature.

432
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,950
So it's also called xenonum,

433
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,280
which means strangers.

434
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,430
It's not familiar with you.

435
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,310
No need to be so enthusiastic.

436
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,470
So

437
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,590
with some simple interruption of power supply to the xenon lamp,

438
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,710
even though the whole lamp bursts under water,

439
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,160
it can have shot circuit without getting an electric shock.

440
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,430
So it's very safe.

441
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,920
Absolutely safe.

442
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,400
OK.

443
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
If everything goes well,

444
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,310
the technicians will contact you today

445
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,470
with the consultant's fee.

446
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,710
Secretary Ding,

447
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,950
I didn't go back

448
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,830
for money.

449
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,760
I am not short of money.

450
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,680
Neither is Tianjin.

451
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,520
But there are still many places in China

452
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,350
suffering from poor harvest of crops,

453
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
hunger

454
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,070
and starvation.

455
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,710
I just want the common people to know that

456
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,640
my chemical fertilizer is not toxic

457
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,230
but lifesaving.

458
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,800
You've ever lived abroad.

459
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,280
Even though you don't know their agricultural technology,

460
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,430
at least you have felt their living atmosphere.

461
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,110
Whether a country is powerful

462
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,590
doesn't depend on its strong ships and armaments

463
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,830
but everyone in the country

464
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,350
full of expectation for the future life

465
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,640
without worries about meals.

466
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,830
Why is it so difficult

467
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,950
to promote my chemical fertilizer?

468
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,560
Did you remember my words just now?

469
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,710
Go with me to see someone.

470
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,640
Who?

471
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,590
The principal in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.

472
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,520
Tell him what you said just now.

473
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,680
Childe.

474
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,560
We have found the house.

475
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,350
I'm wondering if Mr. Guo would like to move there.

476
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,280
Childe. I'm leaving for something else.

477
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,160
Why do you always

478
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,000
wear a lock around your ankle?

479
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,350
Your mother feared that you may get lost

480
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,310
so she locked you, right?

481
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,280
Bullshit.

482
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,000
This is my life lock.

483
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,280
I have been wearing it since uncle Guo took me back.

484
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,310
Wearing it,

485
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,920
I won't forget where I am from.

486
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,280
Where are you from?

487
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,230
Didn't you jump from the cesspit?

488
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,680
Do you want to take a beating?

489
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,110
After the wedding ceremony,

490
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,160
a couple is like birds from the same forest

491
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,470
or lotus from the same stem.

492
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,830
From now on,

493
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,350
no matter what diseases

494
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,160
and hardships you suffer,

495
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,230
how much fortune you have

496
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,040
and how high your official position is,

497
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,230
you must love each other

498
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,680
and go through adversity together.

499
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,310
Adversity.

500
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Adversity.

501
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,400
Adversity.

502
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,710
Adversity.

503
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,430
Is that all?

504
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,950
Difficult.

505
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,310
Just talk about it.

506
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,800
How could you take it seriously?

507
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,070
Gu Ying.

508
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,590
My little sorceress.

509
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,830
What did you say?

510
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,800
Who did I talk to just now?

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
To whom?

512
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,470
To whom?

513
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,160
There there!

514
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,230
She has been unveiled.

515
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,640
Hurry to have food!

516
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,070
Otherwise there won't be chicken ass left.

517
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,350
Who dare eat my chicken ass?

518
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,680
We dare not eat your ass.

519
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,680
You bastard!

520
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,470
You're so impolite to elders.

521
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,520
Sister-in-law. Take care of your mother well.

522
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
Who did you address?

523
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,430
Who are you partial to?

524
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,310
Don't make a noise!

525
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,560
Let's toast to sister-in-law.

526
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,640
Let's toast to sister-in-law.

527
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
Cheers!

528
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,470
Cheers!

529
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,230
Cheers!

530
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,520
Tasteful!

531
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,470
Let's drink.

532
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,110
The clay doll stands for Mr. Guo. Brother Guo.

533
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,950
We don't need to consider it.

534
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,230
Mr. Guo is the brother of our corpse-salvage team, right?

535
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,110
The elder sister-in-law

536
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,950
cares the little brother as well as her son.

537
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,000
The elder-sister-in-law is just like mother.

538
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,710
We need to call you mother

539
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,880
from now on.

540
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,310
Hey,

541
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,310
call her mother.

542
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,880
Mother.

543
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,920
Who is your sister-in-law?

544
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,590
It's sister Yao.

545
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,160
I wonder

546
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,310
where you found

547
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,590
a village girl with red face.

548
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,640
How could she match our brother?

549
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Will you

550
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,110
grab a fat baby back the next year

551
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,000
and hold a party for its one-month birthday?

552
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,160
You don't know it.

553
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,880
This is called

554
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,000
a whole play.

555
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,160
The clay doll got married

556
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,000
to get some whip-round.

557
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,040
And Brother Guo will marry for bride-price.

558
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,160
Really a good plan!

559
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,110
You bastard.

560
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,920
Stop running.

561
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,040
Guo Deyou, time for meal.

562
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,800
Just eat.

563
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,950
Don't worry about Mr. Guo.

564
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,110
Men are usually nervous

565
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,040
before marriage.

566
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,190
I...

567
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,160
I...

568
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,070
Chicken ass. Chicken ass.

569
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,430
Is the paste stuck to the mattress?

570
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,640
Why not get up in the morning?

571
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,400
Get up!

572
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,110
Master.

573
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,520
Tell me

574
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,320
if one key

575
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
can only unlock one lock?

576
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,230
If one key can unlock all the locks,

577
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,760
it's not a key

578
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,080
but the thief's lock-pick.

579
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,560
Where are the Guos?

580
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,630
You're really impolite.

581
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,360
Your wife is going to have a toast.

582
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,429
It's good drinking wine.

583
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,040
Being drunk can make people ignore something.

584
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,600
Lazy guys!

585
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,360
Just eat

586
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,389
but do nothing!

587
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,120
I have to clean it up.

588
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,430
Leave them there. Let me handle them.

589
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,360
My senior apprentice got married.

590
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,560
How could I do nothing?

591
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,710
Sensible!

592
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,670
He didn't organize the marriage by himself

593
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,430
It's managed by others.

594
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,710
It's better to take part in the wedding ceremony instead of him.

595
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,190
That what I'm longing for.

596
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,230
Except the wedding night, I want all the other things done by someone else.

597
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,040
Master.

598
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,320
Lip service?

599
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,800
These are cakes for you.

600
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,600
I know

601
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,390
I can't call them desserts.

602
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,630
There is also a bottle of brandy

603
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,390
which is a drink for the western royal family.

604
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,280
With a nest of rabbits,

605
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,560
there is always a filial one.

606
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,800
I am tidying the table

607
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,840
while you're amusing the rabbit.

608
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
I've told you

609
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,280
not to do that.

610
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,630
Let me do it later.

611
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,280
The wine is for our master.

612
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,800
And this is

613
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,800
for you.

614
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,710
What's this?

615
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,560
You've got married.

616
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,150
The Dragon King Temple is old and broken.

617
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,390
How can it be a bridal chamber?

618
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,040
I will present you a western-style apartment

619
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,040
equipped with close stool, lamp and telephone.

620
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,040
There are also servants cleaning the room for you every day.

621
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,670
Master, Gu Ying and you only need to move there.

622
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,710
I'll pay the transport fee.

623
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,800
Eh.

624
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,800
Don't feel uncomfortable.

625
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,230
We're a family.

626
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,560
No.

627
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,230
You want us to move from here, right?

628
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,080
Master is old.

629
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,280
The Dragon King Temple is wet.

630
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,630
His legs will be in good condition once moving to another place.

631
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,800
Ding Mao.

632
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,800
So many keys.

633
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,520
How many doors does the apartment have?

634
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,120
Only one.

635
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,520
The rest are spare keys.

636
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,360
So many keys can unlock one lock.

637
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,870
It's not a key

638
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,630
but the thief's lock-pick.

639
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,600
Tell me.

640
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,840
What's your scheme?

641
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,710
OK.

642
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,600
Then I will come straight to the point.

643
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,800
Master.

644
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,470
For the curve cut-off project, the flow direction of the river needs to be changed.

645
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,120
I'm afraid the Dragon King Temple can't be saved.

646
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,910
What?

647
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,150
If the river can't flow through the Dragon King Temple,

648
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,190
it will submerge the Enlightenment women's Academy

649
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,470
where hundreds of women students live.

650
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,470
Besides, the school is also an ancient building.

651
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,430
Ridiculous!

652
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,520
The Dragon King Temple has been here since Tianjin came into being.

653
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,470
The school can't be older than the temple.

654
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,430
After all, it's a mortuary.

655
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,560
The temple is extremely broken without burning incense.

656
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,280
What about this?

657
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,520
If you and master stick to living in the temple,

658
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,560
then we can mark the bricks and tiles,

659
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,320
move them

660
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,670
to another place and build a temple again.

661
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,040
I will also take the Buddha's head.

662
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,230
In your view,

663
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,840
the Dragon King Temple is just broken bricks, tiles

664
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,080
and the Buddha's head.

665
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,760
What do you want?

666
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,800
The curve cut-off project is beneficial to the people.

667
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,470
You know it.

668
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,040
Why are you so unlearned

669
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,520
when your personal interests are involved?

670
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm unlearned. So what?

671
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,320
Please leave here

672
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,910
in case the crossbeam

673
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,670
in the temple falls down and hits you.

674
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,630
The flood is going to wash away the Dragon King Temple.

675
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,800
Family members don't know each other.

676
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,870
Master.

677
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,230
I just think that you didn't come today.

678
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Take your lock-pick and go away quickly.

679
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,190
Take the foreign urine, the foreign emperor's drink along with you!

680
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,470
Just pour it.

681
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,150
This is the safe box that Diplomat Gu took along with.

682
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,280
It has been prized up.

683
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,840
But

684
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,280
there is nothing inside.

685
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,840
Either Gu Weiliang schemed the "empty-city stratagem"

686
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,390
or someone perpetrates a fraud.

687
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,760
Do you refer to me?

688
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,190
Don't be nervous.

689
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
As for the things I did,

690
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,080
I have worked work with devotion

691
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,840
and selflessly dedicated my entire life to them.

692
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,870
There are moon and sun in the universe.

693
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm clear of the good ministers in my mind.

694
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,280
Go on the investigation.

695
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,080
Don't worry.

696
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,390
I took Wang Meiren to be the murderer as a cover,

697
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,710
just to stop the rumor from the people

698
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,040
in case it keeps spreading

699
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,120
and causing you trouble.

700
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,710
But I never

701
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,870
stop finding out the truth.

702
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,600
However,

703
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,390
Ding Mao and his elder apprentice Guo Deyou

704
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,080
don't let go of the case.

705
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
I'm afraid

706
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,710
he may track the clue

707
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,000
to Sun Erniang.

708
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,800
Do you think I am running a gangster inn,

709
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,910
selling steamed bun with people's meat?

710
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,520
I'm a bad mouth.

711
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Neither can I handle affairs or talk well.

712
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,390
Keep a close watch on the dogs.

713
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,670
Give bones to those who deserve

714
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,950
and beat those who deserve.

715
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
Use your hand.

716
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,390
Sweet.

717
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,600
Have a rest.

718
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,190
Diving like foreign divers,

719
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
we are dressed like puffy floats.

720
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,670
Right?

721
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,280
We don't need to frighten him.

722
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,520
Looking at himself in the mirror,

723
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,080
he will be scared.

724
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,390
Yeah.

725
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,840
they want to know the depth of the Dragon King Temple.

726
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,000
Today they know

727
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,950
our strength.

728
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
From now on,

729
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,390
Our corpse-salvage team take turns on duty

730
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,040
to guard the waters around the Dragon King Temple.

731
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,080
Keep a close watch on it.

732
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,040
OK.

733
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:15,910
Is it sweet?

734
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,670
I didn't lie to you, right?

735
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,910
Straight to the point.
