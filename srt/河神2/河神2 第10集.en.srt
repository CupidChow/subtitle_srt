00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,380
[Previously on Tientsin Mystic 2]

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,340
Let's start with a recap of the previous episode.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,420
In the last episode,

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,540
Guo Deyou was in a daze when Guo Chun saved him and woke him up,

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,180
but it turned out that Deyou had been bewitched by the Silver Bell Seal.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,340
From then on,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,980
he's been unable to "discern grievances by lighting a cigarette".

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,060
Ding Mao received a mysterious envelope,

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,060
and turned to Xiao's father for an explanation.

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,660
Guo Deyou came to the Physiotherapy Room,

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,050
hoping that Rong Aoshuang could help him break the Silver Bell Seal,

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,500
but the latter said that

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,580
this "illness of the mind" could only be cured by himself.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,540
Guo Deyou left in a fury.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,820
Then he took Ding Mao to the black market

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,620
and obtained an invitation letter to the game.

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,820
In order for Gu Ying to sneak into the Enlightment Academy,

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,300
Xiao Lanlan forged her identity,

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,980
and together they went to a fundraising ball at Residence No. 8.

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,880
Meanwhile,

21
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,220
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao also came to the Residence

22
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,940
according to the direction in the invitation letter.

23
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,300
When Xiao and Ding met,

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,580
they sought to rival each other.

25
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,500
Gu Ying gave a piano performance in order to gain the trust

26
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,540
of the president of the Enlightenment Academy,

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,620
while Guo Deyou led Xiao and Ding

28
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,220
to find the clue to entering the game,

29
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,020
which led them to Room No. 11.

30
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,140
Inside the room,

31
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,620
Ding must decide which to give up:

32
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,860
the clue or his senior fellow disciple.

33
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,700
So Ding Mao got in a predicament,

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,780
which caused the following outcomes:

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,240
Ding Mao was locked in a cage,

36
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,860
River God took control of the situation,

37
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,580
Gu Ying caused a confusion at the Academy,

38
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,940
and a beautiful woman lost her life

39
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,020
like a ruined piece of jade

40
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,780
or a vanished fragrance.

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,860
Jianghu.

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,620
Science.

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,579
Kung fu.

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,020
Truth.

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,700
Nine statues of ox.

46
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,220
Two statues of tiger.

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,540
One statue of rooster.

48
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,940
Mr. Bai.

49
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,260
The administrator.

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,260
A daughter by birth.

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,980
Mooncakes.

52
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,580
The Mid-Autumn Performance.

53
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,580
A case investigation.

54
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,740
Hello, teacher.

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,380
The ancestors built the canal...

56
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,060
Clues.

57
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,700
Enlightenment Academy.

58
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,700
Darla.

59
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,220
...for the purpose of grain transportation.

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,620
Betting lives.

61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,020
Tientsin Mystic 2.

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Tientsin Mystic 2

63
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,060
Episode 10

64
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,800
A great man knows what to give up and what to pursue.

65
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,160
One who can give up his bro as you do

66
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,660
is truly a promising man.

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,710
Isn't this the result you want?

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,420
The reason why some men have achieved great things

69
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,410
is not because they've chosen the better of two benefits,

70
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,700
but because they've chosen the lesser of two evils.

71
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,030
When gasoline is exposed to light,

72
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,690
it would look like a rainbow.

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
So the content of the pool is,

74
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,210
apparently,

75
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,810
just water.

76
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,290
Most importantly,

77
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,690
if you had detected

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,420
the smell of gasoline,

79
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,090
you would have long gone panic.

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,750
You wouldn't have sat so composedly.

81
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,930
"Composedly"?

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,610
How vividly I was acting!

83
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,220
I pretended to be nervous at one time and anxious at another.

84
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,860
I...

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,410
So you didn't notice my eye signal to you

86
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,180
just now?

87
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,710
Nope.

88
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,630
I judged the situation purely on my own.

89
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,020
If I chose you,

90
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,290
it means I thought little of the game,

91
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,210
so there would have been no chance of entering it.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,300
Then we can't continue this game

93
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,650
that undermines our brotherhood.

94
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,080
Whether we shall play it or not is negotiable,

95
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,000
but can you draw back your hand first?

96
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,180
It's very dangerous.

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,740
I can do that, but...

98
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,060
What are you doing with the pillow?

99
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,920
I said

100
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,140
it's dangerous.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,310
Yusi.

102
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,410
Take him back to Dragon King Temple first.

103
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,180
OK.

104
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
He deserves a good rest

105
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,800
after providing so much help.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,970
Eighteen Knife Cuts?

107
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,000
Why is Enlightenment Academy built on an island?

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,890
How inconvenient it is.

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,690
There used to be a road,

110
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,630
which was submerged after a cut-off project

111
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,040
that increased the river flow.

112
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,890
So now it can be reached only by water.

113
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,500
Then what if I want to sneak out

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,590
and eat a sesame pancake?

115
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,610
How can I get out?

116
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,850
Or what if I have a message

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,810
to send out?

118
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,110
The porters would run errands for students,

119
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
so you can take some necessities

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,820
and give them to a porter.

121
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,120
But we shouldn't make them

122
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,530
run errands for free.

123
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,440
Of course.

124
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,100
We should pay them what they deserve.

125
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,250
What?

126
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,810
We should pay them what they deserve.

127
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,200
Why... Why should I pay for it?

128
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,309
This case...

129
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,970
I quit.

130
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,510
Take me back to visit Lanlan.

131
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,169
I'm going to ask her

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,730
why her cousin is such a miser.

133
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,240
You yield whenever I mention Lanlan.

134
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,650
What are you thinking of?

135
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,080
I've already given you the money.

136
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,100
Thank you.

137
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,840
Enlightenment Academy was founded in 1903

138
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,530
by Mr. Dubai, then the French Minister in Tientsin,

139
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,750
in order to provide

140
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,220
first-class education specially for families in the Concession.

141
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,890
This is the main teaching building,

142
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,130
which was renovated once in 1918.

143
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,090
Later,

144
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,460
you will see a Renaissance-style fountain

145
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,380
and stone sculptures

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,850
specially imported from Florence.

147
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,510
How tasteful!

148
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,260
Since you've just returned to China,

149
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,180
you can come to ask me if there's anything

150
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,080
you don't understand.

151
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,170
Thank you, Chen...

152
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,410
Chen Siru.

153
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,350
Oh Yeah, Siru (literally "resemble").

154
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,780
What a tender and elegant name.

155
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,560
"Her waist is as slender as a willow branch,

156
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,400
and her clenched hands resemble two snowballs."

157
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,050
Sounds beautiful.

158
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,780
Please wait a moment.

159
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,480
Why do you keep haunting me like a ghost?

160
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,760
You've provided enough help.

161
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,170
It's not that I want to meet you.

162
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,350
I dreamed of a tiger who chased you all the way,

163
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,970
and who wanted to eat your flesh.

164
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,700
Isn't this dream an omen that

165
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,360
your entering the game is like a goat falling prey to a tiger?

166
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,900
I can't bear to think of that,

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,240
so I've come here to bring you a message:

168
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,150
Don't act beyond your ability.

169
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,180
But then

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,720
I visited a dream interpreter, who told me that

171
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,380
this is called "pulling out a tooth from the tiger's mouth,"

172
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,470
which heralds prosperity.

173
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,260
Don't take my words to heart, Secretary Ding.

174
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,050
Enjoy your meal.

175
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,120
Since you've come here,

176
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,470
why not eat with me?

177
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
What do you want to order, sirs?

178
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
I want a "bouncing carp" cooked by Mr. Zhang San.

179
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
OK. Please wait a few minutes.

180
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,390
The message in the envelope is "Eighteen Knife Cuts."

181
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,120
Yusi has learned through inquiries that

182
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,450
there's a saying in Tientsin that "A bouncing carp made with eighteen knife cuts..."

183
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,240
"...has a raised head, an arched back, and a warped tail."

184
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,060
That's Mr. Zhang San's specialty.

185
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,030
He uses exactly eighteen knife cuts

186
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,930
to make a live carp

187
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,950
into the dish called "bouncing carp,"

188
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,680
sculpting it into a bouncing posture as well as

189
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,180
guaranteeing the integrity of the carp's surface.

190
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,980
Why didn't you ask me instead of asking Yusi about Tientsin food?

191
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,990
Sorry,

192
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,950
Mr. Zhang San is absent today.

193
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,970
We apologize and this plate of mooncakes

194
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,810
are a compensation.

195
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,120
Then we'll just order something else.

196
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,760
Enjoy it.

197
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,630
Well, tell me about it.

198
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,760
What's the implication of this Tientsin dish?

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,350
No clue yet.

200
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,230
But I've known the "Eighteen Knife Cuts"

201
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,380
well enough.

202
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,070
What does it mean?

203
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,910
Someone is the "knife,"

204
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,790
while you are the "meat" that gets cut.

205
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,180
With eighteen knife cuts,

206
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,230
wouldn't you become a pile of mince?

207
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,930
Anna Library

208
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,530
is my favorite place.

209
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,450
Mr. Dubai, the founder of the Academy,

210
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,600
was once

211
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,520
the private tutor of a lady

212
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,250
called Anna.

213
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,610
They fell in love with each other,

214
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,470
but how could the daughter

215
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,410
of an aristocratic family marry a humble teacher?

216
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,290
She's Darla.

217
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,100
She's got

218
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,340
some problem here.

219
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,060
How can a mentally ill person

220
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,660
study here?

221
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,220
Her

222
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,140
parents took part in the October Revolution

223
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,740
and died in Siberia

224
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,590
after being arrested.

225
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,580
She has become like this since then.

226
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,970
President Zhou,

227
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,700
pitying her for her homelessness,

228
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,000
let her stay in the campus.

229
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,820
This area is the Book Zone.

230
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,100
In the future,

231
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,250
you can come here to study.

232
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,540
Mr. Bai.

233
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,070
That is the Archive Zone,

234
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,920
which is forbidden to students.

235
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,840
Siru,

236
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,200
you just mentioned Dubai and Anna.

237
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,230
What happened to them afterwards?

238
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,110
Anna married a duke,

239
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,350
who died of diphtheria

240
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,710
shortly after the marriage,

241
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,070
while Dubai left France

242
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,500
for China on his own to make his career.

243
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,890
But he couldn't forget Anna,

244
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,550
which was why

245
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,140
he founded this Enlightenment Academy

246
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,510
and built this Anna Library.

247
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,920
What's the matter?

248
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,060
All of us are Annas,

249
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,840
who are destined to be remembered only by people who love us.

250
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,350
Gu Ying.

251
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,970
"Sorceress Gu"!

252
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,980
She's not here.

253
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,630
Then I can only

254
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,740
give these mooncakes to you.

255
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,400
You "can only" give them to me?

256
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,830
I don't give them a damn!

257
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,340
You don't even give a damn to the mooncakes from Hefeng Restaurant?

258
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,900
Then I can only eat them on my own with reluctance.

259
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,010
You...

260
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,420
Let go of them!

261
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,040
Here you are.

262
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,890
Where has Gu Ying gone?

263
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,770
You wanna know it?

264
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,010
Listen carefully, then.

265
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,740
Bei—jing.

266
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,110
Director Xiao

267
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,310
took us to "broaden our horizons."

268
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,570
Beijing?

269
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,130
That big girl

270
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,330
who had never gone out of Tientsin for over two decades

271
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,470
should indeed go on a travel to broaden her horizons,

272
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,890
so as not to mistake a cat for a tiger.

273
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,050
Are you implying that I'm a "cat"?

274
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,100
How dare you say it's a mooncake from Hefeng Restaurant?

275
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,510
What's the matter?

276
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,840
Who would stuff a mooncake with dong quai and epiphyllum?

277
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,510
Mooncake...

278
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,840
Dong quai...

279
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,720
Epiphyllum...

280
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,440
Stop. That's enough.

281
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,560
Thank you, Miss Yu.

282
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,089
Isadora Duncan

283
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,040
opposed classical ballet's restrictions to the human body.

284
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,829
The choreography of this fan dance

285
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,560
also strives to achieve a state of

286
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,640
freedom.

287
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,369
Chen Siru has done a good job.

288
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,100
She has grasped Duncan's idea

289
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,790
that "the natural is the beautiful."

290
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,260
However,

291
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,860
the seven or eight dancers before her

292
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,820
didn't do well enough.

293
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,930
You were afraid to stretch out your limbs,

294
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,150
as if you were shackled.

295
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,680
If you continue to be like this,

296
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,350
how can you perform well at the Mid-Autumn Gala?

297
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,650
Do you want Chen Siru to do a solo dance instead?

298
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,360
Isn't this dance easy?

299
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,030
It's all about twisting and turning.

300
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,240
Do shut up.

301
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,030
New comer,

302
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,250
do you have any problem?

303
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,720
How about coming over and trying it out?

304
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,280
Me?

305
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,890
I haven't learned it.

306
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,550
It's okay.

307
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,770
Just stretch out your limbs

308
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,620
so that I can get a rough idea of your level.

309
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,210
Fine. I'll just do one dance.

310
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,220
That's the only one I can do.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,260
I'm not used to the shoes,

312
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,610
so I'll just do it barefoot.

313
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,700
Five, six, seven, eight!

314
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:37,220
"Spirits dwelling in the mountains want to capture my body,

315
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:50,470
and ghosts inhabiting waters want to devour my soul.

316
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:00,900
They offer my heart to the gods.

317
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,100
It's done. It's done..."

318
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,250
Stop escaping, river monster.

319
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,440
"And it returns to the void."

320
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,590
Come over to surrender at once!

321
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,130
Pursue your inner emotions,

322
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,180
and dance barefoot so as to get intimate with the ground,

323
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,380
making the external form of the body return to nature.

324
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,510
That's the principle Duncan had been advocating.

325
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,110
Hey,

326
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,940
what's your name?

327
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,650
I'm Gu...

328
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,140
Gorgeous

329
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,060
Qiao Jing.

330
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,680
Chen Siru,

331
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,620
Rehearse carefully with Qiao Jing these days.

332
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,840
You two can work together

333
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,630
to perform at the Mid-Autumn Gala.

334
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,580
Okay.

335
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,980
You can do it!

336
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,630
Sneaking into Enlightenment Academy is only the first step.

337
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,300
The most crucial thing is,

338
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,900
I need the student profiles,

339
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,520
which are necessary for me to verify the missing girl's identity.

340
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,820
"Wu Wenmei."

341
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,810
"Accidental death."

342
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,520
Why are you still here?

343
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,890
I'm studying.

344
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,760
It's very late now.

345
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,910
Don't you need to rest?

346
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,000
"A foolish bird must fly ahead of others, and a clumsy deer must walk beforehand."

347
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,690
As a latecomer in the school,

348
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,360
how can I catch up with other students

349
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,760
if I don't spend more time studying?

350
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,360
Rome ("Luoma") wasn't built in a day.

351
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,090
Take your time.

352
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,410
"Luoma"?

353
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,710
Isn't it a hinny?

354
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,170
The hinny doesn't run as fast as the horse.

355
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,510
I know that.

356
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,530
Wait.

357
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,550
You were just reading a complementary textbook for senior graders.

358
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,400
Read this first

359
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,000
before getting into more advanced materials.

360
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,180
Thanks.

361
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,840
I will read it carefully.

362
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,190
Call me Mr. Bai.

363
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,720
I normally stay here.

364
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,670
Feel free to turn to me if you want to look for any materials.

365
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,290
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

366
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,300
At first I didn't quite believe what they said about

367
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,410
"nine oxen, two tigers, and one rooster."

368
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,880
Excuse me,

369
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,190
I want to send some clothes back home to get washed.

370
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,210
Address.

371
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,850
Here.

372
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,100
Put it down here.

373
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,440
I'll send yours first

374
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,270
tomorrow morning.

375
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,120
Thank you.

376
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,040
Where were we, Director Chang?

377
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,480
Oh, the "nine oxen."

378
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,850
They say that apart from the bronze ox and the fiery ox,

379
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,380
there must exist other oxen.

380
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,160
I guess they're made of gold, wood, water, fire, soil,

381
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,760
gold, silver, bronze, iron, and tin.

382
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,100
That's not right.

383
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,640
You've mentioned ten oxen.

384
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,570
What monster is it?

385
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,770
Darla?

386
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,570
What's the matter with your hand?

387
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,920
She forced me.

388
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,790
Who forced you?

389
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,680
Go away.

390
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,350
Don't stay here.

391
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,840
The school is not as simple as you've seen.

392
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,930
What's the matter?

393
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,920
Come over here.

394
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,600
Since that day,

395
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,650
an embroidered doll and Chinese hibiscus flowers

396
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,380
have been existing here.

397
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,300
If you clear them away,

398
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,280
they'd still reappear the next day.

399
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,550
It's Wu Wenmei.

400
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,470
She doesn't want to leave.

401
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,270
People who are chosen by them would be taken away.

402
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,360
If you disobey,

403
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,400
you'd have the same fate as Wu Wenmei.

404
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,630
Who is Wu Wenmei?

405
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,990
This was the very place

406
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,740
where she cut her wrist.

407
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,090
I don't want to be like her.

408
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,990
It's she who forced me.

409
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,430
It's those girls who forced me.

410
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,460
It's those girls who forced me.

411
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,700
It's those girls who forced me.

412
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,710
Don't be afraid.

413
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,390
Take your time to tell me the whole story.

414
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,950
You'll know it.

415
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,100
Before long

416
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,080
you'll be like me,

417
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,750
or

418
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,800
like her.

419
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,620
Do you know why Chen Siru

420
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,340
hasn't put her hands on you all the time?

421
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,910
Because she hasn't figured out your background.

422
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,640
Chen Siru?

423
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,730
Darla,

424
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,970
how come you're wandering about again?

425
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,530
Go to tell the president that she's been found.

426
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,310
OK.

427
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,680
Qiao Jing,

428
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,770
how come you're here, too?

429
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,770
This is a precarious building

430
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,800
that is forbidden to students.

431
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,690
Go back quickly.

432
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
It's her who forced me.

433
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,760
It's they who forced me.

434
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,750
Help me.

435
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,030
Help me.

436
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,970
Darla, what are you talking about?

437
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,320
Come here.

438
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,800
How about

439
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,460
I take her back?

440
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,930
It's dark already.

441
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,600
Besides,

442
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,450
you're not familiar with the roads.

443
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,800
It's okay. I can find the way.

444
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,010
I'll take her back.

445
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,100
Let's go.

446
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,120
Wait.

447
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,060
Do you want to get punished by not returning

448
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,840
to the dorm so late at night?

449
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,690
Mr. Bai,

450
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,340
Qiao Jing and I

451
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,940
will be performing at the Mid-Autumn Gala.

452
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,200
But the dancing classroom has been locked,

453
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,350
so

454
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,530
we can only rehearse in this place.

455
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,740
Am I right, Qiao Jing?

456
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,380
Yeah...

457
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,940
Go back first.

458
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,660
Do it tomorrow.

459
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,250
Let's go, Qiao Jing.

460
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,360
Let's go, Darla.

461
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,650
Bye, Mr. Bai.

462
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,410
Are you mistaken?

463
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,590
There's not a soul here.

464
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,570
Anything that is abnormal must be fishy.

465
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,050
Have you seen any restaurant that closes at such an hour

466
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,040
on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival?

467
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,970
Do you remember what dish the waiter served that day?

468
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,120
Mooncakes.

469
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,430
I ate one.

470
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,920
It's incredible that it was stuffed with dong quai and epiphyllum.

471
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,520
Mooncake.

472
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,900
Mid-Autumn.

473
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,180
And epiphyllum,

474
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,910
which blooms at 8 p.m.

475
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,020
As for dong guai (literally "should return") ...

476
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,490
It means "to come back here."

477
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,500
Then the three things combined mean

478
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,570
"to come back here at 8 p.m. on the day

479
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,490
of the Mid-Autumn Festival."

480
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,550
"The moon rises from the sea."

481
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,540
"Far away we share this moment together."

482
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,970
Welcome, Secretary Ding.

483
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,760
I come to Hefeng Restaurant often,

484
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,680
but I didn't know there's another world under it.

485
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,720
Master, master.

486
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,490
I told you not to come here.

487
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,390
I told you not to come here.

488
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,260
Slowly.

489
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,500
What game is it now?

490
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,170
Twenty-One Points.

491
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:51,780
Twenty...

492
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,580
How come it's about time again?

493
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,610
Can't you create something new?

494
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,780
It's a card game from France.

495
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,700
No matter where it's from,

496
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,980
any game that costs your life is not a good game.

497
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,580
I'd better get away from this boundless suffering.

498
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,590
Mr. Guo,

499
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,410
please take a seat.

500
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,590
Where should I sit?

501
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,430
The game begins the moment you sit down,

502
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,220
and you're not allowed to quit during the game.

503
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,890
You've got two chances.

504
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,130
Defeat me once

505
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,390
and the envelope will be yours.

506
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,659
"Document for the Transfer of Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce"?

507
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,449
Once you've sat at the table,

508
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,460
you can only choose one stake out of two:

509
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,020
your wealth

510
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,770
or your life.

511
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,080
Ridiculous.

512
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,090
Guests who have entered the room

513
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,949
and sat down

514
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,960
can exit only under two circumstances:

515
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,070
raising the stakes

516
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,690
or getting killed.

517
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,600
Be patient

518
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,580
and watch carefully.

519
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,810
His relatives will sign it tomorrow,

520
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,630
and then the mine factory will be under your name.

521
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,000
What day is today?

522
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,980
The Mid-Autumn Day.

523
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,860
How can he have a happy family reunion

524
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,610
if we take away his factory on the Mid-Autumn Festival?

525
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,450
It's caused by his greed.

526
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,310
He's chosen to bet his life.

527
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,170
Perhaps you'll start managing

528
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,290
the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce tomorrow.

529
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,020
You'll have a tiring job, sir.

530
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,990
I'm full.

531
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,700
If you transfer the Chamber to other people,

532
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,260
what's the use of winning the envelope at the risk of your life?

533
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,370
If you don't own the Chamber anymore,

534
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,290
you'll be feel ashamed to live?

535
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,020
Only three things matter in the game:

536
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,680
approaches, brains, and guts.

537
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,030
Don't be a coward

538
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,790
since you've come here.

539
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,330
There's no alternative between wealth and life.

540
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,250
You can only bet your life after coming here.

541
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,750
Why not play a game to your heart's content?

542
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,410
If you don't bet your wealth,

543
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,650
the only stake left is your life.

544
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,570
I bet my life.

545
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,060
I will now transfer the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce

546
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,210
to Guo Deyou, captain of

547
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,200
Wuhe Corpse-salvage Team.

548
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
Leaving room for maneuver.

549
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,980
You've got brains.

550
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,500
Be careful.

551
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,960
Pull the curtain inward a little.

552
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,780
OK.

553
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,170
Remember to scrub the backs of the chairs.

554
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,260
No problem.

555
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,460
Turn on another row of lights in the back.

556
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,800
I'll do it.

557
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,290
Be careful with that one, too.

558
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,190
Lift it gently.

559
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,740
In my country,

560
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,950
people think that

561
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,940
the demon is on the left shoulder,

562
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,350
while the angel is on the right shoulder.

563
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,160
I just helped you drive the demon away.

564
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,400
That's like "playing with an axe in the presence of Lu Ban."

565
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,710
How dare any demon

566
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,270
dwell on my shoulder?

567
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,890
Who is Lu Ban?

568
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,870
Are you kidding?

569
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,240
You don't even know the forefather (of craftsmen?

570
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,080
Oh, it's your grandfather?

571
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,650
Deaf people like to interrupt talks,

572
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,960
while foolish people like to create ones.

573
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,830
Why didn't I notice it just now?

574
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,030
When clothes are torn, flesh will be hurt.

575
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,150
What a bad luck.

576
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,070
Give it to me.

577
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,500
I can surely finish mending it before the performance.

578
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,490
You're so awesome.

579
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,600
Then please mend it for me.

580
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,200
Qiao Jing,

581
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,800
come up on the stage for the last rehearsal.

582
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,860
I know Arabic numerals,

583
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,820
but what's the point value of the "K" card?

584
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,440
Each of the cards with head figures is a 10-point card.

585
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,430
Two times seven equals 14.

586
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,690
That's quite small.

587
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,130
Exactly 21 points!

588
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,150
Isn't this the highest set?

589
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,230
Both get 21 points.

590
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,570
Isn't it a draw?

591
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,690
Triple sevens

592
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,090
will be tripled.

593
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,270
That's the real highest set.

594
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,930
The banker wins.

595
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,590
Stake raising!

596
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,700
I'll raise the stakes.

597
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,430
I'll bet the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce

598
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,100
on his life.

599
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,040
Guo Deyou!

600
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,150
Haven't you understood

601
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,230
why I transferred the Chamber to you?

602
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,340
Because if I lost,

603
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,300
at least someone I know would take over the Chamber.

604
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,390
Do I allow you to go on gambling?

605
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,030
You're a living ghost.

606
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,800
I can't see you.

607
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,020
Why are you involving yourself in this?

608
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,110
I've lost my life, and I accept this fate.

609
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,030
Food, drinks, and whores always cost you money,

610
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,460
but gambling is the only thing that might be profitable.

611
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,120
Do you know that

612
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,170
the Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce

613
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,250
will be ruined if you lose again this time.

614
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,210
My master says that

615
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,010
gambling is for fun.

616
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,090
But you guys play it too dully.

617
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,250
Let's play it in a lively way.

618
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,490
How to make it lively?

619
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,810
Is it because you didn't save me on the day when the bomb exploded in the Evil Water Source

620
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,220
that you're sparing no efforts now

621
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,890
to save my life?

622
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,720
Let's play "driving the old goat."

623
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,930
You feel guilty, so you want to save me

624
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:55,570
to make up for the last time.

625
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,770
I tell you what, it's too late!

626
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,740
It's a folk dice game

627
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,320
that uses three dices,

628
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,540
and the one with the higher total points is the winner.

629
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:00,620
OK.

630
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:02,860
Fine.

631
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,170
I hope that no matter what I'm going to do next,

632
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,830
you'll be as indifferent as before.

633
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,690
Dare you bet bigger?

634
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,940
I want both his life

635
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,540
and that letter.

636
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,470
The Grain Transporting Chamber of Commerce

637
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,460
is enough only for exchanging his life.

638
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,060
Then I'll bet my life, too.

639
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,410
It's fun.

640
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,350
It's fun.

641
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:46,600
The banker rolls first.

642
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,970
Thank you.

643
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,240
Five, five, and six.

644
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,930
You still have some chance of winning.

645
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,070
You just need to roll triple sixes.

646
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,430
I didn't save you the last time.

647
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:20,780
Do you still believe me?

648
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,000
I've never disbelieved you.

649
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,750
Good.

650
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,290
With these words of yours,

651
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,790
I believe you're my worthy junior fellow disciple.

652
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,250
Both sets of the dices are yours.

653
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,380
What if you've tampered with them?

654
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,770
You don't agree to change them?

655
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,690
So there's really a trick?

656
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:01,770
Please.

657
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,060
That's fair.

658
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,300
Ask the other students to return to the dorm!

659
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,490
Leave here quickly.

660
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,100
Come on.

661
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,320
Go, go. Hurry!

662
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,470
Go back first, students.
