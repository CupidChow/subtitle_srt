[Episode 5]

3
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,810
My trip to Hong Kong this time

4
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,970
is to receive a shipment of American aid.

5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,170
Chief Zhou indeed has no other option.

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,780
Actually, this kind of work

7
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,840
is much easier than
working at the department.

8
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,479
Besides, Hong Kong's medical facilities

9
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,830
are much better than Taiwan's,

10
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,830
so more medicine can be prescribed.

11
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,180
Chief Zhou

12
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,880
has also assigned me a personal doctor.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,110
So, Honey,

14
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,930
you can rest assured.

15
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,730
Your Chief Zhou is so considerate.

16
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,540
Then ask him to be even more considerate

17
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,590
and apply for me to go with you.

18

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,530
I'm sorry

20

I have good news for you.

26
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,000
President was very pleased

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,660
to hear that
you're the one to be sent to Hong Kong

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,440
to receive the military aid,

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,350
so he specially approved for you

30
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,870
to take the Taikang Warship to Hong Kong.

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,020
Taking the Taikang Warship to Hong Kong?

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,850
The Taikang Warship used to be
President's flagship.

33
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,860
It's not appropriate for a deputy chief
like me to take it, right?

34
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,590
Well, it's not anymore, right?

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
What President means is that

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,060
the Taikang Warship

37
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,160
was originally part of
American military aid.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,720
Taking it to receive new aid

39
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,770
is meant to show certain people

40
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,300
the American Army's support for us.

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,150
Senior.

42
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,020
You'll be representing

43
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,350
the dignity of the Nationalist Government
and our army.

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm grateful for President's concern.

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,680
Also,

46
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,770
since the official purpose

47
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,980
is to receive economic aid
from the American government,

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,220
we might as well make

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,750
the whole thing
as high-profile as possible.

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,550
So after the handover ceremony,

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,930
there will be a grand banquet.

52
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,940
All the business leaders
from across Hong Kong

53

will attend.

54
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,620
President wants those

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,620

57

is rock-solid.

Social engagements are not my strength.

60

and so many people,

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,060
I'm afraid...

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,070
You're being too modest.

64
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,160
Senior, you'll certainly demonstrate
our government's prestige.

65

I've arranged for people from
the Second Department to accompany you,

The Taikang...

170
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,840
Warship?

171
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:18,050
[Keelung Harbor]

172
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,970
For any problems,

173
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,230
go to Yongchuntang Pharmacy
in Hong Kong

174
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,990
and ask for Manager Wan Jingguang.

175
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,870
The token and secret code from here
will still work.

176
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,270
Sir,

177
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,110
I've checked everything.

178
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,870
All safe.

179
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,750
We only have two days in Hong Kong.

180
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,830
Anyway, Hong Kong isn't particularly safe.

181
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,860
Two days should be enough, right?

182
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,390
Let's hope so.

183
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,820
Zhou Zhirou arranged for a bunch of agents
from the Second Department to follow us.

184
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,020
This trip to Hong Kong

185
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,920
probably won't go smoothly.

186
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,060
We'll likely arrive at

187
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,040
Victoria Harbor around noon
the day after tomorrow.

188
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,120
If we go visit
the American Army's representative,

189
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,650
General James Walker,

190
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,940
in a personal capacity that afternoon,

191
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,670
then on our way back to the ship,

192
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,820
we'll have a chance

193
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,150
to go to the pharmacy for the rendezvous
on Hong Kong Island.

194
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,370
What do you think?

195
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,760
I think it's doable.

196
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,070
The department has scheduled you
too tightly, Sir.

197
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,020
Starting from the second day,

198
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,050
there's simply no proper opportunity.

199
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,300
And I've confirmed that

200
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,130
from the Peninsula Hotel
to Hong Kong Island,

201
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,390
we need to take a ferry.

202
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,250
I think after disembarking,

203
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,780
there should be a suitable opportunity
to make the rendezvous.

204
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,730
No matter what,

205
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,530
we must get the Kinmen intelligence out
this time.

206
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,500
At the same time,

207
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,370
we also need to ask the superiors

208
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,900
to send a new courier here
as soon as possible.

209
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,980
Sir, do you think we should

210
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,650
send the military aid allocation plan
to the superiors as well?

211
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,980
It's all your hard work.

212
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,360
Don't let it go to waste.

213
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,520
I'll draft a telegram right now.

214
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,280
Send it to the Americans
over the warship's radio.

215
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,010
Yes, Sir.

216
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,180
Mr. Gu!

217
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,110
Thank you for coming all this way.

218
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,630
[Li Yunshan,
Head of Hong Kong Station, BIS]

219
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,180
Mr. Li.

220
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,300
Welcome.

221
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,150
It's nothing, really.

222
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,150
This way, please.

223
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,610
Thank you.

224
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,130
About dinner,

225
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,860
I think maybe we should skip it.

226
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,860
You see, this mission

227
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,590
is extraordinary.

228
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,600
And we only have two days to prepare,

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
so we'd better focus on work.

230
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,010
I've long heard

231
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,080
that you handle cases
with decisive efficiency, Mr. Gu,

232
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,740
and now I see your reputation
is well-deserved.

233
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
Alright then.

234
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,180
After we go to the hotel

235
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,800
and get you settled in,

236
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
I'll show you around

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,680
to familiarize you with Hong Kong.

238
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,610
Hold on.

239
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,110
The hotel?

240
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,710
I thought I'd be staying at the station.

241
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,930
Director specifically instructed me

242
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,340
that you're here

243
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,140
on an important mission, Mr. Gu.

244
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,890
The American military aid signing ceremony

245
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,550
will be held in
the Peninsula Hotel's ballroom.

246
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,190
The American Army's representatives
are also staying there.

247
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,800
It also has the best accommodations
in all of Hong Kong.

248
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,680
So, both officially and personally,

249
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,280
we should arrange for you to stay there,
Mr. Gu.

250
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,730
Director has instructed me

251
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,200
to fully support you.

252
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,540
I've also assigned a team of field agents

253
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,600
who're familiar with
Hong Kong's local conditions

254
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,930
ready for you to deploy
at any time, Mr. Gu.

255
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,860
Let me put it this way.

256
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,550
If you need anything from me personally,
Mr. Gu,

257
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,200
just name it.

258
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,950
I'll absolutely do my best
to support your work.

259
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,880
You're too kind.

260
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,760
Thank you in advance then, Mr. Li.

261
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,230
Sir, the car is ready.
We can depart anytime.

262
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,610
Get me my suit.

263
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,160
Yes, Sir.

264
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,940
Report!

265
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,790
Come in, please.

266
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,730
[Zhang Yongcheng, Director,
2nd Department, Ministry of Defense, KMT]

267
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,130
Sir.

268
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,800
General Walker is waiting for you
at the dock.

269
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,970
Why is he at the dock?

270
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,840
The Americans never play by the rules.

271
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,970
They always catch everyone off guard.

272
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,110
Tell him I'll be right down.

273
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,090
Yes, Sir.

274
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,360
Those Americans are too enthusiastic.

275
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,680
Didn't they agree to meet us

276
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,910
at the Peninsula Hotel
in a personal capacity?

277
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,150
Given the current situation,

278
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,630
can we still make it to the pharmacy

279
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,630
before it closes?

280
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,180
Plans can't keep up with changes.

281
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,230
Bring me my uniform.

282
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,760
Yes, Sir.

283
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,060
Salute!

284
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,470
How are the personnel arrangements going?

285
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,360
All in place.

286
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,190
All the shoe-shiners and newspaper vendors
at the dock

287
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,810
are working in three shifts.

288
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,000
We also have cars
following them at the entrance.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,660
If they dare to leave the dock,

290
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,530
they won't escape our grasp.

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,690
Leader.

292
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,030
I'm thinking about something.

293
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,430
What if they're too scared to come out,

294
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,490
like turtles hiding in their shells?

295
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,100
That's impossible.

296
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,000
They went through all that trouble
to get to Hong Kong

297
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,610
just to make the rendezvous.

298
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,340
They must be more anxious than we are
right now.

299
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,710
Is General Walker's arrival

300
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,060
truly the Americans
being overly enthusiastic

301
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,390
or deliberately arranged
by the Second Department

302
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,410
or even the BIS,

303
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,890
Wu Shi would never know.

304
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,620
He came to Hong Kong
as part of his own plan,

305
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,320
but now finds himself
trapped under surveillance.

306
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
The Second Department's people
follow him like shadows,

307
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,780
waiting for him to slip up.

308
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Wu Shi knows

309
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,400
he must remain calm

310
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,510
to find a way out of this predicament.

311
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
Tomorrow is the handover ceremony,

312
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,470
and the day after,
he must return to Taiwan.

313
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,300
Today

314
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,520
is his only chance
to rendezvous with Manager Wan.

315
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,010
Time's ticking away.

316
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,820
Only one thought

317
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,780
echoes in Wu Shi's mind:

318
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,920
reach the island.

319
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,800
If he can reach
Yongchuntang Pharmacy before 10 o'clock,

320
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,490
there's still hope.

321
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,130
So he has to take the risk.

322
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
General Walker.

323
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,430
Since we've had
such a pleasant conversation today,

324
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,970
why don't we go to your hotel

325
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,860
and I'll buy you a drink?

326
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,860
That's an excellent idea.

327
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,430
I've brought some fine liquor
from my hometown as well.

328
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,430
Let's drink to our heart's content.

329
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,800
Well, I've got to say,

330
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,870
I am very glad
I finally got a chance to meet you,

331
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,990
General Wu.

332
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,870
Got an excellent dinner,
a very good conversation.

333
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,350
Now I've got another excellent idea.

334
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,960
How about we go to the bar
and have another drink?

335
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,080
I have to go back.

336
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,200
But today will always remain in my memory.

337
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,030
Mine too. See you tomorrow,
my good friend.

338
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
See you tomorrow.

339
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,710
Let's go.

340
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,500
Sir.

341
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,650
Go back and rest early.

342
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,860
You've had a long day as well.

343
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,240
Sir.

344
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,740
Chief specifically instructed

345
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,870
that your health must be taken care of.

346
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,740
I'm not that fragile.

347
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,240
There's no need to follow me everywhere.

348
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,870
But...

349
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,610
Sir.

350
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,930
You all head back to the ship first.

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,460
I'll go buy some medicine.

352
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,870
My old ailment is acting up.

353
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,930
Is it serious, Sir?

354
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,580
Just tell me what medicine you need,

355
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,980
and I'll go buy it for you.

356
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,930
I'll have the driver
take me to the nearest pharmacy.

357
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,000
It won't take long.

358
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,580
Besides, it's raining.

359
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,500
It's alright.

360
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,430
That's just how Hong Kong's weather is.
Don't worry about it.

361
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,760
Right, Director Zhang.

362
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,980
I'll go with Mr. Wu. Don't worry.

363
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,650
I'm sorry, Colonel Nie,

364
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,530
but we have to go over with you

365
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,090
the details of General Wu's

366
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,000
signing ceremony tomorrow.

367
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,040
Adjutant Nie, if you have matters
to attend to, please go ahead.

368
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,440
I'll escort Mr. Wu there.

369
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,170
Please.

370
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,930
Keep a close eye.

371
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,080
I'll go check the ballroom.

372
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,990
Overtake that car ahead.

373
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,610
Got it.

374
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,020
Stop the car. Pull over!

375
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,210
Check what's wrong with Deputy Chief.

376
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,860
Sir, what's wrong?

377
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,340
There's a car that's been following us.

378
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,140
Go check and ask what's going on.

379
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,740
Please wait, I'll go check.

380
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,540
Wait for me a moment.

381
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:28,970
Yes.

382
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,170
Stop right there!

383
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,750
Catch up with that car!

384
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:48,880
Drive.

385
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,210
But Director Zhang told us
to wait for him here...

386
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:51,820
Drive.

387
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:52,790
Okay.

388
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,850
Get through it.

389
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,010
Reverse, reverse!

390
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,390
Go around! Go around!

391
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,290
[Yongchun]

392
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,300
Officer, what do you need?

393
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,690
Nitroglycerin tablets.

394
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,890
Alright, one second.

395
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,330
Are you the only one on duty?

396
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,290
Officer.

397
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,800
How can I help you?

398
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,170
Nitroglycerin tablets.

399
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,200
One moment please.

400
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,930
Do you need some
traditional Chinese medicine

401
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,730
to help lower your blood lipids?

402
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,260
My blood lipids are all right.

403
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,420
Do you have any pre-made Xiaoke Pills?

404
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,600
Yes.

405
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,280
Let's go, hurry!

406
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,430
10 dollars.

407
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,470
You fell ill from working so hard
for our party and country.

408
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,730
How could I let you pay for this yourself?

409
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,210
Director Zhang.

410
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,400
Please don't put me
in a difficult position.

411
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,840
Here.

412
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,900
Keep the change. Thanks.

413
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,810
Let's go.

414
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,570
Come on.

415
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,690
This way.

416
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,200
The Second Department agents
went after Mr. Li's car.

417
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,900
I took the chance to follow
Deputy Chief Wu to Yongchuntang Pharmacy.

418
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,370
Mr. Gu, come on, try this.

419
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,390
You're too kind.

420
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,550
Why is there someone
from the Second Department as well?

421
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,310
Leader,

422
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,650
was our car spotted?

423
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,420
What does it matter if they saw us?

424
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,340
Whether openly or covertly,

425
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,630
it's all for protecting
Deputy Chief Wu anyway, isn't it?

426
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,670
Besides,

427
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,560
when it comes to anti-communist
and counter-espionage work,

428
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,780
our department and the Second Department

429
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,180
have many overlapping responsibilities,

430
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:34,980
right?

431
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,870
Has Yongchuntang Pharmacy
been investigated?

432
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,420
Yes.

433
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,840
Mr. Li's men did the check.

434
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,630
Their paperwork is in order,

435
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,310
and they've been in business
for many years.

436
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,840
There are no issues for now.

437
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,270
Mr. Li,

438
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,710
I personally suggest

439
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,960
we should still assign a couple of people

440
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,690
to keep an eye on
the Yongchuntang Pharmacy.

441
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,420
Just in case.

442
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,720
Of course, of course.

443
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,710
Come here.

444
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,110
Go get two sharp agents

445
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,930
to work with Captain Yu.

446
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,470
For anything that happens,
take orders from Captain Yu.

447
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,910
Got it.

448
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,660
Yes, Sir.

449
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,030
Thank you.

450
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,970
You're welcome.

451
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,780
Mr. Gu,

452
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,950
are we really protecting Deputy Chief Wu?

453
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,820
Doesn't he have people
from the Second Department following him?

454
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,500
Of course.

455
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,460
Of course we're protecting him covertly.

456
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,380
Look,

457
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,110
Deputy Chief Wu holds a high position
with great authority.

458
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,950
His schedule in Hong Kong

459
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,110
has been planned down to the hour

460
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,410
[Deputy Chief Wu's
Hong Kong Visit Schedule]

461
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,300
in advance.

462
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,870
It's all written here.

463
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,020
But his visit

464
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,450
to the Peninsula Hotel tonight

465
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,780
wasn't part of the plan.

466
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,780
So I think we should gather

467
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,720
as much detailed information as possible.

468
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,050
Better safe than sorry.

469
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,670
However,

470
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,300
from the Peninsula Hotel

471
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,360
back to Victoria Harbor,

472
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,120
this pharmacy should be
the most convenient stop.

473
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,860
Right?

474
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,980
Mr. Li.

475
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,100
To be honest,

476
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,690
my trip to Hong Kong this time is

477
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
by orders from above.

478
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Among Deputy Chief Wu's entourage,

479
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,980
there are Communist spies.

480
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,020
They'll definitely exchange intelligence
here in Hong Kong.

481
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,290
It's confidential, so I can't say more.

482
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,420
Please understand.

483
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,620
I understand. Of course.

484
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,070
We're in the same line of work after all.

485
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,910
It seems the BIS hasn't let its guard down

486
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,570
against you for even a moment.

487
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,300
That Gu Zhengwen is really relentless.

488
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,330
He's actually followed us to Hong Kong.

489
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,530
No wonder we were being tailed
as soon as we left the hotel.

490
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,360
Those from the Second Department
have been busy watching me too.

491
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,960
That was really close today.

492
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Today's incident

493
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,840
will surely deepen
Director Zhang's suspicion of you.

494
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,560
Sir,

495
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,190
as far as I know,

496
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,960
the BIS does have a Class-A station
here in Hong Kong.

497
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,020
So around the dock,

498
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,450
including tomorrow's banquet,

499
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,310
there will surely be BIS eyes watching.

500
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Tomorrow is the astronomical tide.

501
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,040
It's our last day.

502
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,650
We must get the message out.

503
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,740
But tomorrow is the military aid
handover ceremony.

504
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
Your entire day is fully scheduled.

505
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,710
How about I go to the pharmacy
instead of you?

506
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,080
I'll be a smaller target acting alone,

507
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,190
and I can shake off tails more easily.

508
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,990
That won't do.

509
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,370
Manager Wan doesn't know you.

510
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,890
I had no choice

511
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,760
but to take Director Zhang
to the pharmacy today.

512
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,150
That was already very dangerous
for Manager Wan.

513
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,280
It's easy to imagine

514
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
that the BIS will definitely set up
an ambush at the pharmacy.

515
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,870
If you force a rendezvous,

516
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,130
it would be disastrous

517
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,740
for both you and Manager Wan.

518
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,100
Now you and I

519
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,880
are both under such tight surveillance

520
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,190
that we can't make a move at all.

521
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,840
If only Manager Wan could make a move.

522
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,710
But even if he could,

523
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,020
he has no way to contact us.

524
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,110
Arrange for some journalists

525
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,830
to interview me
before departure tomorrow morning

526
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,240
to publicize the handover ceremony

527
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,660
and the evening banquet
at the Peninsula Hotel extensively.

528
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,600
That's right.

529
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,000
The military aid handover ceremony

530
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,390
concerns relations between the U.S.
and the Nationalist Government.

531
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,650
This kind of breaking news

532
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,910
can make the headlines the very same day.

533
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,270
Tomorrow night's banquet
at the Peninsula Hotel

534
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,370
is our last chance.

535
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,850
Let's hope Manager Wan sees the newspaper.

536
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,800
Deputy Chief Wu
probably won't

537
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,890
try anything at the handover ceremony.

538
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,620
That's a diplomatic occasion.

539
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,350
It could ruin his reputation.

540
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,130
I never said it was Deputy Chief Wu.

541
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,470
Did I say it was him?

542
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,760
Slip of the tongue.

543
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,860
You can't make such careless remarks.

544
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,060
Of course, of course.

545
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,560
But anyway,

546
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,560
no matter who this person is,

547
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,860
if they manage to
send out the intelligence,

548
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,560
we'll both be in serious trouble.

549
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,910
Mr. Li,

550
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,520
but on the other hand,

551
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,670
if we manage to catch them,

552
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,720
the higher his position,

553
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,530
the better for us, right?

554
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,020
Actually, Director thinks the same way.

555
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,580
Today,

556
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,450
I've specially invited
all of you journalists to the Taikang.

557
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,360
This is because the Taikang was originally

558
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,280
a warship provided by the U.S.
to the Nationalist Government.

559
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,080
Therefore, tonight's military aid
signing ceremony

560
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,940
signifies that

561
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,910
the cooperative relationship
between China and the U.S. since the war

562
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,370
has not only not weakened,

563
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,300
but actually grown stronger.

564
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,520
The prospects for Sino-American relations

565
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,430
are bright.

566
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,710
Extra! Extra!

567
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,170
Exclusive headline:

568
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,760
the U.S. is stepping up support
for the Nationalist Government,

569
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,620
signaling a bright future
for Sino-American ties!

[Grand Banquet to Be Held Tonight
at the Peninsula Hotel]

572
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,980
Did you manage to track the car

573
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,800
that was tailing me last night?

574
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,270
I'm truly sorry.

575
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,430
We're not familiar with this area,

576
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,340
so we lost them.

577
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,350
But I also find it strange.

578
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,820
Who would dare target someone
of your position?

579
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,150
Are you suggesting my judgment was wrong?

580
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,890
Then how about this?

581
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,110
You guys follow me today.

582
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,780
If this car appears again,

583
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,389
are you willing to be punished?

584
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,989
Sir, that's not what I meant.

585
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,560
I was just wondering

586
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,820
who would be so bold.

587
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,710
Go investigate

588
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,889
who those people are

589
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,320
and find out
if they're connected to Communist spies.

590
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,550
Chief didn't appoint you

591
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,610
to come to Hong Kong

592
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,840
for sightseeing.

593
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,610
Please rest assured, Sir.

594
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,480
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

595
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,380
Go now.

596
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,630
How long has it been here?

597
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,520
Since 7:30.

598
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,280
We have an urgent mission today.

599
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,739
Cancel all appointments.

600
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,120
Also, go find a public phone

601
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,320
and call the police station.

602
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,360
Tell them that the car used

603
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,639
in General Yang Jie's assassination
has been found in this area.

604
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,239
Hurry up and go.

605
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,300
Alright, I'm on it.

606
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,430
Don't move!

607
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,160
Freeze!

608
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,050
Report, Sir.

609
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,370
We've caught the people
who were tailing you.

610
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,100
We're interrogating them now.

611
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,690
Before the signing ceremony,

612
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,670
we'll definitely get answers.

613
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,870
That will be too late.

614
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,550
I'll give you two hours.

615
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,430
If you can't get to the bottom of this
by then,

616
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,930
we'll have to reschedule
the signing ceremony.

617
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,590
Yes, Sir.

618
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,720
We'll get back to you with answers
in two hours.

619
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,460
Leader.

620
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,200
The two field agents

621
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,590
who were tracking Deputy Chief Wu
still haven't returned.

622
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,190
The lookouts at the dock said

623
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,080
they saw them leave with
Deputy Chief Wu's convoy.

624
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,070
What about the station?
Did you check there?

625
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,570
We've checked the station and their homes,

626
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,830
but no trace was found.

627
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,510
For my next questions,
nod if the answer is yes,

628
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,200
shake your head if it's no.

629
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,200
Understand?

630
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,400
Do you want to live?

631
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,510
You're a Communist spy, aren't you?

632
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,860
It seems to me
you don't want to live anymore.

633
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,350
Bring him over!

634
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,930
We're from the BIS—

635
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,570
the Hong Kong station.
We're on the same side.

636
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,880
Why would BIS agents
be following Deputy Chief Wu?

637
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,840
We heard there's
communist espionage activity,

638
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,950
and we're under orders
to protect Deputy Chief Wu's safety.

639
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,610
You don't have much time left.

640
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,910
I'll give you one last chance.

641
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,590
If you don't behave,

642
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,930
I'll throw you into the sea!

643
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,510
I'll speak. I'll speak, okay?

644
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,030
Say it!

645
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,740
A special envoy appointed by Director Mao

646
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,940
joined the Hong Kong station recently.

647
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,790
He's the one who ordered us
to investigate Deputy Chief Wu.

648
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,190
Even Head of Station Li
follows his orders.

649
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
Mao Renfeng's special envoy

650
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,070
suspects that Deputy Chief Wu
is a Communist spy?

651
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:30,840
That's right.

652
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,570
Have you found anything so far?

653
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,910
No, nothing at all.

654
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,270
Do you have any other plans?

655
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,460
Just tailing, nothing else.

656
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,290
The Peninsula Hotel!

657
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,460
Many of my colleagues are working as staff
at the Peninsula Hotel.

658
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,610
That's all I know.

659
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,370
If I've told even half a lie,

660
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,700
just throw me into the sea
to feed the fish.

661
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,760
D-Don't go!

662
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,930
Hey!

663
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,990
Send a telegram home immediately.

664
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,990
It rains every day.

665
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,110
What's with this darn weather in Taiwan?

666
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,530
Come in.

667
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,510
Director,

668
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,230
urgent telegram from Hong Kong.

669
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,030
[The BIS has sent people to Hong Kong
to investigate Deputy Chief Wu's]

670
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,030
[alleged communist connections.
Please clarify my role in this.]

671
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,860
Chief,

672
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,820
I have something to report to you.

673
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,570
Deputy Chief Wu is there on behalf of
the Nationalist Government

674
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,700
to receive military aid from our ally.

675
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,380
Mao Qiwu is being incredibly brazen.

676
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,370
The BIS is really
overreaching its authority.

677
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,050
This could cause a diplomatic incident.

678
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,420
I understand, Sir.

679
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,270
I'll arrange people
to monitor their activities immediately.

680
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,840
Fighting communism
and preventing espionage is also

681
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,490
part of your responsibility.
The Ministry of Defense will not allow

682
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,750
any communist espionage infiltration.

683
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,090
You should know

684
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,630
what the Second Department needs to do.

685
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,710
I understand, Sir.

686
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,870
Send a reply to Hong Kong immediately.

687
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,400
Yes, Sir.

688
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,240
Fighting communism
and preventing espionage

689
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,700
is also the foundation of
our Second Department's existence.

690
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,480
We absolutely cannot
let the BIS get ahead of us.

691
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,860
Since Deputy Chief Wu
has resorted to such tactics,

692
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,210
it shows he's desperate.

693
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,390
He can't escape our surveillance.

694
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,530
He must make the rendezvous immediately,

695
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,620
and the best opportunity

696
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,160
is tonight's banquet.

697
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,880
As long as we can collect

698
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,050
solid evidence

699
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,580
of him meeting with
communist spies tonight,

700
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,620
it will be a great merit.

701
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,480
That's true in theory,

702
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,640
but when it comes to taking action,
think about it.

703
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,310
There will be many people tonight,

704
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,850
and they're all prominent figures
from the business circle.

705
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,910
If they're really going to
make the rendezvous

706
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,090
at the banquet,

707
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,780
it will be a tricky situation for us.

708
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,160
Mr. Gu,

709
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,490
do you have any clever plans?

710
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,780
I wouldn't call it clever,

711
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,020
but according to intelligence,

712
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,620
when this banquet was being prepared,

713
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,130
his communication line had been cut off.

714
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,300
He's lost contact with
all his communist accomplices

715
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,430
outside the island,

716
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,870
which means

717
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,300
the person coming for
the rendezvous tonight

718
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,140
can't possibly be on the guest list.
