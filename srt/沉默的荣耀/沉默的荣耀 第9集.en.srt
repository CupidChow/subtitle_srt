1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,020
[Silent Honor]

2
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,690
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,750
Reporting to Comrade Jianfeng.

4
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,880
I have suspended all personnel
involved in the Hong Kong incident

5
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,600
for self-reflection
and disciplinary action.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,460
This incident occurred
due to my negligent supervision.

7
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,630
I've ordered Section 4
to work around the clock

8
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,090
to decode the telegrams sent
by Zhang Hao's team as soon as possible.

9
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,630
I hope to redeem myself
through this service.

10
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,320
However, I

11
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,520
still suspect

12
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,150
that Deputy Chief Wu may be
collaborating with the Communists.

13
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,950
I've heard
that at the Kinmen victory banquet

14
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,400
General Chen Baocang
was dissatisfied with the President

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,500
for hiring Lin Baoyuan
as a strategic advisor

16
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,250
and had a conflict with Commander Yin.

17
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,910
Deputy Chief Wu openly
sided with Chen Baocang.

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,350
Chen Baocang was previously investigated
for supporting the Communists,

19
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,030
though the case was temporarily shelved
due to insufficient evidence.

20
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,880
But I am certain

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,140
he must be connected to Communist spies.

22
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,040
General Chen is about to go to Taichung
to inspect military supplies

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,970
and report directly to Deputy Chief Wu.

24
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,600
Deputy Chief Wu will also
be involved in the Southwest operations.

25
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,010
They worked together
in the Fourth District during the war.

26
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,030
If they join forces,

27
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,560
it could be detrimental to our party.

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,840
You should quickly find someone
to verify this matter.

29
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,910
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,170
Last time at the banquet

31
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,890
you spoke up for me, Yuxun.

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,760
I've been wanting to thank you properly.

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,890
I wanted to invite you to my house

34
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,820
for a proper meal.

35
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,250
But my wife isn't at home,

36
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,700
and I can't cook.

37
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,660
So I came out

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,590
and found this Fuzhou restaurant.

39
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,100
These dishes are really good.

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,570
Most importantly, the chef here

41
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,860
is supposedly
from your hometown in Minhou.

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,320
You're too kind, Zizhen.

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,280
Do you like Fuzhou cuisine?

44
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,110
I don't really like it.

45
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,200
I prefer simple food,

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,810
like donkey meat burgers.

47
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,600
I know.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,950
Besides, I'm treating you.

49
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,350
I can't just offer you
donkey meat burgers.

50
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,710
Why not?

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,290
Let's go. Take these with us

52
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,410
and find some donkey meat burgers.

53
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,579
No, no, Yuxun, listen to me.

54
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,730
I've asked around.

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,570
There are few donkey farms in Taiwan,

56
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,290
let alone finding donkey meat burgers.

57
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,620
Come on, let's sit down.

58
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,290
Stuck on this island,

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,660
many people are like me.

60
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,250
It's so hard to find a taste of home.

61
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,200
But this little restaurant has this,

62
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,920
Laobaigan liquor.

63
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,730
Here, Yuxun, cheers.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,190
Oh, it's you.

65
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,960
Have one. Just bought it. It's very sweet.

66
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,250
Its tough skin gets stuck in your teeth.

67
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,580
What's so good about it?

68
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,570
Let's chat for a while.

69
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,550
It's so boring just waiting around here.

70
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,220
I heard Chief Zhou assigned you

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,990
to inspect military supplies
of all units on the island.

72
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,630
Yes.

73
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,810
I agreed so readily

74
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,700
because he asked me

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,260
to report directly to you.

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,530
It's a good job.

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,380
You think this is a good job?

78
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,780
It has its pros and cons.

79
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,780
If done well, everyone's happy.

80
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,450
If not, you'll make enemies.

81
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,190
You might have forgotten

82
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,420
what I've been doing these past few years.

83
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,150
I used to be the Chief Supply Officer
in Shandong.

84
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,860
I know all too well about

85
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,780
the shady dealings
in the Nationalist Army's logistics.

86
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,900
A vice commander in Xuzhou's
Suppression General Headquarters

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,680
pockets the pay for 800 ghost soldiers.

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,520
Higher-ranking officers take more;
Lower-ranking ones take less.

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,630
By the time it reaches the soldiers,

90
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,159
each man gets less than
one jin of food per day.

91
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,930
After the Xu-Beng Campaign,

92
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,990
all 5 main forces have been starving.

93
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,310
Do you think these military supplies

94
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,360
can withstand inspection?

95
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,540
Wasn't it the same
during the War of Resistance?

96
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,600
Thinking about it now,

97
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,190
after the victory,

98
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,450
I never commanded troops again.

99
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,080
Perhaps that's a blessing.

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,870
In times like these,

101
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,920
trying to stay uninvolved

102
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,470
is difficult.

103
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,060
What is it now?

104
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,170
I just noticed

105
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,870
your gun doesn't have a hammer.

106
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,580
You've got sharp eyes.

107
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,790
Of course.

108
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,110
Let me take a look.

109
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm interested in these things.

110
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,190
Let me see.

111
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,820
Smith & Wesson, huh?

112
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,190
You really know guns.

113
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,230
You've filed off the hammer here.

114
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,520
Why did you do that?

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,850
Back when I was in the military,

116
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,400
we had holsters and straps.

117
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,070
Now I wear plain clothes more often.

118
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,450
Keeping it in my pocket is inconvenient.

119
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,140
The hammer catches
on the pocket when drawing.

120
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,290
Do you draw your gun often?

121
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,950
Do you sleep with your gun?

122
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,250
Yuxun,

123
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,030
on the other hand, the Communist Army has

124
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,740
over 1.5 million civilians

125
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,990
pushing wheelbarrows

126
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,570
and traveling long distances
to deliver food to them.

127
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,810
It's truly like heaven and earth.

128
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,830
Look at us with our planes and artillery.

129
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,020
We have everything.

130
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,430
But who would have thought

131
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,610
that soldiers at the front would go hungry

132
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,090
and not have enough to eat?

133
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,260
How is it that the Nationalist Army

134
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,870
can't even seize food by force,

135
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,930
yet civilians willingly
give it to the Communist Army?

136
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,930
Zizhen,

137
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,720
when I was
at the Fuzhou Pacification Office,

138
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,780
Director Zhu Shaoliang
gave me some advice.

139
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,300
Walls have ears.

140
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,590
Be careful what you say and do.

141
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,700
These words of yours

142
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,330
can be spoken here with me,

143
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,930
but shouldn't be said outside.

144
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,980
Yuxun,

145
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,570
we're the only ones in this restaurant.

146
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,700
What can't be said?

147
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,710
Alright, don't worry.

148
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,860
What we discuss today

149
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,690
won't leave this room.

150
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,070
But anyway,

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,930
if I can't talk to you about these things,

152
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,590
I'll burst from keeping it in.

153
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,530
I heard Madam and the children
have arrived too.

154
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,460
The two younger ones came.

155
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,130
What about Shaocheng and Lancheng?

156
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,570
Are they separated from you now?

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,460
What choice do we have?

158
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,920
We'll take it one step at a time.

159
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,190
I never expected

160
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,380
that on October 1st,

161
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,950
even Mrs. Sun Soong Ching-ling,

162
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,120
along with Zhang Biaolao,
Li Jishen and other dignitaries,

163
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,450
would all stand on the Tiananmen rostrum.

164
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,170
Even General Zhang Zhizhong,

165
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,580
who represented the Nationalist Government
in negotiations,

166
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,910
ended up staying
as the talks progressed.

167
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,430
Now the Nationalist Army
is retreating on all fronts,

168
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,560
and Taiwan is isolated across the sea.

169
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,980
How long we can hold out

170
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,350
remains uncertain.

171
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,430
Yuxun,

172
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,310
I advise you to make plans early.

173
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,520
What plans should I make?

174
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,310
I can't decide that for you.

175
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,360
But you should think about your children.

176
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,950
I feel it's unfair to you.

177
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,310
Look at General Zhang Zhizhong,

178
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,200
when he decided to stay,

179
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,100
Mr. Zhou Enlai immediately arranged

180
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,120
to bring all
his family members to Beijing.

181
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,610
But look at our side,

182
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,840
the BIS keeps harassing you
every other day.

183
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,060
Children have their own fortune.

184
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,780
Compared to Shaocheng and Lancheng,

185
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,650
I'm more worried about you, Zizhen.

186
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,290
Your straightforward manner
and outspoken nature

187
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,960
might get you into trouble

188
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,800
here in Taiwan.

189
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,390
You haven't changed a bit.

190
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,890
You can't tolerate
the slightest dishonesty.

191
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,030
Yes.

192
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,080
Unless I'm reborn.

193
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,320
But you have changed quite a bit.

194
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,750
"Heaven won't tolerate
the Kuomintang surviving."

195
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,550
Those were your words back then.

196
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,960
Do you dare say them now?

197
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,100
I don't.

198
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,670
That Wu Yuxun
who once shared my passion for justice

199
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,500
is gone.

200
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,030
Instead, there's now

201
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,590
a cautious Deputy Chief Wu.

202
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,890
Perhaps we're too optimistic.

203
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,980
Zizhen

204
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,590
is still as genuine as he was back then.

205
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,480
It's just a pity

206
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,410
that I can't

207
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,010
have a heart-to-heart talk with him now

208
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,300
and I had to dampen his spirits today.

209
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,000
I actually think

210
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,130
Deputy Chief Wu's character
is extremely reliable.

211
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,730
For decades, he's never touched
gambling, prostitution, or drugs.

212
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,080
Just this alone

213
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,930
is extremely rare and valuable.

214
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,340
After all, you haven't
seen each other for many years.

215
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,310
It's understandable
that he's being cautious.

216
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,490
General Chen is a man of character.

217
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,120
Even if we can't tell him the truth,

218
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,610
I believe

219
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,360
he can understand
your difficult position, sir.

220
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,310
After Taiwan is liberated,

221
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,330
I'll have a good drink with him.

222
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,860
What is it?

223
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,190
You may go.

224
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,890
Yes, sir.

225
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,910
Father.

226
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,200
Urgent wire from the Southwest:

227
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,620
Liu Bocheng's Communist force
has launched an all-out drive

228
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,020
from western Hunan-Hubei
toward eastern Sichuan-Guizhou.

229
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,820
How many troops do they have?

230
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,170
According to the frontline report,

231
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,770
there are more than
300,000 soldiers in total.

232
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,840
In southwest China,

233
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,990
our army has a million troops.

234
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,500
We hold an absolute advantage.

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
But tactically,

236
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,620
we need flexible strategies

237
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
to increase our chances of victory.

238
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,390
Tell Gu Zhutong

239
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,430
to immediately come up with

240
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,720
a counteroffensive plan
against the Communist Army.

241
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,250
Yes, sir.

242
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,770
Sir, you're needed at the meeting.

243
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,960
Chiang is getting anxious.

244
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,190
Liu Bocheng caught him off guard.

245
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,600
How did he attack?

246
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,660
Toward Chongqing?

247
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,980
He's cutting straight
from western Hunan to Chongqing.

248
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,980
Chiang is worried

249
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,750
because he can't bear to lose

250
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,480
either Chongqing or Chengdu.

251
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,080
What advice did those two Japanese give?

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,670
They want
Luo Guangwen's troops from Guizhou

253
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,260
to attack from the outer line.

254
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,280
That's absurd.

255
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,670
Not a single Nationalist Army unit

256
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,150
is capable of that now.

257
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,350
Chiang himself knows it's impossible.

258
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,050
These Japanese people
are just taking things for granted.

259
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,830
But there are still sensible people
at the Ministry of Defense.

260
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,890
I'm worried someone might suggest

261
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,080
gathering a large force in Chongqing.

262
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,740
Chongqing is easy to defend
but hard to attack.

263
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,270
That would be troublesome.

264
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,000
So I'm thinking at the meeting later,

265
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,790
I'll see if there's a chance to propose,

266
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,130
exploiting Chiang's reluctance
to lose territory

267
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,800
and suggesting he defends
both Chengdu and Chongqing.

268
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,670
If he accepts,

269
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,200
he'll definitely
split his forces between the two cities.

270
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,050
This way, the PLA

271
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,580
will have opportunities
to defeat enemies on multiple fronts.

272
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,050
Everyone,

273
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,150
I've been following the President

274
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,040
[Gu Zhutong,
First-level General of the Army]

275
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,810
commanding at the front lines recently.

276
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,060
[Chief of the General Staff
of KMT Ministry of Defense]

277
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,090
[Commander-in-Chief of the Army]

278
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,390
This time I've come to Taiwan

279
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,180
on the President's orders

280
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,820
to coordinate military operations
in southwest China.

281
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,500
If we cannot come up with

282
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,170
a foolproof plan this time,

283
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,010
I won't be able to return to Chongqing.

284
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,670
Please look here, everyone.

285
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,700
You all can see
the current battlefield situation.

286
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,220
Although Liu Bocheng's
Communist Army forces

287
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,530
have limited troops,

288
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,230
they're coming on strong.

289
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,500
The Ministry of Defense
previously assessed

290
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,080
that the Communist Army's
main offensive in southwest China

291
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,740
would be in northern Sichuan.

292
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,310
But now it seems we're on the defensive.

293
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,340
If Director Song Xilian
continues to retreat,

294
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,890
the Sichuan-Hunan-Hubei
Border Pacification Office

295
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,580
might as well be renamed
the Chongqing Pacification Office.

296
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,270
Everyone,

297
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,340
how can we break this stalemate
and counterattack?

298
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,410
I hope you can contribute your ideas.

299
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,590
Director Huang,

300
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,650
what do you think?

301
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,930
Chongqing is mountainous,

302
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,680
easy to defend but difficult to attack.

303
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,410
Even the Japanese army
could do nothing about it.

304
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,030
If Director Hu

305
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,820
could lead his 13 armies

306
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,360
of nearly 400,000 men

307
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,330
from Hanzhong in northern Sichuan
to Chongqing,

308
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,350
and rely on the Wujiang River,
Wuling Mountain,

309
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,740
and the natural barrier
of the Yangtze River,

310
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,430
building three defense lines,

311
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,830
we can surely break
the siege of Chongqing.

312
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,240
But the Communist Army's vanguard
is already approaching Qianjiang River.

313
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,010
And Director Hu's main forces
are still far away

314
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,320
in the Qinling Mountains
and Hanzhong areas.

315
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,410
Only Unit One is in Guangyuan and Bazhong.

316
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,640
This plan would have
worked well a month ago,

317
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,130
but now I'm afraid distant waters
can't quench immediate thirst.

318
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,330
So, Deputy Chief Liu,

319
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,450
what do you think?

320
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,220
I believe we should have Song Xilian

321
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,190
and Luo Guangwen's troops
in northern Guizhou

322
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,720
abandon eastern Sichuan-Guizhou directly.

323
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,450
We should consolidate our forces

324
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,960
and concentrate them
to defend Chongqing at all costs.

325
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,890
When Director Hu's forces arrive,

326
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,020
we can attack
from both inside and outside

327
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,300
and will surely destroy Liu Bocheng.

328
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,339
If we abandon so many positions,

329
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,790
I'm afraid
the President won't accept that.

330
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,920
Besides, there's also Li Yannian's

331
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,390
precedent of abandoning Pingtan Island.

332
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,390
Song Xilian and Luo Guangwen may not

333
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,460
be willing to execute this order.

334
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,030
If we don't make choices,

335
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,400
even the best plans are meaningless.

336
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,330
Don't speak such discouraging words.

337
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,520
Deputy Chief Wu,

338
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,510
what's your opinion?

339
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,390
I have no opinions,

340
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,290
only concerns.

341
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,260
If Director Hu's main forces
and Song Xilian's corps

342
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,990
all rush to support Chongqing,

343
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,390
then northern Guizhou
will certainly be vulnerable.

344
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,690
If Liu Bocheng

345
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,540
passes through northern Guizhou
and southern Sichuan,

346
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,740
bypassing Chongqing

347
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,880
and heading straight for Chengdu,

348
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,760
wouldn't that be disastrous?

349
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,820
Liu Bocheng is known
for his cunning military tactics.

350
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,910
Deputy Chief Wu's concerns
are not without merit.

351
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,450
Deputy Chief Wu has a high position

352
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,530
and a broad perspective,

353
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,530
and always hits the nail
on the head.

354
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,090
Do you have any strategy
to defeat the enemy?

355
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,660
Director Hu has great military power

356
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,520
and is trusted by the President.

357
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,090
He should be able to take care of
both Sichuan and Chongqing.

358
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,710
As long as
Director Song Xilian in the front

359
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,760
can hold the Wujiang-Pengshui line,

360
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,560
our army still have a chance.

361
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,340
Sir, what did the Chief say to you?

362
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,000
He conveyed Chiang's opinion to me.

363
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,670
Advance without retreat,
protecting both Chengdu and Chongqing.

364
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,700
He ordered the Ministry of Defense
to come up with a plan immediately.

365
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,090
Looks like they're going
to split the forces.

366
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,020
As expected, they don't want
to lose either Chongqing or Chengdu.

367
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,150
Chiang has always
deployed troops this way,

368
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,690
overestimating the Nationalist Army's
fighting capability.

369
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,950
At the beginning of battles,
he tries to cover everything.

370
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,130
Then he wants to occupy more major cities.

371
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,800
In the end, he can't hold onto anything.

372
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,500
It happened in the Liaoxi Campaign,

373
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,130
and in the Xu-Beng Campaign as well.

374
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,190
So your proposal
to protect both Sichuan and Chongqing

375
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,720
plays right into his hands.

376
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,170
This is my previous plan,

377
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,960
but it needs to be detailed.

378
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,480
As long as Hu Zongnan splits his force,

379
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
the PLA have a chance
to take the Southwest.

380
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,720
So the plan

381
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,010
must be finished tonight.

382
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,070
Great. We'll work through the night.

383
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,450
Got off work?

384
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,680
Quite on time today.

385
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,060
Let me do it.

386
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,410
You should head home too.

387
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,610
Madam, I still have some work to finish.

388
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,890
What work is so urgent
that it must be done today?

389
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,480
The Chief urgently needs
a deployment plan.

390
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,490
He's waiting for me to call him
when I'm done.

391
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Get off work no later than
9 PM every night,

392
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,680
go home and rest.

393
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,960
Look at the time.

394
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,400
Well, it's 9:05 PM now.

395
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,110
It's up to you, Yuxun.

396
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,870
Alright, Madam. We won't work tonight.

397
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,670
Good night.

398
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
I'm not going back today.
I'll just stay here

399
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,610
and tomorrow morning...

400
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,220
You should hurry back to be with Mei.

401
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,870
Go home early to be with Mei.

402
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,070
Come early tomorrow.

403
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,340
Come early.

404
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,310
Okay.

405
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,740
Madam, I'm leaving now.

406
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,580
Good night.

407
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,060
Good night.

408
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,960
Dou,

409
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,580
make a pot of rice porridge later

410
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,370
and prepare several more dishes.

411
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,030
Madam,

412
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,500
Adjutant Nie and Mr. Wu were up all night.

413
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,860
Do we need to prepare
so much food now?

414
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,150
Awake now?

415
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,130
Yes.

416
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,970
How was your sleep?

417
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,360
Very well.

418
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,580
No dreams?

419
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,150
No.

420
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,300
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.

421
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,320
I slept really well.

422
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,460
Wu Yuxun,

423
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,500
since when did you learn
to put on an act with me?

424
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,450
Dou already told me everything.

425
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:41,900
Who?

426
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,910
Dou.

427
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,180
She saw you and Nie Xi

428
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,330
spending the whole night in the study.

429
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,790
What about our agreement?

430
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,890
Have you forgotten it all?

431
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,330
There is indeed a critical task

432
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,560
that needs to be completed quickly.

433
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,390
What critical task?

434
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,980
Isn't your life critical?

435
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,310
Morning, Qian.

436
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,480
Morning, Adjutant Nie.

437
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,000
Sir, I'm here.

438
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,350
Stay in bed.

439
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,690
I'm still mad at you.

440
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,660
Just keep sleeping.

441
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,000
Lie down.

442
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:09,760
Okay.

443
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,120
Madam.

444
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,880
You're here.

445
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,220
How was you sleep yesterday?

446
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,550
Very well.

447
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,910
I haven't slept this well in a long time.

448
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,170
I bought breakfast too. It's still warm.

449
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,150
Have a seat.

450
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,580
Nie Xi,

451
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,350
doesn't Mei

452
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,500
blame you for doing this?

453
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:50,920
Mei?

454
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,120
What would she blame me about?

455
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,870
You come here at 7 AM sharp every morning.

456
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,740
And after work,

457
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,470
you either work overtime
at the office

458
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,990
or in your study.

459
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,310
You never get home before 10 PM.

460
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,530
And Mei has never blamed you for this?

461
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,890
I called her several times the other day.

462
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,330
No one answered in the dormitory.

463
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,790
Yes, she was working overtime
at her office.

464
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,830
Didn't I tell you about that before?

465
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,790
Then what about last night?

466
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,190
What about last night?

467
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,610
She didn't work overtime last night.

468
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,450
I went home early last night.

469
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,910
Anyway,

470
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,240
it's good to get some rest.

471
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,280
You can lie to me,

472
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,970
but don't keep lying to Mei.

473
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,040
It's not easy for her to be with you.

474
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,500
You need to treat her well.

475
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,970
A harmonious family
brings success in everything.

476
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,880
Honesty is the most important thing
between husband and wife.

477
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,410
Yes.

478
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,500
So,

479
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,690
invite Mei over for dinner tomorrow.

480
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,490
Consider it

481
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,580
my way of apologizing to Mei

482
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,470
on behalf of your mentor.

483
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,840
No need, Madam.

484
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,850
Mei might be a little unhappy,

485
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,150
but it's really not that serious.

486
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,460
Just some minor family issues.

487
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,670
Not a big...

488
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,850
Listen to my wife.

489
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,320
Ask Mei to come over tomorrow.

490
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,770
You need to apologize to her.

491
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,020
Last night we

492
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,620
worked in the study all night

493
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,950
and didn't sleep at all.

494
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,420
Busted.

495
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,080
Busted again?

496
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,190
I'm sorry, Madam.

497
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,880
You haven't slept all night.

498
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,030

Yesterday at the market,

I saw a woman selling cigarettes,

544
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,710
and then she was chased
and beaten by police.

545
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,920
Why did that happen?

546
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,070
Mom,

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,360

aren't regular police.

549
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,010
They're tax officers
from the Monopoly Bureau.

550
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,880
Now in Taiwan,

551
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,230
necessities like cigarettes,
alcohol, sugar, and tea

552
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,690
are government monopolies.

553

Private sales are prohibited.

554
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,620
Really? When did this start?

555
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,690
It started as soon as Japan surrendered.

556
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,020
It was established
by the provincial chairman at that time.

557
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,060
The profits from cigarettes, alcohol,
sugar, and tea are the highest.

558
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,250
This government holds Japan with one hand

559
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,480
and clings to American aid with the other.

560

I've thought about it too, Mom.

But if I really had that ability,

568
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,650
wouldn't I have
quit this job long ago?

577
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,739
and they all want a taste
of their hometown food.

578
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,000
Right?

579
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,770
Many people want chili oil.

580
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,250
I was thinking

581
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,620
if we bring in some things
not available locally

582
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,480
like chili powder,
Sichuan pepper powder and such,

583
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,710
the sales should be good, right?

584
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,590
And even if they don't sell right away,

585
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,870
they're dry goods, easy to store,

don't you think?

but no chili powder.

593
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,280
we've got ourselves
a business opportunity.

594

before we can contact them.

668
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,480
Yes.

669
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,830
That's the proper procedure.

670
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,100
Did you bring the radio?

671
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,640
The inspection at Taiwan entry
is too strict.

672
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,480
I couldn't even bring in an antenna.

673
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,350
So regarding
the communication line establishment,

674
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,160
I'll have to trouble
the Taiwan Work Committee.

675
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,530
That's what we just decided
in the meeting.

676
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,460
To establish a communication line

677
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,290
as a bridge between the East China Bureau

678
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,100
and the East Sea Team.

679
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,640
Thank you for your help.

680
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,660
Is this your first time in Taiwan?

681
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,890
Yes, first time.

682
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,180
The White Terror in Taiwan is very severe.

683
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,640
Since you're unfamiliar with this place,

684
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,470
come to us if you have any difficulties.

685
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:13,850
Okay.

686
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,080
But before entering,

687
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,340
you must check the blackboard
at the entrance.

688
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,400
If it says "Mellow Flavor",

689
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,320
it's safe for rendezvous.

690
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,950
If "Flavor" is changed to "Finish",

691
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,100
it's dangerous.

692
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,980
No rendezvous then. Remember that.

693
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,020
Okay, got it.

694
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,120
What happened just now?

695
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,310
False alarm.

696
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:39,750
Come.

697
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,330
The courier replacing Comrade Zhang Hao

698
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,210
has arrived for the rendezvous.

699
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,980
What intelligence did she bring?

700
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,600
Nothing.

701
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,600
The East Sea Intelligence Team

702
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,950
Comrade Zhang Hao belongs to

703
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,600
is extremely important to the Party.

704
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,410
Comrade Zhang Hao has sacrificed his life,

705
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,610
and the radio is gone.

706
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,410
We have so much intelligence
that needs to be delivered.

707
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,060
So you need to rebuild
the communication line

708
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,980
and take this intelligence
from Taipei to Hong Kong.

709
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,010
How much time do you need?

710
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:18,850
One week.

711
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,770
Give me one week.

712
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,570
I promise to complete the task.

713
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,940
On behalf of the Party, thank you.

714
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,040
Zheng,

715
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,950
trust me.

716
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,600
Ju,

717
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,120
hasn't Changcheng returned?

718
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,480
What's going on with you two?

719
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,840
Didn't you go together?

720
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,720
He's back.

721
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,660
Mom.

722
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,790
Mom, where have you been?

723
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,270
I've been looking for you.

724
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,520
I was so worried.

725
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,750
Changcheng.

726
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,370
I think

727
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,350
I must have taken a wrong turn.

728
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,280
And I felt like

729
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,560
I was getting further and further away.

730
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,230
Then I hired a rickshaw

731
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,980
to come back.

732
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,120
Did you find a place
to make the chili powder?

733
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,290
Yes, I did.

734
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,290
I found a Chinese medicine shop.

735
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,750
The owner is very nice.

736
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,710
I told him

737
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,890
to process it for us,

738
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,790
and afterward,

739
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,850
for every package sold,
we can take commission.

740
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,050
He agreed right away.

741
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,210
Right, I just wrote down the address.

742
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,660
I think

743
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,930
it's not too far from here.

744
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,000
Take a look.

745
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,160
This shop?

746
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,640
But selling chili powder
in front of a medicine shop,

747
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,730
is that appropriate?

748
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,750
As long as the owner agrees,

749
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,830
why not?

750
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,730
Besides, I think that shop

751
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,720
has a bustling street in front of it,

752
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,040
with lots of people passing by.

753
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,100
I think we can do good business there.

754
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,290
Then I'll give it a try?

755
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,770
Yeah, try it.
