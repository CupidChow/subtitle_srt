00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,570
Sir, a telegram from the Southwest Office.

4
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,050
Have Wujiang and Pengshui fallen so soon?

5
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,980
They've fallen.

6
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,140
General Song Xilian failed to
hold Wujiang,

7
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,520
and even lost Pengshui. Now…

8
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,340
Colonel Wang,

9
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,770
don't speak words of discouragement.

10
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,990
Sichuan and Chongqing will surely
stand as solid as a fortress.

11
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,450
You must have confidence.

12
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,930
Yes!

13
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,170
Is there any liquor left in the office?

14
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,970
Yes, there is.

15
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,579
Sir, would you like a drink?

16
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,140
It's not appropriate in the office, is it?

17
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,840
Yes.

18
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,550
Let's drink at home.

19
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,350
I'll join you.

20
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,510
Drinking at home isn't appropriate either.

21
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,710
Madam won't allow it.

22
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,460
Then why did you ask?

23
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,730
Can't I just ask?

24
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm off work. I'll head out first.

25
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,880
Go ahead.

26
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,570
I still have to work overtime.

27
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,790
Two files still haven't come back from

28
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,340
Wu's and Zhou's offices.

29
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,990
It's so annoying.

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,470
Zhenhua,

31
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,560
if you're in a hurry,

32
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,130
I can cover your shift.

33
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,350
Really?

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,750
I actually made plans
to see a play with some friends.

35
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,850
Then go already.

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,840
But you've been busy all day.

37
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,520
It doesn't matter.

38
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,250
We're roommates;

39
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,000
helping each other is what we should do.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,460
If you want to go, hurry up.

41
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,340
But next time when I need something,

42
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,690
you have to cover my shift.

43
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,850
You're the best!

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,510
I'll bring you back some taro cake.

45
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,100

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,040
Sir,

49
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,340
there's still one more document
you haven't filed.

50

The chief says I can't leave

51
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,060
until all the files are filed.

52
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,409
When did you get here?

53
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,790
Sir, I checked in at
the Confidential Office just yesterday.

54
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,450
I meant when did you arrive at my door.

55
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,450
Just before I knocked.

56
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,990
File it, comrade.

What's wrong?

63
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,780
Do you really have to transfer Xuecheng?

64
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,980
Is there no other way?

65

A few days ago,

66
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,310
Ms. Li, the Chinese teacher

67
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,840
at Qiuzhen Middle School,

68
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,080
was seized by BIS

69
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,740
for spreading Communist propaganda

70
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,340
in class

71
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,590
and executed

72
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,340
the next day.

73
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,780
Her family arrived

74
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,660
only after it was over.

75
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,580
Then...

76
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,230
That thing her best friend

77
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,730
showed her

78
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,900
was really too dangerous.

79
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,820
Yes.

80
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
That's why she has to transfer schools.

81
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,550
Don't worry too much.

82
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,550
Don't tell her—no need to scare her.

83
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,570
I won't.

84
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,610
And you shouldn't worry too much either.

85
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,440
I'll take her to school tomorrow

86
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,850
and have a chat with her.

90
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,650
Yeah. Why?

91
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,290
Could I get a lift back with you?

92
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,960
Are you in a hurry to get back?

93
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,620
No, I just worked late today.

94
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,750
I'm a bit scared to walk back

95
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,190
alone in the dark.

96
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,400
No problem.

97
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,020
Thank you.

98
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,390
You're welcome.

99
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,220
Adjutant Nie,
do you also like listening to the radio?

100
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,480
Occasionally.

101
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,080
I like Zhou Xuan and Bai Guang.

102
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,000
I vaguely heard you listening to the radio

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,240
in the office today too.

104
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,700
Whose songs do you usually like
to listen to?

105
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,820
I don't usually listen to songs.

106
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,770
I listen to news—

107
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,920
Central News Agency broadcasts.

108
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,810
But not always,

109
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,920
I just tune in to whatever's on.

110
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,970
It doesn't matter to me.

111
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,290
Hearing can be deceiving anyway.

112
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,590
Sometimes sound isn't so reliable—

113
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,070
like just now, I didn't hear

114
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,540
your footsteps before you knocked.

115
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,090
Is that so?

116
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,510
Maybe you were just

117
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,780
too focused on work.

118
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,190
Everyone in the ministry knows

119
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,450
you and Deputy Chief Wu

120
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,950
are swamped with official business.

121
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,760
Adjutant Nie, you can stop there.

122
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,070
I haven't had dinner.

123
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,500
I'd like to grab a bite
before heading back.

124
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,640
Forget it.

125
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,390
Let's just go back now.

126
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,230
Why?

127
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,460
I'm afraid of taking up your time.

128
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,100
I just realized that

129
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,400
it's so dark now.

130
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,330
If I eat alone and then go back,

131
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,900
I'll be scared again.

132
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,600
Go ahead and eat.

133
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
Would you like a bowl too?

134
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,130
No, thanks.

135
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,900
I'll wait for you in the car.

136
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,040
Boss, two bowls of misua, please.

137
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,670
Sit over there. It'll be ready soon.

138
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,740
Adjutant Nie,

139
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,080
I ordered two bowls just now.

140
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,300
Would you like to try some?

141
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,170
Thank you.

143

Li Qing, what's going on?

144
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,720
Why did you come back with Adjutant Nie?

145
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,590
Don't tell me he actually drove you back.

146
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,920
He's so old-fashioned—

147
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,170
did he drove you back?

148
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,780
I just waited for him
to return the files, sign in,

149
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,020
and we grabbed a late-night snack.

150
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,140
You two had a late-night snack together?

151
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,070
Did he treat you?

152
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,010
Just a bowl of misua.

153
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,630
A bowl of misua is a big deal!

154
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,520
What are you thinking about?

155
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,750
Wait a minute.

156
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,300
Were you really trying to help me,

157
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,900
or was there another reason?

158
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,930
Of course I was trying to help you.

159
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,840
Yeah?

160
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,240
Obviously.

161
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,160

162
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,700
though,

163
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,080
I think Adjutant Nie

164
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,880
is actually quite a nice person.

165
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,030
Oh, come on.

166
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,070
Don't set your sights on him.

167
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,380
He's already married.

168
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,650
Then why have I never seen

169
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,930
Mrs. Nie at the office?

170
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,620
Trouble in the marriage?

171
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,650
You've noticed too, huh?

172
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,360
When we all worked late,

173
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,630
every officer's wife

174
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,850
brought fresh clothes for her husband.

175
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,930
But not him.

176
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,240
He's like a bachelor.

177
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,890
Mrs. Wu even

178
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,530
brings an extra set for him.

179
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
No idea why.

180
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,750
Could it be that he doesn't have a wife?

181
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,750
Who told you that?

182
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,660
His file says he does.

183
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,080
I even saw her

184
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,340
in the hallway before.

185
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,160
But lately, she hasn't shown up.

186
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,150
Everyone's saying

187
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,080
maybe something happened at home.

188
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,880
You've fallen for him?

189
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,340
I can tell.

190
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,490
What do you think about all day?

191
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,130
You've definitely fallen for him,

192
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:34,860
haven't you?

193
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,020
You like him?

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,510
Really?

195
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,240
You've really fallen for him?

196
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,480
No.

197
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,980
What are you doing?

198
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,120
Come on, just admit it.

199
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,380
Wash up and get ready for bed.

200
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,770
Hurry up.

201
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,740
I'm not kidding.

202
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,890
Do you really like him?

203
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,690
Are you done yet? Come on, hurry.

204
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,270
Father,

205
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,750
the enemy is advancing on
southwestern Sichuan

206
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,380
and the areas south of it.

207
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,670
Song Xilian's two corps

208
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,440
have only a little over 30,000 men left.

209
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,740
Send a telegram to Hu Zongnan

210
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,930
to order him to march south
from northern Sichuan at once,

211
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,390
and hold Chengdu at all costs.

212
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,270
Yes, Father.

213
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,150
Last time, Deputy Chief Wu

214
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,620
suggested that Song Xilian
hold the Wujiang

215
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,650
and Pengshui line.

216
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,780
Now that both positions are lost,

217
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,430
many in the Kuomintang are whispering that

218
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,360
he did it on purpose.

219
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,460
The Kuomintang strives to quell
the uprising and needs capable hands.

220
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,100
With the war so tense on all fronts,

221
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,960
you must unite the generals
within the Kuomintang

222
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,250
to steady morale.

223
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,170
Have Chen Cheng and Gu Zhutong
come here immediately

224
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,620
to come up with a new counterattack plan.

225
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,100
Yes, Father.

226
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,480
Please, take a seat.

227
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,700
At this critical moment of the
Southwest Campaign,

228
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,180
losing contact with Song Xilian's forces

229
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,160
has left the eastern Sichuan
front wide open,

230
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,500
disrupting some of our original plans.

231
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,530
We must make new adjustments now.

232
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,980
In addition,

233
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,740
I've received an urgent telegram
from Yan Xishan,

234
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,000
strongly recommending that
I take command in Chongqing

235
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,960
to turn around the Kuomintang
and Nation's
declining situation.

236
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,690
After careful consideration,

237
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,010
both emotionally and rationally,

238
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,700
I must set aside

239
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,030
personal safety and honor,

240
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,030
and stand with the military
and political cadres in the southwest—

241
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,890
sharing life and death,
facing hardship together,

242
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,700
and striving to

243
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,870
turn the situation around.

244
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,020
President,

245
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,180
I'm willing to follow you to Chongqing

246
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,990
and face any peril together.

247
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,480
We're willing to face any peril with you.

248
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,320
Please take a seat.

249
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,020
I am deeply gratified

250
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,600
by such a spirit.

251
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,090
I've already handed the list

252
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,540
of accompanying personnel to Jingguo.

253
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,400
Let's depart tomorrow.

254
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,210
Oh, by the way,

255
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,080
Deputy Chief Wu.

256
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,599
At your service.

257
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,230
Recently, I've heard some questioning

258
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,670
whether our party should
employ the White Group.

259
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,260
To me, this is utterly absurd.

260
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,599
During the War of Resistance,

261
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,359
Mr. Wu suffered the pain of
losing his son,

262
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,690
yet he still worked diligently,

263
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,360
serving as an interpreter
for me and the White Group,

264
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,890
and helping to draft strategic guidelines.

265
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,850
Such a spirit of putting
the greater good above personal grief

266
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
is all the more precious

267
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,120
in this time of national crisis.

268
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,820
Everyone,

269
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,720
you should take Deputy Chief Wu
as an example

270
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,670
to put the country above yourselves
in this time of crisis.

271
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,650
I really want to see

272
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,100
how charming Adjutant Nie is

273
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,980
to have you so smitten.

274
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,510
Don't talk nonsense.

275
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,600
Lu Zhenhua,

276
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,780
hurry and take the files
I asked you to organize

277
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,390
to Deputy Chief Wu for signature.

278
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,040
Okay.

279
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,040
Is there any mail for me?

280
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,410
I just picked them up.

281
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,600
Sir!

282
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,710
Come in.

283
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,890
Here are some documents

284
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,760
that need Deputy Chief Wu's signature.

285
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,930
He is in a meeting.

286
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,110
I'll give them to him when he returns.

287
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,840
[To Section Chief Zhao, personal]

288
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,750
Are you sure you didn't see my letter?

289
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,130
I don't think so. It's all here.

290
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,450
That's not right.

291
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,280
I should have received a letter today.

292
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,610
How could it be missing?

293
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,630
Ms. Zhao,

294
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,250
you are looking for this, right?

295
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,570
Lu Zhenhua,
how can you handle things like this?

296
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,130
Can you just send my personal letters
anywhere like that?

297
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,670
Can't you tell documents and envelopes?

298
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,870
I think you shouldn't work here anymore.

299
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,340
Go down to the archives immediately.

300
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,100
Nobody goes to the basement

301
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,360
for ten or fifteen days,

302
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,020
so you won't make mistakes again.

303
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhao.

304
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,060
I didn't mean to.

305
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,170
Sorry.

306
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,950
Ms. Zhao,

307
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,230
this is not just Lu Zhenhua's fault.

308
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,400
I accidentally sorted them wrong

309
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,660
while we were talking.

310
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,570
Playing the hero now, are you?

311
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,780
Since you're so righteous,

312
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,360
why don't you take her place

313
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,410
and work in the archives?

314
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,120
Ms. Zhao,

315
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,690
don't be so angry. Calm down.

316
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,890
Adjutant Nie,

317
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,020
you don't know

318
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,580
how difficult these new recruits

319
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,650
are to manage.

320
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,860
I know.

321
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,100
You in the Confidential Section

322
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,880
deal with important documents,

323
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,590
including some top-secret  national files.

324
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,890
If anything goes wrong,

325
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,950
none of us can bear the consequences.

326
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,880
Mr. Wu went to a meeting.

327
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,340
I saw that this was your letter,

328
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,040
and I didn't know if it was important,

329
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
so I just handed it to you right away.

330
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,590
These two are new recruits.

331
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,760
They didn't do it on purpose.

332
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,120
Please be lenient with them.

333
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,850
They won't let it happen again.

334
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
Fine, since you've spoken for them,

335
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,260
but this is the last time.

336
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,910
Thank you.

337
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,820
Lu Zhenhua, I need to

338
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,710
have a proper talk with you

339
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,630
about this.

340
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,060
Adjutant Nie,

341
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,430
thank you for helping me out just now.

342
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,130
I wouldn't have known
what to do otherwise.

343
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,080
We're colleagues.

344
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,140
No need to thank me.

345
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,040
Zhenhua is my good friend.

346
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,520
I couldn't bear to see her scolded
by Ms. Zhao.

347
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,150
I didn't expect you to be so righteous.

348
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,520
You've helped us so much.

349
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,930
Can we treat you to a meal?

350
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,740
The front line situation is urgent.

351
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,430
I haven't had a proper rest
for the past two weeks.

352
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,560
Let's skip the meal.

353
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,420
Thank you.

354
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,330
Still, we have to thank you.

355
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,090
You should head back now,

356
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,290
or Ms. Zhao will give you trouble again.

357
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,940
Everyone,

358
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,560
we have fought on many fronts

359
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,820
and it is rare to gather together today.

360
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,230
For this first toast,

361
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,090
I propose we all drink to the President,

362
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,650
in honor of restoring order,
saving the country,

363
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,080
and facing national crisis together.

364
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,520
Restoring order, saving the country,

365
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,650
and facing national crisis together.

366
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,070
For the second toast,

367
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,240
I want to honor the soldiers
who will follow the President

368
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
on the expedition to the Southwest.

369
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,820
I give you this send-off.

370
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,230
Please, everyone be seated.

371
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,060
Yuxun,

372
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,820
please wait a moment.

373
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,650
The President has not
publicly praised anyone

374
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,040
for a long time.

375
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,860
You fully

376
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,600
deserve this honor.

377
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,590
A toast to Deputy Chief Wu.

378
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,170
A toast to Deputy Chief Wu.

379
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,030
I'm deeply grateful
for the trust of the President,

380
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,050
the Chief, and everyone here.

381
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,820
It is my great honor to serve

382
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,970
the Kuomintang and the Nation
with all that I can.

383
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,810
Please be seated.

384
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,230
Make yourselves comfortable.

385
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,970
Deputy Chief Wu,

386
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,370
you are our role model.

387
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
We should all learn from you.

388
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,880
Deputy Chief Wu,

389
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,560
a toast to you.

390
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,230
Alright, thank you.

391
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,170
Mei,

392
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,200
come on, quick.

393
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,740
Don't be shy, have a seat.

394
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,850
It's getting late. They're still not back.

395
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,650
Why don't we start

396
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,770
without them?

397
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,960
Here,

398
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,130
have some more of this.

399
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,020
Thank you.

400
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,820
Mei,

401
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,730
I invited you here today

402
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,630
mainly to apologize

403
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,310
on behalf of Yuxun.

404
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,990
He always makes Nie Xi work late,

405
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,380
which affects you as a couple.

406
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Both of them work so hard.

407
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,060
I'll talk to him

408
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,560
and ask him to
let Nie Xi work less overtime.

409
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,720
Did he only say that
I complained about him working overtime?

410
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,330
He didn't say that.

411
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,850
But you complained about him

412
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,110
because he was working overtime, right?

413
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,560
That's why you were unhappy.

414
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,220
I called you several times
but nobody answered.

415
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:39,930
Madam,

416
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,170
he lied to me.

417
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,560
He lied to you?

418
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,260
What did he lie about?

419
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,520
Tell me. I'll help you.

420
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,310
When we first came to Taiwan,

421
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,840
I insisted on bringing the child with me.

422
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,020
But he said the boat ride would be rough

423
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,210
and the child might feel unwell,

424
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,210
so he would bring the child by plane.

425
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,720
But when we arrived in Taipei,

426
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
he came alone.

427
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,240
I thought

428
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,710
we could settle in first

429
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,620
and then bring the child over.

430
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,490
Every time I asked him after that,

431
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,580
he just brushed me off—

432
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,430
putting it off

433
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,590
day after day.

434
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,820
Always telling me it will be soon.

435
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,890
I feel like he doesn't
care about the child

436
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,120
and doesn't want our family
to be together.

437
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,620
I really couldn't take it,

438
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,990
so I had to move out.

439
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,160
You're not going to
stay with Nie Xi anymore?

440
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,730
I can't continue for now.

441
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,540
We are living apart.

442
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,970
Living apart?

443
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,090
Wait, Mei.

444
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,790
You have to think carefully.

445
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,650
Living apart is a serious matter.

446
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,730
I remember Yuxun told me that

447
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,170
at that time it was Nie Xi

448
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,880
who insisted on coming to Taiwan,

449
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,730
so he left the child in Fuzhou.

450
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,730
And he even told us that this was done

451
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,550
with your consent.

452
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,660
How could I possibly agree?

453
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,890
How could I ever agree to

454
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,420
be separated from my child?

455
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,020
Even if I die, I want

456
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,650
our family to die together.

457
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,410
Nie Xi really went too far.

458
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,610
He not only lied to me,

459
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,760
but also to you and Mr. Wu.

460
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,430
He didn't want to tell his mentor,

461
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,830
maybe because he has his own difficulties.

462
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,320
Mei,

463
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,520
men sometimes

464
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
face a lot of pressure outside.

465
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,410
I'll ask him for you later.

466
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,050
You should also think about it.

467
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,570
It might be best to move back.

468
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,390
I've seen you two

469
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,780
fall in love,

470
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,450
and your relationship hasn't been easy.

471
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,320
Life is so short,

472
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,800
just a few decades.

473
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,690
Don't do anything

474
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,320
that will make you regret it.

475
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,450
And sometimes, with a man,

476
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,990
you have to give him some face.

477
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,710
Madam,

478
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,480
over all these years,

479
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,540
have you ever complained about Mr. Wu?

480
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,210
Yes.

481
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,450
Of course I have.

482
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,220
But he is my...

483
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,860
He's my husband.

484
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,390
As long as
he is well and the child is well,

485
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
it doesn't matter

486
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,260
what happens to me.

487
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,340
I wish I could be like you.

488
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,910
I've tried,

489
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,210
but I just can't.

490
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,890
It's okay, Mei.

491
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,380
It's okay.

492
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,980
I get so angry

493
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,290
when I think about him lying to me.

494
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,260
Thinking about him
keeping me apart from my child—

495
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,490
it hurts so much.

496
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,610
There, there.

497
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,910
I miss my child so much.

498
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,710
Madam,

499
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,190
is there really no way
to bring the child over?

500
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,780
I also have two children on the mainland.

501
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,820
I completely understand how you feel.

502
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,490
But you can see the situation now:

503
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,410
Fuzhou is already under Communist control.

504
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,580
It's not as simple as getting back

505
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,090
with just a boat ticket.

506
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,520
Mr. Wu,

507
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,680
I've been working myself

508
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,260
to the bone,

509
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,080
begging everyone I can,

510
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,690
and we're still short 200 trucks.

511
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,950
The First Army was
personally assigned by the President.

512
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,490
If we can't deliver to Chongqing on time

513
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,950
and miss the opportunity,

514
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,150
I can't bear that responsibility.

515
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,250
How about this?

516
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,950
I'll call Officer Bai Chongxi

517
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,970
and see if he can help us arrange some.

518
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,710
Mr. Wu, saving a life
is the greatest virtue of all.

519
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,680
Officer Bai will definitely
honor your request.

520
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,140
I'm on it.

521
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,830
General Chen is looking for you.

522
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,280
Zizhen, you're here too.

523
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,300
Did Chief Gu ask you to come?

524
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,200
Chief Gu didn't.

525
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,540
It's about work.

526
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm here to see the Chief and you.

527
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:57,990
What for?

528
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,720
To submit my resignation.

529
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,440
I can't handle the task of

530
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,820
inspecting military equipment
on the island.

531
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,260
Please find someone more capable.

532
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,660
Resignation?

533
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,260
Where are you planning to go?

534
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,130
Where else could I go?

535
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,190
I'll go to Tainan to train new recruits.

536
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,880
Goodbye.

537
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,360
Zizhen,

538
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,810
are you in some kind of trouble?

539
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,890
Not at all.

540
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,210
What trouble could I possibly have?

541
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,090
I just heard that you

542
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,620
served as translator
for the President and White Group,

543
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,700
and even received
high praise from President.

544
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,820
I, Chen,

545
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,100
feel I fall short in comparison.

546
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,530
No wonder President
holds you in such high regard.

547
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,110
You've really changed in just a few days.

548
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,940
I've been too slow to realize.

549
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,840
I always thought you were

550
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,280
Wu Yuxun, fearless
and fighting side by side

551
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,470
at Battle of Kunlun Pass,
spilling blood for the cause.

552
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,020
But now, Deputy Chief Wu,

553
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,470
you've devoted yourself
to easing the burdens of the nation,

554
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,870
even forgetting the hatred
for the Japanese for your own son.

555
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,610
I just don't understand

556
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,440
why you put on such airs

557
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,400
right in front of General Hu

558
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,710
at the victory banquet
after the Battle of Guningtou?

559
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,040
Do you take me for a fool?

560
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,980
Fine.

561
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,060
I know I don't have your

562
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,290
vision or ability,

563
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,730
so it's best to have someone capable

564
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,510
handle the inspection
of military equipment on the island.

565
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm just an ordinary,
insignificant person.

566
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,420
Go enjoy your celebration drink.

567
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,390
What more do you want?

568
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,760
Zizhen,

569
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,760
it's hot and unhealthy
in Tainan.

570
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,650
Take care.

571
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,970
Sir,

572
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,900
why was General Chen
in such a bad mood just now?

573
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,910
How is he? Everything okay?

574
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,930
It's nothing.

575
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,240
He came to submit his resignation

576
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,690
to me and the Chief,

577
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,810
asking to go train new recruits in Tainan.

578
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,140
Come on, don't just stand there, drink up.

579
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,070
Alright.

580
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,270
You drink so much,

581
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,450
doesn't it make you feel unwell?

582
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,670
It does.

583
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,470
Bikui,

584
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,120
remember the rules we agreed on?

585
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,840
The second is

586
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,170
no drinking outside.

587
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,690
Alright, alright.

588
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,200
Let's not talk about this now.

589
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,280
Mei came over for dinner.

590
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,200
She's still pretty upset with Nie Xi.

591
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,450
What do you want?

592
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:42,930
I...

593
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,290
I told you before,

594
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,810
when Mei comes over for dinner,

595
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,960
you and I should both apologize to her.

596
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,650
You don't make enough promises, do you?

597
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,870
Actually, when Mei comes,

598
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,430
you, me, and Nie Xi

599
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,080
should all be there.

600
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,450
Yeah, yeah. Here.

601
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,150
Lie down.

602
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,730
Why does Mei seem so upset with Nie Xi?

603
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,090
She said he's been hiding a lot of things
from her.

604
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,719
Hiding a lot?

605
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,230
Like what?

606
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,239
Alright, let's not get into that.

607
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,090
From now on, make sure
Nie Xi comes home on time

608
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,620
and finishes work earlier.

609
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,300
Yuxun,

610
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,170
are you keeping anything from me too?

611
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,489
No.

612
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,210
Not even a tiny little thing?

613
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,570
No.

614
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,630
Tomorrow,
Xue Cheng is transferring schools.

615
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,160
You'll go with me.

616
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,140
Xuecheng.

617
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,780
Xuecheng,

618
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,080
the transfer is for your own good.

619
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,720
You'll understand later.

620
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,860
I don't understand.

621
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,570
Li Yuanzhen was brought here

622
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,090
from Fuzhou by her parents too.

623
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,840
We never wanted to come to Taiwan,

624
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,700
but you all dragged us here.

625
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,970
And another good friend of ours

626
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,140
stayed in Fuzhou.

627
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,070
We don't even know

628
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,530
when we'll see them again.

629
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,800
And now you're going to separate me

630
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,140
from my best friend again.

631
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,600
How is that for my own good?

632
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,400

Bikui,

645
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,340
go tell Xuecheng

646
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,910
she's not transferring anymore.

647
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,110
Sir, you're here.

648
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,490
Today is General Chen's departure day.

649
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,160
Has he still decided to go to Tainan
to train the new recruits?

650
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,720
Yes.

651
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,350
Let's go. I'll see him off.

652
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,440
[Keelung Harbor]

653
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,960
Attention! Salute!

654
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,910
Where were these soldiers recruited from?

655
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,780
General Chen,

656
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,310
these are all student soldiers.

657
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,470
They volunteered to join the army
and serve the country,

658
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,930
to be assigned as reinforcements
to the 201st Youth Division.

659
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,450
Are they all volunteers?

660
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,180
Yes, they all volunteered!

661
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,290
Boy,

662
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,500
do you want to go home?

663
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,940
Don't be afraid.

664
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,270
While I'm here, no one will stop you.

665
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,480
Anyone who wants to go home can leave now.

666
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,080
Go.

667
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,090
Reform the ranks!

668
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,140
General Chen!

669
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,210
General Chen.

670
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,750
Why are you here?

671
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,670
You're leaving today,

672
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,680
and Sir has been thinking of you.

673
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,730
This is a small token from him.

674
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,580
With all the hardships of travel,

675
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,640
he hopes you

676
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,470
and your men

677
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,540
will take good care of
yourselves in Tainan.

678
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,950
Donkey meat burger?

679
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,170
It's the taste of home.

680
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,070
The taste of our hometown.

681
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,550
Sir,

682
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,970
Mr. Chiang just arrived in Chongqing and
asked you to meet with the White Group.

683
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,410
There won't be any major changes,
will there?

684
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,550
Mr. Chiang sees Chongqing as
an anti-Communist stronghold.

685
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,680
He definitely won't give it up easily.

686
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,890
Last time, I suggested that Liu and Deng

687
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,560
might bypass Chongqing

688
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,050
and strike directly at Chengdu;

689
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,360
He actually listened.

690
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,070
He's now moved all of
Hu Zongnan's main forces

691
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,340
to Chengdu,

692
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,120
leaving only the First Army,
long absent from real battle,

693
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,520
to reinforce Chongqing.

694
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,920
That actually works in favor of
liberating Chongqing.

695
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,320
It's a long, mountainous road
from northern Sichuan to Chengdu.

696
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,050
Even if the First Army makes the trip,
it won't make any difference.

697
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,830
Judging from the recent deployments
of the PLA,

698
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,660
Liu and Deng are focusing
all their efforts on wiping out

699
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,860
Song Xilian's corps.

700
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,660
They also do not want them
to fall back to Chongqing

701
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,410
and regroup.

702
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,140
So what we need to do now

703
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,730
is keep Liu and Deng constantly updated

704
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,440
on how much reinforcement Chongqing
can expect from the rear.

705
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,420
Once the new courier arrives,

706
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,070
we will send this deployment out.

707
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,510
Lately, I've almost been

708
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,910
sleeping with the radio.

709
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,000
Don't worry,

710
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,200
I definitely won't miss
any messages from the courier.
