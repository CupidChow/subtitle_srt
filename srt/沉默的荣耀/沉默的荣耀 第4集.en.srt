00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,020
[Silent Honor]

2
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,860
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,210
They're lying in wait—

4
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,640
either for us,

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,780
or for Xie Zhonghao.

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,770
What about him?

7
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,720
Was he arrested?

8
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,750
No trace.

9
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,979
Even the dead drop can't reach him.

10
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,320
We need to find him.

11
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,600
We need to confirm if he's still alive.

12
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,310
How do we do that?

13
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,710
We could check his place.

14
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,040
You've got his address, right?

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,670
If we go there,

16
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,060
at least we might learn something.

17
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,450
No, Sir.

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,419
That's too risky.

19
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,460
We can't just abandon our comrade.

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,870
Who knows how many

21
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,800
BIS agents are watching his place?

22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,270
You were the one who warned me about that.

23
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,200
Speaking of which,

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,829
the Communist line

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,360
really does have its own appeal.

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,650
It's very persuasive, almost enchanting.

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,150
But that's both their strength

28
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,410
and their weakness.

29
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,780
Back in Beiping,

30
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,630
it was those leftists at the universities.

31
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,690
And here in Taiwan,

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,440
it's young men like Liu Kangfu.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,030
But they're different.

34
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,440
Liu Kangfu's generation

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,750
grew up in an environment

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,350
under Japan's push

37
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,340
to imperialize them.

38
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,130
Many of them

39
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,350
ended up in Japanese uniforms,

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,910
sent across

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,130
Japan’s battlefields
throughout Southeast Asia.

42
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,840
So I don't think their professed faith

43
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,440
in communism is genuine.

44
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,410
It's just a way to drive us out.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,470
People like that

46
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,650
are a double-edged sword.

47
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,190
Crush that

48
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,970
fragile faith,

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,060
and

50
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,410
they'll betray steadfasts like Zhang Hao,

51
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,430
and in turn, even more

52
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,660
individuals of higher rank and influence.

53
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,829
Our comrade's fate is unknown,

54
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,620
yet we dare not take any action.

55
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:49,910
I'll go.

56
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,240
I must go.

57
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,120
Sir.

58
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,810
Were you the one who fired first?

59
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,120
Yes.
I failed to keep discipline among my men;

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,390
sorry for alarming you,

61
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,029
Vice Minister.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,250
That's Xie Zhonghao's house up ahead.

63
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,500
Sir, the window looks newly replaced.

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,990
I can see bloodstains beneath it.

65
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,630
Sir, you're back.

66
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,110
Xuecheng.

67
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,300
Dad,

68
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,370
why didn't you knock before coming in?

69
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,680
I did knock.

70
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,390
No, you didn't.

71
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,270
You're just too nervous.
What are you doing?

72
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,740
Nothing. Nothing.

73
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,280
I bought you some candy. Try it.

74
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,420
Why are you tearing my book?

75
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,620
Where did you get this?

76
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,420
A classmate lent me his lecture notes.

77
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,620
Your classmate's notes look like this?

78
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,560
Give it to me.

79
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,120
No!

80
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,330
Xuecheng, give it to me.

81
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,920
Why should I give you my things?

82
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,420
Give it to me!

83
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,940
No!

84
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,560
Xuecheng!

85
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,120
No!

86
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,710
Is that how you talk to your father?

87
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,300
He tore my book!

88
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,560
Give it to me!

89
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,120
No!

90
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,870
Xuecheng,

91
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,030
give it to me.

92
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,860
Are you aware that

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,540
she's been looking at these books and

94
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,740
her classmate's lecture notes like this?

95
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,360
What if something happens because of it?

96
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,430
It's confiscated.

97
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,250
Do not associate with that classmate.

98
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,610
Go to the school tomorrow
to find out what's going on;

99
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,340
if necessary, arrange for her
to be transferred.

100
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,679
Warlord! Coward!

101
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,309
Warlord!

102
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,620
-Xuecheng!
-Coward!

103
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,470
Warlord!

104
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,049
-Stop talking nonsense.
-Coward!

105
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,470
-Xuecheng
-Warlord! Coward!

106
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,850
Warlord!

107
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,940
Yuxun!

108
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,210
Sir.

109
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,670
Yuxun.

110
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,640
Team Leader.

111
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,670
Team Leader.

112
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,620
This time Mr. Wu
was driving the car himself,

113
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,630
with his adjutant in the passenger seat.

114
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,940
I think that's the only suspicious part.

115
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,800
Think about it.

116
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,970
Captain Yu.

117
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,560
I, Wu Shi,

118
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,840
a Vice Minister of Defense,

119
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,600
if I want to drive myself,
is that any of your business?

120
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,460
BIS is overstepping.

121
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,180
If it can't even serve as evidence,

122
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,310
then stop talking.

123
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,800
It's all nonsense.

124
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,100
I actually think it makes sense:

125
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,850
Vice Minister Wu just arrived in Taiwan,
newly appointed.

126
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,250
He went to Keelung
to inspect the defenses,

127
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,300
which makes it perfectly
reasonable for him

128
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,100
to pass by Xie Zhonghao's house—

129
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
seamless.

130
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,290
It's nothing.

131
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,040
Have you been taking the
blood-pressure medicine

132
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,500
I set out for you every day?

133
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,430
I'm asking you—have you taken it?

134
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,710
I did, I took it all.

135
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,730
Speak clearly.

136
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,590
Sometimes I forget.

137
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,670
Is Sir alright?

138
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,190
He fainted. He's inside.

139
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,040
Where's Nie Xi?

140
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,040
I told him to make sure you

141
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,590
take your blood-pressure
medicine every day.

142
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,360
Where is he?

143
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,800
Here!

144
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,400
Here.

145
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,810
Nie Xi,

146
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,080
he's a workaholic.

147
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,610
And you're copying him, aren't you?

148
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,090
If you keep doing this,

149
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,340
how can I trust you in the future?

150
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm sorry, Madam—it was my oversight.

151
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,570
Madam, don't blame Nie Xi.

152
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,660
It's my fault.

153
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,900
Nie Xi, please step outside.

154
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,880
Calm down, Madam.

155
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,160
Come, sit down.

156
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,610
If you want to die,

157
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,760
you can't die in Taiwan.

158
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,290
You must go back to Fuzhou.

159
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,490
I'll die with you.

160
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,640
My parents are in Fuzhou.

161
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,110
They can take care of the children.

162
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,440
Come, my dear.

163
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,350
All right.

164
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll take my medicine on time.

165
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,890
It's not just about
taking medicine on time—

166
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,520
I need to lay down
some ground rules with you.

167
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,510
Please go ahead, my dear.

168
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,710
First,

169
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,740
you must be home before nine every day.

170
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Second,

171
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,850
no drinking outside.

172
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,990
No matter what the children do,

173
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,000
you can't lose your temper.

Also,

175
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,810
if you're sent out on assignment,

176
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,630
you must take me with you.

177
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,720
Wherever you go, I go.

178
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,650
And lastly,

179
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,150
tomorrow you're staying home to rest.

180
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,920
No matter how big the matter,
you're not allowed out.

181
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,090
Dear, that's five rules now.

182
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,940
I don't care how many—

183
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,700
just promise me.

184
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,730
Okay.

185
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,860
I promise you.

186
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,150
I promise you.

187
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,450
Okay.

188
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,380
Okay.

189
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,230
Then… Can I

190
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,940
have one condition?

191
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,730
No conditions allowed.

192
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,280
Fine.

[Hong Kong Hezhong Company]

195
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,880
Ms. Zhu, here's your letter.

196
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,580
It's from Taiwan.

197
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,540
Great! All for me?

198
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,230
This one's yours,

199
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,310
and this one's from my boyfriend to me.

200
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,910
Your boyfriend wrote to you?

201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,060
That's wonderful.

202
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,440
Wait, Ms. Zhu,

203
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,810
why are you so happy today?

204
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,710
I'm going back to Shanghai.

205
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,680
What's wrong?

206
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,110
Nothing.

207
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,600
What's wrong, Deying?

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,260
I can't bear to part with you.

209
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm happy for you, I congratulate you,

210
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,520
-But I don't want to be part with you.
-Alright.

211
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,690
Come on, Deying,

212
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,930
go read your boyfriend's letter.

213
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,710

Dear Mother,

215
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,390
Changcheng and I have arrived in Taipei
with the office.

216
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,980
The baby was born safely—

217
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,100
it's a boy,

218
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,510
and he looks a lot like my father.

219
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,030
Are you still busy in Hong Kong?

220
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,680
If you're free,

221
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,110
Changcheng and I want to
invite you to Taiwan for a short stay.

222
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,490
We miss you very much—Ju.

223
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,900
Chief, you wanted to see me?

224
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,730
Vice Minister Wu has fallen ill.

225
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,230
Go visit him on my behalf.

226
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,430
Prepare a generous gift.

227
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,960
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,010
I heard that

229
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,860
the communist spy who jumped from
a window and died

230
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,580
during the BIS' recent operation
in Keelung

231
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,850
lived right along
Vice Minister Wu's patrol route.

232
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,150
And right after Mr. Wu returned,
he had a hypertensive attack.

233
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,450
What a coincidence.

234
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,550
Check out the background on that spy.

235
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,280
Yes. What about the Vice Minister Wu?

236
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,210
Vice Minister Wu got startled
at NTU Hospital

237
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,450
and has been overworked
with military affairs.

238
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,850
You need to clarify

239
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,630
the cause of his illness.

240
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,530
Yes, I'll go right away.

241
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,210
Please convey my thanks to the Chief.

242
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,900
Chief cares about you a lot.

243
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,410
He sent me to bring
some of your favorite foods.

244
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,869
Thank you, Mrs. Wu.

245
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,380
Please have a seat.

246
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,780
I can handle this myself.

247
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,849
You're too kind,

248
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,310
bringing so many things.

249
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,430
Please thank the Chief for me

250
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,770
for sending you to visit Yuxun.

251

It's my pleasure.

Please sit down.

253
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,190
Alright.

254
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,930
Take your time chatting.

255
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,800
Okay.

256
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,490
Have some tea.

257
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,340
Since I heard about your incident,

258
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,120
I've been extremely worried.

259
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,390
But I didn't dare disturb your rest today,

260
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,610
so I didn't even call.

261
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,100
Now I feel relieved.

262
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,830
What accident could happen to me?

263
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,490
I came back from the battlefield.

264
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,690
I'm not that fragile.

265
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,320
You're

266
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,870
getting all flustered.

267
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,360
Those men under Mao Renfeng

268
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,660
have pulled stunts like this before.

269
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,530
That Communist spy at NTU Hospital—

270
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,290
once he realized he was being watched,

271
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,320
of course he'd take a hostage and run.

272
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,650
You just happened to cross paths with him.

273
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,270
That's normal.

274
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,310
But Gu Zhengwen is like a mad dog—

275
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,110
going after anyone in his way.

276
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,110
Now he's trying to brand you as a spy.

277
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
As far as I know,

278
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,740
Gu Wenzheng

279
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,850
isn't with BIS' operations unit.

280
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,730
He's an external staff member of
the Reconnaissance and Prevention Team.

281
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,900
That team

282
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,190
is a secret branch,

283
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,740
reporting directly to Director Mao—

284
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,480
their office

285
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,160
isn't even in the BIS headquarters.

286
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,090
The innocent have nothing to fear.

287
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,750
Let him go after if he wants to.

288
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,540
I can't stoop to quarreling
with a colonel.

289
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,990
Of course you wouldn't.

290
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,450
But

291
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,600
the one he's slandering

292
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,440
is the Vice Minister
of our Ministry of Defense.

293
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,290
And from what I know,

294
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,530
they're still digging into your visit
to the 318th Division

295
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,900
before it defected.

296
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,470
That falls under

297
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,260
our Second Department's jurisdiction.

298
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,920
If that's the case, he's
offending us as well.

299
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,950
Just say the word,

300
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,710
and I'll take care of it.

301
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,060
What are you planning to do?

302
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,960
That depends on your wishes.

303
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,920
I appreciate your kindness, Director Duan.

304
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,670
But the matter
has already passed some time ago.

305
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,750
Comrade Jianfeng already invited me

306
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,880
for tea about it,

307
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,650
and Director Mao himself
called to apologize.

308
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,050
If I keep pressing,
it wouldn't look right.

309
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,100
You truly are broad-minded.

310
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm ashamed by comparison.

311
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,370
By the way,

312
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,960
the situation at Kinmen is getting tense.

313
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,620
How's your research

314
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,950
on the PLA Third Field Army, Tenth Corps

315
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,490
coming along?

316
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,480
It's in progress.

317
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,050
Our people are actively
infiltrating as well.

318
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,370
But the Communists' political vetting

319
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,490
is brutal,

320
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,450
making our work difficult.

321
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,980
If communist spies
are seeping into our forces,

322
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,290
we should infiltrate theirs in return.

323
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,240
Know your enemy, know yourself.

324
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,060
Yes.

325
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,890
Have some tea.

326
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,770
Wu Shi is sure

327
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Zhou Zhirou is getting suspicious.

328
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,450
Taiwan intelligence line has been severed.

329
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,180
The new courier can't get to
Taiwan anytime soon.

330
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,140
BIS and the Ministry of Defense

331
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,050
had inevitably set up an inescapable web,

332
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,880
waiting for him to slip up.

333
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,540
Would he let the Kinmen intelligence
go to waste

334
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,640
and watch the PLA die in vain?

335
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,970
Wu Shi chose to step into the game.

336
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,260
If Zhou Zhirou wanted proof,

337
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,680
he would give him a flaw.

338
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,540
That flaw

339
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,800
was Hong Kong.

340
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,520
Cigarettes! All brands available!

341
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,370
Would you like cigarettes, sir?

342
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,250
Boss.

343
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,080
Don't look back again.

344
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,970
This man might be Xie Zhonghao.

345
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,780
Take him alive.

346
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,340
Good morning, Adjutant Nie.

347
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,200
Morning, Qian.

348
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,940
Haven't had breakfast yet?

349
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,540
Have some.

350
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,720
After washing the car, take a break.

351
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,640
I'll drive Sir.

352
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,050
Adjutant Nie,

353
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,130
you always finish my work for me.

354
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,350
Will they dock my pay for that?

355
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,320
Don't worry about it.

356
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,460
Isn't it nice to get some rest?

357
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,260
Adjutant Nie,

358
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,180
let me wash your car too.

359
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,550
Sure, thanks.

360
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,770
Sir.

361
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,560
Come in.

362
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,600
Here are the minutes from today's
Ministry of Defense meeting—

363
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,530
for your review.

364
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,550
Chief Zhou said your health comes first

365
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,350
and approved two extra days off.

366
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,180
I can't rest.

367
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,380
I must go to Hong Kong myself.

368
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,930
To Hong Kong?

369
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,050
What would you do there
at a time like this?

370
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,510
To deliver intelligence.

371
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,660
The Kinmen battle is
on the verge of breaking out;

372
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,030
if we wait for a new courier
to reach Taiwan,

373
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,090
it will be too late.

374
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,090
Going to Hong Kong to find Manager Wan

375
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,140
is the fastest way to
get the intel through.

376
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,510
Now BIS knows

377
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,750
our courier is dead

378
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,840
and the line is cut.

379
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,580
Anyone going to or from Taiwan

380
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,240
will be under close scrutiny.

381
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,410
And you're a prime suspect.

382
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,790
If you go to Hong Kong now,

383
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,250
wouldn't that be
walking straight into a trap?

384
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,210
Not just BIS,

385
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,960
Duan Tuizhi has been probing me too,

386
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
about my trip to the 318th Division.

387
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,930
Then all the more reason you can't go.

388
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,630
Both departments are eyeing you closely.

389
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,230
They don't have
hard evidence against you yet.

390
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,340
I'll give them the evidence.

391
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,100
Hand this military aid allocation plan

392
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,400
to the Ministry of Defense for review.

393
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,050
You're gambling that the Americans
will be satisfied with the plan

394
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,010
and then send you to Hong Kong
to make the handoff?

395
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:38,510
Yes.

396
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,410
Because they need evidence.

397
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,680
So Zhou Zhirou will definitely
send me to Hong Kong.

398
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,200
General Walker

399
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,430
keeps pressing me to arrange the handover.

400
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,860
He holds the rank
of Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army.

401
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,180
So our representative

402
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,590
can't be of lower rank than that.

403
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,640
Who do you think

404
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,680
is most suitable?

405
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,740
Who do I think is most suitable?

406
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,050
In my mind,

407
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,010
there are only three possible candidates.

408
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,610
First, General Sun Liren.

409
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,580
When he was with
the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India,

410
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,150
he had many dealings with the Americans.

411
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,210
The U.S. military still
holds a good impression of him.

412
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,880
Second,

413
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,580
apart from General Sun,

414
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,510
the one with the most interactions
with the Americans

415
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,290
is Deputy Commissioner Lin Wei

416
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,840
of the Southeast Office.

417
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,470
And the third person?

418
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,740
The third one

419
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,760
is you, Chief.

420
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,170
If you were to personally take the lead,

421
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,480
it would truly show
our respect for our allies.

422
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,510
Impossible. The battle for Kinmen
is about to erupt,

423
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,010
and Chongqing is also in danger.

424
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,450
Zhou Zhirou is the Air Force Commander—

425
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,710
there's no way he could abandon his post.

426
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,270
General Sun, though,

427
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,610
is indeed a suitable candidate.

428
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,710
He studied in the U.S. and
enjoys deep trust from the Americans.

429
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,470
But there was once a rumor circulating

430
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,390
that the U.S. military wanted to
use General Sun

431
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,630
to replace the President.

432
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,230
I'd say,

433
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,660
right now, the last thing
the President wants to see

434
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,590
is General Sun getting
too close to the Americans.

435
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,920
As for Weiwen,

436
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,700
back during the Expeditionary Force days,

437
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,180
he was caught
between the President and Stilwell,

438
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,180
and the relationship soured badly.

439
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,550
Even though Stilwell
isn't around this time,

440
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,440
I doubt the Americans

441
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,900
would welcome him either.

442
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,660
Then honestly, I can't think of

443
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,520
anyone else who's more suitable.

444
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,660
As you know,

445
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,840
personnel matters aren't my strong suit.

446
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,660
I think I understand now.

447
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,210
So you're suggesting that

448
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,410
Zhou Zhirou appears respectful to you,

449
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,380
but what he really wants is evidence

450
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,500
to find out whether you're a Communist.

451
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,830
So he'll definitely send you to Hong Kong.

452
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,800
So this is my only chance.

453
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,740
My brother told me before he left

454
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,470
that they must see me in person
in Hong Kong

455
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,400
to make contact.

456
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,770
Send it out first.

457
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,630
I don't care about
the consequences anymore.

458
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,550
[Yongchun]

459
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,540
Wan.

460
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
Comrade Zhu Feng.

461
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,400
What's wrong?

462
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,740
You don't seem in high spirits.

463
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,150
Maybe I've been too busy lately.

464
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,470
Did you need something?

465
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:17,970
Yes.

466
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,040
I want to show you something.

467
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,010
I want to know

468
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,440
if this could be useful to you.

469
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,010
A special pass?

470
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,410
Issued by the
Taiwan Provincial Police Department?

471
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:34,970
Yes.

472
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,130
How did you get this?

473
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,050
My adopted daughter Ju is in Taiwan.

474
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,100
My son-in-law is the director

475
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,230
of the Provincial Police Department.

476
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,140
I remember you once reported

477
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,860
about their plans to go to Taiwan.

478
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,580
Yes.

479
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,320
Ju invited me to Taiwan,

480
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,190
but now I need to return to Shanghai.

481
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,530
So this special pass

482
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,510
is of no use to me anymore.

483
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,980
I thought it might
be useful to you, right?

484
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,180
Of course.

485
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,170
You know,

486
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,180
back then, as long as we wanted,

487
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
there was no city we couldn't enter.

488
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,600
We even sent quite a few cadres to Taiwan.

489
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,640
But now, with the White Terror
in Taiwan being so severe,

490
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,970
and the provincial chairman Chen Cheng

491
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,230
having imposed martial law again in May,

492
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,340
sending someone to Taiwan now

493
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,920
is extremely difficult.

494
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,010
With this special pass,

495
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,600
we can make replicas.

496
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,980
Actually, if you needed it,

497
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,760
you could have told me earlier.

498
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,290
I could have asked Ju to get one for us.

499
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,190
Look,

500
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,690
the pass

501
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,600
has the issuing authority

502
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,270
and the exact home address.

503
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,130
If you ask them for it and then don't go,

504
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,260
it could cause trouble for the family,

505
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,650
and visitors can't stay there

506
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,940
or they'll be exposed.

507
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,050
Now that they're sending it over,

508
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,430
things are much easier.

509
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Comrade Zhu Feng,

510
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,010
I thank you on behalf of the Party.

511
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,470
I'm glad it can be of use.

512
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,670
I'll keep this special pass

513
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,680
for you.

514
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,770
It will definitely be very useful.

515
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,400
Dear Chief Zhou,

516
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,360
we're very satisfied with
the new military assistance plan

517
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,360
recently sent by your department.

518
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,050
We can properly send personnel
to Hong Kong

519
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,180
to complete the handover procedures.

520
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,510
Best regards, James Walker.

521
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,240
You may go now.

522
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,770
Please ask Director Duan to come in.

523
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,420
Yes.

524
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,120
Chief.

525
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,290
You wanted to see me?

526
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,190
You went to visit Vice Minister Wu;

527
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,100
how is he?

528
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,940
He looks a bit weaker than usual,

529
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,450
but generally fine.

530
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,750
I conveyed your concerns to him.

531
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,080
Tell him to rest more

532
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,480
and not worry about work.

533
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,890
Has BIS

534
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,380
made any new moves recently?

535
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,450
A report from my mole inside BIS:

536
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,380
Gu Zhengwen believes that

537
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,190
the person who was supposed to
make contact with Zhang Hao

538
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,550
suddenly lost connection.

539
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,170
They will surely establish
a new communication line,

540
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,420
so recently they've been
strictly investigating

541
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,440
people coming out of Taiwan.

542
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,690
Go back and keep watching.

543
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:24,710
Yes!

544
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,590
Chief.

545
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:09,450
Okay.

546
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,190
Senior.

547
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,140
Chief.

548
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,500
How are you?

549
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,000
Feeling any better?

550
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,180
Much better.

551
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,520
My wife has been taking care of me.

552
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,310
Your blood pressure still won't come down,

553
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,160
that's a real problem.

554
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,860
How about

555
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,550
I find you a good American doctor

556
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,550
-to take a good look at you.
-No need.

557
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,820
I just need to
take my medication regularly.

558
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,080
It's nothing serious.

559
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,120
Work is important,

560
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,300
but you must take care of your health too.

561
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,719
Chief, what did you call me here for?

562
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,550
Did you draft this allocation plan

563
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,409
yourself?

564
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,719
Yes, I did.

565
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,280
With the Ministry of Defense so busy,

566
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,489
they told me to
rest at home and do nothing.

567
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:28,889
But that makes me uneasy.

568
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,389
Besides, I know

569
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,070
the Americans
have been waiting for this plan

570
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,159
for a long time.

571
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,850
So I wanted to help ease your burden.

572
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,489
You're my senior;

573
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,120
I should naturally come to you

574
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,679
for advice and strategies.

575
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,010
I've reviewed this plan;

576
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,050
it's very thorough.

577
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,100
Did they respond yet?

578
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,980
They did. Not a single word was changed.

579
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,449
It's been approved.

580
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,030
Well, that's excellent news.

581
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,760
It'll help ease
the urgent situation in Kinmen.

582
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,380
If there's nothing else,

583
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,840
I'll head back now, Chief.

584
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,550
Senior, don't rush off.

585
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,320
Come.

586
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,730
General Walker

587
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,410
has been urging me

588
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,610
to arrange the handover.

589
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,490
He holds the rank
of Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army.

590
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,730
So our representative

591
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,410
can't be of lower rank than that.

592
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,530
Senior,

593
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,740
since this allocation plan

594
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,170
was written by you personally,

595
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,030
I think you should go yourself.

596
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,030
I can't.

597
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,390
First, I'm terrible
at social interactions.

598
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,430
Second, with my health the way it is—

599
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,490
just last night my blood pressure spiked

600
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,420
close to 200.

601
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,960
My wife scolded me terribly for it.

602
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,090
If I get sick again in Hong Kong,

603
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,170
wouldn't that
jeopardize the whole mission?

604
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,420
That's not a problem.

605
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,700
The medical facilities in Hong Kong

606
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,410
are far better than in Taiwan.

607
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,010
If you could make the trip,

608
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,320
I'd assign a military doctor

609
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,220
to accompany you the entire time

610
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,550
to guarantee nothing would go wrong.

611
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,420
Chief, I cannot go.

612
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,240
BIS suspects me

613
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,390
because of the Taiwan University incident.

614
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,720
They're now strictly monitoring
everyone leaving Taiwan.

615
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,370
If I really go,

616
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,070
it might give others
something to criticize.

617
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
That's true.

618
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,010
Chief, if there's nothing else,

619
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,290
I'll take my leave now.

620
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,270
Senior.

621
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,820
Senior.

622
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,500
I've been thinking it over,

623
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,120
and you're still the most suitable person.

624
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,270
Our Ministry of Defense
is going on an official trip—

625
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,530
surely we don't need to bow to BIS' whims.

626
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,560
Senior, don't worry.

627
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,010
You're being sent by me personally.

628
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,850
If they dare cause trouble,
they can come to me.

629
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:26,730
Besides,

630
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,510
you've already helped me

631
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,090
finalize this plan.

632
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,860
You must help me
see it through to the end.

633
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,130
It's settled then.

634
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,280
Senior, you'll depart tomorrow.

635
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,070
Yes.

636
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,450
I won't let you down.

637
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,810
Thank you for your help.

638
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,380
Director Duan.

639
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,500
Chief Zhou.

640
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,790
Vice Minister Wu
is heading to Hong Kong tomorrow

641
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,790
regarding U.S. military aid.

642
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,010
Your Second Department
must send someone along.

643
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:30,700
Remember,

644
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,440
make sure you complete your assigned task.

645
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,050
Understood.

646
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,490
Finish your current work quickly.

647
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,440
Then prepare to take delivery of

648
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,350
the American aid documents.

649
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,350
We leave tomorrow

650
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,280
To Hong Kong?

651
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:47,900
Yes.

652
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,570
I'll accompany you home
to pack your things.

653
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,500
What's wrong, Sir?

654
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
I can't go in.

655
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,450
I just remembered

656
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,850
a few days ago my wife
made me agree to five rules.

657
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,740
I promised her.

658
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,820
One of them was that

659
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,950
whenever I travel on business,
I must take her along.

660
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,420
What kind of rules?

661
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,820
Basically, wherever I go,
she insists on going with me.

662
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,530
But this trip to Hong Kong
isn't an ordinary assignment,

663
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,490
I can't take her with me.

664
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,750
What should we do then?

665
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,780
How about this:

666
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,840
tell Madam that

667
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,400
the Ministry of Defense
has urgent duties these days,

668
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,810
and that I'll be staying at the office.

669
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,780
Just bring me a few changes of clothes.

670
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,310
Alright.

671
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,700
So what do you need me to bring?

672
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,790
A suit.

673
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,420
A suit… Okay.

674
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,300
And two pairs of leather shoes.

675
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,050
Two pairs of leather shoes… Got it.

676
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,840
And my dress uniform.

677
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,380
Dress uniform… Okay.

678
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:57,590
That's all.

679
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,250
But Madam will definitely ask

680
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,440
why would you need a suit
just for working late at the Ministry?

681
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,160
Just tell her the Ministry
might have some gatherings these days.

682
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,050
Gatherings… Alright.

683
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,010
And the two pairs of shoes?

684
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,900
Just say you don't know

685
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,500
which pair I'll find more suitable.

686
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,440
And what about the dress uniform?

687
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,310
Tell her

688
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,400
I've lost some weight recently

689
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
and need to take the uniform

690
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,300
to the military headquarters
for alterations.

691
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:19,720
Okay.

692
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,400
Sir.

693
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,110
Nie Xi.

694
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,170
Madam.

695
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,840
Why are you here so late?

696
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,860
Is something wrong?

697
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,790
Come in quickly.

698
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
I'm here to get some clothes for Sir.

699
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,920
Clothes? Where is he?

700
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,420
He's still at the Ministry of Defense.

701
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,460
There's an urgent military matter,

702
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,590
so he needs to stay there for a few days.

703
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,470
Alright.

704
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,010
Dou!

705
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,490
Dou!

706
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,420
Get the suitcase ready.

707
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,450
Yes, Madam.

708
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,890
Why bring a suit?

709
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,140
The Ministry might
hold a reception this weekend.

710
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,450
So is he staying just
a few days or for a whole month?

711
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,510
Should I pack up the entire bedding too?

712
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,910
That won't be necessary.

713
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,320
Take these leather shoes.
They go with everything.

714
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,350
Alright, I'll pack them.

715
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,780
And a military dress uniform.

716
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,260
A dress uniform?

717
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,490
For working late at the Ministry?

718
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,840
He said he's recently put on weight—
no, lost weight—

719
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,370
and needs to have it altered
at headquarters.

720
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:41,950
Okay.

721
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,670
Madam, one suitcase is enough.

722
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,720
He promised me

723
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,980
wherever he goes, I go.

724
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,350
I'm coming with you to the Ministry.

725
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,450
Please don't.

726
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,440
Wait a moment.

727
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,840
Madam.

728
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,570
What's wrong? Let's go.

729
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,430
No, it's not...

730
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,740
I...

731
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,520
What's going on?

732
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,740
Dear.

733
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,810
Why are you here?

734
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,030
Here I am.

735
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,480
Nie Xi said you were working late
at the Ministry of Defense.

736
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,570
Not anymore.

737
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,960
Let's talk inside.

738
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,260
Let me take that.

739
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,950
You go back first.

740
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,340
Okay.
