00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,020
[Silent Honor]

2
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,860
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,210
They're lying in wait—

4
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,640
either for us,

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,780
or for Xie Zhonghao.

6
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,770
What about him?

7
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,720
Was he arrested?

8
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,750
No trace.

9
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,979
Even the dead drop can't reach him.

10
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,320
We need to find him.

11
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,600
We need to confirm if he's still alive.

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,310
How do we do that?

13
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,710
We could check his place.

14
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,040
You've got his address, right?

15
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,670
If we go there,

16
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,060
at least we might learn something.

17
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,450
No, Sir.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,419
That's too risky.

19
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,460
We can't just abandon our comrade.

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,870
Who knows how many

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,800
BIS agents are watching his place?

22
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,270
You were the one who warned me about that.

23
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,200
Speaking of which,

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,829
the Communist line

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,360
really does have its own appeal.

26
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,650
It's very persuasive, almost enchanting.

27
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,150
But that's both their strength

28
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,410
and their weakness.

29
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,780
Back in Beiping,

30
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,630
it was those leftists at the universities.

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,690
And here in Taiwan,

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,440
it's young men like Liu Kangfu.

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,030
But they're different.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,440
Liu Kangfu's generation

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,750
grew up in an environment

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,350
under Japan's push

37
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,340
to imperialize them.

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,130
Many of them

39
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,350
ended up in Japanese uniforms,

40
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,910
sent across

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,130
Japan’s battlefields
throughout Southeast Asia.

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,840
So I don't think their professed faith

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,440
in communism is genuine.

44
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,410
It's just a way to drive us out.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,470
People like that

46
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,650
are a double-edged sword.

47
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,190
Crush that

48
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,970
fragile faith,

49
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,060
and

50
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,410
they'll betray steadfasts like Zhang Hao,

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,430
and in turn, even more

52
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,660
individuals of higher rank and influence.

53
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,829
Our comrade's fate is unknown,

54
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,620
yet we dare not take any action.

55
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:54,910
I'll go.

56
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,240
I must go.

57
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,120
Sir.

58
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,810
Were you the one who fired first?

59
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,120
Yes.
I failed to keep discipline among my men;

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,390
sorry for alarming you,

61
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,029
Vice Minister.

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,250
That's Xie Zhonghao's house up ahead.

63
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,500
Sir, the window looks newly replaced.

64
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,990
I can see bloodstains beneath it.

65
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,630
Sir, you're back.

66
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,110
Xuecheng.

67
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,300
Dad,

68
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,370
why didn't you knock before coming in?

69
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,680
I did knock.

70
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,390
No, you didn't.

71
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,270
You're just too nervous.
What are you doing?

72
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,740
Nothing. Nothing.

73
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,280
I bought you some candy. Try it.

74
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,420
Why are you tearing my book?

75
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,620
Where did you get this?

76
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,420
A classmate lent me his lecture notes.

77
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,620
Your classmate's notes look like this?

78
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,560
Give it to me.

79
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,120
No!

80
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,330
Xuecheng, give it to me.

81
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,920
Why should I give you my things?

82
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,420
Give it to me!

83
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,940
No!

84
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,560
Xuecheng!

85
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,120
No!

86
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,710
Is that how you talk to your father?

87
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,300
He tore my book!

88
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,560
Give it to me!

89
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,120
No!

90
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,870
Xuecheng,

91
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,030
give it to me.

92
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,860
Are you aware that

93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,540
she's been looking at these books and

94
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,740
her classmate's lecture notes like this?

95
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,360
What if something happens because of it?

96
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,430
It's confiscated.

97
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,250
Do not associate with that classmate.

98
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,610
Go to the school tomorrow
to find out what's going on;

99
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,340
if necessary, arrange for her
to be transferred.

100
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,679
Warlord! Coward!

101
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,309
Warlord!

102
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,620
-Xuecheng!
-Coward!

103
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,470
Warlord!

104
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,049
-Stop talking nonsense.
-Coward!

105
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,470
-Xuecheng
-Warlord! Coward!

106
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,850
Warlord!

107
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,940
Yuxun!

108
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,210
Sir.

109
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,670
Yuxun.

110
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,640
Team Leader.

111
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,670
Team Leader.

112
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,620
This time Mr. Wu
was driving the car himself,

113
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,630
with his adjutant in the passenger seat.

114
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,940
I think that's the only suspicious part.

115
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,800
Think about it.

116
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,970
Captain Yu.

117
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,560
I, Wu Shi,

118
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,840
a Vice Minister of Defense,

119
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,600
if I want to drive myself,
is that any of your business?

120
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,460
BIS is overstepping.

121
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,180
If it can't even serve as evidence,

122
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,310
then stop talking.

123
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,800
It's all nonsense.

124
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,100
I actually think it makes sense:

125
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,850
Vice Minister Wu just arrived in Taiwan,
newly appointed.

126
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,250
He went to Keelung
to inspect the defenses,

127
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,300
which makes it perfectly
reasonable for him

128
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,100
to pass by Xie Zhonghao's house—

129
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,680
seamless.

130
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,290
It's nothing.

131
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,040
Have you been taking the
blood-pressure medicine

132
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,500
I set out for you every day?

133
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,430
I'm asking you—have you taken it?

134
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,710
I did, I took it all.

135
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,730
Speak clearly.

136
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,590
Sometimes I forget.

137
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,670
Is Sir alright?

138
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,190
He fainted. He's inside.

139
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,040
Where's Nie Xi?

140
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,040
I told him to make sure you

141
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,590
take your blood-pressure
medicine every day.

142
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,360
Where is he?

143
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,800
Here!

144
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,400
Here.

145
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,810
Nie Xi,

146
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,080
he's a workaholic.

147
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,610
And you're copying him, aren't you?

148
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,090
If you keep doing this,

149
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,340
how can I trust you in the future?

150
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm sorry, Madam—it was my oversight.

151
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,570
Madam, don't blame Nie Xi.

152
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,660
It's my fault.

153
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,900
Nie Xi, please step outside.

154
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,880
Calm down, Madam.

155
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,160
Come, sit down.

156
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,610
If you want to die,

157
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,760
you can't die in Taiwan.

158
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,290
You must go back to Fuzhou.

159
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,490
I'll die with you.

160
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,640
My parents are in Fuzhou.

161
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,110
They can take care of the children.

162
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,440
Come, my dear.

163
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,350
All right.

164
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,520
I'll take my medicine on time.

165
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,890
It's not just about
taking medicine on time—

166
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,520
I need to lay down
some ground rules with you.

167
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,510
Please go ahead, my dear.

168
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,710
First,

169
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,740
you must be home before nine every day.

170
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,380
Second,

171
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,850
no drinking outside.

172
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,990
No matter what the children do,

173
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,000
you can't lose your temper.

Also,

175
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,810
if you're sent out on assignment,

176
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,630
you must take me with you.

177
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,720
Wherever you go, I go.

178
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,650
And lastly,

179
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,150
tomorrow you're staying home to rest.

180
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,920
No matter how big the matter,
you're not allowed out.

181
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,090
Dear, that's five rules now.

182
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,940
I don't care how many—

183
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,700
just promise me.

184
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,730
Okay.

185
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,860
I promise you.

186
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,150
I promise you.

187
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,450
Okay.

188
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,380
Okay.

189
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,230
Then… Can I

190
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,940
have one condition?

191
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,730
No conditions allowed.

192
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,280
Fine.

[Hong Kong Hezhong Company]

195
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,880
Ms. Zhu, here's your letter.

196
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,580
It's from Taiwan.

197
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,540
Great! All for me?

198
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,230
This one's yours,

199
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,310
and this one's from my boyfriend to me.

200
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,910
Your boyfriend wrote to you?

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,060
That's wonderful.

202
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,440
Wait, Ms. Zhu,

203
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,810
why are you so happy today?

204
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,710
I'm going back to Shanghai.

205
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,680
What's wrong?

206
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,110
Nothing.

What's wrong, Deying?

I can't bear to part with you.

209
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,940
I'm happy for you, I congratulate you,

210
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,520
-But I don't want to be part with you.
-Alright.

211
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,690
Come on, Deying,

212
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,930
go read your boyfriend's letter.

Dear Mother,

215
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,390
Changcheng and I have arrived in Taipei
with the office.

216
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,980
The baby was born safely—

217
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,100
it's a boy,

218
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,510
and he looks a lot like my father.

219
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,030
Are you still busy in Hong Kong?

220
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,680
If you're free,

221
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,110
Changcheng and I want to
invite you to Taiwan for a short stay.

222
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,490
We miss you very much—Ju.

223
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,900
Chief, you wanted to see me?

224
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,730
Vice Minister Wu has fallen ill.

225
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,230
Go visit him on my behalf.

226
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,430
Prepare a generous gift.

227
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:28,960
Yes, sir.

228
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,010
I heard that

229
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,860
the communist spy who jumped from
a window and died

230
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,580
during the BIS' recent operation
in Keelung

231
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,850
lived right along
Vice Minister Wu's patrol route.

232
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,150
And right after Mr. Wu returned,
he had a hypertensive attack.

233
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,450
What a coincidence.

234
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,550
Check out the background on that spy.

235
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,280
Yes. What about the Vice Minister Wu?

236
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,210
Vice Minister Wu got startled
at NTU Hospital

237
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,450
and has been overworked
with military affairs.

238
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,850
You need to clarify

239
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,630
the cause of his illness.

240
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,530
Yes, I'll go right away.

241
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,210
Please convey my thanks to the Chief.

242
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,900
Chief cares about you a lot.

243
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,410
He sent me to bring
some of your favorite foods.

244

Thank you, Mrs. Wu.

245
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:30,380
Please have a seat.

246
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,780
I can handle this myself.

247
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,849
You're too kind,

248
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:34,310
bringing so many things.

249
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,430
Please thank the Chief for me

250
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,770
for sending you to visit Yuxun.

251

It's my pleasure.

Please sit down.

253
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,190
Alright.

254
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,930
Take your time chatting.

255
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,800
Okay.

256
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,490
Have some tea.

257
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,340
Since I heard about your incident,

258
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,120
I've been extremely worried.

259
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,390
But I didn't dare disturb your rest today,

260
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,610
so I didn't even call.

261
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,100
Now I feel relieved.

262
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,830
What accident could happen to me?

263
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,490
I came back from the battlefield.

264
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,690
I'm not that fragile.

265
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,320
You're

266
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,870
getting all flustered.

267
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,360
Those men under Mao Renfeng

268
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,660
have pulled stunts like this before.

269
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,530
That Communist spy at NTU Hospital—

270
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,290
once he realized he was being watched,

271
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,320
of course he'd take a hostage and run.

272
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,650
You just happened to cross paths with him.

273
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,270
That's normal.

274
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,310
But Gu Zhengwen is like a mad dog—

275
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,110
going after anyone in his way.

276
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,110
Now he's trying to brand you as a spy.

277
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
As far as I know,

278
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,740
Gu Wenzheng

279
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,850
isn't with BIS' operations unit.

280
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,730
He's an external staff member of
the Reconnaissance and Prevention Team.

281
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,900
That team

282
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,190
is a secret branch,

283
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,740
reporting directly to Director Mao—

284
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,480
their office

285
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,160
isn't even in the BIS headquarters.

286
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,090
The innocent have nothing to fear.

287
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,750
Let him go after if he wants to.

288
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,540
I can't stoop to quarreling
with a colonel.

289
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,990
Of course you wouldn't.

290
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,450
But

291
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,600
the one he's slandering

292
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,440
is the Vice Minister
of our Ministry of Defense.

293
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,290
And from what I know,

294
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,530
they're still digging into your visit
to the 318th Division

295
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,900
before it defected.

296
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,470
That falls under

297
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,260
our Second Department's jurisdiction.

298
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,920
If that's the case, he's
offending us as well.

299
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,950
Just say the word,

300
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,710
and I'll take care of it.

301
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,060
What are you planning to do?

302
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
That depends on your wishes.

303
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,920
I appreciate your kindness, Director Duan.

304
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,670
But the matter
has already passed some time ago.

305
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,750
Comrade Jianfeng already invited me

306
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,880
for tea about it,

307
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,650
and Director Mao himself
called to apologize.

308
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,050
If I keep pressing,
it wouldn't look right.

309
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,100
You truly are broad-minded.

310
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm ashamed by comparison.

311
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,370
By the way,

312
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,960
the situation at Kinmen is getting tense.

313
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,620
How's your research

314
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,950
on the PLA Third Field Army, Tenth Corps

315
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,490
coming along?

316
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,480
It's in progress.

317
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,050
Our people are actively
infiltrating as well.

318
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,370
But the Communists' political vetting

319
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,490
is brutal,

320
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,450
making our work difficult.

321
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,980
If communist spies
are seeping into our forces,

322
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,290
we should infiltrate theirs in return.

323
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,240
Know your enemy, know yourself.

324
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,060
Yes.

325
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,890
Have some tea.

326
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,770
Wu Shi is sure

327
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Zhou Zhirou is getting suspicious.

328
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,450
Taiwan intelligence line has been severed.

329
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,180
The new courier can't get to
Taiwan anytime soon.

330
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,140
BIS and the Ministry of Defense

331
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,050
had inevitably set up an inescapable web,

332
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,880
waiting for him to slip up.

333
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,540
Would he let the Kinmen intelligence
go to waste

334
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,640
and watch the PLA die in vain?

335
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,970
Wu Shi chose to step into the game.

336
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,260
If Zhou Zhirou wanted proof,

337
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,680
he would give him a flaw.

338
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,540
That flaw

339
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,800
was Hong Kong.

340
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,520
Cigarettes! All brands available!

341
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,370
Would you like cigarettes, sir?

342
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,250
Boss.

343
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,080
Don't look back again.

344
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,970
This man might be Xie Zhonghao.

345
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,780
Take him alive.

346
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,340
Good morning, Adjutant Nie.

347
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,200
Morning, Qian.

348
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,940
Haven't had breakfast yet?

349
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,540
Have some.

350
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,720
After washing the car, take a break.

351
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,640
I'll drive Sir.

352
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,050
Adjutant Nie,

353
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,130
you always finish my work for me.

354
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,350
Will they dock my pay for that?

355
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,320
Don't worry about it.

356
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,460
Isn't it nice to get some rest?

357
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,260
Adjutant Nie,

358
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,180
let me wash your car too.

359
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,550
Sure, thanks.

360
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,770
Sir.

361
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,560
Come in.

362
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,600
Here are the minutes from today's
Ministry of Defense meeting—

363
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,530
for your review.

364
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,550
Chief Zhou said your health comes first

365
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,350
and approved two extra days off.

366
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,180
I can't rest.

367
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,380
I must go to Hong Kong myself.

368
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,930
To Hong Kong?

369
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,050
What would you do there
at a time like this?

370
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,510
To deliver intelligence.

371
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,660
The Kinmen battle is
on the verge of breaking out;

372
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,030
if we wait for a new courier
to reach Taiwan,

373
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,090
it will be too late.

374
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,090
Going to Hong Kong to find Manager Wan

375
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,140
is the fastest way to
get the intel through.

376
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,510
Now BIS knows

377
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,750
our courier is dead

378
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,840
and the line is cut.

379
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,580
Anyone going to or from Taiwan

380
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,240
will be under close scrutiny.

381
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,410
And you're a prime suspect.

382
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,790
If you go to Hong Kong now,

383
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,250
wouldn't that be
walking straight into a trap?

384
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,210
Not just BIS,

385
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,960
Duan Tuizhi has been probing me too,

386
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
about my trip to the 318th Division.

387
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,930
Then all the more reason you can't go.

388
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,630
Both departments are eyeing you closely.

389
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,230
They don't have
hard evidence against you yet.

390
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,340
I'll give them the evidence.

391
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,100
Hand this military aid allocation plan

392
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,400
to the Ministry of Defense for review.

393
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,050
You're gambling that the Americans
will be satisfied with the plan

394
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,010
and then send you to Hong Kong
to make the handoff?

395
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,510
Yes.

396
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,410
Because they need evidence.

397
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,680
So Zhou Zhirou will definitely
send me to Hong Kong.

398
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,200
General Walker

399
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,430
keeps pressing me to arrange the handover.

400
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,860
He holds the rank
of Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army.

401
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,180
So our representative

402
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,590
can't be of lower rank than that.

403
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,640
Who do you think

404
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,680
is most suitable?

405
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,740
Who do I think is most suitable?

406
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,050
In my mind,

407
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,010
there are only three possible candidates.

408
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,610
First, General Sun Liren.

409
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,580
When he was with
the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India,

410
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,150
he had many dealings with the Americans.

411
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,210
The U.S. military still
holds a good impression of him.

412
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,880
Second,

413
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,580
apart from General Sun,

414
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,510
the one with the most interactions
with the Americans

415
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,290
is Deputy Commissioner Lin Wei

416
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,840
of the Southeast Office.

417
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,470
And the third person?

418
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,740
The third one

419
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,760
is you, Chief.

420
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,170
If you were to personally take the lead,

421
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,480
it would truly show
our respect for our allies.

422
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,510
Impossible. The battle for Kinmen
is about to erupt,

423
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,010
and Chongqing is also in danger.

424
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,450
Zhou Zhirou is the Air Force Commander—

425
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,710
there's no way he could abandon his post.

426
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,270
General Sun, though,

427
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,610
is indeed a suitable candidate.

428
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,710
He studied in the U.S. and
enjoys deep trust from the Americans.

429
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,470
But there was once a rumor circulating

430
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,390
that the U.S. military wanted to
use General Sun

431
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,630
to replace the President.

432
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,230
I'd say,

433
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,660
right now, the last thing
the President wants to see

434
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,590
is General Sun getting
too close to the Americans.

435
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,920
As for Weiwen,

436
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,700
back during the Expeditionary Force days,

437
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,180
he was caught
between the President and Stilwell,

438
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
and the relationship soured badly.

439
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,550
Even though Stilwell
isn't around this time,

440
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,440
I doubt the Americans

441
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,900
would welcome him either.

442
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,660
Then honestly, I can't think of

443
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,520
anyone else who's more suitable.

444
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,660
As you know,

445
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,840
personnel matters aren't my strong suit.

446
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,660
I think I understand now.

447
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,210
So you're suggesting that

448
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,410
Zhou Zhirou appears respectful to you,

449
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,380
but what he really wants is evidence

450
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,500
to find out whether you're a Communist.

451
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,830
So he'll definitely send you to Hong Kong.

452
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,800
So this is my only chance.

453
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,740
My brother told me before he left

454
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,470
that they must see me in person
in Hong Kong

455
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,400
to make contact.

456
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,770
Send it out first.

457
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,630
I don't care about
the consequences anymore.

458
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,550
[Yongchun]

459
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,540
Wan.

460
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Comrade Zhu Feng.

461
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,400
What's wrong?

462
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,740
You don't seem in high spirits.

463
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,150
Maybe I've been too busy lately.

464
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,470
Did you need something?

465
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,970
Yes.

466
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,040
I want to show you something.

467
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,010
I want to know

468
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,440
if this could be useful to you.

469
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,010
A special pass?

470
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,410
Issued by the
Taiwan Provincial Police Department?

471
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,970
Yes.

472
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,130
How did you get this?

473
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,050
My adopted daughter Ju is in Taiwan.

474
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,100
My son-in-law is the director

475
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,230
of the Provincial Police Department.

476
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,140
I remember you once reported

477
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,860
about their plans to go to Taiwan.

478
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,580
Yes.

479
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,320
Ju invited me to Taiwan,

480
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,190
but now I need to return to Shanghai.

481
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,530
So this special pass

482
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,510
is of no use to me anymore.

483
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,980
I thought it might
be useful to you, right?

484
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,180
Of course.

485
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,170
You know,

486
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,180
back then, as long as we wanted,

487
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
there was no city we couldn't enter.

488
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,600
We even sent quite a few cadres to Taiwan.

489
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,640
But now, with the White Terror
in Taiwan being so severe,

490
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,970
and the provincial chairman Chen Cheng

491
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,230
having imposed martial law again in May,

492
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,340
sending someone to Taiwan now

493
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,920
is extremely difficult.

494
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,010
With this special pass,

495
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,600
we can make replicas.

496
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,980
Actually, if you needed it,

497
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,760
you could have told me earlier.

498
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,290
I could have asked Ju to get one for us.

499
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,190
Look,

500
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,690
the pass

501
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,600
has the issuing authority

502
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,270
and the exact home address.

503
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,130
If you ask them for it and then don't go,

504
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,260
it could cause trouble for the family,

505
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,650
and visitors can't stay there

506
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,940
or they'll be exposed.

507
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,050
Now that they're sending it over,

508
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,430
things are much easier.

509
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
Comrade Zhu Feng,

510
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,010
I thank you on behalf of the Party.

511
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,470
I'm glad it can be of use.

512
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,670
I'll keep this special pass

513
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,680
for you.

514
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,770
It will definitely be very useful.

515
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,400
Dear Chief Zhou,

516
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,360
we're very satisfied with
the new military assistance plan

517
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,360
recently sent by your department.

518
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,050
We can properly send personnel
to Hong Kong

519
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,180
to complete the handover procedures.

520
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,510
Best regards, James Walker.

521
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,240
You may go now.

522
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,770
Please ask Director Duan to come in.

523
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,420
Yes.

524
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,120
Chief.

525
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,290
You wanted to see me?

526
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,190
You went to visit Vice Minister Wu;

527
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,100
how is he?

528
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,940
He looks a bit weaker than usual,

529
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,450
but generally fine.

530
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,750
I conveyed your concerns to him.

531
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,080
Tell him to rest more

532
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,480
and not worry about work.

533
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,890
Has BIS

534
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,380
made any new moves recently?

535
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,450
A report from my mole inside BIS:

536
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,380
Gu Zhengwen believes that

537
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,190
the person who was supposed to
make contact with Zhang Hao

538
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,550
suddenly lost connection.

539
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,170
They will surely establish
a new communication line,

540
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,420
so recently they've been
strictly investigating

541
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,440
people coming out of Taiwan.

542
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,690
Go back and keep watching.

543
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:29,710
Yes!

544
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,590
Chief.

545
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,450
Okay.

546
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,190
Senior.

547
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,140
Chief.

548
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,500
How are you?

549
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,000
Feeling any better?

550
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,180
Much better.

551
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,520
My wife has been taking care of me.

552
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,310
Your blood pressure still won't come down,

553
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,160
that's a real problem.

554
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,860
How about

555
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,550
I find you a good American doctor

556
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,550
-to take a good look at you.
-No need.

557
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,820
I just need to
take my medication regularly.

558
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,080
It's nothing serious.

559
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Work is important,

560
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,300
but you must take care of your health too.

561
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,719
Chief, what did you call me here for?

562
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,550
Did you draft this allocation plan

563
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,409
yourself?

564
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,719
Yes, I did.

565
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,280
With the Ministry of Defense so busy,

566
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,489
they told me to
rest at home and do nothing.

567
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,889
But that makes me uneasy.

568
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,389
Besides, I know

569
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,070
the Americans
have been waiting for this plan

570
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,159
for a long time.

571
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,850
So I wanted to help ease your burden.

572
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,489
You're my senior;

573
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,120
I should naturally come to you

574
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,679
for advice and strategies.

575
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,010
I've reviewed this plan;

576
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,050
it's very thorough.

577
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,100
Did they respond yet?

578
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,980
They did. Not a single word was changed.

579
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,449
It's been approved.

580
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,030
Well, that's excellent news.

581
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,760
It'll help ease
the urgent situation in Kinmen.

582
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,380
If there's nothing else,

583
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,840
I'll head back now, Chief.

584
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,550
Senior, don't rush off.

585
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,320
Come.

586
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,730
General Walker

587
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,410
has been urging me

588
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,610
to arrange the handover.

589
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,490
He holds the rank
of Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army.

590
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,730
So our representative

591
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,410
can't be of lower rank than that.

592
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,530
Senior,

593
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,740
since this allocation plan

594
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,170
was written by you personally,

595
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,030
I think you should go yourself.

596
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,030
I can't.

597
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,390
First, I'm terrible
at social interactions.

598
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,430
Second, with my health the way it is—

599
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,490
just last night my blood pressure spiked

600
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,420
close to 200.

601
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,960
My wife scolded me terribly for it.

602
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,090
If I get sick again in Hong Kong,

603
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,170
wouldn't that
jeopardize the whole mission?

604
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,420
That's not a problem.

605
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,700
The medical facilities in Hong Kong

606
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,410
are far better than in Taiwan.

607
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,010
If you could make the trip,

608
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,320
I'd assign a military doctor

609
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,220
to accompany you the entire time

610
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,550
to guarantee nothing would go wrong.

611
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,420
Chief, I cannot go.

612
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,240
BIS suspects me

613
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,390
because of the Taiwan University incident.

614
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,720
They're now strictly monitoring
everyone leaving Taiwan.

615
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,370
If I really go,

616
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,070
it might give others
something to criticize.

617
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
That's true.

618
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,010
Chief, if there's nothing else,

619
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,290
I'll take my leave now.

620
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,270
Senior.

621
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,820
Senior.

622
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,500
I've been thinking it over,

623
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,120
and you're still the most suitable person.

624
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,270
Our Ministry of Defense
is going on an official trip—

625
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,530
surely we don't need to bow to BIS' whims.

626
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,560
Senior, don't worry.

627
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,010
You're being sent by me personally.

628
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,850
If they dare cause trouble,
they can come to me.

629
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,730
Besides,

630
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,510
you've already helped me

631
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,090
finalize this plan.

632
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,860
You must help me
see it through to the end.

633
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,130
It's settled then.

634
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,280
Senior, you'll depart tomorrow.

635
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,070
Yes.

636
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,450
I won't let you down.

637
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,810
Thank you for your help.

638
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,380
Director Duan.

639
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,500
Chief Zhou.

640
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,790
Vice Minister Wu
is heading to Hong Kong tomorrow

641
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,790
regarding U.S. military aid.

642
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,010
Your Second Department
must send someone along.

643
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:35,700
Remember,

644
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,440
make sure you complete your assigned task.

645
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,050
Understood.

646
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,490
Finish your current work quickly.

647
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,440
Then prepare to take delivery of

648
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,350
the American aid documents.

649
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,350
We leave tomorrow

650
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,280
To Hong Kong?

651
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:52,900
Yes.

652
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,570
I'll accompany you home
to pack your things.

653
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,500
What's wrong, Sir?

654
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
I can't go in.

655
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,450
I just remembered

656
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,850
a few days ago my wife
made me agree to five rules.

657
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,740
I promised her.

658
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,820
One of them was that

659
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,950
whenever I travel on business,
I must take her along.

660
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,420
What kind of rules?

661
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,820
Basically, wherever I go,
she insists on going with me.

662
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,530
But this trip to Hong Kong
isn't an ordinary assignment,

663
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,490
I can't take her with me.

664
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,750
What should we do then?

665
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,780
How about this:

666
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,840
tell Madam that

667
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,400
the Ministry of Defense
has urgent duties these days,

668
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,810
and that I'll be staying at the office.

669
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,780
Just bring me a few changes of clothes.

670
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,310
Alright.

671
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,700
So what do you need me to bring?

672
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,790
A suit.

673
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,420
A suit… Okay.

674
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,300
And two pairs of leather shoes.

675
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,050
Two pairs of leather shoes… Got it.

676
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:01,840
And my dress uniform.

677
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,380
Dress uniform… Okay.

678
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,590
That's all.

679
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,250
But Madam will definitely ask

680
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,440
why would you need a suit
just for working late at the Ministry?

681
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,160
Just tell her the Ministry
might have some gatherings these days.

682
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,050
Gatherings… Alright.

683
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,010
And the two pairs of shoes?

684
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:12,900
Just say you don't know

685
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
which pair I'll find more suitable.

686
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,440
And what about the dress uniform?

687
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,310
Tell her

688
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,400
I've lost some weight recently

689
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,440
and need to take the uniform

690
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,300
to the military headquarters
for alterations.

691
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,720
Okay.

692
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,400
Sir.

693
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,110
Nie Xi.

694
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,170
Madam.

695
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,840
Why are you here so late?

696
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,860
Is something wrong?

697
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,790
Come in quickly.

698
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,900
I'm here to get some clothes for Sir.

699
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,920
Clothes? Where is he?

700
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,420
He's still at the Ministry of Defense.

701
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,460
There's an urgent military matter,

702
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,590
so he needs to stay there for a few days.

703
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,470
Alright.

704
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,010
Dou!

705
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,490
Dou!

706
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,420
Get the suitcase ready.

707
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,450
Yes, Madam.

708
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,890
Why bring a suit?

709
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,140
The Ministry might
hold a reception this weekend.

710
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,450
So is he staying just
a few days or for a whole month?

711
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,510
Should I pack up the entire bedding too?

712
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,910
That won't be necessary.

713
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,320
Take these leather shoes.
They go with everything.

714
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,350
Alright, I'll pack them.

715
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,780
And a military dress uniform.

716
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,260
A dress uniform?

717
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,490
For working late at the Ministry?

718
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,840
He said he's recently put on weight—
no, lost weight—

719
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,370
and needs to have it altered
at headquarters.

720
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:46,950
Okay.

721
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,670
Madam, one suitcase is enough.

722
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,720
He promised me

723
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,980
wherever he goes, I go.

724
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,350
I'm coming with you to the Ministry.

725
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,450
Please don't.

726
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,440
Wait a moment.

727
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,840
Madam.

728
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,570
What's wrong? Let's go.

729
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,430
No, it's not...

730
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,740
I...

731
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,520
What's going on?

732
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,740
Dear.

733
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,810
Why are you here?

734
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,030
Here I am.

735
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,480
Nie Xi said you were working late
at the Ministry of Defense.

736
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,570
Not anymore.

737
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,960
Let's talk inside.

738
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,260
Let me take that.

739
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,950
You go back first.

740
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,340
Okay.
