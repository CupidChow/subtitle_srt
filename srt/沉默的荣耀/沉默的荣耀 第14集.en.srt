Deputy Chief,

4
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,460
that's true.

5
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,630
But Chief Zhou also said

6
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,180
that this shipment of military supplies

7
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,450
is a top priority.

8
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,610
I'm in a difficult position too.

9
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,539
Have these ships departed yet?

10
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,920
The last batch just left.

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,260
Don't worry.
As soon as the ships return to port,

12
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,790
I'll immediately
allocate them for your use.

13
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,880
But you'll need to

14
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,870
put in a good word for me

15
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,180
and ask the Chief

16
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,500
for a two-day extension.

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Then I can free up ships for Vietnam.

18
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,530
Right?

19
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,490
Fine.

20
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,070
Notify me as soon as your ships dock.

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,070
I need to assess the situation first

22
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,800

Sir, have you received some news?

27
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,720
Zhou Zhirou has arranged
for the Fourth Department

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,250
to transport
military supplies to Zhoushan.

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm not sure what supplies exactly,

30
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
but it's urgent.

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,680
Do you think

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,020
it's related to the recent

33
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,780
secret meeting
at the Hsinchu Air Force Base?

34
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,640
It's possible.

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,020
Zhoushan has always been

36
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
the maritime shield for East China.

37

If the two are connected,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,150
then we can confirm

39
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,150
it's not an Air Force operation
from southwest China.

40

The day after tomorrow, I'll go check
the ships returning from Zhoushan.

Timeless literature

Although "Memorial to the Throne"

Leader.

88
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,510
When I first reported to the bureau,

89
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,270
everyone was talking about

90
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,690
how Mr. Gu cracked
the Guangming News case

91
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,940
and busted
the Communist spy den in Keelung.

92
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,140
Everyone from the President
to the Director praised you.

93
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,690
I became an agent...

94
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,250
I joined this line of work

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,330
because I was afraid of being bullied

96
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,810
and needed to make a living.

97
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,770
I never thought

98
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,610
someone could make
such a career out of it like you did.

99
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,530
So I went to the personnel department

100
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,910
and insisted on
being transferred under your command.

101
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,780
And you actually selected me.

102
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,380
For the Guangming News case,

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,250
the President gave the Director

104
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,310
a reward of 300,000 Taiwan dollars.

105
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,390
300,000!

106
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,950
Director Ye only
makes 600 dollars a month.

107
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,580
You're quite well-informed.

108
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,480
I heard it from others.

109
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,400
Do you think 600 is too little?

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,890
Well, 600 for me

111
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,360
would be too much.

112
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,830
600 isn't much,

113
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,640
but it certainly isn't little either.

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,620
But you

115
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,870
are right to have
great ambitions and ideals.

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
Because once you solve major cases,

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,090
you'll naturally
receive substantial rewards.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,930
Otherwise, would you
follow Director Ye's example?

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,890
Not enough money
and unable to solve cases,

120
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,620
resorting to roadside kidnappings.

121
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,820
Yes, Leader.

122
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,930
Mere cleverness won't achieve greatness.

123
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
From now on, if you tell me to go east,

124
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,100
I won't take half a step west.

125
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,770
Director Ma, you certainly don't waste

126
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,500
the Navy's shipping capacity.

127
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,750
The ships aren't fully
loaded on return voyages anyway.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,280
It would be a shame to waste the tonnage.

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,740
Loading some local specialties

130
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,920
can help make a bit of freight money.

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,020
The Fourth Department knows
how to calculate profits.

132
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,600
We have no choice, Deputy Chief.

133
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
Money is needed everywhere these days.

134
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,800
That Liberty Ship looks good.

135
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,010
Deputy Chief, that one

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,610
needs to assemble more millitary equipment

137
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,730
to Zhoushan.

138
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,770
Let's go and check others.

139
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,790
You can use another ship
to transport the military supplies.

140
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,790
Leave this to me.

141
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,770
Let's go check.

142
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,750
Great achievements start with small steps.

143
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,390
I think

144
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,010
with your qualifications

145
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,830
you'd be quite suitable
for infiltration work

146
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,070
here in Taiwan.

147
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Infiltration?

148
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,780
Yes.

149
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,030
Based on the information we have,

150
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,400
Lin Yiliang, the boss
of Sanrong Trading in Keelung,

151
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,320
is most likely
to be Zhang Hao's accomplice.

152
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,580
So I plan to arrange you

153
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,870
to infiltrate

154
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,290
as Mr. Zhuang Achen.

155
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,040
Help me find out
Lin Yiliang's background.

156
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,340
But Leader,

157
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,440
I've never done infiltration work before.

158
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,650
I'm afraid

159
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,890
I might ruin your master plan.

160
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,170
Come on.

161
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,170
Don't be such a coward.

162
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:05,700
Sit down.

163
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,320
You, Weng Lianwang,

164
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
are on your first infiltration mission.

165
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,910
But that Mr. Zhuang Achen

166
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
is also escaping for the first time.

167
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,230
Both of you are panicking.

168
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,810
What's the difference?

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,550
Right?

170
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,400
Besides, I'll personally guide you.

171
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,190
I brought you here today

172
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,870
to get you familiar with

173
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,830
the Keelung Middle School campus.

174
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,890
These are the materials
prepared for you in advance.

175
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,940
Memorize them as soon as possible.

176
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,590
From now on,

177
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,870
you are no longer Weng Lianwang.

178
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,320
You are Mr. Zhuang Achen.

179
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,170
If there's anything you don't understand,

180
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,670
you can go to the prison

181
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,080
and have a chat
with the real Zhuang Achen.

182
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
To go to Vietnam to withdraw troops,

183
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,960
if we use smaller ships,
we'll need to send more of them.

184
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
It would be troublesome to coordinate.

185
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,440
So I'd prefer to send
the Liberty Ship if possible.

186
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,770
After all, this is a diplomatic mission.

187
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,290
If the ships are too shabby,
they don't look

188
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,750
very presentable in front of the French.

189
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,680
Right, the President always prioritizes
international impression.

190
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,830
Deputy Chief, please take another look.

191
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,160
I'll go down to check the cabin.

192
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,280
Please, after you.

193
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,770
Mr. Zhuang.

194
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,240
Leader.

195
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,700
What did you say?

196
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,590
Have you lost your mind?

197
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,550
I'm memorizing my lecture notes.

198
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,860
Mr. Gu, just tell me what's on your mind.

199
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,530
Alright.

200
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,480
I won't bother you
with memorizing the lecture notes.

201
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,790
You're using this oil drum for water?

202
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,050
You bet. It's genuinely made in the U.S..

203
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,050
Look, it says right here.

204
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,380
U.S. Air Force exclusive oil drum.

205
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,600
Much lighter than our old iron buckets.

206
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,650
They just unloaded in Zhoushan.

207
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,580
So I grabbed an empty one for water.

208
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,380
Pretty handy.

209
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,000
It seems Zhou Zhirou

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,130
has transported jet fuel to Zhoushan.

211
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Judging from the shipping records,

212
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,380
the quantity is substantial.

213
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,420
We can confirm

214
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,100
that Zhoushan

215
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,090
is coordinating with Air Force operations.

216
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,930
Could it possibly be

217
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,880
a joint naval, ground,

218
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,760
and air combat operation?

219
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,090
Since November,

220
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,240
they've been
reinforcing the Zhoushan Islands.

221
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,440
And Chiang Kai-shek has explicitly

222
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,970
outlined an offensive-defensive strategy.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,940
He ordered the Air Force to intensify

224
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,710
attacks on maritime and coastal areas.

225
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,760
Plus, recently,

226
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,270
Zhou Zhirou has been frequently
attending meetings in Hsinchu.

227
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,050
And the level of secrecy

228
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,220
is so strict.

229
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,170
I think it's more likely

230
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,820
an unilateral operation of the air force.

231
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,210
Zhoushan...

232
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,980
If it is Zhoushan,

233
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,200
it should be

234
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,180
in the southeast direction.

235
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,850
The southeastern islands
now have only one remaining airport,

236
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,430
which is the Dinghai Airport in Zhoushan.

237
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,200
Sir,

238
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,460
where do you think
they're most likely to bomb?

239
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,070
In my view,

240
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,610
to achieve your objectives,

241
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,850
the bombing priorities should,

242
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,710
in addition to military targets,

243
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,540
also focus on

244
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,530
Shanghai's industrial facilities,

245
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,560
especially power plants, shipyards,

246
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
water treatment plants, and docks.

247
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,240
This way,

248
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,630
we can eliminate
the Communist Army's war potential

249
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,500
to ensure Zhoushan's safety,

250
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,010
and destroy
the confidence of Shanghai citizens

251
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,210
and even the entire nation's
trust in the Communist Army.

252
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,260
However,

253
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,750
strategic bombing has limited precision

254
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,260
and will affect innocent people.

255
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,270
Shanghai in our hands

256
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,880
is truly Shanghai.

257
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,130
In the Communists' hands,

258
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,080
it's just Communist territory.

259
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,600
I'm assigning this task to you.

260
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,290
Maintain secrecy.

261
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,960
We can't guarantee

262
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,240
there aren't Communist spies in our ranks.

263
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,300
Rest assured, President.

264
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,600
I plan to select elite personnel
from the Second Department

265
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,630
specifically for security measures.

266
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,810
I can guarantee you

267
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,910
that besides the Air Force,

268
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,230
no one will know the complete plan.

269
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,890
Even Director Ma
who's responsible for transportation

270
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,080
won't know
what the fuel shipped to Zhoushan

271
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,590
is actually for.

272
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,670
[Ningbo]

273
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,380
[Shanghai]

274
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,980
Shanghai?

275
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,960
Bombing Ningbo
would be the most convenient.

276
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,220
But that's Chiang Kai-shek's hometown.

277
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
Bombing Hangzhou is also an option.

278
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,160
But in terms of impact
and destructive power,

279
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,310
Ningbo and Hangzhou
can't compare to Shanghai.

280
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,060
Plus, with the recent months
of naval blockade

281
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,320
and economic embargo,

282
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,820
I believe

283
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,110
the Air Force's plan

284
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,850
is to use Zhoushan as a springboard

285
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,920
and forward base

286
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,520
to stockpile aviation supplies in advance,

287
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,890
and to wait for the right moment

288
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,910
to bomb Shanghai.

289
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,740
Shanghai and Zhoushan
are very close to each other.

290
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,400
The Air Force can
carry out maintenance nearby,

291
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,700
greatly increasing the number of sorties.

292
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,760
If Chiang Kai-shek's plot succeeds,

293
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,340
the damage to Shanghai

294
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,670
and New China

295
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,120
would be unimaginable.

296
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,550
The Nationalist Government
just used the Gold Yuan notes

297
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,240
to swindle people of their money.

298
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,100
They have fled,

299
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,440
and now they're turning back
to bomb their own people.

300
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,240
No wonder they're losing power.

301
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,880
Shanghai is just one part of it.

302
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,580
If they take this opportunity

303
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,440
to fortify the Zhoushan Islands,

304
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,420
using the airports
and naval bases on the islands,

305
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,840
they can not only
directly threaten East China,

306
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,550
but also

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,390
greatly affect the development

308
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,680
of all cities along the Yangtze River.

309
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,390
The urgent task now is to determine

310
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,590
[D-Day: the day on which
a military operation begins]

311
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,520
the D-Day timeframe

312
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,430
and send out the intelligence,

313
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,000
so that Shanghai

314
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,860
can prepare defenses in advance.

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,790
Sir,

316
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,090
do you have any good ideas?

317
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,200
Large-scale bombing

318
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,460
requires specific weather conditions.

319
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,480
The weather in Shanghai
and Zhoushan is similar.

320
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,820
I need to know

321
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,600
the weather conditions in Zhoushan waters.

322
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
Given the current level of secrecy,

323
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,109
trying to access weather reports

324
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,710
from the meteorological station

325
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,690
won't be easy.

326
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,960
Of course it won't be easy,

327
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,839
but we still need to try.

328
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,680
Is Mrs. Chen's exit permit ready?

329
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,810
It's ready.

330
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,589
I'll contact her first thing tomorrow.

331
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,319
Ask her to pass a message to Wan,

332
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,619
telling them to quickly

333
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,250
send an experienced new courier here.

334
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,630
Understood.

335
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,690
Hongxiang Silk Shop.
Is this Mrs. Chen speaking?

336
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,420
Yes, it's me.

337
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,940
The new fabric you ordered has arrived.

338
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,800
Alright, I understand. Thank you.

339
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,610
Director Duan has become suspicious

340
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,280
about our rendezvous
at the Power Company Guesthouse.

341
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
[Special pass]

342
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,890
There's a flight to Zhoushan tomorrow.

343
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,380
Comrade East Sea
has arranged a seat for you.

344
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,270
To be safe,

345
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,890
you should leave as soon as possible.

346
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,810
I've thought it through.

347
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,070
There are many comrades building Shanghai,

348
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,520
but I'm the only one

349
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,430
with a legal special pass.

350
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,210
This mission is my bounden duty.

351
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,480
I wish you a swift and successful return.

352
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,050
A man should stride boldly through life.

353
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,960
Can a woman not also be as mighty
as a whale crossing the sea?

354
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,830
Hello, whom would you like to speak to?

355
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,280
Hello, may I speak to Yin Xuefen, please?

356
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,030
Yin Xuefen?

357
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm her old classmate.

358
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,640
You mean Mrs. Lv, right?

359
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,350
Her husband got promoted

360
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,750
and they no longer live here.

361
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,480
They moved out just last month.

362
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,170
Do you know where they moved to?

363
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,850
I really don't know.

364
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm sorry to have bothered you then.

365
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,480
Mom.

366
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,830
Who were you talking to on the phone?

367
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,900
An old classmate
from when I was in Ningbo.

368
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,500
I heard she's also in Taipei.

369
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,850
I wanted to get in touch with her.

370
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,510
We were quite close back then.

371
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,510
Did you reach her?

372
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,980
They said she moved.

373
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,890
Taipei may not be big,

374
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,770
but finding someone
can still be quite difficult.

375
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,400
Mom, you must be hungry.

376
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,940
Guess what I made for you?

377
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,630
What did you make?

378
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,400
Sliced Pork with Pickled Cabbage.

379
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,490
Sounds wonderful.

380
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,830
It's a specialty from Northeast China.

381
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,100
I love it so much.

382
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,980
Old habits die hard.

383
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,130
You're a product of where you're from.

384
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,880
When I first came to Taipei,

385
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,760
I wanted to eat Sliced Pork
with Pickled Cabbage for every meal.

386
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
But there aren't many authentic
Northeast restaurants in Taipei,

387
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,070
and they're expensive too.

388
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,000
I had to pickle the cabbage myself.

389
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,890
Ju.

390
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,350
Are there any good
Ningbo restaurants in Taipei?

391
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:40,880
Hello.

392
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,780
Please come in.

393
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,410
I've been looking for
your restaurant for a long time.

394
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,050
My usual three dishes:

395
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,790
meatball soup,
pickled water bamboo, and smoked fish.

396
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,570
Mrs. Chen,

397
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,230
I'll throw in a serving
of rice cake on the house.

398
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,860
That's too kind.

399
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,440
It's our pleasure.

400
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,240
You've been patronizing us
for several days in a row.

401
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,050
Thank you.

402
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,180
Our chefs

403
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,740
are all from Zhenhai.

404
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,480
I can't guarantee anything else,

405
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,680
but the taste is definitely authentic.

406
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,390
Please wait a moment
while I prepare your order.

407
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,990
Thank you.

408
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,000
Mrs. Lv.

409
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,790
Hello, Mr. Yu.

410
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,660
Yin Xuefen.

411
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,590
Zhu Yi...

412
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,570
Zhu Yiyin!

413
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,630
What are you doing here?

414
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,410
I came to see my daughter.

415
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,180
So you've come to Taipei too.

416
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,960
Yes.

417
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,510
You haven't changed at all.

418
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,110
I recognized you right away.

419
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,830
Let me tell you.

420
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,750
I've been waiting
for you here for 3 days.

421
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,810
You've been waiting for me for 3 days?

422
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,810
Yes, before I came to Taiwan,

423
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,270
they told me you were here.

424
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,030
I thought I really had to see you.

425
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,720
Then I called your home
and they said you'd moved.

426
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,610
So I thought,

427
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,030
since you love food so much,

428
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,390
and this Ningbo restaurant
is the best one here,

429
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,030
I would definitely run into you.

430
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,900
And look, I finally found you!

431
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,640
What if I hadn't come today?

432
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,530
Then I would have kept waiting for you.

433
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,930
I would have waited forever.

434
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,600
Until I finally saw you.

435
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,440
Well, you've found me today.

436
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,070
Let me treat you.

437
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,830
Please sit.

438
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,220
What are you treating me for?

439
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,180
I've already ordered.

440
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,360
Why don't you just add a few more dishes?

441
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,380
All right then.

442
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,810
Mr. Yu, bring us the menu.

443
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,320
Sure.

444
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,590
These past few months in Taiwan,

445
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,590
I still haven't been able to adjust.

446
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,740
I keep thinking about
friends and family in Zhenhai.

447
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,000
Sometimes in my heart,

448
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,270
I feel so empty.

449
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,090
Fortunately, this restaurant

450
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,850
serves very authentic food.

451
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,740
It's completely
because of these familiar flavors

452
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,350
that I can bear staying here.

453
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,110
Thank you.

454
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,260
Thanks.

455
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,360
But from what I can see,

456
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,410
your life seems quite lively.

457
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,000
I saw you in the newspaper,

458
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,460
with a group of ladies,

459
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,370
doing some kind of charity sale

460
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,140
to support the troops
and civilians in Zhoushan, right?

461
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,070
That event you mentioned
was organized by Mrs. Zhou.

462
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,660
She just wanted
to have a festive celebration.

463
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,180
Actually, the charity sale

464
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,240
was just an excuse.

465
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,700
But Xuefen,

466
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,630
among all those ladies,

467
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,920
you looked
the most beautiful in the photos.

468
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,990
Oh, not at all.

469
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,570
Actually, those ladies

470
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,620
really are quite influential.

471
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,730
What do you mean?

472
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,380
They are the wives of several generals

473
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,130
from the Southeast
Military and Political Office,

474
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,790
as well as the wives of the Deputy Chiefs

475
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,120
and Directors of the Ministry of Defense.

476
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,590
Do you meet often?

477
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,300
About 2 or 3 times a week.

478
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,930
Sometimes we play mahjong,

479
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,330
sometimes we sing opera.

480
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,290
Sounds very lively and fun.

481
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,250
It is quite lively.

482
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,900
Zhu Yiyin.

483
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,140
I think you've changed.

484
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,750
In the past,

485
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,900
you didn't seem to care much

486
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,700
about other people's business.

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,980
To be honest,

488
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,820
since coming to Taiwan,

489
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,170
where I know no one,

490
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,150
sometimes...

491
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,650
I'm feeling a bit bored too.

492
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,610
So hearing about all your exciting stories

493
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,500
makes me happy.

494
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,580
Actually, I heard that you

495
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
got married and moved to Shenyang,

496
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,790
and that your husband was an engineer.

497
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,420
He's my late husband now.

498
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,270
His surname was Chen.

499
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
He was very good to me.

500
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,900
I'm so sorry.

501
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,100
It's alright.

502
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,380
It's all in the past.

503
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,140
I've changed my name now.

504
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,210
I'm called Zhu Chenzhi.

505
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Mr. Sha Menghai helped me choose it.

506
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,050
Zhu Chenzhi. That sounds lovely.

507
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,710
Mrs. Dou is organizing something tomorrow.

508
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,170
Why don't you come with me?

509
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,090
That won't do.

510
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,640
I'm just an ordinary person.

511
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,380
How could I possibly
mingle with your crowd?

512
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,640
What does that matter?

513
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,460
You're my friend. Why shouldn't you?

514
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,720
It's no problem at all.

515
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,750
It would be nice
to join in your lively gatherings.

516
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,900
So many ladies there.

517
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,750
Is there any special
etiquette I should know?

518
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,740
Looks like Mrs. Wu is here,

519
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,480
isn't it?

520
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,750
Juan, come here,

521
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,880
draw for me.

522
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,510
Hurry up.

523
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,400
I have a great hand.

524
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,660
Keep an eye on it for me.

525
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm so sorry.

526
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,420
Mrs. Lv,

527
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,850
why are you so late?

528
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,660
Didn't we agree

529
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,400
you'd come for afternoon tea?

530
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,790
I've spent my entire afternoon

531
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,390
entertaining my old friend.

532
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,510
I should have called you.

533
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,590
That's right.

534
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,130
Let me introduce you.

535
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,500
Mrs. Chen,

536
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,820
my best friend from Ningbo.

537
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,830
Mrs. Dou,

538
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,600
the one I told you about...

539
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,930
-...the star of Taipei's ladies' circle.
-The star.

540
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,790
Xuefen always mentions your name.

541
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,850
I finally meet you in person today.

542
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,430
Mrs. Chen, right?

543
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,940
Pleased to meet you. Please come in.

544
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,700
Thank you.

545
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,630
Mrs. Chen just arrived from Hong Kong.

546
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,590
I only got in touch
with her these past few days.

547
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,570
You know how it is — old friends meet

548
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,190
and just can't stop talking.

549
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,940
I brought her today

550
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,980
to meet some new friends.

551
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,140
Liu,

552
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
prepare some tea.

553
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:56,970
Mrs. Dou,

554
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,580
I have a small gift for you.

555
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,840
I bought this in Hong Kong.

556
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,140
It's an American brand,

557
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,220
quite a good one.

558
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,440
Just a small token.

559
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,740
I know this one.

560
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,160
This is America's

561
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,360
most popular style and color this year.

562
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,960
Yes, exactly this color.

563
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,620
I was asking someone
to bring me one from the U.S.

564
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,510
Juan, look,

565
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,220
the one I had someone
bring from the U.S. is this exact color.

566
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,070
This is beautiful.

567
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,070
This brand is very famous in the U.S.

568
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,880
No, no, this is too expensive.

569
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,900
How could I accept it?

570
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,440
Please.

571
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,160
Just accept it.

572
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,830
She does big business

573
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,160
in Hong Kong.

574
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,140
She has plenty of American goods at home.

575
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,160
Not at all.

576
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,700
I'm glad you like it.

577
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,140
Just a small gesture.

578
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,530
Mrs. Wu, you're finally here!

579
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
I thought you weren't coming.

580
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,610
How could I miss it?

581
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,220
I just got delayed on the way.

582
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,430
Come in, let's talk inside.

583
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,800
Let me tell you.

584
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,140
Mrs. Duan

585
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,910
wanted to come today.

586
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,680
She went too far last time,

587
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,000
so I turned her down.

588
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,140
I figured you wouldn't
want to see her either.

589
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,130
I think

590
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,480
she'll never come to Dou's Mansion again.

591
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,860
It's so much nicer
to just play mahjong and sing.

592
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,520
All that gossip is pointless.

593
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,480
Exactly!

594
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,170
This has nothing to do with me,

595
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,570
or I'd truly be wrongfully accused.

596
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,430
You're not wearing enough.

597
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,450
It wasn't this cold when I left home.

598
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,830
Quite a crowd today, isn't there?

599
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,550
Many experts have come today.

600
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,180
Later,

601
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,930
we can have a good match together.

602
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,560
Let's go.

603
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,060
That's Deputy Chief Wu's
wife, Wang Bikui.

604
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,520
She's a valued guest here.

605
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,630
She looks very kind.

606
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,810
Sorry, I'm late.

607
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,270
Would you like to play?

608
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,920
You go ahead.

609
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,480
Don't let me interrupt.

610
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,780
Alright, carry on chatting.

611
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,060
We have a new friend today, Mrs. Chen,

612
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,450
who is Mrs. Lv's friend.

613
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,400
She just arrived from Hong Kong.

614
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,640
Yes, Mrs. Chen

615
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,200
is here for the first time today.

616
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,060
Hello, Mrs. Wu.

617
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,090
Hello, Mrs. Chen.

618
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:21,880
Pleased to meet you.

619
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,510
Likewise.

620
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,540
The secret bombing plan alerted Wu Shi

621
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,760
that Chiang Kai-shek
might already suspect him.

622
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,900
He carefully reviewed
his previous actions,

623
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,640
trying to determine if he was overthinking

624
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,680
or if he had overlooked something.

625
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,570
Every step forward

626
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,470
would require extreme caution.

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,090
Mrs. Lv.

630
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,050
Your singing has improved so much.

631
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,200
I was completely enchanted.

632
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,660
You're too kind.

633
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,190
Now that I've finished
"The Search for the Dream",

634
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,320
who will sing "A Stroll in the Garden"?

635
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,900
Mrs. Wu.

636
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,130
Weren't you going to sing a few pieces?

637
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,410
How about singing
"A Stroll in the Garden"?

638
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,030
Yes, indeed.

639
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,030
Sing one, Mrs. Wu.

640
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,630
I just had a couple of drinks,

641
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,380
and my voice isn't cooperating.

642
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,090
Please continue without me.

643
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,240
I don't want to spoil the fun.

644
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,890
Just sing a verse.

645
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,810
Your voice is so beautiful.

646
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,790
Yes.

647
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,750
You sing so well.

648
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,140
Please do sing.

649
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,720
How about I give it a humble try?

650
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,190
Great!

651
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,390
Wonderful!

652
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,250
Excellent!

653
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
May I borrow your fan?

654
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,840
Good.

655
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,020

Welcome back, Mr. Wu.

660
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,030
Have you had dinner, sir?

661
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,660
Yes, I have.

662
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,100
Mrs. Wu isn't home.

663
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,360
She went to Dou's Mansion to play mahjong.

664
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,490

00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,380
Here, have some fruit.

675
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,890
Mrs. Wu, your voice is wonderful.

676
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,320
You can hit the high notes
and reach the low ones too.

677
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,980
It sounds so fluid and natural.

678
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,140
So graceful and elegant.

679
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,160
You're too kind.

680
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,640
Mrs. Chen, you flatter me.

681
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,570
I really mean it.

682
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,920
When I heard you sing, I thought

683
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,050
it was absolutely beautiful.

684
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,740
Why didn't you sing earlier?

685
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,510
There were too many people.

686
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,960
I was too shy to sing.

687
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,390
Mrs. Wu, you seem quite introverted.

688
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,100
Mrs. Dou is very lively.

689
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,190
And very hospitable too.

690
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,080
She enjoys
being around people, doesn't she?

691
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,180
Mrs. Chen, you're here for the first time,

692
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,510
yet you seem quite comfortable,
not nervous at all.

693
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,370
I'm quite alright in that regard.

694
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,030
I do business in Hong Kong.

695
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,639
I'm used to meeting all sorts of people.

696
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,960
Where are you from, Mrs. Chen?

697
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,760
I'm from Zhenhai, Ningbo.

698
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,219
Are you in Taiwan for business?

699
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,030
No, I'm here to visit my daughter.

700
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:28,510
She had a baby.

701
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,000
A little one.

702
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,310
You're so young.

703
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,000
Are you really a grandmother?

704
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,600
I'm not young at all.

705
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,900
You're too kind.

706
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,969
You really do look young.

707
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,010
Before doing business in Hong Kong,

708
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,090
I was in Shanghai.

709
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,130
I've run a money shop

710
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,750
and also a bookstore.

711
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,040
I've done a bit

712
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,530
of every kind of business.

713
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,199
That's impressive,

714
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,330
to have done so many different things.

715
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,500
I've been to Shanghai too.

716
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,430
My daughter studies there.

717
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,550
I think it's a wonderful place.

718
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,010
My daughter also studies in Shanghai.

719
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,130
My daughter studies medicine.

720
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,270
Really?

721
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,000
My daughter studies medicine too.

722
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,370
Really?

723
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,990
What a coincidence!

724
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,680
Mrs. Wu, what's your name?

725
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,780
I mean your maiden name.

726
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,470
Bikui.

727
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,020
Wang Bikui.

728
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,590
Wang Bikui.

729
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,230
I'm Zhu. Zhu Chenzhi.

730
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,920
It's been so long since anyone

731
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,450
has asked me my maiden name.

732
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,880
Usually,

733
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,930
it's only because of the title "Mrs. Wu"

734
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,780
that I'm treated as a valued guest here.

735
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,210
This Mrs. and that Mrs.,

736
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,990
it just sounds more formal.

737
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,890
Using maiden names
feels more intimate, doesn't it?

738
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,720
Yes.

739
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,920
I've grown used to being called "Mother"

740
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,360
or "Mrs." in my daily life.

741
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,090
It's been so long
that I've forgotten my own name.

742
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,360
But I think

743
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,390
being a mother has its own pride.

744
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,190
I have two of my children here,
and they're both very well-behaved.

745
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,270
My husband is
very responsible about their education.

746
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,100
But I still have two grown children
in mainland China.

747
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,150
They're out of sight and out of reach.

748
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,590
Even if they get sick,

749
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,150
I can't take care of them.

750
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,250
Thinking about this,

751
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,380
I feel quite guilty.

752
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,420
For me, it's like this.

753
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,400
When I'm at home,

754
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,000
I often think

755
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,950
I should go out and do something.

756
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,800
But when I actually go out,

757
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,170
I often think

758
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,020
it's better to stay home with the children

759
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,540
and my husband.

760
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,900
People are always
contradicting themselves.

761
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,710
So sometimes

762
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,370
you have to cheer yourself up.

763
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm happy to be at Dou's Mansion today.

764
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,850
We drink tea, chat,

765
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,280
and sing opera together.

766
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,260
It's really lively.

767
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,950
Would you like to go in
and sing another piece?

768
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,680
I'll stay here a bit longer.

769
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,980
I feel sitting here chatting with you

770
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,260
is more comfortable than being inside.

771
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,630
Remember you promised
to visit my home in a few days.

772
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,030
I'll bake some pastries for you.

773
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,660
Sure, I'll definitely come visit.

774
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,440
Great.

775
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,670
Mrs. Dou, thank you so much for today.

776
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,330
For your warm hospitality.

777
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,110
Mrs. Chen, you're too kind.

778
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,040
I was worried I wasn't being a good host.

779
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,730
Not at all.

780
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,420
Mrs. Chen, you must come visit more often.

781
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,570
Mrs. Wu rarely gets
along with people so well.

782
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,570
Sure, I'd love to.

783
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,420
Take care on your way.

784
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,320
Okay.

785
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,960
I'll be going now.

786
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,840
Goodbye.

787
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,210
Great, we'll visit often.

788
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:45,920
See you later.

789
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,440
Come together. Goodbye.

790
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,710
What brings

791
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,130
our busy Director Duan here today?

792
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,100
Mrs. Dou, you're still so beautiful.

793
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,810
You flatter me.

794
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,480
I'm here to pick up my darling.

795
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,090
She's not here.

796
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,330
She didn't come today.

797
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,630
She hasn't been here today.

798
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,040
But wait.

799
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,300
She told me she's been
hanging out at your place these days.

800
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,740
She told you she's been
hanging out at my place these days?

801
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,720
I haven't seen her for ages.

802
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,370
Director Duan,

803
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,940
your wife is

804
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,660
young and beautiful.

805
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,650
And she has quite a free spirit.

806
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,080
You'd better keep an eye on her.

807
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,570
I'll be going now.

808
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,360
Mrs. Wu, you're back.

809
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,450
Honey. Why are you
in such a good mood today?

810
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,770
I met a new friend

811
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,190
at Dou's Mansion today.

812
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,560
We were like old friends at first sight.

813
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,490
I'm happy when I think of her.

814
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,090
What's that friend like?

815
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,020
I'll invite her to our home

816
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,730
and introduce her to you.

817
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,850
I'm sure you'll like her too.

818
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,460
Alright.

819
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm done singing.

820
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,420
Let's go to bed.

821
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,110
Honey.

822
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,940
I'd like to hear you sing one more piece.

823
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,540
You've heard me sing before.

824
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,550
I want to hear it.

825
00:40:32,090 --> 00:41:03,590
♪ The sea moon,
pure as ice, begins its ascent ♪

826
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:16,070
♪ The jade rabbit appears ♪

827
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:30,360
♪ And soon ascends again from the east ♪

828
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,760
Hold him down. Don't move.

829
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,850
Let me go!

830
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,870
You inspection soldiers!

831
00:42:59,050 --> 00:42:59,710
Don't move!

832
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,590
Let me go!

833
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,580
Don't move!

834
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,950
Let me go!
