How much is he raising it?

77

Thirty percent.

Thirty percent?

That's pure extortion!

80
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,560

81

about our company's background?

82
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,520
On the surface,
he's just raising the price,

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,610
but in fact he doesn't want

84
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,409
to sell us the penicillin at all.

85

As long as the price is right,

89

they'd even do business with the Soviets.

demanding they supply
the timber as soon as possible.

109

But they refused.

110

After our investigation,

111
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,400
the timber merchants' association
didn't receive

112

any calls from military
or government departments that day.

Who did Deputy Chief Wu actually call?

We're still checking
the call routing nodes.

But in both matters,

Deputy Chief Wu is definitely involved.

building an intelligence network
in Taiwan.

It automatically delivers
intelligence to our superiors.

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,550
we'll surely create huge waves
in the East Sea.

265
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,020

poured with the Northern Dipper itself.

doesn't he know
about your high blood pressure?

273
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,050
Yet he let you drink so much.

274
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,610
I'll have some wine too.

279
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,110
before you came to Taiwan.

280
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,520
I bought this copy especially for you.

281
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,300
This isn't the only book
I haven't finished.

["Autumn Begonia"]

283

and I'll buy them for you one by one.

285

All of them?

286
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,090
All of them.

to start a family.

Lancheng is a young girl
living alone in Shanghai.

305
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,320
I'm just acting in this position.

306
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,680
You're being too modest.

307
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,260
Right now, besides you,

308
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,560
who else could
take on this responsibility?

309

in Guangzhou to oversee matters there.

311
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm merely following orders
to temporarily manage

312
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,800
the General Staff Headquarters
of the Ministry of Defense

to meet with some old friends?

322

I invited Yimin for a hometown meal.

324

332
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,820
that He Sui's younger son, He Kang,

333
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,330
is serving
in the Agricultural and Forestry Office

334
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,400
of the Shanghai
Military Control Commission,

335
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,210
and he was photographed by reporters.

336
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,320
I know your two families are very close.

337
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,360
I'm concerned
you might not understand the situation

338
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,530
and get implicated.

339
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,760
I wouldn't want someone with your talents

340
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,850
to have nowhere to apply them.

341
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,110
I was actually planning
to invite him to catch up.

342
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,480
Thank you for the warning, Chief.

343
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,550
The current development
of the war situation

344
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,750
is truly unpredictable.

345
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,800
Just a few months ago, we were considering
dividing rule along the Yangtze River,

346
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,950
but now the government keeps retreating.

347
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,560
This time the President

348
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,560
has asked me to manage
the affairs of the Ministry of Defense.

349
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,910
Is it a blessing or a curse?

350
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,640
In my opinion,

351
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,400
Chief, you can rest assured

352
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,800
for some time.

353
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,550
What insights do you have, Senior?

354
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,900
Su Yu has occupied
Fuzhou and is heading south,

355
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,450
directly targeting Guangzhou.

356
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,390
It seems fierce,

357
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,010
but in fact,
since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign,

358
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,770
his forces have been fighting continuously
and are severely weakened.

359
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,230
By the time they reached Fuzhou,
they were already exhausted.

360
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,120
They cannot
break through in the short term

361
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,380
our army's major forces
in the Zhangzhou-Xiamen

362
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,510
and Chaoshan areas.

363
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,770
The southeast is
temporarily free from danger.

364
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,490
Central China, however,
will definitely face a fierce battle.

365
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,690
Lin Biao has been resting for a long time

366
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,810
and is determined to take Hunan.

367
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,120
But to defend Guangxi,
we must first defend Hunan.

368
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,380
Acting President Li Zongren
won't stand by and do nothing.

369
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,380
Bai Jiansheng, the "Little Zhuge Liang,"

370
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,320
hasn't earned his reputation for nothing.

371
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,860
Without your urging,

372
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,600
he will fight to the death.

373
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,270
That's why I say for some time,

374
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,970
you can rest easy.

375
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,750
The President truly has an eye for talent.

376
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,770
In the future,

377
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,590
I'll inevitably
need to rely on you, Senior.

378
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,520
Chief, with your trust,

379
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,360
I will certainly
do my utmost and give my all.

380
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,690
-Freeze! Freeze!
-What are you doing?

381
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,380
Hurry!

382
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,110
[Ye Xiangzhi, Director
of the Operations Division of the BIS]

383
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Mr. Ye, they couldn't have gone far.

384
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,070
The medicine is still brewing.

385
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,100
Let's wait for them to return.

386
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,320
Team One, guard the front entrance.

387
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,250
You take Team Two to watch the back.

388
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,270
Be careful not to leave any traces.

389
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,830
Yes, sir.

390
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,170
Quick, search the place.

391
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,880
Yes, sir.

392
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,790
Kang was photographed by reporters.

393
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,170
The photos were published in Hong Kong.

394
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,390
Today I received evacuation orders.

395
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
Why haven't you left yet?

396
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,000
I was waiting for you.

397
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,920
Sui.

398
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,980
I can only escort you this far.

399
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,640
The materials for you,

400
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,300
along with the tokens and codes

401
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,620
used to contact the courier,

402
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,620
are all in here.

403
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,590
Keep them safe.

404
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,990
The courier's name is Zhang Hao,

405
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,100
a veteran underground operative.

406
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,510
His current identity

407
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,510
is first mate at a shipping company.

408
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,640
The radio is hidden on the ship.

409
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,100
It's only used when at sea.

410
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,600
Even radio direction-finding
or checking power meters

411
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,320
couldn't track him down.

412
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
It's very secure.

413
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,030
This radio is for emergency contact only,

414
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,430
not to be used routinely.

415
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,690
Okay.

416
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,180
If there's important intelligence
or an emergency,

417
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,210
I'll activate it then.

418
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,740
If you encounter
any difficulties in Taiwan,

419
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,270
you can go to
Yongchuntang Pharmacy in Hong Kong

420
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,320
and seek assistance
from its manager, Mr. Wan Jingguang.

421
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,190
Use these same tokens
and codes inside this.

422
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,660
I'll contact him later

423
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,660
to inform him about your situation.

424
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,470
Remember.

425
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,770
You must meet him in person.

426
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,710
Understood.

427
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,740
I've been investigating

428
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,730
who managed to infiltrate

429
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,090
the Keelung Work Committee
within 2 weeks,

430
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,830
which led to its complete destruction.

431
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,100
Did you find out?

432
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,510
His name is Gu Zhengwen.

433
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,880
He's the head of the BIS
Counterintelligence Section.

434
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,340
If you ever deal with him in the future,

435
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,770
remember, never underestimate him.

436
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,070
I understand.

437
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,510
The East Sea Team

438
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,360
is now in your hands.

439
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,560

is established today!

467
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,600
Our army was intercepting
on multiple fronts. The battle was fierce.

468
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,730
Commander Tang Enbo states that

469
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,270
the Kinmen and Xiamen are as unassailable
as ironclad fortresses.

Hurry up and send it

What? Just one aircraft?

473
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,360
Send it out anyway.

474
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,060
Have you managed to contact Tang Enbo?

475
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,670
Not yet.

476
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,570
Keep trying.

477
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,320
Yes, sir.

478
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,750
Senior.

479
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,320
Xiamen has fallen.

480
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,060
Didn't Tang Enbo claim
that his Xiamen fortress

481
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,620
was impregnable?

482
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,010
Didn't he say it could hold for 3
to 5 years without any problem?

483
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,210
It's only been 3 days!

484
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,570
The Communist Army

485
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,070
used feint attacks

486
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,420
to tie up Commander Tang's reserve forces

487
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,350
and established a landing field
in northern Kinmen.

488
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,970
General Chen only found out

489
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,080
when he received a call from the director
of Xiamen Telecommunications Bureau

490
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,430
that Communist troops
had already entered the city.

491
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,760
What about casualties?

492
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,460
Can our troops withdraw?

493
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,920
Sir, at present, it can be confirmed

494
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,060
that the 74th Division

in northern Kinmen,

496
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,160
as well as the 29th Division
in the city area

497
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,900
and on Gulangyu,
have all been completely wiped out.

498
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,250
The remnants of the 68th

499
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,400
and 96th Armies
in southern Kinmen are in grave peril.

500
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,860
Only the 166th Division
remained relatively intact,

501

502

503

a single unit to rush to Kinmen's aid.

520

to turn their ships around
and hasten to Kinmen.

537
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,090
Yes, sir.

538
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,980
Good. We've finally
addressed this urgent crisis.

539

Yuxun.

540
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,010
This time

541
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,210
you and the President
are thinking alike again.

542
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,380
No wonder you're the President's
handpicked top scholar.

543
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,040
You flatter me, General Chen.

544
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,230
General Chen has always
been decisive in military matters.

545
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,090
No need to be so modest, Senior.

546
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,010
In short,

547
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,120
now our Army in Kinmen

548
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,690
suddenly has over 60,000 elite troops.

549
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,060
And the Communist forces
have neither navy nor air force.

550
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,380
Even if Ye Fei

551
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,080
were to hurl the entire
10th Corps, 100,000 troops,

552
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,690
onto Kinmen Island,

553
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,600
they would surely never return.

554
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,050
Gentlemen, for Boyu's counterattack

555
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,520
to succeed brilliantly,

556
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,630
be absolutely silent
and maintain strict secrecy.

557
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,720
The content of today's meeting

558
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,410
is restricted to everyone present.

559
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
General Chen, you can rest assured.

560
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,730
Among us,

561
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,730
could there possibly be Communist spies?

562
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,530
Senior.

563
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,780
Chief.

564
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,590
To be honest,

565
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,620
when I learned today
that Xiamen had fallen,

566
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,880
I truly felt that there was no way
to defend Fujian any longer.

567
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,620
Look,

568
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,430
Xiamen has an airport,
fortresses, and a city,

569
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,400
yet it only held out for 3 days.

570
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,120
What does Kinmen have?

571
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,880
Just defeated troops.

572
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,820
Now it's fine.

573
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,760
As Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force,

574
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,560
I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

575
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,300
Yes, yes.

576
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Come to my office.

577
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,890
I just got some Dongding oolong tea.

578
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,930
Let's brew a nice pot of tea,

579
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,530
relax a bit,

580
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,710
and have a chat. Come on.

581
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,300
Chief.

582
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
Let's have tea another day.

583
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,160
Maybe it's because
I've been too stressed lately

584
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,660
that I've been feeling dizzy,

585
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,190
and my blood pressure has remained high.

586
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,490
I'd like to request some time off

587
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,990
to visit the hospital.

588
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,360
You should go right away.

589
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,030
You've been on duty for several nights.

590
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,400
At our age,

591
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,160
we're no longer like we were back
at Baoding Military Academy.

592
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,470
Yes.

593
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,600
Health comes first.

594
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,810
Go quickly.

595
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,150
I'll have someone
send the tea to you later.

596
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:21,880
Thank you.

597
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,530
Contact Zhang immediately

598
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,460
and change into civilian clothes.

599
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,060
Sir.

600
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,860
Today isn't our scheduled meeting day.

601
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,850
This last-minute arrangement
isn't well-prepared.

602
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,910
I'm worried there might be problems.

603
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,850
There's no time.

604
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,170
Chen Cheng has ordered

605
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,910
Hu Lian's two armies to reinforce Kinmen.

606
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,300
The garrison forces have tripled.

607
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,090
Amphibious landing operations

608
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,030
are the PLA's weakest point.

609
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,510
If the intelligence
about Hu Lian's reinforcements

610
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,580
doesn't get out,

611
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,490
the PLA, without
any command of the sea or air

612
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,150
and lacking defense in depth,

613
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,580
who was preparing to attack
20,000 defending troops,

614
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,170
will launch a desperate assault
against a beachhead

615
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,880
held by 60,000 elite forces.

616
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,360
The consequences would be unimaginable.

617
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,890
Then we must take this risk.

618
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,500
After the meeting,
Zhang needs to return to Keelung.

619
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
It will definitely be after curfew.

620
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,170
I'll get him a pass first,

621
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,970
then accompany you to the hospital.

622
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,900
There's no time.

623
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,870
Take me to the hospital first.

624
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,240
Get the pass afterward,

625
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,570
then come back to pick me up.

626
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,140
But I'm worried about your safety.

627
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,260
It's fine. Since Sui left,

628
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,490
I've met with Zhang Hao
at the hospital three times.

629
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,770
He's very experienced.

630
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,030
If there's any danger,

631
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,750
he won't meet with me.

00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,730
Back off!

661
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,290
Don't hurt Deputy Chief Wu!

662
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,370
Deputy Chief?

663
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,410
So that's why all this commotion.

664
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,580
Open the door!

665
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,450
Open it!

666
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,380
Open it!

667
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,630
Alright.

668
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,540
Don't do anything rash.

669
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,280
Hurry up!

670
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,130
Step back!

671
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,700
Stop!

672
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,740
Back off!

673
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,630
Hurry!

674
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,400
Quick, get in the car!

675
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,070
Get in!

676
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,180
Quick, after them!

677
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,500
They won't dare shoot while I'm here.

678
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,510
It's all my fault.

679
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,700
I was careless.

680
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,430
No.

681
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,700
Thanks to you for noticing.

682
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,860
What kind of driving is that?

683
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,030
So recklessly fast!

684
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,150
Don't shoot!
Deputy Chief Wu is in the car!

685
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,430
Go! Go!

686
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,980
The Leader fired!

687
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,240
Somebody's shooting!

688
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,680
Murder!

689
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,090
Who fired the shot?

690
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,480
Who fired first?

691
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:39,920
I...

692
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,770
Deputy Chief Wu, I...

693
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,580
Deputy Chief Wu, I...

694
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,400
Deputy Chief Wu, I...

695
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,340
It was me!

696
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,590
I fired it.

697
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,860
You fired first?

698
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,320
Yes.

699
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,740
I am

700
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,450
Gu Zhengwen, leader
of the Counterintelligence Section at BIS.

701
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,250
I failed to control my subordinates.

702
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,110
I apologize for frightening you.

703
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:16,370
[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics
of the Ministry of Defense]

704
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,180
The Deputy Chief
of the Ministry of Defense

705
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,630
sit in a car
given by General Chen Cheng,

706
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,380
and you dared to shoot at him?

707
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,450
Who gave you such courage?

708
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,290
Aren't you afraid of dying

709
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,240
by firing at him?

710
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,990
There aren't many Deputy Chiefs

711
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,380
in the Ministry of Defense.

712
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,770
How could it be such a coincidence

713
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,040
that he showed up
at a Communist spy meeting point?

714
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,570
How is it such a coincidence

715
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,460
that he was held hostage
by a Communist spy?

716
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,250
Do you really think this is a coincidence?

717
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,530
We monitored Zhang Hao's residence

718
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,470
in Keelung.

719
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,530
After receiving a phone call,

720
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,570
he immediately followed the instructions

721
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,400
and rushed to
the National Taiwan University Hospital

722
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,610
to meet someone

723
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,690
under the pretext of selling penicillin.

724
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,090
Afraid of alerting them,

725
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,340
we went to the hospital early
to set up an ambush.

726
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,010
That day,

727
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,460
Zhang Hao tried to sell penicillin

728
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,590
to 4 people in total.

729
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,590
The other 3 have already been

730
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,790
taken back
to our section for investigation.

731
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,800
They've basically been cleared
of Communist connections.

732
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,620
Currently, the most suspicious person

733
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,850
is Deputy Chief Wu.

734
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,900
Did you trace
the source of the phone call?

735
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,260
Did you hear the conversation

736
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,400
between Deputy Chief Wu and Zhang Hao?

737
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,110
Also,

738
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,320
did you find any evidence

739
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,970
on Zhang Hao?

740
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,690
Nothing at all.

741
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
Then it's just hearsay.

742
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,490
How am I supposed to
explain this to my superiors?

743
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,450
That man used a public phone

744
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,700
and his voice was disguised.

745
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,160
Enough.

746
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,960
You can see how cunning they are.

747
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,950
You may leave.

748
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,130
Yes, sir.

749
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,050
Connect me with

750
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,640
Deputy Chief Wu Shi.

751
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,740
Deputy Chief Wu, this is Mao Renfeng.
