From November 1st, 1949

4
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,020
to December 27th, 1949,

5
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,240
the PLA spent 57 days

6
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,780
liberating most parts of Sichuan, Xikang,
Yunnan and Guizhou,

as well as over 500 cities and towns

in Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi and Gansu.

Chiang Kai-shek personally
directed the battles,

10
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,570
yet he could not reverse
the tide of defeat.

11

On December 10th,

12
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,079
he flew from Chengdu to Taiwan,

13

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,450
These are several plans
from the Ministry of Defense about

17
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,470
recapturing Kunming
and punishing the traitor Lu Han,

18
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,740
including deploying troops
from nearby areas to close in on Kunming

19
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,740
and carrying out
a direct air force bombing

20
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,580
on Wuhua Mountain
where the Yunnan Provincial Government is.

21
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,040
It seems everyone
at the Ministry of Defense

22
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,760
is filled with righteous indignation.

23

We're just waiting for your order,
President.

24

To suppress the rebellion
and save the nation,

27
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,230
punishing Lu Han alone
is far from enough.

28

for the air force.

and there is the deciphered content
of the telegram.

32
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,190

in the military top brass.

Director.

36
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,630
The terrain in Taichung's
mountainous areas is complex.

37
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,030
And inter-village transportation
is often inconvenient.

38
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,410
Posing as a school teacher,

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,970
I built closer relations
with local villagers.

40
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,840
Through extensive investigations,

41
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,800
it wasn't until recently

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,020
that I discovered that a group of people,

43
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,120
under the pretext of land reclamation,

44
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,300
were engaging in large-scale purchases

45
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,950
of weapons left behind
by the Japanese army.

46
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,420
Combined with the previously collected
information,

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,450
I think that

48
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,950
one of armed bases
of the Communist spies

49
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,800
is likely located in the area
between Zhuzikeng and Baimao Mountain.

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,920
As for the exact location,

51
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,540
we still need
further detailed investigations.

52
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,310
You go compile this into a document.

53
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,070
I'll send others
to conduct the investigation.

54
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,600
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,980
Now that the Nationalist Army
keeps retreating in defeat,

56
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,450
intelligence personnel
from all over the country

57
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,060
have come to Taiwan.

58
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:48,820
But in Taiwan,

59
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,010
there can't be
too many Communist spies.

60
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,610
We don't need so many people.

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,740
So rectification and downsizing
are imperative.

62
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,010
Only those who deliver results
get to keep their positions.

63

with the Guangming News case.

66

It's time to reopen the Zhang Hao case.

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,450
Well,

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,100

wasn't in vain.

72
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,320
the Section 4 deciphered a telegram
that was intercepted

73
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,740
on September 21st.

74
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,020
It contained military deployments
for Kinmen and Xiamen.

75
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,400
And according to Liu Kangfu's confession,

76
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,930
he was sending the telegram

77
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,540
to a Communist spy team called East Sea.

78
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,930
So I suspect that the East Sea

79
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,530
is hiding within the upper echelons
of the Nationalist Government.

80
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,470
Comrade Jianfeng has agreed

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,470
that from now on,

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,390
you'll be reinstated
to your original position.

83

It's short by about 100 kg.

88
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,010
That can't be right.

89
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,570
Did you count wrong?

90
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,460
How could I possibly count wrong?

91

Captain Liu.

92
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,560
You can't keep giving us less each month.

93

That's not proper, right?

94
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,440
There're so many men in my team.

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,500
How am I supposed
to distribute this?

96
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm just the delivery man.

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,440
I deliver exactly
what is allocated to you.

98

We're colleagues working together.

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,850
I wouldn't cut your food short,

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,800
would I?

101
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm off.

102
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,160
Captain Liu!

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,540
The numbers just don't add up.

104
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,600
What do you mean?

105
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,880
If you're not satisfied,

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,950
I'll just take it all back.

107
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,270
I can just send someone else
to drop it off,

108
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,760
and it'll end up another 100 kg short.

109
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,250
It's not about my satisfaction.

110
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,130
There are so many people in my team.

111
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,390
We can let everyone see

112
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,480
if it gets less and less each month.

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,690

Lianwang, come take a look.

117
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,000
See if they're skimming off
the army rations.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,060
I don't really understand
these things.

119

How can you not understand this?
Come here.

Nobody wants to get involved.

126

In the army, it's always the superiors

that take advantage
of the ones below them.

If you don't make up the shortage today,

By the way,

149
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,340
here's some money,
which is not much to share.

150
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,670
Take it and get everyone something to eat.

151
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,670
Captain Liu.

152
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,320
If there's really not enough food
for us,

153
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,110
just take all this away.

154
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,480
That won't be necessary, Mr. Gu.

155
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,980
No need.

156
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,510
I mean it.

When there's a proper opportunity later,

158
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,590
I'll get more for you to make up for it.

159
00:07:59,590 --> 00:07:59,990

I thank you on behalf of everyone.

You've finally returned.

166

You don't know when you were gone...

167
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,070

on these small matters.

Get me the schedule number

169
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,300
for the Ping'an Ship. I need it.

170
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,980
Help me take the stuff upstairs.

171
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,060
Be careful!

172
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

173
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:31,910
Leader.

174
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going to read the newspaper.

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm going to read the newspaper
for a while.

176
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,549
Be good.

177
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:06,340
[Communist Party Members' Remains
Were Found on Coast After Over Ten Days]

178
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,920
At 10 PM on September 19th,

179
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,280
it arrived at Keelung Harbor.

180
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,310
It departed at 6 AM on the 21st.

181
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,240
Leader, I found it.

182
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,010
So Zhang Hao

183
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,030
sent the telegram right after

184
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,700
the ship departed on the 21st.

185
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,680
But at 10 PM on the 19th,

186
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,310
the ship arrived in Keelung.

187
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,350
Keelung was under curfew at that time.

188
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,320
That means

189
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,440
he could only get the content
for the telegram

190
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,900
during the daytime of the 20th.

191
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,980
What telegram?

192
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,690
It has been deciphered!

193
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,240
Take Liu Kangfu
to the interrogation room.

194
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,890
Do you know why you're here?

195
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,910
I previously

196
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,700
ruined your big plan.

197
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,330
And now this is my chance
to atone for my mistakes.

198
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,030
It's not some big plan.

199
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,930
Things are always changing.

200
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,930
It's not all your fault.

201
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,300
This time your mission is very simple.

202
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,150
You just need to

203
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,740
tell me every single detail

204
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,250
about Zhang Hao and you

205
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,670
since you met,

206
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,960
including what he said,

207
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,650
what he did,

208
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,620
even what clothes he wore,

209
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,320
and his habitual phrases

210
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,220
and gestures.

211
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,530
Tell me everything in detail.

212
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,410
Okay, I'll tell you.

213
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,870
I'll tell you everything.

214
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,580
I first met Zhang Hao

215
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,670
at the end of August.

216
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,130
At that time, I had been assigned to work

217
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,370
on the Ping'an Ship
by the Taiwan Work Committee

218
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,770
for more than two months.

219
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,890
He was the first mate on the ship.

220
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,340
Right.

221
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,830
I was practicing
throwing mooring lines that day

222
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,860
when he suddenly came up to me.

223
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,180
Deputy Chief Wu.

224
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,960
Deputy Chief Wu.

225
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,030
The Chief hasn't returned yet?

226
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,840
Not yet.

227
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,270
There's no meeting
at the ministry today.

228
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,530
Where did he go for a meeting?

229
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,740
I'm not quite sure about the details.

230
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,670
How about I call you
when the Chief returns?

231
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,120
You're the First Secretary.

232
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,180
And you don't know?

233
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,100
General Huang Jie has sent
three urgent telegrams in one day.

234
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,940
I'm waiting for the Chief's decision.

235
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,620
Well...

236
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,880
The Chief went to the Hsinchu base
for a meeting.

237
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,250
He specifically ordered
that no one should disturb him.

238
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,540
Fine.

239
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,810
Let me know as soon as he returns.

240
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,360
Yes, sir!

241
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,740
September 20th?

242
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,680
The question is so sudden

243
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,200
that I can't remember now.

244
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,050
It has been over three months.

245
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:26,910
It has indeed been

246
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,970
over three months.

247
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,530
But look,

248
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,560
the Ping'an Ship arrived at Keelung Harbor

249
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,050
on the evening of the 19th.

250
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,620
But in the early morning of the 21st,

251
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,790
it left Keelung Harbor for Guangzhou.

252
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,530
That means Zhang Hao

253
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,000
could only have gone to Taipei

254
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,120
during the day on the 20th.

255
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Now that you mention it, I remember.

256
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,140
That docking was particularly hasty.

257
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,610
We weren't allowed
to get off the ship at all.

258
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,640
As for whether Zhang Hao got off

259
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
or where he went,

260
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,120
I have no idea.

261
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,540
Mr. Gu,

262
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,120
I've only met Zhang Hao

263
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,910
a few times in total.

264
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,240
I've already told you everything I know

265
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,860
and I can remember.

266
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,090
I believe you.

267
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,320
Was there any informal contact

268
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,870
between Zhang Hao and you

269
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,030
that was not related to your party work

270
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,440
or your duties on the Ping'an Ship?

271
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,290
Now that you mention it,
there was indeed one time.

272
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,570
When I was eating
at a restaurant in Keelung,

273
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,700
I ran into Zhang Hao.

274
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,480
When was this?

275
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,670
Who did he meet?

276
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,670
Did he see you?

277
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,280
It was probably also in late September.

278
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,670
I really don't remember what he was doing.

279
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,580
I was sitting in the restaurant.

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,460
He probably didn't see me.

281
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,870
It was very hot that day.

282
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,150
There were a lot of salted fish
drying on the street,

283
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,880
with a fishy smell everywhere.

284
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,410
What did you eat?

285
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,960
Sanxian Noodles.

286
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,280
Sir.

287
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,240
You think there's something wrong
with Zhou Zhirou

288
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
rushing to Hsinchu for the meeting?

289
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,940
It's definitely unusual.

290
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,800
It seems that

291
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,830
the air force will take action soon.

292
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
That's possible.

293
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,000
Mr. Chiang

294
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,290
is furious about Lu Han's uprising.

295
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,890
Is the air force planning to retaliate
against Lu Han

296
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,020
by bombing Kunming?

297
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,620
Or will they send the air force

298
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,330
to support Hu Zongnan
at the Chengdu front?

299
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,320
China is so vast.

300
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,900
We can't rule out that Mr. Chiang
might have other plans.

301
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,790
Mr. Gu, aren't you eating?

302
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,760
Never mind. I'm not hungry anyway.

303
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,230
It tastes good?

304
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,050
It's fine.

305
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,130
Both taste

306
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,630
and smell

307
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,530
can help you remember.

308
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,710
Have you thought of anything?

309
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,100
No.

310
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,980
That's okay.

311
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,100
Well then...

312
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,030
When you saw Zhang Hao that day,

313
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,980
was he right in front of you

314
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,100
or was he on your

315
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,650
left

316
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,510
or right?

317
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,670
Right.

318
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,570
On your right?

319
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,440
On your right.

320
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,070
On your left?

321
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,700
This side.

322
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,270
On your left.

323
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,740
You were eating Sanxian Noodles that day.

324
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,890
You turned your head to the left

325
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,670
and saw Zhang Hao.

326
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,290
Xiaonan.

327
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,010
Come here.

328
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,750
Stand here.

329
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,140
Hurry.

330
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,120
You play Zhang Hao. Here.

331
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,290
Was Zhang Hao talking with...

332
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,840
Yes.

333
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,740
So Zhang Hao was talking to someone

334
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,360
and you couldn't see that person

335
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,960
due to this position, right?

336
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,780
That person was behind the wall.

337
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,510
There was a wall on this side?

338
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:33,890
Yes.

339
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,960
No wonder.

340
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,280
Turn around.

341
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,340
-Turn around.
-Yeah.

342
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,410
Right. Zhang Hao turned around,

343
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,740
and that's how I saw him.

344
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,270
I remember that day

345
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,500
he seemed reluctant to leave.

346
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,670
Reluctant to leave?

347
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,650
Well, it seems

348
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,630
the person behind the wall

349
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,670
had a special relationship with Zhang Hao.

350
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,829
I'll take you to Keelung Harbor tomorrow.

351
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,160
Wait.

352
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
I think it's here.

353
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,300
Don't stop now.

354
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,030
Find a place to pull over ahead.

355
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,950
I remember it was around here.

356
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,270
There were many snack stands

357
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,400
in this area.

358
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,200
Here.

359
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,330
This way.

360
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,140
I was sitting right in this spot

361
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,170
and he was standing over there.

362
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,340
Isn't this on your right?

363
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,960
Sorry, I made a mistake.

364
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,050
So you were looking

365
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,210
at that direction?

366
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,640
Yes.

367
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,570
Are you sure?

368
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
Definitely. Right here.

369
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,410
Let me know if you have dried oysters.

370
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,900
Hold this.

371
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,870
Thank you.

372
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,700
Hello.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,720
Hello.

374
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,870
What kind of fish is this?

375
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,500
It's the local Sipo fish,

376
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,630
also called Balang.

377
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,380
It adds great flavor to congee and soup.

378
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,510
I was worried
you couldn't understand what I said.

379
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,970
Are you not a local either?

380
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,480
In business, customers come

381
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,810
from all over the world.

382
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,570
Learning some local dialect
helps with business, right?

383
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,250
Yes, indeed.

384
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,540
I'll take some of this.

385
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,080
Sure.

386
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,380
These are good.

387
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,780
Let me weigh some for you.

388
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,640
Great.

389
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,380
Leader,

390
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,370
do you think there's something wrong
with this shop?

391
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,330
Why isn't Mrs. Ma here today?

392
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,250
She loves playing mahjong the most,
doesn't she?

393
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,380
Director Ma has got another mistress.

394
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,130
Director Ma is such a playboy.
He changes mistresses every month.

395
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,900
You really don't want to know

396
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,090
who that woman is?

397
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,070
Who is she?

398
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,160
The the lead songstress at Huadu Ballroom.

399
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,820
She's also an air force widow.

400
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,250
She was a college student.

401
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,010
After graduation, she married a pilot.

402
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,250
The day after their wedding,

403
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,360
her husband's plane
fell from the sky.

404
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,220
She came to Taiwan
and became a songstress.

405
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,140
I've seen her.

406
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,010
She's incredibly beautiful.

407
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,510
No wonder Director Ma can't resist her

408
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,720
and never goes home.

409
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,330
Mrs. Huang, would you play for me
for a while?

410
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,550
I suddenly got a headache.

411
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,880
I'll go rest over there.

412
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,340
All right, I'll take over.

413
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,520
Where do you pick up
all these gossipy bits?

414
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,980
My husband told me!

415
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,790
His job is basically gathering information

416
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,440
about others, isn't it?

417
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,550
Your husband knows

418
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,960
so much gossip.

419
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,080
Aren't you afraid he might

420
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,210
follow Director Ma to Huadu Ballroom?

421
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,250
If he really wants to do that,

422
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,780
how can I possibly stop him?

423
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,590
As long as he doesn't bring
his mistress home, it's fine.

424
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,920
You're so open-minded.

425
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,700
What else can I do?

426
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,960
That's true.

427
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,350
You can't exactly

428
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,210
tie your husband down with a rope.

429
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,400
Mrs. Wu, I really envy you.

430
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,960
You never have to worry about such things,

431
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,490
right?

432
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,030
My husband also said

433
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,930
that Deputy Chief Wu is a really good man,

434
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,740
who never flirts with other women

435
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,340
and only focuses on his work.

436
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,040
Exactly.

437
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,200
I've heard that too.

438
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,820
You can't judge people by appearances.

439
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,400
I've heard that

440
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,640
a woman went
to Power Company Guesthouse

441
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,900
to see Deputy Chief Wu.

442
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,810
Keep your voice down.

443
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,310
Your husband is really something,

444
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,770
spying even
on his superior's personal life.

445
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,010
Deputy Chief Wu?

446
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,480
Didn't he just move?

447
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,570
Could it have been a female colleague
or something?

448
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,700
She was dressed like a rich madam,

449
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,980
so she definitely is not a colleague.

450
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,680
Enough.

451
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,830
Stop gossiping behind people's backs.

452
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,680
Mrs. Dou.

453
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,110
I'm really sorry,

454
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,750
but I'm just too tired.

455
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,230
I'll leave first, okay?

456
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,600
Please enjoy yourselves.

457
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,440
Goodbye, Mrs. Wu.

458
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,210
See you next time.

459
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,050
Alright, goodbye.

460
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,880
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

461
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,590
Liu, bring Mrs. Wu's shawl over here.

462
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,550
Coming.

463
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,720
Here. Give it to me.

464
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,080
Thank you.

465
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,290
I'm sorry about today.

466
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,370
I've ruined everyone's mood.

467
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,070
Not at all.

468
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,720
You're always welcome here.

469
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,770
It's my fault.

470
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,480
I should invite just anyone to my home.

471
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,180
It's fine.

472
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,110
Go back inside.

473
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,400
Goodbye.

474
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,330
She's angry with me?

475
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
Did I say something wrong?

476
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,550
Liu,

477
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,700
bring Mrs. Duan's coat over here.

478
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,000
She should be leaving too.

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,730
I'm a straightforward person.

480
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,150
I hate gossip the most.

481
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,740
You're no longer welcome at Dou's Mansion.

482
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,540
Please leave.

483
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,990
How could you be like this?

484
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,330
Why is it so hard

485
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,930
to tell the truth these days?

486
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,720
When your husband becomes

487
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,130
Deputy Chief Duan, then we'll talk.

488
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,340
Madam, you're back.

489
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,920
Didn't you go to Dou's Mansion
to play mahjong?

490
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,420
Why are you back so early?

491
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,720
You didn't work overtime today?

492
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,250
No. We've made that agreement, haven't we?

493
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,710
I should come home on time.

494
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,670
Nice talk.

495
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,550
I'd rather believe pigs can fly

496
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,410
than believe a man's smooth talk.

497
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,440
What's wrong?

498
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,250
Did you hear something
at Dou's Mansion?

499
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,070
All these years you've worked
so hard outside.

500
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,800
I know that and understand you.

501
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,090
For a high-ranking official like you,

502
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,250
it's normal to have a mistress.

503
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,840
But I only have one request.

504
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,060
Don't lie to me.

505
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,570
Did you hear something from those madams?

506
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
What did they say?

507
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,680
Mrs. Ma wasn't there today.

508
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
And they said that

509
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,090
Director Ma got another mistress.

510
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,170
Then Mrs. Dou said she envied me.

511
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,590
But Mrs. Duan sitting nearby

512
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,910
started to stir things up,

513
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,960
saying something ridiculous.

514
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,550
Which madam?

515
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,530
Mrs. Duan.

516
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,930
What ridiculous things did she say?

517
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,030
Don't ask anymore.

518
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,990
It was nothing.

519
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,500
Yuxun.

520
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,180
I only have one request.

521
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
No matter what,

522
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,180
don't lie to me.

523
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,100
Bikui.

524
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,940
We met and fell in love when you were 18.

525
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,130
We've been married for 30 years.

526
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,130
Doesn't all of this

527
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,120
outweigh their gossip?

528
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,270
I shouldn't have listened to them.

529
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,980
I shouldn't have listened.

530
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,520
It was nonsense.

531
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Come on, Bikui.

532
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,750
Listen to this.

533
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,230
No matter what you hear,

534
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,890
you must believe

535
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,660
I won't lie to you.

536
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,980
Trust me.

537
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,080
Your hairstyle looks beautiful.

538
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,350
Morning, Sir.

539
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,020
Duan Tuizhi is investigating Mrs. Chen.

540
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,340
Just because of what happened
at Power Company Guesthouse?

541
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,000
At that time,
she claimed to be my wife's friend.

542
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,810
If the investigation continues,
her cover will be blown soon.

543
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,030
So we must send her back.

544
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,510
Get her the exit permit
as soon as possible.

545
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,970
Alright. I'll do it today.

546
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:46,070
[Deputy Chief's Wife Leads Christmas
Charity Sale to Support Zhoushan]

547
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,760
Many people know about the telegram

548
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,190
regarding Kinmen and Xiamen.

549
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,380
Are you still suspecting Deputy Chief Wu?

550
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,030
There are indeed quite a few people
with access to the deployment information

551
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,980
in Kinmen and Xiaman.

552
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,770
But...

553
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,530
But only Deputy Chief Wu

554
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,000
also had the chance

555
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,030
to meet Zhang Hao on September 20th

556
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,680
and also actually met Zhang Hao

557
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,640
at the entrance of NTUH.

558
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,610
What does this have to do
with this Mr. Lin?

559
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,820
I suspect that the person Zhang Hao met

560
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,870
at Sanrong Trading in September
was Lin Yiliang.

561
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,420
And according to Liu Kangfu,

562
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,740
these two had a deep connection.

563
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,880
I believe

564
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,540
they might be brothers

565
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,770
or

566
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,980
Communist spy partners
having worked together for a long time.

567
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,880
But regardless of their relationship,

568
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,490
as long as we investigate him thoroughly,

569
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,110
it will lead to a major breakthrough
in the case.

570
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,040
Birds of a feather flock together.

571
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,570
This kind of situation

572
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,610
is quite common.

573
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,670
It's not enough.

574
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,620
It's still too peripheral.

575
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,010
Since you're suspecting Deputy Chief Wu,

576
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,980
you must get the first-hand information.

577
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,870
Yes, sir. I'm working on it.

578
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,830
Where else can we
find such a good employer

579
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,110
who even works alongside us?

580
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,310
Anywhere else,
we'd have to carry everything ourselves.

581
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,600
What are you looking at?

582
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,030
Keep working.

583
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
I've been working all along.

584
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,470
The sooner you finish,
the sooner you get paid.

585
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,790
Just put it by the door.

586
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,290
Put it by the door too.

587
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,620
Hello. What are you doing?

588
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,990
I need to use the restroom.

589
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,840
Wait.

590
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,310
This way, please.

591
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,510
No, the one inside...

592
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,860
Turn left here,
and you'll find it to your right.

593
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,450
The staff in the shop are very vigilant.

594
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,180
And they're also very tight-lipped.

595
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,980
I've been looking for a chance,

596
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,740
but I couldn't even get one foot inside.

597
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,310
Leader,

598
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,230
I think

599
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,060
there's definitely something fishy
about the shop.

600
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,740
Alright, let me sum this up for you.

601
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,640
So with an ordinary identity,

602
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,170
you can't go inside, right?

603
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,310
Yes.

604
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,650
I think

605
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,110
Sanrong Trading

606
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,610
is impenetrable

607
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,770
and sealed off.

608
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,070
For us to break in

609
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,970
is indeed quite difficult.

610
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,720
How many Keelung Work Committee members

611
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,780
we arrested for the Guangming News case

612
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,480
are still in custody?

613
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,440
About 30.

614
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,550
About 30.

615
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,350
You mean

616
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,470
we'll pretend to be
from the Keelung Work Committee, right?

617
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,690
That's a great idea, Leader.

618
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,140
I've been wrongly accused.

619
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,300
I didn't do it!

620
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,160
Please.

621
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,380
Let me go!

622
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,040
Please release me!

623
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,220
It really wasn't me!

624
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,530
Mr. Zhuang.

625
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,190
It has been a long time.

626
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,630
You've lost weight.

627
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,770
No, no, no.

628
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You bastard.

629
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,140
Forty-seven lives lost

630
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,140
at Keelung Middle School.

631
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,550
Can you sleep at night?

632
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,330
Yes, I can.

633
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,570
You know, I'm also a materialist.

634
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,880
You'll die a terrible death.

635
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,170
It really is suitable.

636
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,780
Bring him out.

637
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,940
Let's stop here for today.

638
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,310
Deputy Chief Wu, please stay.

639
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,440
Senior.

640
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,530
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told me

641
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,640
that the French government

642
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,220
finally agreed to let Huang Jie's corps
withdraw to Vietnam.

643
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,910
That's good.

644
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,340
Better to get some back than none.

645
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,600
It's better than letting Lin Biao

646
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,430
capture 30,000 more men.

647
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,240
The condition is

648
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,180
that the troops
must surrender their weapons.

649
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,510
Surrender the weapons?

650
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,630
Surrender the weapons to the French?

651
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,280
Come in.

652
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,140
Leader, you wanted to see me?

653
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,570
Have a seat.

654
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,140
How has your harvest been lately?

655
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,240
W-What harvest?

656
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,070
I heard that

657
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,880
you've been frequently helping out
at the Operations Division lately.

658
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,570
Leader,

659
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,850
I didn't keep it all to myself.

660
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,350
While you were away,

661
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,000
our colleagues were almost out of food.

662
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,010
So I came up with a way

663
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,739
to improve everyone's living conditions.

664
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,630
Do you remember

665
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,030
the full name of our team?

666
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,130
The Counterintelligence Section
of the BIS.

667
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,880
The Counterintelligence Section
of the BIS

668
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,290
actually has a very short history.

669
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,310
When you were still at the Taiwan station,

670
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,800
it was just a unit
under the Operations Division.

671
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
After the Guangming News case,

672
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,590
the Director appreciated

673
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,090
our competence
in capturing Communist spies,

674
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,670
so he made our team a separate section.

675
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:52,780
However,

676
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,590
if

677
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,340
our future work doesn't go smoothly

678
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,400
and we fail to catch Communist spies,

679
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,800
then I'm afraid you'll end up
on the streets

680
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,080
checking IDs.

681
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,270
Just as you said,

682
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,840
"I speak both Mandarin and Hokkien,

683
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,140
which comes in handy,

684
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,590
while Yu Xiaonan is so inarticulate

685
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,940
that he can't even check IDs properly."

686
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,220
Leader,

687
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,560
how did you know that?

688
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,260
Isn't this what you said?

689
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,640
I believe those were your exact words.

690
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,330
I'm sorry, Leader.

691
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,550
I...

692
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,800
I was indeed speaking out of turn.

693
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,830
How is that speaking out of turn?

694
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,050
It was precisely
because you have these skills

695
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,630
that I specifically transferred you here

696
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,820
from Director Ye.

697
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,050
You're overthinking it. It's fine.

698
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,830
Sit down.

699
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,840
Even if

700
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,810
the Ministry of Defense

701
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,670
orders Huang Jie's corps
not to surrender their weapons

702
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,070
and hold their position,

703
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,800
do you think they would listen?

704
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,440
They've fled all the way from Hunan,

705
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,110
running over 1,000 kilometers.

706
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,210
They're just one step away
from crossing the border

707
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,170
to safety.

708
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:06,940
Huang Jie's corps

709
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,650
had been retreating
under the PLA's pursuit.

710
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,500
They could only detour through Vietnam

711
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,680
to return to Taiwan.

712
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,710
Wu Shi had approached Zhou Zhirou
several times before

713
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,640
but failed to get any information.

714
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,570
Now that Zhou Zhirou brought up
the matter himself,

715
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,260
Wu Shi keenly realized

716
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,710
this was the perfect opportunity
to pry into the air force's

717
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,770
secret operation.

718
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,320
Wu Shi then seized the chance,

719
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,900
using his opposition to Huang Jie's corps

720
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,230
surrendering their weapons to the French

721
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,420
to probe Zhou Zhirou's true thoughts
on the matter

722
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,380
and then act accordingly.

723
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,630
In any case, it's better than

724
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,670
being annihilated
by the Communist Army, isn't it?

725
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,500
Chief,

726
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,250
what are you going to do?

727
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,440
After Huang Jie's corps
surrender their weapons,

728
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,860
they'll assemble and stand by
in Haiphong, Vietnam.

729
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,190
This involves many parties.

730
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,730
Therefore,

731
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,340
someone from our ministry
must take charge.

732
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,440
I'll have to trouble you

733
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,940
to coordinate with various parties.

734
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,190
Yes.

735
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,560
I understand.

736
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,740
I'll take charge of this.

737
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,680
I'll report directly to you.

738
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,230
For 30,000 men,

739
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,650
I need transport ships.

740
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,310
I've made a rough estimation.

741
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
In total,

742
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,930
we need 3 to 10 transport ships.

743
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,070
Good.

744
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,810
You can go
to Director Ma directly.

745
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,640
He is currently in charge
of coordinating military logistics.

746
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,170
If it's really impossible
to arrange the ships,

747
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,880
then we'll have to postpone it.

748
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,310
It cannot be postponed.

749
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,610
Chief.

750
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,740
Huang Jie was the former
Deputy Chief of Staff after all.

751
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,880
If he's really captured,

752
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,650
it'll be embarrassing for all of us.

753
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,570
If we can bring back Huang Jie's corps,

754
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,850
that's 30,000 combat-ready soldiers
after all.

755
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,650
Good.

756
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,800
Then I'll trouble you with this task.

757
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,760
Rest assured. I'll do my best.

758
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,510
I will definitely work hard

759
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,280
and catch more Communist spies for you,

760
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,150
making the Counterintelligence Section
live up to its name.

761
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,070
It's not for me.

762
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,980
Even if you don't say doing it
for our party and our ideology,

763
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,340
you should at least mention doing it

764
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,650
for the welfare of everyone
in our section.

765
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,910
You just said yourself

766
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,370
that you're concerned
about our colleagues' livelihoods.

767
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,100
That's good.

768
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,240
Yes, sir! I'll catch more Communist spies
for our section.

769
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,940
Good.

770
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,120
Weng Lianwang,

771
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,440
I have a mission right now

772
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,150
for you to carry out.

773
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,060
Director Ma, Deputy Chief Wu is here.

774
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,570
Deputy Chief Wu, what brings you here?

775
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,880
Director Ma, what a refined hobby
you have.

776
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,300
Doing this in front of you is really
showing off my poor skills to an expert.

777
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,830
It's just a way to kill time.

778
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,980
This is really something.

779
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,690
Luo Zhenyu.

780
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,910
You're truly an expert.

781
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,800
Sir,

782
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,380
when will you also write
a piece of calligraphy for me?

783
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,000
Director Duan got
a piece of your calligraphy

784
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,530
and keeps showing it off to me.

785
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,480
No problem.

786
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,020
Just tell me what content you want,
and I'll write it for you.

787
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,490
Please, have a seat.

788
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,530
You're a great scholar

789
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,150
and also a master calligrapher.

790
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,350
Anything you write would be wonderful.

791
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,480
Please.

792
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,060
Have some tea.

793
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,480
Recently,

794
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
I managed to get

795
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,730
some precious calligraphy supplies
from Guangzhou.

796
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,480
The rice paper is from Jingxian.

797
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,880
And among them, there was

798
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,810
a Wushi Qiyan ink stick.

799
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,780
That ink stick

800
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,880
is truly rare.

801
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,990
I've already sent someone

802
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,140
to deliver it to Wu's Mansion.

803
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,270
Thank you, Director Ma.

804
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,400
Rice paper is precious,

805
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,540
but soldiers are even more valuable.

806
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,870
Director Ma, you must have guessed

807
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,650
that I came here today

808
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,850
to request your help to bring

809
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,350
Huang Jie's corps back.

810
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,200
Sir, I wouldn't dare call it a request.

811
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,120
The Chief has already informed me.

812
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,160
I was planning

813
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,380
to go to your office later

814
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,480
to report to you personally.

815
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Then I'll get straight to the point.

816
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,640
There are 30,000 men in Huang Jie's corps.

817
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,640
We need at least five transport ships.

818
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,590
You're really putting me
in a difficult position.

819
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,450
Even if you pushed me to the limit,

820
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,620
I still couldn't produce
five transport ships.

821
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
That's not right.

822
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,500
I know

823
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,940
that the military aid from the U.S. alone

824
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,150
included ten transport ships.

825
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,840
My request isn't unreasonable.

826
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,170
Sir,

827
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm just in charge of logistics.

828
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,090
There are too many transport requests now.

829
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,000
I really can't spare any
to allocate to you.

830
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,260
Then what should we do?

831
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,690
We just let

832
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,690
the 30,000 soldiers of Huang Jie's corps

833
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,870
wait in that internment camp in Vietnam?

834
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,150
Every few days, more than ten bodies
are carried out.

835
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,480
This involves

836
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,260
diplomatic affairs

837
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,750
and the image
of the Nationalist Government.

838
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,690
Director Ma,
can you bear the consequences?

839
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,480
Sir,

840
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,570
how about this?

841
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,440
I'll allocate three ships to you first.

842
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:30,980
Would that work?

843
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,100
Director Ma, since this is so difficult
for you,

844
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,020
then just take back the rice paper

845
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,540
and other things you sent to my residence.

846
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,180
If I can't bring back
General Huang's troops,

847
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,800
I won't have many chances

848
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,950
to use such fine paper and ink anymore.

849
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,980
Sir,

850
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,480
please don't leave.

851
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,260
Let me be honest.

852
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,500
I just can't make bricks without straw.

853
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,620
Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue
borrowed the ships

854
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,690
to march forward into Hainan Island

855
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,980
and hasn't returned them yet.

856
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,530
Chief Gu sent a fleet to Guangxi

857
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,480
to pick up Bai Chongxi's troops.

858
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,440
And Chief Zhou

859
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,980
dispatched many transport ships

860
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,460
to Zhoushan.

861
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,210
I don't even have enough ships

862
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,210
to send supplies to Kinmen.

863
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,690
I hope you can understand.

864
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,990
Please, have a seat.

865
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,690
General Hu Lian
has already urged me twice.

866
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,690
Sending supplies to Zhoushan

867
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,440
isn't that urgent, is it?

868
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,500
How about sending those ships
to Vietnam first?

869
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,870
You have no idea.

870
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,190
Of all the ships, those bound for Zhoushan

871
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,070
are the most needed and most urgent.

872
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,870
Everything must be transported
within two weeks.

873
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,670
Director Ma.

874
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,110
What can be more urgent
than my matter?

875
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,650
What can be more important

876
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,980
than the lives of 30,000 soldiers?

877
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,000
Sir,

878
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,840
you have a point.

879
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,030
But Chief Zhou also said

880
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,500
that this shipment of military supplies

881
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,800
is a top priority.
