[Episode 6]

3
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,850
Mr. Gu.

4
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,310
Do you have any clever plans?

5
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,500
I wouldn't call it clever.

6
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,590
According to information,

7
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,310
when this banquet was being prepared,

8
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,840
his communication line was cut off.

9
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,120
He can't reach
any of his Communist spy accomplices

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,250
outside the island,

11
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,650
which means

12
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,090
the contact who comes tonight

13
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,120
can't be on the invitation list.

14
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,850
They confessed everything.

15
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,380
They're from the Hong Kong station
of the BIS.

16
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,370
From the BIS?

17
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,750
Then why were they following me?

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,479
The BIS received information

19
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,640
that Communist spies planned to
sabotage the signing ceremony,

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,120
so they sent people from
the Hong Kong station to investigate

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,720
and to secretly protect you.

22
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,910
So, you're saying

23
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,430
I wronged them?

24
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,640
They did make some mistakes in their work.

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,860
However, thanks to your vigilance,

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,470
it was a close call with no real danger.

27
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,620
Thank you for your hard work.

28
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,960
The Chief certainly
chose the right person.

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,870
You flatter me.

30
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,020
My mission on this trip is
to ensure your safety

31
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,350
and the security of the signing ceremony.

32
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,440
You may go.

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,930
What about those two BIS agents?

34
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,300
They were just doing their duty.

35
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,700
Since they're innocent,

36
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,060
let them go.

37
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,410
Yes, I understand.

38
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
Director Zhang is hedging his bets.

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
Now, not only the BIS,

40
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,420
but the Second Department is
monitoring us, too.

41
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,610
Even if Manager Wan gets into the venue,

42
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,150
it will be difficult for him
to make contact.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,630
This is the floor plan of the ballroom.

44
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,840
We'll need people here,

45
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,000
here, here, here,

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Here, as well.

47
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,950
We need our people at all these positions.

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,690
Mr. Li,

49
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,790
This could be the greatest achievement

50
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,790
since the establishment of the BIS.

51
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,440
I assume you have
more personnel available?

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,630
Sir, the newspaper.

53
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,800
I've checked the list of all the staff

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,260
for tonight's reception.

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,860
There are 39 people in total.

56
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,890
More than ten of them

57
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,800
were replaced within the last three days.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,600
They're probably agents
arranged by Gu Zhengwen.

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,610
Other places will have people, too.
There will definitely be a lot.

60
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,120
What about Gu Zhengwen himself?

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
Haven't seen him yet.

62
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,860
We've caught the crack in it.

63
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,610
The Second Department is
no less capable than the BIS.

64
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,430
We'll soon get

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,920
something on Gu Zhengwen.

66
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,390
I wonder if Manager Wan

67
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,720
has seen the newspaper.

[The 7th China-U.S. Economic Aid Reception]

Ladies and gentlemen.

70
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,659
we are gathered here tonight

71
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,270
to enjoy peace and some fine wine,

72
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,030
and for that, we owe thanks to one man.

73
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,370
He is a distinguished military strategist

74

and my dear friend, General Wu Shi!

75

76
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,540
our gathering is for peace tonight.

77
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,750
I've come to Hong Kong
on behalf of the National Army

78
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,040
to seek peace.

79

Let's raise a toast to China and America

80

I can see you truly have
an extraordinary bearing.

See you. Bye.

120
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,010
Leader, I heard from the on-duty driver

121
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,820
that Deputy Chief Wu's
car schedule for tomorrow

122
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,980
has been completely canceled.

123

The driver who took him tonight

124
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,780
was arranged by the Second Department.

125
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,430
He said after the banquet, Deputy Chief Wu

126
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,650
went straight back to the ship.

127
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,180
He didn't go anywhere else.

128
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,450
Just as I suspected.

129
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,310
The intelligence has probably
been sent out.

The ceremony for receiving military aid
is also completed.

131

There's no legitimate reason
to follow him anymore.

Take a look for me.

134

the same one?

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:31,940
I'll take it.

174
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
Please wrap it up. Thank you.

175
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,560
They're really trying hard.

176
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,840
Let's go.

177
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,010
Isn't this the paper
burned by Xie Zhonghao?

178
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,420
Didn't Section 4 say
it couldn't be restored?

179
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,650
This is the work of

180
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,130
the British MI6.

181
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,080
What? What Six?

182
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,220
MI6.

183
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,770
British Military Intelligence, Section 6.

184
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,550
When you told me about visiting Britain,

185
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,480
it was for this?

186
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,290
Deputy Chief Wu's

187
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,510
trip to Hong Kong—

188
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,890
officially,

189
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,630
he completed his mission
and secured military aid;

190
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,640
privately,

191
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,770
he made contact with his accomplices

192
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,430
and delivered intelligence.

193
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,340
He certainly returned with quite a haul.

194
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,010
With this key,

195
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,040
we'll decipher Zhang Hao's messages
sooner or later.

196
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,220
Is Deputy Chief Wu really a Communist spy?

197
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,740
Could there be a mistake?

198
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,020
Deputy Chief Wu

199
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,340
is actually one of the most skilled

200
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,300
among those Communist spies.

201
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,500
Guiyang: Cloudy,

202
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,960
18 to 25 degrees.

203
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,480
Interrupting with a news bulletin.

204
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,990
Kinmen's Guningtou

205
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,990
came under a sudden landing assault
by Communist troops yesterday.

206
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,380
After fighting all night,
the Nationalist soldiers

207
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,270
are now striving to hold their ground.

208
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,930
Kinmen's defense

209
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,740
is now taken over by Commander Hu Lian.

210
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,480
Where did things go wrong?

211
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,210
Director Tang Enbo will
supervise the handover.

212
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,520
Sir.

213
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,200
[St. Paul's Hospital, Hong Kong]

214
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,580
Apart from slightly high blood pressure,

215
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,640
everything seems fine at the moment.

216
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,370
But

217
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,420
I recommend him to stay in the hospital
for 24 more hours for observation

218
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,520
just in case.

219
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,170
Okay. Thank you, sir.

220
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,640
The doctor says it's nothing serious,

221
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,650
but he recommends
24-hour observation in the hospital.

222
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,579
Director Zhang,

223
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,960
why don't you head back first?

224
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,310
I'll stay with him.

225
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,839
How could I possibly leave?

226
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,339
I'll immediately launch level 2 security

227
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,770
and seal off the entire floor.

228
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,609
I'll also assign three officers here

229
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,569
to keep the Deputy Chief

230
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,030
under watch 24 hours a day.

231
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,550
No need to make such a fuss.

232
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,790
The Deputy Chief has high blood pressure.

233
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,290
He needs proper rest

234
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,550
and some peace and quiet.

235
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,950
It's my duty.
I wouldn't dare be negligent.

236
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,020
It's not about being negligent.

237
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm worried that reporters
might blow things out of proportion.

238
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,980
Sir.

239
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,690
Never mind.

240
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,290
With official duties at hand,

241
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,750
I really couldn't stay long
at the hospital.

242
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,190
You're really working hard work.

243
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,270
Bring aboard immediately

244
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,590
all the necessary medical equipment

245
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,850
missing from the ship.

246
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,880
Give me the case.
You don't need to see me off.

247
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,640
Go back now.

248
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,750
Manager Wan said

249
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,070
I must see you pass through customs
with my own eyes

250
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,810
before I can leave.

251
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,470
Let me carry your case for now.

252
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,310
Leader, it's fourth-class cabin!

253
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,230
When have we ever traveled
in fourth class?

254
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,030
Didn't Mr. Li tell us

255
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,270
he was so powerful?

256
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,500
Do you think
he's deliberately targeting us?

257
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,110
Excuse me, sir.

258
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,500
Sir.

259
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,330
Get her!

260
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,410
What are you doing?

261
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,830
Officer, wait a moment, please!

262
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,360
Officer.

263
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,940
Officer, I'm from the BIS.

264
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm from the BIS.

265
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,550
What?

266
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,380
Look, my paper.

267
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,050
That woman—

268
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,310
I suspect she's a Communist,

269
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,240
so I need to search her belongings.

270
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,940
This is Hong Kong.

271
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,920
I know. I know this is Hong Kong,

272
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,740
but I am sure

273
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,160
you know

274
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,250
what I'm talking about, right?

275
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,770
Okay. Okay.

276
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,290
She is a young lady. Be gentle.

277
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,750
Of course.

278
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,670
Take her!

279
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,340
Done.

280
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,280
Thank you for your help, Dr. Li.

281
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,510
I'll stay with him.

282
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,670
I'll wait outside.

283
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,610
Call me if you need anything.

284
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,870
Sir, please rest well.

285
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,740
Well, this is great.

286
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,860
We're completely trapped on this ship.

287
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,290
You can't get off.

288
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,990
And Manager Wan can't come aboard.

289
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,900
Sir.

290
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,450
Please don't worry too much.

291
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,440
Although we're not sure

292
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,580
if the PLA received our intelligence,

293
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,140
clearly, the attack has been moved up.

294
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,070
The battle has just begun,

295
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,820
so everything is still uncertain.

296
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,900
Even with the reinforcements
of Hu Lian's corps,

297
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,790
the PLA might still

298
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,290
have some chance of winning.

299
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,490
Amphibious assaults

300
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,050
are a brand-new challenge for the PLA.

301
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,870
In previous land battles,
the National Army would

302
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,360
just retreat when losing.

303
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,330
They routinely employed
a strategy of rapid disengagement,

304
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,200
which frequently led to
their swift collapse.

305
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,600
However, island warfare

306
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,220
is different.

307
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,190
The defending forces
have no room for retreat.

308
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,910
They can only fight to the death.

309
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:42,900
Sir.

310
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,250
There's no use in worrying now.

311
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,110
Even if you could get past
these agents from the Second Department

312
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,310
and meet Manager Wan,

313
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,030
what good solutions do we have

314
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,250
to help the PLA?

315
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,780
It's my fault.

316
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,640
The situation was urgent
and time was limited,

317
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,460
so I only gave Manager Wan

318
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,720
the intelligence
about Hu Lian's reinforcements.

319
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,700
I should have included

320
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,570
a battle strategy recommendation.

321
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,070
The PLA currently has no navy

322
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,530
or air force.

323
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,700
The enemy has an absolute advantage
in troop numbers, naval and air power,

324
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,300
and geographical position.

325
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,240
Therefore, the PLA

326
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,350
must not launch an attack recklessly.

327
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,630
Even in the current situation,

328
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,070
they should still wait for

329
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,120
the reinforcements to land gradually.

330
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,230
Perhaps…

331
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,160
Perhaps there might be
a chance of victory.

332
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,130
I want to see Manager Wan.

333
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,510
Alright, Sir.

334
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,430
Please take care of yourself.

335
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,370
Don't worry too much.

336
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,980
How about this?

337
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,630
After dark,

338
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,690
I'll find an excuse to go ashore

339
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,680
and see if there's a chance
to meet Manager Wan.

340
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,620
I'll go tell him.

341
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,320
Okay.

342
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,610
I'll write a letter to Manager Wan.

343
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,280
Help me up.

344
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,130
Apart from

345
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,840
the battle strategy,

346
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,920
I need to tell him some

347
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,410
other things in my letter.

348
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,820
When you see him,

349
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
you must ask him

350
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,180
to send a new courier here
as soon as possible.

351
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,460
At the opening ceremony of

352
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,140
the Taiwan Provincial Games,

353
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,590
Chairman Chen Cheng stated

354
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,510
that the tremendous changes in Taiwan

355
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,960
since its recovery 4 years ago
are inseparable

356
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,200
from the wise leadership
of our Father and the President.

357
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,990
That's why we must strengthen

358
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,220
our confidence in defending Taiwan
and retaking the mainland.

359
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,070
Now, we continue with updates
on the Kinmen battle.

360
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,530
Sir.

361
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,130
I couldn't make contact with him.

362
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,400
There were spies all around
the pharmacy entrance.

363
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,000
There was nothing I could do.

364
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:33,790
Report!

365
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,550
Deputy Chief Wu,

366
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,590
the Chief called.

367
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,850
The President is very satisfied
with the Kinmen battle situation

368
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,810
and is delighted.

369
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,470
To boost our
national and military prestige,

370
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,950
he has instructed us
to publicize it extensively.

371
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,340
Tomorrow, on the Taikang Warship,

372
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,070
a press conference will be held.

373
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,400
The Chief hopes you can make time
to attend and make a speech.

374
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,030
[Yongchun]

375
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,330
Wan.

376
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,020
Why are you back?

377
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,110
De Ying was discovered.

378
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,450
I saw her jump into the sea
with my own eyes.

379
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,860
I just found out too.

380
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,370
The authorities are
searching for her body.

381
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,770
But the Hong Kong pier
is a deep-water port.

382
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,770
Jumping from such a height...

383
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,120
I know she couldn't swim.

384
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Which part exactly went wrong?

385
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,390
There was a problem with her documents.

386
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,980
They caught it
when she was going through customs.

387
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,440
She was carrying contact information

388
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,040
of the Taiwan Work Committee

389
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,380
and the detailed home address

390
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,810
of the comrade impersonating her brother.

391
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,850
She jumped into the sea

392
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,380
to protect them.

393
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,940
How could there be a problem
with her documents?

394
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,590
Wasn't she supposed to use

395
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,580
my special pass?

396
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,880
De Ying couldn't possibly enter Taiwan

397
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,680
in your name,

398
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,540
much less stay
at your adopted daughter's home.

399
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,050
So, based on your document,

400
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,110
we made a new one for her.

401
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
However,

402
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,610
to ensure Taiwan's
so-called regularization,

403
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,120
Chen Cheng has used America's latest

404
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,850
anti-counterfeiting technology
on every pass.

405
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,110
That's something we never anticipated.

406
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,270
Wan.

407
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,600
Let me go instead of De Ying.

408
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,800
Your assignment from the Party

409
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,280
is to return to Shanghai
to build the New China.

410
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,380
Besides,

411
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,870
you haven't seen your husband or daughter

412
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,930
for several years.

413
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,660
I can't deprive you of the chance

414
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,260
to reunite with your family.

415
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,110
About sending someone to Taiwan,

416
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,940
I'll find another way.

417
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,420
But whoever goes now

418
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,580
can only use fake documents.

419
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,250
We can't let other comrades
take this risk again.

420
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,750
I understand how you feel.

421
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,910
But Taiwan right now

422
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,980
is under severe White Terror.

423
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,220
You have no experience
in underground intelligence work.

424
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,350
So, I can't send you to take such risks.

425
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,870
I know I'm not professional in this field,

426
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,720
but right now I'm the only one who has

427
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,580
a legal identity to enter Taiwan.

428
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,650
Please ask the Party
to seriously consider my request.

429
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,560
To be honest,

430
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,310
I didn't expect you would come back today.

431
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,770
And I'm grateful

432
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,160
you're stepping forward at this moment.

433
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,250
I'll report your request to my superiors.

434
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,180
However,

435
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,380
I must solemnly remind you:

436
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,250
Taiwan today

437
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,350
is unlike any other place.

438
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,860
The intensity of the struggle there

439
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,590
far exceeds your imagination.

440
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,680
Whether you can adapt after going there

441
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,770
or whether you'll regret it,

442
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,900
I cannot guarantee.

443
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,280
If something goes wrong,

444
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,870
you might not be able to escape unharmed.

445
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,830
You should understand

446
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,680
what that means.

447
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
So, during this time,

448
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,610
please think it through carefully.

449
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,170
I will consider it carefully.

450
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,910
At this critical moment
of the Kinmen battle,

451
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,590
I have been instructed by President Chiang

452
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,790
to hold this press conference

453
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,470
to inform the public about
the latest military situation

454
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,290
in Kinmen.

455
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,570
About 9,000 Communist troops,
3 regiments in total,

456
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,980
launched an attack on our Kinmen Island

457
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,380
at around 2 a.m. on the 25th.

458
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,580
Our defending forces

459
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,250
fought back valiantly.

460
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:30,880
Besides,

461
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,620
with approximately 60,000 men
in 22 regiments,

462
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,980
we hold an absolute advantage.

463
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,810
General Wu,

464
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,700
according to my information,

465
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,880
during the landing,

466
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,920
the Communist vessels

467
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,450
became stranded at low tide

468
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,290
due to being too close to the beach

469
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,050
and were all bombed by the National Army.

470
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,940
They currently have no ability
to organize reinforcements

471
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,720
and thus face complete annihilation.

472
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,020
I'd like to ask how much longer

473
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,380
the landed Communist forces can hold out?

474
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,410
That's difficult to determine.

475
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,310
It depends on the fighting spirit
of soldiers on both sides.

476
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,040
But I personally believe

477
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,090
our forces in Kinmen,

478
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,690
with overwhelming

479
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,260
land, sea, and air superiority,

480
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,950
are certain to win.

481
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,510
This concludes today's press conference.

482
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,250
All media representatives and journalists,

483
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,060
thank you!

484
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,480
General Wu!

485
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,790
About the current battlefield situation,

486
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,050
could you share some personal thoughts?

487
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,810
At this very moment,

488
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,530
on the Kinmen battlefield
hundreds of sea miles away,

489
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,640
our soldiers

490
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,950
are fighting bravely for the future

491
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,920
of our country and people.

492
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,690
My heart is filled with respect for them.

493
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,350
I know,

494
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,910
whether they live or die,

495
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,330
their struggle

496
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,090
is meaningful!

497
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,720
So, here,

498
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,770
as a soldier,

499
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,750
I salute them.

500
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,770
On October 24, 1949,

501
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,440
Unit One of the PLA's 10th Corps

502
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,840
was ordered to launch the Kinmen campaign.

503
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,530
The advance forces
of more than three regiments

504
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,990
landed on Kinmen beaches

505
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,670
and secured their positions.

506
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,650
Later, their landing vessels
were destroyed;

507
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,530
reinforcements couldn't reach them;

508
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,180
and the enemy reinforcements arrived.

509
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,880
The landing units clashed with vastly
superior enemy forces for days and nights

510
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,410
but were defeated when they
ran out of ammunition and supplies.

511
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,290
We don't have much time.

512
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,560
It seems Manager Wan

513
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,520
has strong infiltration capabilities
in Hong Kong.

514
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,320
Neither I nor Mr. Wu expected you
to board the ship.

515
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,630
This is thanks to Chiang's

516
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,170
being eager to boast about

517
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,610
his certain victory at Kinmen.

518
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,160
But

519
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,080
the information about
the reinforcements at Kinmen

520
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,540
was delivered, wasn't it?

521
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,540
Why did the PLA still launch the attack?

522
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,140
I didn't expect
the attack order to come early.

523
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,430
One hour before I sent the telegram,

524
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,560
the first batch, the 3 regiments,
had already departed.

525
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,610
Just 1 hour late.

526
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,770
Yes.

527
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,460
It's such a pity.

528
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,110
This is the letter from Mr. Wu to you.

529
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,410
Originally, he hoped you would pass on

530
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,920
the content of this letter as intelligence

531
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,990
to the Party.

532
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,700
Unfortunately, it seems

533
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,510
a bit too late right now.

534
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,240
I understand.

535
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,470
There's other content in the letter

536
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,330
that requires your cooperation.

537
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,170
All right.

538
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,700
Most importantly,

539
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,430
Mr. Wu hopes the Party can quickly send

540
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,560
a courier as experienced

541
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,850
as Comrade Zhang Hao.

542
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,300
It's urgent.

543
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,900
Please rest assured.

544
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,160
Your connection with the Party

545
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,420
will be restored soon.

546
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,250
That's great.

547
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,180
Please give this

548
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,200
to the new courier.

549
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,270
The situation in Taiwan is very tense now.

550
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,960
To be safe, the person's identity can only
be verified by this object.

551
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,440
Okay.

552
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,570
This is how to contact

553
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,830
the courier after arriving in Taiwan.

554
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,430
I'm leaving.

555
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,300
All right.

556
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,550
Also,

557
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,510
please tell the general

558
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,410
to take good care of himself.

559
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,460
Hope you'll all be safe in Taiwan.

560
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,870
Take care.

561
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,409
Honey.

562
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,130
Why are you waiting for me here?

563
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,409
I just like waiting for you here.

564
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,810
Where are the children?

565
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,770
It's too late. They've gone to sleep upstairs.

566
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,540
Don't move.

567
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,730
Let me sit here with you for a while.

568
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,360
You must be tired, right?

569
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,050
I'm okay.

570
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,219
How's your blood pressure?

571
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,010
It's been normal.

572
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,760
Thanks, Qian. Take care!

573
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,010
Good evening.

574
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,080
Good evening.

575
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,320
Mei.

576
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,840
I'm back.

577
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,070
Working overtime again?

578
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,260
Yes.

579
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,560
Wait a moment.

580
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,420
Look at this.

581
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,040
Isn't it pretty?

582
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,910
It's so expensive.

583
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,710
Things from Hong Kong are a bit pricey,

584
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,300
but

585
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,680
I think this dress
would look great on you.

586
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,410
Try it on.

587
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,590
I heard it on the radio.

588
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,170
Heard what?

589
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,540
The victory at Kinmen.

590
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,530
When do you plan to
counterattack the mainland?

591
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,680
Are you that eager for
the mainland recovery?

592
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,700
Does holding Kinmen mean
we can counterattack the mainland?

593
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,700
You actually believe what Chen Cheng says?

594
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,360
What I'm hoping for
isn't the mainland recovery.

595
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,820
are
still on the mainland.

596
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,750
When we left Fuzhou,

597
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,100
Shaocheng and Lancheng—

598
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,780
we didn't even get to see them.

599
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,180
In these chaotic times,

600
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,940
I don't know how they're doing
on the mainland.

601
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,760
Give me your arm. I'll help you put it on.

602
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,400
I'm asking you a question!

603
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,440
When can we counterattack
and return to Fuzhou?

604
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,220
Are you that eager for

605
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,150
the mainland recovery to succeed?

606
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,920
The Nationalist Government has turned

607
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,800
the whole country into such a mess.

608
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,130
Haven't you seen it?

609
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,410
What's the point of going back?

610
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,570
To continue harming the people of Fuzhou?

611
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,150
Would you dare say such things
at Chieh Shou Hall?

612
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,170
I don't care at all

613
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,320
whether the counterattack would succeed.

614
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,460
I only care when

615
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,990
our children can be with us!

616
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,970
I don't think you even miss them.

617
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,060
I miss them very much.

618
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,900
Bikui.

619
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,590
Don't worry.

620
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,670
I'll definitely find a way

and asked Li Yunshan to assist you.

678
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,920
And all you brought back is this junk?

679
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,000
What am I supposed to see here?

680
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,920
Deputy Chief Wu drinking with Americans?

681
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,320
Director, Mr. Wu is a clever man.

682
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,790
His entire Hong Kong trip

683
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,510
was absolutely flawless,

684
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,770
but I didn't go to Hong Kong in vain.

685
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,670
Through my contacts at MI6,

686
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,760
I've managed to recover

687
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,420
the two sets of keys
obtained from Xie Zhonghao.

688
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,260
They've already been sent to Section 4.

689
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,530
Decoding the messages
sent by Zhang Hao's team

690
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,910
will happen very soon.

691
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,930
How long can we see
the decrypted messages?

692
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,440
We need to go through

693
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,050
all messages sent from Taiwan

694
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,030
in the past two and a half months.

695
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,760
The workload is indeed enormous.

696
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,670
Director Yang also said
he found it a bit difficult.

697
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,460
You believe that old fox?

698
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,530
Get me Director Yang at Section 4.

699
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,070
Assign some people to focus on the leads

700
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,940
Mr. Gu brought back from Hong Kong,

701
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,630
I want to see the results
as soon as possible.

702
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,730
Yes, that's an order.

703
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,440
Thank you for your support, Director.

704
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,190
Director.

705
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,970
Do you also suspect Deputy Chief Wu?

706
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,570
Suspicion

707
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,360
is an instinct in our line of work.

708
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,540
The Hong Kong trip
didn't go smoothly, did it?

709
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,890
I think you should pay attention
to things happened

710
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,750
at the Second Department
and the Hong Kong station.

711
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,210
It's not that we can't investigate
Deputy Chief Wu.

712
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,000
It's that his rank is too high

713
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,890
and he was personally appointed
by the President.

714
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,010
To investigate him,

715
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,950
you must be both bold and meticulous,

716
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,750
so as not to give others
ammunition against you.

717
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,990
Yes, I will follow your example, Director.

718
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,470
I'll strive to…

719
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,670
Alright, alright, stop flattering me.

720
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,370
I only ask one thing of you:

721
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,630
don't cause me trouble.

722
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,610
I'll just butter you up.

723
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,070
Get out of here.

724
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,420
Director, I'm off to investigate the case.
