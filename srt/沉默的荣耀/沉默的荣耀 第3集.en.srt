3
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,620
Deputy Chief Wu, I'm Mao Renfeng.

4
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,090
I've heard about what happened today.

5
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,980
It's entirely my fault.

6
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,290
I must sincerely apologize to you

7
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,440
for causing you such distress.

8
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,770
Your BIS is eager
to catch Communist spies.

9
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,190
I understand.

10
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,870
Deputy Chief Wu, your understanding

11
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,990
makes me feel even more ashamed.

12
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,740
But I just can't believe that he...

13
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,480
How dare he shoot at you?

14
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,240
Who gave him such audacity?

15
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,560
I must severely punish Group Leader Gu

16
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,870
to give you an explanation.

17
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,410
That's your BIS's

18
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,590
internal affair.

19
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,010
Deputy Chief Wu, that

20
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,430
Communist spy who sold you medicine today,

21
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,590
we've been tracking him for a long time.

22
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,990
He's extremely cunning.

23
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,560
But what a coincidence. Don't you think?

24
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,940
How did you happen to run into

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,530
this Communist spy
at National Taiwan University Hospital?

26
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,900
I went to the hospital
for my hypertension.

27
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,230
I've already reported this to Chief Zhou.

28
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,510
You must take your medication regularly
for hypertension.

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,220
I won't disturb you any further.

30
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,130
I apologize again.

31
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,540
That's right.

32
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,210
Deputy Chief Wu did inform me.

33
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,570
Mao Qiwu, what's the meaning of this call?

34
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,660
Does the Deputy Chief

35
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,340
of our Ministry of Defense need to report

36
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,490
to your BIS just to visit a hospital?

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,520
It was indeed a shot.

38
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,240
Only now did Wu Shi feel

39
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,190
the grief and terror

40
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,820
surging within his heart.

41
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,570
This was the closest
he had come to being exposed.

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,190
He could truly smell

43
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,060
the bloody scent of White Terror.

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,800
If his identity were revealed today,

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,890
the intelligence network
He Sui had painstakingly built

46
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,600
would be destroyed in an instant.

47
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
How many comrades
would be innocently sacrificed?

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,750
What misfortune would befall their family?

49
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,450
But the Kinmen intelligence

50
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,310
concerned the future of New China

51
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,659
and the lives of tens of
thousands of PLA soldiers.

52
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,830
Wu Shi felt for the first time

53
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,620
that every step forward

54
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,360
was filled with unknown dangers.

55
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,560
If Mao Renfeng doesn't apologize

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,159
to Deputy Chief Wu in person today,

57
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,909
it means he doesn't respect
the Ministry of Defense at all.

58
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,050
Yesterday they could

59
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,120
shoot at Deputy Chief Wu.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,220
Tomorrow, will they be able

61
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,350
to call me, the Chief, a Communist spy?

62
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,360
Then tell me,
how can our Ministry of Defense

63
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,760
carry on with its normal work
in the future?

64
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,570
Come out.

Chief Zhou.

67
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,990
What Gu Zhengwen did

68
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,330
is truly disrespectful
to the Ministry of Defense.

69
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,090
I will definitely discipline him strictly
when I return.

70
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,910
I apologize to you for this.

71
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,240
Director Mao,

72
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,620
I truly appreciate it

73
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,410
that you have this awareness.

74
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,810
Chief, but there are reasons for this.

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,770
How is it that the Communist spy

76
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,100
we've been tracking
happened to run into Deputy Chief Wu?

77
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,460
How is it that before
the 318th Division defected,

78
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,650
he just happened
to visit the division headquarters?

79
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,360
How is it that
the construction work in Fuzhou

80
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,500
just happened to stop

81
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,540
because of one phone call from him?

Please forgive me, Chief Zhou.

I only wish for
the safety of our party and nation.

Senior, you've finally arrived.

88
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,510
Sorry, Comrade Jianfeng.

89
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,060
I had some urgent military matters
to attend to.

90
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,100
That's why I'm late.

91
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,760
Deputy Chief Wu, you're finally here.

92
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,890
Please, have a seat.

93
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,460
Regarding the Kinmen strategy,

94
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,310
both of you generals
have been working too hard.

95
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,860
Especially you.

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,980
I heard you've been
working non-stop for days.

Please have a taste.

Just a small token of my appreciation.

100
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,950
Comrade Jianfeng, you're too kind.

101
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,310
Oriental Beauty tea is quite rare.

102

I was merely doing my duty.

103
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,260
It's Chief Zhou who has the foresight.

104
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,350
You're always so modest.

105
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,450
Indeed.

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,700
I invited you here today,

107
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,510
first to express my appreciation.

108
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,010
And also, I want to apologize to you

109
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,340
about the incident at NTUH.

110
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,190
Chief Zhou told me about it.

111
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,430
You're the Deputy Chief
personally appointed by the President.

112
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,360
A mere group leader from BIS

113
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,640
actually dared to shoot at you,

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,190
and even suspected you
of being connected to Communist spies.

115
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,770
It's completely absurd.

116
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,870
If Mao Renfeng hadn't called my office

117
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,190
to verify Senior's whereabouts,

118
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,430
I had no idea

119

It is indeed absurd.

Just say the word,

122
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,510
I'll punish Gu Zhengwen immediately

123
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,970
and deal harshly with BIS.

124

That's right, Senior.

This matter will be handled
according to your wishes.

Jail them or execute them,
whatever you want.

127

It's just a small matter.

The island is in a critical period
of spy elimination.

129

They just want to earn more merits.

130

This sentiment is understandable.

131
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,050
They're just devoted
to the party and nation after all.

Just doing their duty in their position.

Let it go, Comrade Jianfeng.

As long as they don't

bite like mad dogs
in the future, it's fine.

136

Senior, you're still so magnanimous.

137
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,600
Since

138
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,330
Deputy Chief Wu is so forgiving,

to apologize to you in person.

the desk placement has bad feng shui

178

Deputy Chief Wu took the gun?

179
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,580
You mean Deputy Chief Wu
has a guilty conscience?

180
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,720
That's not what I meant.

181

But if we find the gun,

182
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,250
everything will become clear.

186

Director, I came to you

187

because I need your help.

188
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,420
The gun was already returned.

189

190
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,940
So you want

191
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,220
Deputy Chief Wu to personally
return it to you?

192

car repair costs?

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,340
Will it be safe to find them?

339
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,680
Why was Zhang Hao exposed?

340
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,980
You're worried that

341
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,330
there's a traitor among these two agents.

342
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,590
It's very possible.

343
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,200
We just don't know

344
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,260
who the traitor is.

345
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,570
So we've just reconnected
only to be cut off again?

346
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll give it a try.

347
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,940
Even if only one of them is safe,

348
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,750
it's worth trying.

349
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,680
How will you try?

350
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,850
After I escort you,

351
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,750
I'll go to their workplaces

352
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,470
and check around their residences.

353
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,380
Whether they've betrayed us
or been exposed,

354
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,330
it won't be difficult to spot

356

361
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,140

362
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,270

363

375
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,640
Sir,

376
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,590
the location of Wu's Mansion
is really excellent.

377
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,190
But why is there only
one guard at the entrance?

378
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,940
Even one is too many for me.

379
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,300
More people means more trouble.

380
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,700
One guard

381
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,880
and one driver is just fine.

382
00:26:59,290 --> 00:26:59,850
Get off.

383
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,030
I've been thinking.

384
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,920
You absolutely cannot go

385
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,420
near Xie Zhonghao and Liu Kangfu's homes.

386
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,850
It would be too dangerous.

387
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,770
But we don't have any other options.

388
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,110
There must be another way.

389
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,310
The more critical the situation,
the calmer we need to be.

390
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,690
You're back.

391
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,940
I'm back.

392
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,090

393
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,860
Come in.

394
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,000
Dad.

395
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,690
Mom won't let me
keep the bird at home.

396
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,980
She says there's no space.

397
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,220
How can there be no space
in such a big house?

398
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,330
If Mom doesn't allow it,
you should set it free.

399
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,620
Give it back its freedom.

400
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,950
No.

401
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,590
I don't want to set it free.

402
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,220
Okay, come here.

403
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,200
Come, I'll find a place for you.

404
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,510
Come.

405
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,240
Dou, prepare dinner.

406
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,720
Okay.

407

Nie Xi, dinner time.

408
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,290
Let me help, Madam.

409
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,570
It's fine, you go rest.

410
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,160
Xie Zhonghao killed

411
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
our two men.

412
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,920
We haven't notified their family yet.

413
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,980
Should we follow the usual procedure?

414
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,270
Then for each person,

415
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,920
add 50 jin of rice and 10 jin of soybeans.

416
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,310
50 jin of rice and 10 jin of soybeans?

417
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,530
Times are tough.

418
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,950
The entire BIS has over 10,000 people.

419
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,490
Those who can get their salary on time

420
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,020
can be counted on two hands.

421
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,430
Keep catching Communist spies.

422
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,430
There's a reward when you catch one.

423
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,350
Power's out again.

424
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,150
Must be a short circuit somewhere.

425
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,590
I'll go check.

426
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,750
Nie Xi.

427
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,280
Short circuit?

428
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
You just mentioned a short circuit.

429
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,290
Many residential areas in Taipei

430
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,640
have aging electrical systems.

431
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,770
They're probably making repairs now.

432
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,080
Short circuit.

433
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,960
Cipher clerk.

434
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,280
Radio operator.

435
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,220
Sir,

436
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,260
what are you mumbling about?

437
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,480
Zhang was the station chief and courier.

438
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,590
He separately contacted
the cipher clerk Xie Zhonghao

439
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,520
and the radio operator Liu Kangfu.

440
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,400
In other words,

441
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,260
these two subordinates
don't know each other.

442
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,050
According to the Party's discipline,

443
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,580
they shouldn't meet at all.

444
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,110
If someone
using the cipher clerk's identity

445
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,030
arranges to meet the radio operator,

446
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,970
while simultaneously
using the radio operator's identity

447
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,370
to meet the cipher clerk,

448
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,640
between the two of them,

449
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,180
whoever shows up

450
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,880
must be

451
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,440
the traitor who betrayed Zhang Hao.

452
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,110
These two books show
obvious signs of reading,

453
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,660
indicating that Xie Zhonghao must have

454
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,350
read them many times over.

455
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,530
But this one is different.

456
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,640
It's pristine.

457
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,610
If he doesn't read it,

458
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,320
why keep it on the desk

459
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,030
within easy reach?

460
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,830
Of course, one could argue

461
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
it's a newly purchased book.

462
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,580
But looking at the content,

463
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,220
it seems out of place.

"Dead Souls" by Gogol.

465

"Family" by Ba Jin.

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,530
These are both authors

467
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,940
the Communists are very fond of.

468
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,400
Moreover, "Dead Souls"

469
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,800
is Lu Xun's translation.

470
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,030
But "From A Cottager's Sketchbook"

471
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,850
by Liang Shiqiu

472
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,800
is a collection of essays.

473
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,220
Would someone so sentimental

474
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,300
have such strong convictions?

475
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,850
Would he have the courage

476
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,310
to jump out of that window?

477
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,310
So I believe

478
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,030
this must be the codebook.

479
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,140
It must be the cipher key.

480
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,850
Only a traitor would be so concerned
about the other's identity.

481
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,240
If we can verify

482
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,060
that the cipher clerk is safe,

483
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,750
then we'll cipher the code

484
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,650
and find a commercial station
to send it out.

485
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,490
If the radio operator is safe,

486
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,400
then we'll go offshore
and send the message in plain code.

487
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,160
This way,

488
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,820
the news from Kinmen
will get out no matter what.

489
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,030
Didn't Zhang mention

490
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,690
the locations of their dead drops
in his letter?

491
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,470
Notify them separately.

492
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,570
No matter where you arrange to meet,

493
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,960
be wary of Gu Zhengwen.

494
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,670
Still no respond?

The Ping'an ship hasn't set sail.

496
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,960
Zhang hasn't replied.

497
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,690
There must be a big problem.

498
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,320
Zhang's position is too important.

499
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,480
Should we quickly select someone

500
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,340
to replace him as the new courier?

501
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,220
In Taiwan's current situation,

trying to send someone to replace Zhang

503
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,950
is extremely difficult.

[12:00 noon
at the entrance of Tian's Teahouse]

507
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,290
[From Zhang's translator friend]

508
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,700
You saw him reading the letter?

509
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,780
Absolutely true.

510
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,580
Leader was right.

511
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,060
We've caught our fish.

512
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,180
I need to keep an eye on him myself.

513
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,500
Should we send more people there?

514
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,530
Absolutely not.

515
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,870
Don't scare away the fish
Leader is trying to catch.

516
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,140
Go report to him right away.

517
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,850
Okay.

518
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,500
Hu Lian's two army corps

519
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,550
will arrive in Kinmen soon.

520
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,020
The military force in Kinmen

521
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,820
will triple at once.

522
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,850
But what about
the logistical supplies on the island?

523
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,520
Still the same.

524
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,010
Not even enough to support 20,000 people.

525
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,790
Tang Enbo just sent a telegram today.

526
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,680
The first thing he did
after receiving the transfer order

527
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,410
was to ask for weapons and food.

528
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,230
But where am I supposed
to get those for him?

529
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,889
[Tian's Teahouse]

530
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,630
Captain followed Liu Kangfu

531
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,960
to the Tian's Teahouse.

532
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,860
I rushed back

533
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,940
to report to you.

534
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,760
Alright, got it. Go back to work.

535
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,290
Yes, sir.

536
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,530
It's impossible
to requisition from Taiwan now.

537
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,660
The latest batch of military supplies

538
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,430
has already been sent to Zhoushan.

539
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,980
They say "Before troops move,

540
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,340
supplies go first."

541
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,050
This time we have the troops ready,

542
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,810
but we're short on supplies.

543
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,450
I'm worried that if this continues,

544
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,730
Commander Tang and Generals Hu and Li

545
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,400
might suffer more unnecessary casualties.

546
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,720
What about that American military aid?

547
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,260
Wasn't that deal already secured?

548
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,150
Can we ship some to Kinmen?

549
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,950
Try it.

550
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,970
[Tian's Teahouse]

551
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,610
The military aid promised to us

552
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,340
has been withheld
by the Americans for no reason.

553
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,110
We finally negotiated a deal

554
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,170
but they insist
we submit a distribution plan.

555
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,590
How we distribute it

556
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,050
is none of their business.

557
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,700
We've submitted
so many distribution plans,

558
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,940
but there's been no response at all.

559
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,610
The purpose of today's meeting

560
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,360
is to gather everyone's ideas.

561
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,860
We need to think carefully

562
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,940
about how to solve

563
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,960
the urgent logistical supply

564
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,400
crisis on Kinmen Island.

565
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,700
If anyone has any thoughts,

566
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,530
please feel free to share. Okay?

567
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,300
I'd like the usual please.

568
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,090
Alright, just a moment.

569
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,630
Okay.

570
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,530
I'd like a bowl of noodles.

571
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,030
Okay.

572
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,400
Stay still.

573
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,630
Let me go!

574
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,800
Let me go!

575
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,460
Let go of me!

576
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,570
They'll definitely
come looking for me again.

577
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,360
Let me go!

578
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,590
Captain Yu, listen to me.

579
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,190
They'll definitely come looking for me.

580
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,860
Believe me.

581
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,010
Let me go!

582
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,930
Captain Yu!

583
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,190
Believe me.

584
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,320
Captain Yu, let me explain!

585
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,980
Captain Yu!

586
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,370
Captain Yu,
please give me one more chance.

587
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,690
They will definitely contact me again.

588
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,660
Trust me.

589
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,750
I won't let you down.

590
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,450
Captain Yu.

591
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,360
Leader,

592
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,940
I've been following him the whole time.

593
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,140
Haven't noticed anything suspicious.

594
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,920
I've checked everything,

595
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,380
including the woman
who sold him betel nuts.

596
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,440
The entire shop was just full of

597
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,940
locals eating noodles.

598
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,460
There was one outsider.

599
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,140
I checked him out too.

600
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,780
No issues at all.

601
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,890
What about you?

602
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,120
I definitely wasn't spotted.

603
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,010
Mr. Gu.

604
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,040
Please let me explain.

605
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,420
I... I was just trying to help you
catch the Communist spy.

606
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,940
I wanted to make some contribution.

607
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,570
Look,

608
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,730
if I had reported

609
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,680
that the cipher clerk was caught,

610
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,120
wouldn't Captain Yu get all the credit?

611
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,610
Right?

612
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,400
Cipher clerk?

613
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,940
Yes.

614
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,520
Tell me the exact contents

615
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,430
of that letter word for word.

616
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,800
Okay.

617
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,400
12:00 noon

618
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,420
at the entrance of Tian's Teahouse.

619
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,280
From Zhang's translator friend.

620
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,260
Mr. Gu,

621
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,770
please let me go back.

622
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,600
They will definitely contact me again.

623
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,300
Next time I'll report in advance.

624
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,950
Trust me.

625
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,020
Give me one more chance.

626
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,400
Don't worry, I'll explain for you

627
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,900
in front of the Chief.

628
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,070
Goodbye.

629
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,720
How's it going?

630
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,590
The cipher clerk Xie Zhonghao

631
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,960
hasn't touched the dead drop.

632
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,320
The one who came was
the radio operator Liu Kangfu.

633
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,270
That action team leader
who fired last time

634
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,600
has been following him.

635
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,590
Then this proves

636
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,800
the traitor who betrayed Zhang Hao
is Liu Kangfu.

637
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,840
This Liu Kangfu has been exposed.

638
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,260
Is he of no use to us anymore?

639
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,070
Is he useless
just because he's been exposed?

640
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,330
How would you know?

641
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,360
Besides,

642
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,810
do you know how he was exposed?

643
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,030
How would I know?

644
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,260
When we were in Beiping,

645
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,460
we raided the Communist radio station.

646
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,400
You should be very clear
about their discipline,

647
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,110
right?

648
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,780
Between cipher clerks and radio operators,

649
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,360
they shouldn't even know each other,

650
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
let alone have any contact.

651
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,030
So that letter

652
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,800
wasn't about arranging a meeting at all.

653
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,820
It was just a test.

654
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,630
Their people must have already

655
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,900
been hiding near Tian's Teahouse.

656
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,140
As soon as Liu Kangfu appeared,

657
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,900
my hand would be completely revealed.

658
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,840
But...

659
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,570
But they don't know Liu Kangfu.

660
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,170
Well, maybe they recognized

661
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,170
a certain limping agent.

662
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,480
Leader,

663
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,350
I...

664
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,430
I was wrong.

665
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,270
I shouldn't have acted on my own.

666
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,740
I should have sent someone unfamiliar to them.
