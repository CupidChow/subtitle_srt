[Episode 12]

3
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
Mrs. Chen was quick to react.

4
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,710
It would've been terrible
if she had gotten into the car.

5
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Seems she does have
some experience in this after all.

6
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,260
What's wrong?

7
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,790
I'm still a bit worried.

8
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,510
Earlier at the teahouse,

9
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,420
she was planning to
take the note with the address

10
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,750
and come straight here.

11
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,460
Go quickly.

12
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,990
Follow her by car

13
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,700
and escort her home—
as long as it can be done safely.

14
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,300
Okay.

15
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,670
Why are we operating so early today?

16
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,840
We've been arresting people every night,

17
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,350
[Weng Lianwang, member of the
Counterintelligence Section of the BIS]

18
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,220
and now people in Taipei
have gotten smart.

19
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,910
They don't even leave their homes anymore.

20
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,640
So, we wanna try during the day.

21
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,950
Weng Lianwang.

22
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,460
I heard the Director was looking for
someone from your team,

23
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,860
that Operation Captain,

24
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,970
Yu something...

25
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,310
Yu Xiaonan.

26
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,940
Right.

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,570
He wanted to talk to him.

28
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,520
Is it that your team leader Gu
won't be able to come back

29
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,579
and they want him to take over?

30
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,240
Why don't you team up with him?

31
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,810
He's not a local.

32
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,740
He's not like you, Lianwang.
You speak Mandarin.

33
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
With his clumsy way of speaking,

34
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,079
he can't even check IDs properly.

35
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,380
And he wants to be a team leader?

36
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,230
Get to work now, hurry up.

37
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,610
Get in, quickly!

38
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,100
Take out your ID.

39
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,940
Wait a moment!

40
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,500
Ricksh…

41
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,800
Officer, what's the matter?

42
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,860
We're from the BIS. Show me your ID.

43
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,030
Alright.

44
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,230
This is my pass.

45
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,090
There's something wrong with your ID.

46
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,210
Let's go to the bureau to verify it.

47
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,220
I have a family member in
the Provincial Police Department.

48
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,090
This pass was just newly issued to me.

49
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,300
Let's go to the bureau to verify it.

50
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,250
Then everything will be clear,

51
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,180
don't you think?

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Take her away!

53
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,610
Why are you grabbing my purse?

54
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,230
Wait, what are you doing?

55
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,780
Move it!

56
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,750
It's new!

57
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,980
I just got it!

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,570
Shut up!

59
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,830
Help!

60
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,480
The BIS is arresting innocent people!

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,940
I'm a professor
at National Taiwan University!

62
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,740
I'll report you to President Fu!

63
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm a professor
at National Taiwan University!

64
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,070
I'll report you to President Fu!

65
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,810
Behave yourself!

66
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,370
Get in!

67
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,250
Get in!

68
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,360
Mrs. Chen hadn't been followed

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
from the time she left the teahouse.

70
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,630
And those agents

71
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,480
were originally hiding in the car.

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,550
They only started checking and searching
when they saw people coming out.

73
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,130
They pretended to be catching Communists,

74
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,130
but they were actually just checking IDs.

75
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,190
And they specifically targeted

76
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,790
people who looked well-off.

77
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,409
So, I think

78
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,770
it's more like a kidnapping for ransom.

79
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,490
They won't take her to the BIS.

80
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,950
They'll definitely hold her somewhere else
and demand money.

81
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,320
Looking at it this way,

82
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,500
I think...

83
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,310
Mrs. Chen's identity
is probably still safe.

84
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,570
What I'm worried about now
is whether the film that she has

85
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,630
has been destroyed or not.

86
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,160
Time is of the essence now.

87
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,770
The sooner we rescue her,

88
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,880
the less risk of exposure there is.

89
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,690
If it's really kidnapping and blackmail,

90
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,880
is it possible

91
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,010
to find a suitable person

92
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,570
to redeem her?

93
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,920
The problem is

94
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,950
finding the right person.

95
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
Who can step forward now?

96
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,430
Director Duan.

97
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,180
What?

98
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,190
Director Duan.

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,260
Once Duan Tuizhi gets involved,

100
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,950
the story Mrs. Chen fabricated earlier

101
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,880
will fall apart.

102
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,310
They arrested several people at that time.

103
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,640
Do you know anyone else?

104
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,370
No.

105
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,120
There is one person though.

106
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,950
He claimed to be a professor
at National Taiwan University.

107
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,159
He kept shouting
the BIS was arresting innocent people.

108
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,570
He threatened to report them
to President Fool.

109
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,170
What's that President Fool?

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,250
Not Fool.

111
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,360
He should be referring to Fu Sinian,
President of National Taiwan University.

112
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Fu the Cannon, right?

113
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,800
Yes.

114
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,320
If he finds out

115
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,620
that a professor from his university
has been kidnapped by the BIS,

116
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,190
he would dare to storm Caoshan Villa

117
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,720
and pound on Chiang's desk.

118
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,340
Perfect!

119
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,490
The key now is

120
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,450
how to contact President Fu.

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,280
I'll figure something out.

122
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,860
I've been with
the Counterintelligence Section

123
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,260
for about half a year now.

124
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,860
The Communist spies I've seen—

125
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,370
if we count them on our fingers and toes,

126
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,630
we'd run out of digits.

127
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,890
Not a single one of them

128
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,630
has remained silent
after our leader interrogated them.

129
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,870
I just don't buy it!

130
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,290
Believe me!

131
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,070
Some of them, without certain measures,

132
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,390
would not cooperate.

133
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,250
Like this one.

134
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,950
Him.

135
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,690
Come on.

136
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,690
You...

137
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,860
Take it off.

138
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,120
Off!

139
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,370
Xuecheng!

140
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,850
Jiancheng!

141
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,870
Where are you?

142
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,680
You two are cheating!

143
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,370
You can't lift that up!

144
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,950
Got you!

145
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,520
I'm going to tickle you!

146
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,610
You're cheating!

147
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,770
Whose turn is it now?

148
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,770
Let him catch us first.

149
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,000
Jiancheng, it's your turn.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,370
Alright.

151
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,700
You try to catch us both.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,510
Okay.

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,750
Okay.

154
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,700
It's not tight enough. Wait a moment.

155
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,760
Come on, Xuecheng, help him put it on.

156
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,890
No peeking!

157
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,450
No peeking, you hear me?

158
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,270
Hurry up!

159
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,630
Everyone, listen up!

160
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,630
There are problems with
all your identification documents.

161
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,700
Your identities cannot be confirmed.

162
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,500
If we follow legal procedures,

163
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,740
you'd be locked here
for at least 10 days to 2 weeks.

164
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,940
So, I've come up with a solution for you.

165
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,390
Right now,

166
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,390
you can take your new ID and go home.

167
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,190
It doesn't cost much—
just 200 New Taiwan Dollars.

168
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,410
Those who don't have enough cash

169
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,500
can call your family to bring it over.

170
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,520
You, come out.

171
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,390
I'm talking to you.

172
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,140
Not you, you.

173
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:44,970
I understand.

174
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,280
Mr. Liu.

175
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,560
I have something to attend to.
I'll be off.

176
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,950
Okay.

177
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,730
What are you eating?

178
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,360
See you later.

179
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:02,710
Move!

180
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Have you decided?

181
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,930
Do you want to pay the supplementary fee?

182
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,440
If you pay in US dollars or gold,

183
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,680
I'll give you a 10% discount.

184
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,120
Actually, my son-in-law is your colleague,

185
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,480
Wang Changcheng
from the Police Department.

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,610
Why don't you make a call to confirm?

187
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,390
From our sister department?

188
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,450
Yes, that's right.

189
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,900
Why didn't you say so earlier?

190
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
I would have processed yours first.

191
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,580
Connect me to the Telecommunications
Office, Provincial Police Department.

192
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,840
Okay.

193
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,530
Hello, is Wang Changcheng there?

194
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,130
I'd like to speak with Wang Changcheng.

195
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,460
I'm his mother-in-law.

196
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,150
What? He's not there?

197
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,010
Where did he go?

198
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,700
Can you give me a phone number?

199
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,290
Okay, thank you.

200
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,220
If you can't get through, don't bother.

201
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,420
Those who work in telecommunications

202
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,820
would put on headphones
and work all night.

203
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,730
Arrange a private room for her.

204
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,130
Let her get some rest.
Call again tomorrow.

205
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,500
Officer.

206
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,730
Please let me make a call home.

207
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,780
Thank you.

208
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
If you can't get through, forget it.

209
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Take her upstairs.

210
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,400
Let me try one more time.

211
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,700
Let me check again.

212
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm hungry.

213
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,980
I've been detained for too long.

214
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,290
I don't even know how long

215
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,930
you're going to keep me here.

216
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,630
My son-in-law is your colleague.

217
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
Just give me a little help, Officer.

218
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,120
Thank you.

219
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,510
I'll just take a little more.

220
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,480
Thank you. Thanks.

221
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,220
Go.

222
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,500
Thank you, Officer.

223
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,950
Thank you.

224
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,790
If something unexpected happens,

225
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,740
pull the film out from here
and it will be exposed.

226
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,980
So you finally decided to come home!

227
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,930
I was working overtime.

228
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,740
Mom still hasn't come home!

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
I heard from the neighbors that

230
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,770
the BIS has been arresting people
everywhere these days.

231
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,050
I'm worried something happened to her,

232
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,170
but I didn't dare leave the child
home alone to go look for her,

233
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,040
so I was waiting for you to come home
before searching.

234
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,580
Who'd thought
you'd be working overtime again today!

235
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,700
You should have called me.

236
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,100
The phone at home is broken!

237
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,910
Broken?

238
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,100
I'm worried sick!

239
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,910
Don't worry.

240
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,860
Mom didn't say where she was going?

241
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,100
She just said she was going shopping

242
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,560
but didn't mention where.

243
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,700
The phone line might be down.

244
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,160
You don't think
Mom ran into the BIS agents, do you?

245
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,480
All the big shots are in Chongqing lately.

246
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,080
I haven't heard of any operations.

247
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,200
Why don't you ask your old colleagues

248
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
at the BIS about it?

249
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,600
Can't do that.

250
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,790
Why not?

251
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,080
First, there aren't
any operations going on.

252
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,410
As long as Mom isn't arrested,

253
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,580
she's not in any danger.

254
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,120
She probably just visited an old friend

255
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,330
and lost track of time.

256
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,190
She might have tried to call home,

257
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,820
but the phone line was down.

258
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,640
You know, what if

259
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,410
nothing actully happened?

260
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,670
If I start asking around,

261
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,470
people might get suspicious

262
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,840
and think we have connections
with Communist spies.

263
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,650
That wouldn't be good.

264
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,220
At a time like this,

265
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,600
you're still worried about
what others might think?

266
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,790
Mom cares about me.

267
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,410
She came all the way from Hong Kong

268
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,990
to take care of me and the child.

269
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,970
Afraid of being a burden,

270
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,540
she constantly contributes
to our household expenses

271
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,600
and helps you make money in business.

272
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,580
Now, she might be in danger,

273
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,250
and you won't even ask your colleagues?

274
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,360
It's just one simple question.

275
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,290
Would it kill you?

276
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,360
Keep your voice down.

277
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,320
Mom pays for all our groceries.

278
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,820
You haven't missed a single meal!

279
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,460
Enough! Lower your voice!

280
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,800
The neighbors are all my colleagues.

281
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,860
These Japanese-built wooden houses
have terrible soundproofing!

282
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,190
You can hear even a fart!

283
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,220
Let me tell you,

284
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,410
if Mom really is

285
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,740
arrested as a Communist spy,

286
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,580
our whole family is finished!

287
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,530
You don't care about our child?

288
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,580
Or your husband?

289
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,420
Why did you force me to say it?

290
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,620
It can't be that serious, can it?

291
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,650
As long as Mom isn't a Communist spy,

292
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,320
it won't be.

293
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,280
Stop overthinking.

294
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,460
I'll ask around tomorrow.

295
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,740
Remember to get someone to fix the phone.

296
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,180
If it hadn't broken,

297
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,360
we wouldn't have had this problem today.

298
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,060
Alright.

299
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,460
Go heat some water for me.

300
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,850
I've been running around all day.
I need to soak my feet.

302
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,560
What?

303
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,840
[Fu Sinian,
President of National Taiwan University]

304
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,640
Professor Yin has been
arrested by BIS agents?

305
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,500
May I ask who's calling?

306
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,020
Okay.

307
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,310
Okay.

308
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,440
Thank you very much.

309
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,330
That Chen Cheng, breaking his promise!

310
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,650
Who would dare teach
at National Taiwan University after this?

311
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,850
Why would the BIS arrest Professor Yin?

312
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,350
The school just cooperated
with Officer Chen

313
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,480
in arresting over 500 students
as Communist spies.

314
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,740
They promised not to touch the teachers.

315
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,520
Is this information reliable?

316
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,700
Whether it's reliable or not,

317
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,620
just ask and we'll know.

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,380
Students!

340
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,610
Students!

341
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,110
Professor Yin, are you alright?

342
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,770
Students!

343
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,370
Thank you for your help.

344
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,410
This time, I've truly seen

345
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,770
what it means when evil forces rule

346
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,860
and their lackeys run rampant.

347
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,720
Check, please.

348
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,130
The Nationalist Government is doomed.
Absolutely doomed!

349
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,230
Adjutant Nie.

350
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,140
Give me back my rights! Give me freedom!

351
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,490
What are you doing here?

352
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,690
I happened to have some time today,

353
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,460
so I came to buy the taro cake

354
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,660
Lu Zhenhua has been craving for so long.

355
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
I didn't expect to run into you here.

356
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,770
Why are you here?

357
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,600
And in civilian clothes, too.

358
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,940
Had some business nearby

359
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,140
and got hungry, so I was grabbing a bite.

360
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,710
Well, it's almost time.

361
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,780
Time to work.

362
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,150
Shall we go back together?

363
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,730
Give me back my rights!

364
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Okay.

365
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,540
Let's go.

366
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,580
Give me freedom! Give me back my rights!

367
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,470
Give me freedom!

368
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,410
Rickshaw!

369
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,940
Where to, ma'am?

370
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,160
To the No. 3 bus stop.

371
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,560
All right. Hold on tight.

372
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,150
See you later, Adjutant Nie.

373
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,670
Okay.

374
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,090
Deputy Chief Wu.

375
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,240
It's safe. I saw her come out myself.

376
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,670
No one was following her.

377
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,130
This is the phone number
for Mrs. Chen's daughter's place.

378
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,440
She should have destroyed the film.

379
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,240
Tell her to come get the backup
as soon as possible.

380
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,370
This is urgent intelligence
from the East Sea Team.

381
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,400
Please deliver it as soon as possible.

382
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,310
[Cai Xiaoqian, alias Zheng,
Secretary of CPC Taiwan Work Committee]

383
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,640
So quick?

384
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,170
We just met a few days ago.

385
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,650
The East Sea Team is impressive.

386
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,350
I'm only responsible
for a small part of it,

387
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,100
just running errands.

388
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,820
Mrs. Chen.

389
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,980
You don't look well.

390
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,160
Is something wrong?

391
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,820
There was a small incident just now,

392
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,930
but it's fine.

393
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,020
It's over now.

394
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,340
I'll have to trouble you with the rest.

395
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,550
We'll do our best to help you
deliver the intelligence.

396
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,980
That's our mission.

397
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,810
We'll be accountable to our superiors.

398
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,980
Mrs. Chen.

399
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,160
Even if it's not a mission,

400
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,920
just let me know if you need anything.

401
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,160
You're too kind.

402
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,420
The line is fixed?

403
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,210
This is Hongxiang Silk Shop.

404
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,890
Is this Mrs. Chen's residence?

405
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,700
She's not home.

406
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,030
What can I help you with?

407
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,290
The fabric Madam ordered from our shop
has arrived.

408
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,420
Please let her know.

409
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,500
I'll tell her when she returns.

410
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,590
I'm back.

411
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,340
Mom, you're back.

412
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
What happened?

413
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,520
Where have you been all night?

414
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,880
I was so worried!

415
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
-Sit down.
-Sorry for worrying you.

416
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,420
Mom, what happened?

417
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,380
You didn't come home all night yesterday.

418
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,550
I was so worried!

419
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,500
I went out shopping,

420
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,010
and while I was shopping,

421
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,880
I ran into people from the BIS.

422
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,460
They mistook me for a spy

423
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,510
and arrested me.

424
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,630
After all that trouble,

425
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,270
it turned out they just wanted some money,

426
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,110
you know?

427
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,140
Then, I told them

428
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,880
that my son-in-law

429
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,160
is Wang Changcheng
from the Provincial Police Department.

430
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,320
They knew you

431
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,770
and said I needed to call and verify.

432
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,140
Changcheng.

433
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Were you not at work yesterday?

434
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,010
I was on field duty last night,

435
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,010
not at the office.

436
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,290
Alas!

437
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,910
Then, why was no one
answering the phone at home?

438
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,620
The home phone was broken yesterday.

439
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,350
It was only fixed this morning.

440
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,020
What a coincidence.

441
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,390
Mom, they didn't hurt you,

442
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,510
did they?

443
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,270
It was just a matter of

444
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,930
solving the problem with money.

445
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,270
Changcheng has quite a reputation.

446
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,110
When I mentioned his name,

447
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,270
they all knew who he was

448
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,770
and even gave me food.

449
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,560
What's important is you're back safely.

450
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,720
If anything had happened to you,

451
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,620
how would I explain to my siblings?

452
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,740
At least those brats had some conscience,

453
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,200
otherwise I wouldn't
let them off so easily!

454
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,140
By the way, Mom,

455
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,590
where exactly were you detained?

456
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,610
I asked several colleagues at the BIS,

457
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,510
but none of them knew.

458
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,550
About that detention place,

459
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,410
I'm not sure where it was, either.

460
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,660
The moment I woke up today,

461
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,270
they released me.

462
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
How can they just arrest people at will?

463
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,660
Extorting money
from ordinary people all day—

464
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,320
what kind of behavior is that?

465
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,930
Ju, I'm so sorry

466
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,120
for causing you so much trouble

467
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,360
and making you worried

468
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,290
and concerned.

469
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,660
I apologize to you.

470
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,190
Please don't say that, Mom.

471
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,010
It's getting late.

472
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,620
I need to go to work.
You two can go on chatting.

473
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,260
Alright.

474
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,240
By the way, Mom,

475
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,170
did you order any fabric from

476
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,790
Hongxiang Silk Shop before?

477
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,740
No, I didn't.

478
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,010
That's strange.

479
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,290
Someone called today saying

480
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,020
your fabric order has arrived.

481
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,090
Oh! Yes, yes!

482
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,400
I did order it.

483
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,460
I... It is quite hot in Hong Kong,

484
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,830
but it's cold in Taipei.

485
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,720
So I wanted to get some more clothes made.

486
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,630
I was so tired

487
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,400
that I forgot it.

488
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes, I did order it.

489
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,460
It's fine, Mom.
Don't forget to pick it up.

490
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,110
I'm leaving now.

491
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,200
Alright.

492
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,830
Mom, what would you like to eat?

493
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,650
I'll make it for you now.

494
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,790
No need, Ju.

495
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,260
All I want now is to get some sleep.

496
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,690
I'm so tired!

497
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,250
Ju.

498
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,650
I want to ask you something.

499
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,630
Since I've been staying at your home,

500
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,430
I've caused you so much trouble.

501
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,430
Has Changcheng been displeased about it?

502
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,620
Not at all, Mom.

503
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,530
You're overthinking.

504
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,850
You've come to help us,

505
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,620
contributing to our household expenses

506
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,200
and helping us taking care of the baby.

507
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,490
You've saved us a lot of worry.

508
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,820
We couldn't be happier!

509
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,040
Then, I can rest easy.

510
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,770
I'll go get some rest.

511
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,810
[Hongxiang Silk Shop]

512
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,560
Madam.

513
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,350
What would you like to buy?

514
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,580
I'd like to look at some fabric.

515
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,450
Fabric, right?

516
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,880
Our shop

517
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,390
just received a new batch of fine fabrics.

518
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,340
I guarantee you'll like them.

519
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,730
Good.

520
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,770
This way, please.

521
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,410
Look. This is

522
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,880
the fabric that arrived from the West
a few days ago.

523
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,740
It was just made into a cheongsam.

524
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,480
See how bright the color is.

525
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,870
The material is excellent too.

526
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,920
Yes, and this one too.

527
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,960
You can feel it.

528
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,380
This fabric.

529
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,810
Feels nice, doesn't it?

530
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,770
Where is this from?

531
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,740
This one is from Southeast Asia.

532
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,510
You can take a look at it too.

533
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,050
Hello.

534
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,210
Sir.

535
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,700
You called to inform me

536
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,240
that Mrs. Chen's fabric order has arrived.

537
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,440
I'm here to pick it up.

538
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,950
Madam, please continue browsing here.

539
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,220
Sir, I'll go look for your order.

540
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,200
Thank you.

541
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,700
Mom.

542
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,380
Changcheng!

543
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,350
You...

544
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,930
What are you doing here?

545
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,770
The situation in Taiwan is unstable now.

546
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,830
You're new here.

547
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,550
I was worried you might run into trouble,

548
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,480
so I came over.

549
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,290
I just came to look at some fabric.

550
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,480
Just in case.

551
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,010
Alright.

552
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,660
Haven't found it yet?

553
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,370
Just a moment, sir.

554
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,420
Look at you, coming to take care of me
while you're working.

555
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm really causing you trouble.

556
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,700
It's no trouble, Mom.

557
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,680
I'll keep you company for a while.

558
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,520
We're family.

559
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,090
Found it!

560
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,420
It's this one.

561
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,470
Yes, this fabric was delivered
from the mainland a few days ago.

562
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,770
It's so smooth.

563
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,010
And the color is elegant.

564
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,570
It's just that it's a bit expensive.

565
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,100
You really have good taste.

566
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,050
Here.

567
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,350
Mom, let me call a rickshaw for you.

568
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,700
I'm running out of time.

569
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,860
Changcheng, no need.

570
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,160
I want to look around a bit more.

571
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,250
You should hurry to work.

572
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,250
Don't be late!

573
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
Alright, then.

574
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,340
I'm off to work.

575
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:26,820
Okay.

576
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,460
Madam, let's continue looking over here.

577
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,790
Alright.

578
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,700
There are two more kinds of fabric here

579
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,550
that I haven't shown you yet.

580
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,350
They've also arrived recently.

581
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,500
Should be this…

582
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,700
Thank you.

583
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,380
It was due to my poor arrangement.

584
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,840
I'm sorry you had to suffer.

585
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,440
Not at all.

586
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,640
Thank you for rescuing me.

587
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,570
And I must thank Adjutant Nie

588
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,370
for covering up the matter
at Hongxiang Silk Shop.

589
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,380
It was what we ought to do.

590
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,250
Since he used the clerk's phone call
as an excuse,

591
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,150
we couldn't leave any loose ends.

592
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,330
The film I gave you last time
was destroyed, right?

593
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,650
I brought you a backup.

594
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,300
No need.

595
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,680
I've sent it out.

596
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,700
You've sent it out?

597
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,680
Yes.

598
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,610
In such a dangerous situation,

599
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,360
why didn't you
destroy the film right away?

600
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,840
I instructed you to do so.

601
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,830
It's not easy to gather intelligence.

602
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,480
If it could be preserved,

603
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,890
shouldn't we try our best to keep it?

604
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,460
Before you came to Taiwan,

605
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,000
didn't Wan tell you?

606
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,600
Safety comes first in clandestine work.

607
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,980
You will be safe only after
the evidence is destroyed.

608
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,140
Only then will the comrades
of the intelligence line be safe.

609
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,710
But we should handle things
according to the circumstances.

610
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,190
I was told about

611
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,080
the time sensitivity of this intelligence.

612
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,650
If I didn't send it out,

613
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,900
when would it ever be delivered?

614
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,560
Besides, I didn't know there was a backup!

615
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,290
It's such important material.

616
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,900
Why did you act on your own

617
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,450
and disobey orders?

618
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,330
Even if you managed to save the film,

619
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,380
how could you go to the rendezvous

620
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,980
right after leaving the BIS?

621
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,830
Are you sure you weren't followed?

622
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,090
I checked repeatedly.

623
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,940
There were absolutely no security risks.

624
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,110
As a courier,

625
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,300
my primary duty is
to deliver intelligence.

626
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,100
Isn't that the right thing to do?

627
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,220
I just said safety is the top priority.

628
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,750
Delivering intelligence comes second.

629
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,010
Don't you understand?

630
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,630
Comrade Zhu Feng,

631
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,120
have you considered this?

632
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,080
Once the film falls into
the hands of the BIS,

633
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,640
your life will be in danger.

634
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,750
The Taiwan Work Committee
will have to withdraw,

635
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,750
and your family will be implicated.

636
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,290
The East Sea Team will be
completely exposed.

637
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,890
Most importantly,

638
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,340
our superior will lose

639
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,170
the most crucial intelligence source
from the Ministry of Defense.

640
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,010
From now on,

641
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,160
we'll suspend all communication.

642
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,630
I need to think about our next steps

643
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,860
before contacting you again.

644
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,720
Comrade Wu Shi,

645
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,690
where will we meet next time?

646
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,900
Go back and get some rest first.

647
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,660
Be sure to stay safe.

648
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,820
Comrade Wu Shi.

649
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,850
I didn't come to Taiwan

650
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,910
to take a vacation.

651
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,699
Originally,

652
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,150
someone else was supposed
to carry out this mission.

653
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,190
But due to an unexpected incident,

654
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,150
I came instead.

655
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,179
I know I made a mistake.

656
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,350
But this is my first time as a courier.

657
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,090
Shouldn't you give me another chance?

658
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,489
My previous courier was Taiwanese.

659
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,330
He had been in the revolution
for over a decade.

660
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,690
He was reliable and competent

661
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,090
and never made a mistake,

662
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,340
yet I still had to watch him

663
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,690
die right in front of me.

664
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,830
In our line of work,

665
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,340
there often isn't a second chance.

666
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,690
You think I'm worried about
the safety of the intelligence.

667
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,360
Wrong!

668
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,460
I just don't want my courier

669
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,840
to be sacrificed again.

670
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,570
I understand.

671
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,650
I know I made a mistake.

672
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,920
Wait for my notice.

673
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,380
Before that,

674
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,570
don't take any action.

675
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,410
Comrade Zhu Feng,

676
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,690
have you considered this?

677
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,670
Once the film falls into
the hands of the BIS,

678
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,210
your life will be in danger.

679
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,340
The Taiwan Work Committee
will have to withdraw,

680
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
and your family will be implicated.

681
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,340
Mom, you're back.

682
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,010
Did you make this?

683
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,940
It's the Ningbo rice cake you love,

684
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,840
along with many other Ningbo dishes.

685
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,100
Thank you for coming to Taiwan to help us.

686
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,480
I should thank you.

687
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,630
What are you thanking us for?

688
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,840
You're the one helping Changcheng
make money in business.

689
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,370
We're the ones benefiting.

690
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,550
Changcheng, serve the yellow croaker.

691
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,290
Right away.

692
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,290
No need.

693
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,900
I'm a bit tired now.

694
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,430
I'd like to rest for a while.

695
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,220
You go ahead and eat.

696
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,440
What's wrong with Mom?

697
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,570
Mom says she's a bit tired

698
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,870
and wants to rest.

699
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,960
Yiliang still hasn't shown up.

700
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,660
Could something have happened?

701
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,460
[Chen Zemin, Deputy Secretary
of CPC Keelung Work Committee]

702
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,840
Rebuilding the communication line
in one week

703
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,400
is indeed a daunting task.

704
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,180
If he doesn't arrive before dark,

705
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,310
I'll go to Keelung myself.

706
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,300
I guess that's our only option.

707
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,780
Be careful on your way.

708
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,390
Don't worry, Zheng. I have experience.

709
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,150
If anything happens,

710
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,210
contact the local liaison directly.

711
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:12,670
Yiliang.

712
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,550
Why are you so late?

713
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,840
Did anything happen on your way here?

714
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,360
What's wrong?

715
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,520
I was stopped at a checkpoint.

716
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,980
It's fine. I can handle it.

717
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,840
The new communication station
is ready to use.

718
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,800
The intelligence.

719
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,450
Hurry.

720
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,220
Good that you're safe.

721
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,040
The film is inside.

722
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,050
Here.

723
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,760
Alright, I'll leave, then.

724
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,620
Wait, Yiliang.

725
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,430
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

726
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,570
Haven't seen you for a week.

727
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,560
You look exhausted.

728
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,360
Wait a moment.

729
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,260
Take this.

730
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,710
Thanks.

731
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,940
Zheng.

732
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,140
Did you know Zhang Hao's real name

733
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,390
was Lin Yiwei?

734
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,400
Yiliang is his younger brother.

735
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,980
On December 10, 1949,

736
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,600
Chiang Kai-shek hastily evacuated
from Chengdu.

737
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,560
He flew directly to Taiwan
on his private plane, the "Zhongmei."

738
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,410
Now broadcasting the news.

739
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,860
On the afternoon of November 30, 1949,

740
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,850
the PLA, advancing toward Chongqing

741
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,360
after occupying Jiangjin,

742
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,500
Shunjiangchang, Yudong Town,

743
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,980
Nanwenquan and Mudong Town
on the south bank of the Yangtze River,

744
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,460
crossed the Yangtze River
from these places

745
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,190
and liberated Chongqing in the afternoon.

746
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,060
Keep listening.

747
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,470
On the eve of Chongqing's liberation,

748
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,280
the remnants of the Kuomintang
scrambled to escape

749
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,420
in disarray.

750
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,410
On the morning of the 30th,
Chiang Kai-shek

751
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,460
fled in panic to Chengdu.

752
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,440
Yan Xishan and Zhang Qun had already

753
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,010
fled to Chengdu on the 28th.

754
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,110
The collapse of the Southwest defense line

755
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,130
-completely crushed Chiang Kai-shek's
-Sir.

756
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,270
-dream of a decisive battle in Sichuan.
-On the meeting just now,

757
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,000
what did they say
about Chongqing's liberation ?

758
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,820
Go tune in to the Central News Agency.

759
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,020
To preserve its strength
and fight elsewhere,

760
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,530
the Nationalist Army

761
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,010
voluntarily withdrew from Chongqing.

762
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,080
President Chiang,
reluctant to leave the wartime capital,

763
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,740
held out until the very last moment.

764
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,100
Only on December 1st

765
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,480
did he go to Chengdu
to continue commanding.

766
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,780
Taichung area:
cloudy with scattered showers,

767
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,350
15 to 28 degrees.

768
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
Having lost Chongqing as a barrier,

769
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,810
Chiang Kai-shek actually wants to fight

770
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,230
a decisive battle with the PLA
in the western Sichuan plain.

771
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,960
The troops of the Southwest Office,

772
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,090
from Hu Zongnan down to Sun Yuanliang,

773
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,850
are all clustered together.

774
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,080
Which one of them has the determination
to fight to the death?

775
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,360
How can they fight a decisive battle
with the PLA?

776
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,880
The liberation of Chengdu
is just a matter of time.

777
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,150
Sir, you previously worked
as an interpreter for the White Group

778
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,340
and suffered so much hardship.

779
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,590
Now it all seems worthwhile.

780
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,380
Let me use tea instead of wine

781
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,150
to toast you

782
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,270
in celebration.

783
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,490
Why use tea instead of wine?

784
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,170
Get some wine. Let's have a drink.

785
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,000
In the office?

786
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,380
This is the office.

787
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,090
That's not appropriate, is it?

788
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:54,950
I want to drink.

789
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,470
You should have one.

790
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,210
I'll drink with you tonight
when we get back.

791
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,070
I want to drink.

792
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,390
We're in the office. If someone sees…

793
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,340
I want to drink.

794
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,240
Can't I drown my sorrows?

795
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,250
Drowning your sorrows?

796
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,150
Fine.

797
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,940
I'll go take a shower first.

798
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,860
Adjutant Nie.

799
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,260
What a coincidence.

800
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,660
What are you so happy about?

801
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,630
Happy? Not at all.

802
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,130
Then why did you drink?

803
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,420
It's only 8:30.

804
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,360
You're usually still working at this hour.

805
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,670
Is there some wonderful news

806
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,560
you're celebrating?

807
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,840
Who says drinking is
only for celebrations?

808
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,460
Can't I drink to drown my sorrows?

809
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,150
You're so concerned
about the party and country.

810
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,270
I'm deeply impressed!
