00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,289
What kind of place is Hong Kong?

5
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,310
Hong Kong is to our lower left.

6
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,070
Do you know Guangdong?

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,180
It's right next to Guangdong.

8
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,580
If Guangdong were the size
of a watermelon,

9
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,759
Hong Kong would be the size of an egg.

10
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,789
Is it fun there?

11
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,850
Fun?

12
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,000
We went there for work.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
Why did you take off the watch
I bought you?

14
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,780
There are many delicious foods there.

15
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,590
Your dad specifically bought
the Wife Cake for you.

16
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,850
This one is quite nice.

17
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,230
That one is too valuable.

18
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,620
So I just kept it in a box.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Is there a wife inside the Wife Cake?

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,260
Inside the Wife Cake?

21
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,410
Take a look
and see if there's a wife in it.

22
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,340
I get it now.

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,740
Wives are only at home.

24
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,970
Sometimes there's no wife at home either.

25
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,630
Why isn't there a wife at home?

26
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,940
Because she's working overtime.
She's busy.

Thank you for your trust.

I should be the one thanking you.

This time you're going to Taiwan

47

I'll resolve the pass issue
as soon as possible

52

and arrange for a new courier
to replace you.

How dare I take credit?

169
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,740
When I arrived in Kinmen,

170
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,160
I only boosted the morale.

171
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,150
If anyone deserves credit,

172
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,570
it should be you, General Li.

173
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,240
That's right.

174
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,580
I don't deserve such praise.

175
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,060
General Hu,
if not for your reinforcements,

176
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,330
[Li Liangrong, Commander
of the 22nd Corps of the Kuomintang]

177
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,240
the outcome of this battle
would have been uncertain.

178
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,930
Cheers to you!

179
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,790
I just did my job.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,650
Cheers.

181
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,300
Deputy Chief Liu.

182
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,110
General Hu Lian.

183
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,980
Congratulations.

184
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,580
Thank you.

185
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,240
Commander Tang.

186
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Let me toast you.

187
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,930
[Tang Enbo, Deputy Commander of the KMT's
Southeast Military and Political Office]

188
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,740
Top Scholar Wu.

189
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,930
Why are you hiding here?

190
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,050
Let me toast you.

191
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,320
I should be the one toasting you,
General Hu.

192
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,870
I never expected

193
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,650
you to be such a hearty drinker.

194
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,570
I'll finish mine too.

195
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm happy for you, General Hu.

196
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,660
Your contribution was indispensable

197
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,590
to the great victory at Guningtou.

198
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,520
Though we call it a great victory,

199
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,590
we also suffered heavy casualties.

200
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,980
How could that be?

201
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,930
Didn't we outnumber them?

202
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,680
We did outnumber them.

203
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,000
But we really didn't

204
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,290
anticipate

205
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,740
that the three regiments
of the Communist Army

206
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,140
would fight so fiercely,

207
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,100
thrusting deeply
toward the strategic high ground.

208
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,040
The lone army held out for four days.

209
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,190
To wipe them out,

210
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,170
our corps also suffered heavy casualties.

211
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,830
This was totally unexpected.

212
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,090
This was totally unexpected.

213
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,970
This was totally unexpected.

214
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,530
Sorry to keep you waiting.

215
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,820
Please have a seat.

216
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,200
Come on.

217
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,660
-Have a seat.
-Have a seat.

218
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,990
I asked you to stay

219
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,190
because the President
has an important matter to entrust to you.

220
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,450
He hopes you will give your full support.

221
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,970
Please go ahead.

222
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,180
The Southwest

223
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,250
is the rear base of our party.

224
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,010
During the War of Resistance,

225
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,590
if we hadn't relied on the Southwest,

226
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,520
our party would have been in grave danger.

227
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,350
Now we've reached another critical moment.

228
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,440
The President has decided

229
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,400
to concentrate all the military forces

230
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,500
in the Southwest

231
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,350
for a decisive battle
against the Communist Army.

232
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,550
If we win this battle,

233
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,950
the Southwest and Taiwan

234
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,340
can coordinate with each other,

235
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,090
laying a solid foundation

236
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,790
for our strategic counteroffensive.

237
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,790
The President truly has a grand vision.

238
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,690
Indeed.

239
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,130
In such extraordinary times,

240
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,810
we must employ extraordinary people.

241
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,430
The President has hired two

242
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,510
senior military advisors from Japan

243
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,360
to offer us strategic guidance.

244
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,140
This matter
must be kept strictly confidential.

245
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,750
What do you need us to do?

246
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,400
These two Japanese men

247
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,710
have read Deputy Chief Wu's works.

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
They believe

249
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,260
Deputy Chief Wu's strategic vision
and military skills

250
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,090
are truly admirable.

251
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,690
They've proposed

252
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,870
to have Deputy Chief Wu
serve as their interpreter.

253
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,300
This matter

254
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,340
has already been approved
by the President.

255
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,350
Commander Zhou,

256
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,470
Deputy Chief Wu is your subordinate.

257
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,520
So please talk to him about this matter.

258
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,330
This matter

259
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,920
might be quite difficult.

260
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,280
You all know

261
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,450
his temperament.

262
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,050
Moreover, one of his sons

263
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,570
was killed in a Japanese bombing.

264
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,330
He harbors deep hatred
toward the Japanese.

265
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,260
Asking him to be their interpreter

266
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,610
is something I find extremely difficult
to bring up.

267
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,060
But the President has already approved.

268
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,090
Perhaps

269
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,420
you could explain the situation
to the President yourself.

270
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,270
General Chen,

271
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,590
we also need your help

272
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,570
to work with Commander Zhou

273
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,380
to persuade Deputy Chief Wu.

274
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,550
After all,

275
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,880
you were classmates
at Baoding Military Academy.

276
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,310
Alright.

277
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,350
The interests of our party

278
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,880
are above everything else.

279
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,140
So regarding the victory
at Guningtou in Kinmen,

280
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,780
the primary credit naturally goes
to our 18th Army.

281
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,310
Exactly.

282
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:13,800
Indeed.

283
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
And that strategic advisor Lin Baoyuan,

284
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,740
despite being

285
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,460
a defeated Japanese commander,

286
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,280
really knows

287
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,940
the art of warfare.

288
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,480
Exactly.

289
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,810
Using a Japanese as our strategic advisor

290
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,060
will get us scolded

291
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,700
if this gets out!

292
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,030
Have you lost your mind?

293
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,440
Our enemy now is the Communist Party.

294
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,870
What's wrong with defending Taiwan?

295
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,490
Besides,

296
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,700
selecting people based on talent
shows we're broad-minded!

297
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,070
General Yin, you're correct.

298
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,930
Commander Yin.

299
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,560
Do you know

300
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
who Lin Baoyuan is?

301
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,810
Lin Baoyuan is Hiroshi Nemoto,

302
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,840
a war criminal
who has killed Chinese people.

303
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,020
It's General Chen.

304
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,550
The Japanese invaders
devastated our country.

305
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,890
It was at the cost of 35 million lives

306
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,220
that we finally won the War of Resistance.

307
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,110
Now,

308
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,960
the Kuomintang Army has actually hired
this Japanese war criminal

309
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,220
as a strategic advisor

310
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,330
to harm our fellow countrymen.

311
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,190
This is allying with the villain!

312
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,800
It's an utter disgrace to all soldiers
who fought against Japanese aggression!

313
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,570
How dare you spout such nonsense here?

314
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,970
Don't you have any shame?

315
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,250
As long as we can defeat the Communists,

316
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,450
what's wrong with using Japanese help?

317
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,300
General Chen, I know you

318
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,070
once participated in

319
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,330
the Japanese surrender ceremony
in Qingdao.

320
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,830
But times have changed.

321
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,420
Today is a day to celebrate our victory.

322
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,870
Why do you
have to pour cold water on this?

323
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,060
This battle was at Guningtou.

324
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,500
It was just because your tanks

325
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,390
happened to stop

326
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,920
on the beach
where the Communist Army landed.

327
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,720
You know well how little credit
your medal actually deserves,

328
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,330
don't you?

329
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,170
How little credit?

330
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,880
It was my 18th Army
that reinforced in time!

331
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,950
General Chen,

332
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,980
you're just unwilling to accept this,
aren't you?

333
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,750
Back then, your department

334
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,380
made such serious mistakes.

335
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Tens of thousands of kilograms of grain

336
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,370
ended up in the Communist Army's hands.

337
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,880
Have you ever explained that clearly?

338
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,360
Well,

339
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,090
did you feel a kinship
with the Communist Army?

340
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,070
Or did you have such bad eyesight

341
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,570
that you signed the wrong documents?

342
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,830
Cheers.

343
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,340
General Chen,

344
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,400
please wait.

345
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,190
Commander Yin.

346
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,000
Please apologize to General Chen.

347
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,240
With all due respect,
I don't see why I should apologize.

348
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,720
The case about General Chen
supporting the Communist Army

349
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,580
was thoroughly investigated and cleared
at the end of last year.

350
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,070
An official notice has been issued

351
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,760
to prove General Chen's innocence

352
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,570
That's the first reason.

353
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,130
Second,

354
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,720
General Chen

355
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,000
lost sight in one eye

356
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,980
while defending our country

357
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,460
against Japanese invaders.

358
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,810
Today,

359
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,980
we can enjoy peace here,

360
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,000
drinking, chatting,

361
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
and enjoying ourselves,

362
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,000
all thanks to the countless
anti-Japanese soldiers

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,390
like General Chen

364
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,810
who sacrificed their lives

365
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,510
and shed their blood.

366
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,610
Yet you mocked him.

367
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,440
Therefore,

368
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,860
please apologize.

369
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,720
Forget it.

370
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,450
An apology from someone like him

371
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,550
means nothing to me.

372
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,060
No.

373
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,920
I won't accept it
if he doesn't apologize today.

374
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,820
Top Scholar Wu,

375
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,980
there's no need to get angry.

376
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,410
General Chen, there's no need

377
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,410
to be so petty with a junior officer.

378
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,690
Let me handle these trivial matters.

379
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,800
Commander Yin has had too much to drink.

380
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Take him back.

381
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,810
Wait!

382
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,390
Boyu.

383
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,720
The War of Resistance lasted 14 years.

384
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,250
You know that better than me

385
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,140
how much we sacrificed.

386
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,160
Today, if Commander Yin

387
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,570
doesn't apologize
for his inappropriate words,

388
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,300
I won't let it go.

389
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Do we really want to break the hearts

390
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,610
of our fellow Chinese?

391
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,280
Apologize.

392
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,880
Apologize to General Chen.

393
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,760
Apologize to all the soldiers

394
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,790
who shed blood

395
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,640
and sweat

396
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,880
during the War of Resistance!

397
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,240
Don't forget where you came from.

398
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,000
What are you waiting for?

399
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,770
General Chen,

400
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,280
I just spoke out of line.

401
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm willing to accept military punishment.

402
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,930
Take him back
to the division headquarters.

403
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,260
Confine him and make him reflect!

404
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,800
Yes, sir!

405
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,930
Top Scholar Wu,

406
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,490
it's my fault for failing
to discipline my subordinates.

407
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,970
I'll enforce stricter discipline
from now on.

408
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,570
Let's have a drink together.

409
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,720
No, thanks.

410
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,480
I've had too much already.

411
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,420
Zizhen,

412
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,900
it's been four years since we parted
at the 4th War Zone.

413
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,260
Today you still have such courage,

414
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,770
daring to speak up for justice.

415
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,610
I truly admire you.

416
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,760
No, no.

417
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,030
Deputy Chief Wu, you're too kind.

418
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,240
Tonight I was reckless again.

419
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,350
Times have changed.

420
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,210
I've just cleared myself of suspicions
of supporting Communists,

421
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,460
and now I've done something
so absurd again,

422
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,320
making you step in and help me out.

423
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,580
I'm truly ashamed.

424
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,810
Zizhen.

425
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,710
You're being too formal with me.

426
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,850
We've been
through life and death together.

427
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,330
What I admire most about you

428
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,010
is you bold and unyielding spirit.

429
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,990
I'll treat you to drinks another day.

430
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,960
Let's get together
for a good drink sometime.

431
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,330
He's a bold and heroic man.

432
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,130
Given General Chen's personality,

433
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,740
in today's Taiwan,

434
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,710
life will be quite difficult for him.

435
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,590
It's too cold outside.

436
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,570
Let's chat inside.

437
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,440
Senior, I know
you have high blood pressure.

438
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,290
Don't drink too much.

439
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,240
Please sit down.

440
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,880
Sit down.

441
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,800
Today,

442
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,870
let me toast you

443
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,230
with tea instead of wine.

444
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,000
Tonight calls for a good drink.

445
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,500
Besides,

446
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,740
let me tell you a secret.

447
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,130
After drinking,

448
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,630
my blood pressure isn't high at all.

449
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,570
You haven't lost your touch at all!

450
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,520
Zhirou.

451
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,340
When I was studying
at Baoding Military Academy,

452
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,950
I knew Yuxun was exceptionally talented.

453
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,040
Sure enough, my hunch was right.

454
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,830
Look, at the front,

455
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,170
we have fierce generals like Boyu,

456
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,130
and in the rear,

457
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,830
we have strategic talents like Yuxun.

458
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,310
We'll surely reclaim the mainland
within three years.

459
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,760
I'm flattered.

460
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,310
By the time the military aid arrived,

461
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,240
we had achieved victory at Kinmen.

462
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,980
It was just a nice extra.

463
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,170
I'm in no way comparable to the generals

464
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,770
fighting on the front lines.

465
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,390
I'm already unworthy
of receiving the medal.

466
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,390
You're always so modest,

467
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
letting others take all the credit!

468
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,760
Chairman, Chief,

469
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,500
what brings you here to see me?

470
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,930
The President
has coordinated the Southwest.

471
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,980
He has led the troops
to defend the Southwest

472
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,000
for some time.

473
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,600
To ensure absolute success,

474
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,170
the President has invited

475
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,260
Naosuke Tomita, who now goes
by the name Bai Hongliang,

476
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,750
and Kunimitsu Aratake, who goes
by the name Lin Guang,

477
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,310
to offer advice to our army.

478
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,310
Naosuke Tomita?

479
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,090
Kunimitsu Aratake?

480
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,950
These two are war criminals.

481
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,210
They are war criminals,

482
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,060
aren't they?

483
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,960
Yes, they are.

484
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,890
How did we end up working with them?

485
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,270
Now our party is in imminent danger.

486
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,310
The President is doing this

487
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,220
for the sake of our ideology, our party

488
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,890
and our country.

489
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,330
Besides,

490
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,020
Bai Hongliang and Lin Guang

491
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,310
have thoroughly studied
your military writings.

492
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,830
They greatly admire you.

493
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,310
So the President

494
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,540
wants us

495
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,720
to tell you this.

496
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,780
Senior,

497
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,610
we all know

498
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,170
you harbor deep hatred
toward the Japanese,

499
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,560
since one of your sons

500
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,100
died during the War of Resistance.

501
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,760
Yes, indeed.

502
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,870
But in our army,

503
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,750
only you have both

504
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,810
military expertise

505
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,030
and Japanese proficiency.

506
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,280
And the President also hopes
that you'll provide

507
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,540
an operational summary later.

508
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,310
So...

509
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,650
So he wants me

510
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,780
to serve as an interpreter
for the Japanese

511
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,090
and communicate with them.

512
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,610
Yes.

513
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,670
But when Ching-kuo came to me,

514
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,000
I flatly refused.

515
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,060
I know that

516
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,440
you're open
to discussing just about anything,

517
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,770
but when it comes to matters
involving the Japanese,

518
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,510
you certainly won't agree.

519
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,370
But honestly,

520
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,740
to serve as the interpreter
between the President

521
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,470
and the Japanese effectively,

522
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,070
one must

523
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,350
not only have a high level

524
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,980
of military expertise,

525
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,280
but also have a thorough knowledge

526
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,040
of the situation in the Southwest.

527
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,170
Senior,

528
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,530
you are recognized

529
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,650
as the top talent in our army.

530
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,480
In our ministry, no one can match

531
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,560
your level of military theory

532
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,290
and Japanese language skills.

533
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,800
That's why

534
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,960
the President personally selected you.

535
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,810
However, I've already told Ching-kuo

536
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,280
that you are a man of principle

537
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,720
and would absolutely refuse this matter.

538
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,810
Sir, are your okay?

539
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:51,740
I'm fine.

540
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,500
Why did Chief Zhou ask you to come here?

541
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,040
Mr. Chiang wants me to serve

542
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,590
as the interpreter for the White Group.

543
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,020
Sir.

544
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,110
Please stop drinking.

545
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,860
Stop drinking.

546
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,930
[Welcome the soldiers
for the victory at Kinmen]

547
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,870
Stop.

548
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,100
Stop here.

549
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,360
What's wrong, Sir?

550
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,850
I'm a bit afraid to go in.

551
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,260
I understand.

552
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,810
Jingcheng was killed by the Japanese.

553
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,170
And now Mr. Chiang is asking you

554
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,370
to be the interpreter for the Japanese.

555
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,590
You must feel like

556
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,070
you can't face Mrs. Wu, right?

557
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,190
The Southwest Campaign has begun.

558
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,320
Mr. Chiang's staff team

559
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,560
mainly consists of Gu Zhutong
and some others in Chongqing.

560
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,520
We're in Taiwan,

561
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,020
unable to get any core intelligence.

562
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,140
There's no easier way to get intelligence

563
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,950
than straight from Mr. Chiang himself.

564
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,340
That's true.

565
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,060
But this would put you

566
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,240
in a really difficult position.

567
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,710
Sir, let me walk you in.

568
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:42,770
No need.

569
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,700
Go home early.

570
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,540
Mr. Wu, you're back.

571
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,449
Mom!

572
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,980
My toy car is broken.

573
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,550
Let me see what's wrong...

574
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,320
With it.

575
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,320
It looks fine to me.

576
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,670
I don't know.

577
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,840
It just stopped working.

578
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,960
It stopped working?

579
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,590
Tomorrow your dad will buy you a new one.

580
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,460
I don't want a new one!

581
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,820
I just like this one!

582
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,560
I'll buy you a new one tomorrow, okay?

583
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm back. Give it to me.

584
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,260
I will fix it for you.

585
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,610
Don't get me a new one.

586
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,949
No new one. I'll fix this one for you.

587
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,380
Don't worry. I'll definitely fix it.

588
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,440
Come on, let's go.

589
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,930
Let me carry you.

590
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,810
Bye, Dad.

591
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,140
You'll fix it, okay?

592
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,970
General.

593
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,070
This Commander Yin

594
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,060
is Hu Lian's favorite.

595
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,750
You just got through the review
not long ago.

596
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,740
I'm worried that if someone

597
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,170
makes a big fuss
about what happened today,

598
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,480
you might...

599
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,320
I'm afraid
you'll face more criticism again,

600
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,920
which might be detrimental
to our future work.

601
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,310
You can put your mind at ease.

602
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,710
I know what I'm doing.

603
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,970
Even if today's matter gets reported

604
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,370
all the way to Mr. Chiang,

605
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,950
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

606
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,320
All those soldiers present fought

607
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,640
in the 14-year War of Resistance.

608
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,910
Every one of them has a blood feud

609
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,140
with the Japanese.

610
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,900
Every one of them bears

611
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,580
an irreconcilable hatred
toward the Japanese.

612
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,360
Today, I spoke

613
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,450
my mind openly there.

614
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,690
They wouldn't mind at all.

615
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,790
In fact, they would feel satisfied.

616
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,680
Do you know why?

617
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,450
Why?

618
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,520
First,

619
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,770
they are just like us,

620
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,570
having a blood feud with the Japanese.

621
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,340
Second,

622
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,840
so many people died

623
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,310
in the Battle of Kinmen.

624
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,080
We all feel so grieved about it.

625
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,390
Yet Hu Lian threw a big party there.

626
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,240
Anyone with a shred of conscience

627
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,900
would feel as sad as we do.

628
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,360
Therefore,

629
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,580
after what happened today,

630
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,070
there will definitely be people
who dare to speak up in the future.

631
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,330
As you've seen,

632
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,090
my old friend,

633
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,410
Wu Yuxun,

634
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,510
now as the Deputy Chief
of the Ministry of Defense,

635
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,210
resolutely

636
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,670
stood up for me.

637
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,980
Wu Yuxun,

638
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,570
back when he was in Nanjing

639
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,040
serving as the Director
of the Historical and Political Bureau,

640
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
once said, "Heaven won't

641
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,920
tolerate the Kuomintang regime's
survival."

642
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,320
He has felt the pain personally.

643
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,610
His son, Wu Jingcheng,

644
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,300
died due to the defeat
of the Henan-Hunan-Guangxi Campaign.

645
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,650
I've met Jingcheng.

646
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,850
Every time he saw me,

647
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,660
he tugged at my clothes and said,

648
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,190
"Uncle Baocang,

649
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,080
when I grow up,

650
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,830
I want to learn from you
how to ride horses and fight in battles."

651
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,830
Jingcheng was naturally bright.

652
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,190
And Yuxun loved him dearly.

653
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,500
Losing this child

654
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,500
caused him years of suffering.

655
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,740
No wonder the gentle Deputy Chief Wu

656
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,600
got so furious today.

657
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,150
Wu Yuxun and I

658
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,610
are not only alumni
from Baoding Military Academy,

659
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,010
but also worked together

660
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,770
in the 4th War Zone.

661
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,740
During the Battle of Kunlun Pass,

662
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,240
we fought side by side,

663
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,360
sharing life and death like brothers.

664
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,610
I should find a convenient time
to meet with him.

665
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,920
It might yield some unexpected results.

666
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,740
Dad.

667
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,550
Dad.

668
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,240
Jingcheng.

669
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,520
What's wrong?

670
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,790
Dad.

671
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,270
I'm in pain.

672
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,730
Dou.

673
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,540
Dou.

674
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,190
Have you seen Mr. Wu?

675
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,390
No, I haven't.

676
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,400
Qian.

677
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,880
Qian!

678
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,480
Qian!

679
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:02,820
Qian!

680
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,540
I'm here.

681
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,760
Have you seen Mr. Wu?

682
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,870
No, I haven't.

683
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,000
Qian,

684
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,160
take my car and hurry back

685
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,250
to tell Mrs. Wu not to worry.

686
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,410
Mr. Wu is in the office.

687
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,170
I'll head back then.

688
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,500
Okay, drive carefully.

689
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,270
Sir.

690
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,450
Is it work time already?

691
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,110
No.

692
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,350
It's only 4 a.m.

693
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,090
Then why are you here?

694
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,290
I was looking for you.

695
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,690
Mrs. Wu was worried when you weren't home,

696
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,250
so she called me.

697
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,170
She has woken up?

698
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,610
I'll make a call.

699
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,240
No need.

700
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,200
I came with Qian.

701
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,230
I saw the lights on upstairs,

702
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,190
so I told him to head back right away

703
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,520
to let Mrs. Wu know
and not get too worried.

704
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,550
What's wrong?

705
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,780
I had a dream.

706
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,740
A dream?

707
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,710
What did you dream about?

708
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,360
Nothing.

709
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,760
You don't need to stay with me.
Go get some rest.

710
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,070
Sir.

711
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,560
If you're feeling upset,

712
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,650
we don't have to go.

713
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,340
Nonsense.

714
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,280
If I wanted to feel at ease,

715
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,600
I would have stayed in Fuzhou
and joined the uprising,

716
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,790
instead of coming to Taiwan.
