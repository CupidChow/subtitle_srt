[Episode 6]

3
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,850
Mr. Gu.

4
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,310
Do you have any clever plans?

5
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,500
I wouldn't call it clever.

6
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,590
According to information,

7
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,310
when this banquet was being prepared,

8
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,840
his communication line was cut off.

9
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,120
He can't reach
any of his Communist spy accomplices

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,250
outside the island,

11
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,650
which means

12
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,090
the contact who comes tonight

13
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,120
can't be on the invitation list.

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,850
They confessed everything.

15
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,380
They're from the Hong Kong station
of the BIS.

16
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,370
From the BIS?

17
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,750
Then why were they following me?

18
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,479
The BIS received information

19
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,640
that Communist spies planned to
sabotage the signing ceremony,

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,120
so they sent people from
the Hong Kong station to investigate

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
and to secretly protect you.

22
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,910
So, you're saying

23
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,430
I wronged them?

24
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,640
They did make some mistakes in their work.

25
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,860
However, thanks to your vigilance,

26
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,470
it was a close call with no real danger.

27
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,620
Thank you for your hard work.

28
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,960
The Chief certainly
chose the right person.

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,870
You flatter me.

30
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,020
My mission on this trip is
to ensure your safety

31
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,350
and the security of the signing ceremony.

32
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,440
You may go.

33
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,930
What about those two BIS agents?

34
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,300
They were just doing their duty.

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,700
Since they're innocent,

36
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,060
let them go.

37
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,410
Yes, I understand.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,140
Director Zhang is hedging his bets.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,440
Now, not only the BIS,

40
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,420
but the Second Department is
monitoring us, too.

41
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,610
Even if Manager Wan gets into the venue,

42
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,150
it will be difficult for him
to make contact.

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,630
This is the floor plan of the ballroom.

44
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,840
We'll need people here,

45
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,000
here, here, here,

46
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Here, as well.

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,950
We need our people at all these positions.

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,690
Mr. Li,

49
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,790
This could be the greatest achievement

50
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,790
since the establishment of the BIS.

51
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,440
I assume you have
more personnel available?

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,630
Sir, the newspaper.

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,800
I've checked the list of all the staff

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,260
for tonight's reception.

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,860
There are 39 people in total.

56
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,890
More than ten of them

57
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,800
were replaced within the last three days.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,600
They're probably agents
arranged by Gu Zhengwen.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,610
Other places will have people, too.
There will definitely be a lot.

60
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,120
What about Gu Zhengwen himself?

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
Haven't seen him yet.

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,860
We've caught the crack in it.

63
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,610
The Second Department is
no less capable than the BIS.

64
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,430
We'll soon get

65
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,920
something on Gu Zhengwen.

66
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,390
I wonder if Manager Wan

67
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,720
has seen the newspaper.

[The 7th China-U.S. Economic Aid Reception]

Ladies and gentlemen.

70
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,659
we are gathered here tonight

71
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,270
to enjoy peace and some fine wine,

72
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,030
and for that, we owe thanks to one man.

73
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,370
He is a distinguished military strategist

74

and my dear friend, General Wu Shi!

75
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,740
General Walker earlier emphasized

76
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,540
our gathering is for peace tonight.

77
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,750
I've come to Hong Kong
on behalf of the National Army

78
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,040
to seek peace.

79

Let's raise a toast to China and America

80

you are a scholarly military man.

I can see you truly have
an extraordinary bearing.

See you. Bye.

120
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,010
Leader, I heard from the on-duty driver

121
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,820
that Deputy Chief Wu's
car schedule for tomorrow

122
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,980
has been completely canceled.

123

The driver who took him tonight

124
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,780
was arranged by the Second Department.

125
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,430
He said after the banquet, Deputy Chief Wu

126
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,650
went straight back to the ship.

127
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,180
He didn't go anywhere else.

128
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,450
Just as I suspected.

129
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,310
The intelligence has probably
been sent out.

The ceremony for receiving military aid
is also completed.

131

There's no legitimate reason
to follow him anymore.

132

Take a look for me.

134

the same one?

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,940
I'll take it.

174
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
Please wrap it up. Thank you.

175
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,560
They're really trying hard.

176
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:13,840
Let's go.

177
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,010
Isn't this the paper
burned by Xie Zhonghao?

178
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,420
Didn't Section 4 say
it couldn't be restored?

179
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,650
This is the work of

180
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,130
the British MI6.

181
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,080
What? What Six?

182
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,220
MI6.

183
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,770
British Military Intelligence, Section 6.

184
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,550
When you told me about visiting Britain,

185
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,480
it was for this?

186
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,290
Deputy Chief Wu's

187
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,510
trip to Hong Kongâ€”

188
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,890
officially,

189
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,630
he completed his mission
and secured military aid;

190
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,640
privately,

191
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,770
he made contact with his accomplices

192
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,430
and delivered intelligence.

193
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,340
He certainly returned with quite a haul.

194
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,010
With this key,

195
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,040
we'll decipher Zhang Hao's messages
sooner or later.

196
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,220
Is Deputy Chief Wu really a Communist spy?

197
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,740
Could there be a mistake?

198
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,020
Deputy Chief Wu

199
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,340
is actually one of the most skilled

200
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,300
among those Communist spies.

201
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,500
Guiyang: Cloudy,

202
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,960
18 to 25 degrees.

203
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,480
Interrupting with a news bulletin.

204
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,990
Kinmen's Guningtou

205
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,990
came under a sudden landing assault
by Communist troops yesterday.

206
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,380
After fighting all night,
the Nationalist soldiers

207
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,270
are now striving to hold their ground.

208
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,930
Kinmen's defense

209
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,740
is now taken over by Commander Hu Lian.

210
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
Where did things go wrong?

211
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,210
Director Tang Enbo will
supervise the handover.

212
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,520
Sir.

213
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,200
[St. Paul's Hospital, Hong Kong]

214
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,580
Apart from slightly high blood pressure,

215
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,640
everything seems fine at the moment.

216
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,370
But

217
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,420
I recommend him to stay in the hospital
for 24 more hours for observation

218
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,520
just in case.

219
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,170
Okay. Thank you, sir.

220
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,640
The doctor says it's nothing serious,

221
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,650
but he recommends
24-hour observation in the hospital.

222
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,579
Director Zhang,

223
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,960
why don't you head back first?

224
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,310
I'll stay with him.

225
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,839
How could I possibly leave?

226
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,339
I'll immediately launch level 2 security

227
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,770
and seal off the entire floor.

228
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,609
I'll also assign three officers here

229
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,569
to keep the Deputy Chief

230
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,030
under watch 24 hours a day.

231
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,550
No need to make such a fuss.

232
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,790
The Deputy Chief has high blood pressure.

233
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,290
He needs proper rest

234
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,550
and some peace and quiet.

235
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,950
It's my duty.
I wouldn't dare be negligent.

236
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,020
It's not about being negligent.

237
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,800
I'm worried that reporters
might blow things out of proportion.

238
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,980
Sir.

239
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,690
Never mind.

240
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,290
With official duties at hand,

241
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,750
I really couldn't stay long
at the hospital.

242
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,190
You're really working hard work.

243
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,270
Bring aboard immediately

244
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,590
all the necessary medical equipment

245
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,850
missing from the ship.

246
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,880
Give me the case.
You don't need to see me off.

247
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,640
Go back now.

248
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,750
Manager Wan said

249
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,070
I must see you pass through customs
with my own eyes

250
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,810
before I can leave.

251
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,470
Let me carry your case for now.

252
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,310
Leader, it's fourth-class cabin!

253
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,230
When have we ever traveled
in fourth class?

254
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,030
Didn't Mr. Li tell us

255
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,270
he was so powerful?

256
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,500
Do you think
he's deliberately targeting us?

257
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,110
Excuse me, sir.

258
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,500
Sir.

259
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,330
Get her!

260
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,410
What are you doing?

261
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,830
Officer, wait a moment, please!

262
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,360
Officer.

263
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,940
Officer, I'm from the BIS.

264
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,870
I'm from the BIS.

265
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,550
What?

266
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,380
Look, my paper.

267
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,050
That womanâ€”

268
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,310
I suspect she's a Communist,

269
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,240
so I need to search her belongings.

270
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,940
This is Hong Kong.

271
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,920
I know. I know this is Hong Kong,

272
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,740
but I am sure

273
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,160
you know

274
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,250
what I'm talking about, right?

275
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,770
Okay. Okay.

276
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,290
She is a young lady. Be gentle.

277
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,750
Of course.

278
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,670
Take her!

279
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,340
Done.

280
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,280
Thank you for your help, Dr. Li.

281
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,510
I'll stay with him.

282
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,670
I'll wait outside.

283
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,610
Call me if you need anything.

284
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,870
Sir, please rest well.

285
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,740
Well, this is great.

286
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,860
We're completely trapped on this ship.

287
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,290
You can't get off.

288
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,990
And Manager Wan can't come aboard.

289
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,900
Sir.

290
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,450
Please don't worry too much.

291
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,440
Although we're not sure

292
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,580
if the PLA received our intelligence,

293
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,140
clearly, the attack has been moved up.

294
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,070
The battle has just begun,

295
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,820
so everything is still uncertain.

296
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,900
Even with the reinforcements
of Hu Lian's corps,

297
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,790
the PLA might still

298
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,290
have some chance of winning.

299
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,490
Amphibious assaults

300
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,050
are a brand-new challenge for the PLA.

301
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,870
In previous land battles,
the National Army would

302
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,360
just retreat when losing.

303
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,330
They routinely employed
a strategy of rapid disengagement,

304
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,200
which frequently led to
their swift collapse.

305
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
However, island warfare

306
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,220
is different.

307
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,190
The defending forces
have no room for retreat.

308
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,910
They can only fight to the death.

309
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:47,900
Sir.

310
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,250
There's no use in worrying now.

311
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,110
Even if you could get past
these agents from the Second Department

312
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,310
and meet Manager Wan,

313
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,030
what good solutions do we have

314
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,250
to help the PLA?

315
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,780
It's my fault.

316
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,640
The situation was urgent
and time was limited,

317
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,460
so I only gave Manager Wan

318
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,720
the intelligence
about Hu Lian's reinforcements.

319
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,700
I should have included

320
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,570
a battle strategy recommendation.

321
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,070
The PLA currently has no navy

322
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,530
or air force.

323
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,700
The enemy has an absolute advantage
in troop numbers, naval and air power,

324
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,300
and geographical position.

325
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,240
Therefore, the PLA

326
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,350
must not launch an attack recklessly.

327
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,630
Even in the current situation,

328
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,070
they should still wait for

329
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,120
the reinforcements to land gradually.

330
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,230
Perhapsâ€¦

331
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,160
Perhaps there might be
a chance of victory.

332
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,130
I want to see Manager Wan.

333
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,510
Alright, Sir.

334
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,430
Please take care of yourself.

335
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,370
Don't worry too much.

336
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,980
How about this?

337
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,630
After dark,

338
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,690
I'll find an excuse to go ashore

339
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,680
and see if there's a chance
to meet Manager Wan.

340
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,620
I'll go tell him.

341
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,320
Okay.

342
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,610
I'll write a letter to Manager Wan.

343
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,280
Help me up.

344
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,130
Apart from

345
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
the battle strategy,

346
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,920
I need to tell him some

347
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,410
other things in my letter.

348
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,820
When you see him,

349
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
you must ask him

350
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,180
to send a new courier here
as soon as possible.

351
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,460
At the opening ceremony of

352
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,140
the Taiwan Provincial Games,

353
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,590
Chairman Chen Cheng stated

354
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,510
that the tremendous changes in Taiwan

355
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,960
since its recovery 4 years ago
are inseparable

356
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,200
from the wise leadership
of our Father and the President.

357
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,990
That's why we must strengthen

358
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,220
our confidence in defending Taiwan
and retaking the mainland.

359
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,070
Now, we continue with updates
on the Kinmen battle.

360
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,530
Sir.

361
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,130
I couldn't make contact with him.

362
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,400
There were spies all around
the pharmacy entrance.

363
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,000
There was nothing I could do.

364
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,790
Report!

365
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,550
Deputy Chief Wu,

366
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,590
the Chief called.

367
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,850
The President is very satisfied
with the Kinmen battle situation

368
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,810
and is delighted.

369
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,470
To boost our
national and military prestige,

370
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,950
he has instructed us
to publicize it extensively.

371
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,340
Tomorrow, on the Taikang Warship,

372
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,070
a press conference will be held.

373
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,400
The Chief hopes you can make time
to attend and make a speech.

374
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,030
[Yongchun]

375
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,330
Wan.

376
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,020
Why are you back?

377
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,110
De Ying was discovered.

378
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,450
I saw her jump into the sea
with my own eyes.

379
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,860
I just found out too.

380
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,370
The authorities are
searching for her body.

381
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,770
But the Hong Kong pier
is a deep-water port.

382
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,770
Jumping from such a height...

383
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,120
I know she couldn't swim.

384
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Which part exactly went wrong?

385
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,390
There was a problem with her documents.

386
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,980
They caught it
when she was going through customs.

387
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,440
She was carrying contact information

388
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,040
of the Taiwan Work Committee

389
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,380
and the detailed home address

390
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,810
of the comrade impersonating her brother.

391
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,850
She jumped into the sea

392
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,380
to protect them.

393
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,940
How could there be a problem
with her documents?

394
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,590
Wasn't she supposed to use

395
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,580
my special pass?

396
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,880
De Ying couldn't possibly enter Taiwan

397
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,680
in your name,

398
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,540
much less stay
at your adopted daughter's home.

399
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,050
So, based on your document,

400
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,110
we made a new one for her.

401
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
However,

402
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,610
to ensure Taiwan's
so-called regularization,

403
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,120
Chen Cheng has used America's latest

404
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,850
anti-counterfeiting technology
on every pass.

405
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,110
That's something we never anticipated.

406
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,270
Wan.

407
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,600
Let me go instead of De Ying.

408
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,800
Your assignment from the Party

409
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,280
is to return to Shanghai
to build the New China.

410
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,380
Besides,

411
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,870
you haven't seen your husband or daughter

412
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,930
for several years.

413
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,660
I can't deprive you of the chance

414
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,260
to reunite with your family.

415
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,110
About sending someone to Taiwan,

416
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,940
I'll find another way.

417
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,420
But whoever goes now

418
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,580
can only use fake documents.

419
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,250
We can't let other comrades
take this risk again.

420
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,750
I understand how you feel.

421
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,910
But Taiwan right now

422
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,980
is under severe White Terror.

423
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,220
You have no experience
in underground intelligence work.

424
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,350
So, I can't send you to take such risks.

425
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,870
I know I'm not professional in this field,

426
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,720
but right now I'm the only one who has

427
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,580
a legal identity to enter Taiwan.

428
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,650
Please ask the Party
to seriously consider my request.

429
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,560
To be honest,

430
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,310
I didn't expect you would come back today.

431
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,770
And I'm grateful

432
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,160
you're stepping forward at this moment.

433
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,250
I'll report your request to my superiors.

434
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,180
However,

435
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,380
I must solemnly remind you:

436
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,250
Taiwan today

437
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,350
is unlike any other place.

438
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,860
The intensity of the struggle there

439
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,590
far exceeds your imagination.

440
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,680
Whether you can adapt after going there

441
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,770
or whether you'll regret it,

442
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,900
I cannot guarantee.

443
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,280
If something goes wrong,

444
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,870
you might not be able to escape unharmed.

445
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,830
You should understand

446
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,680
what that means.

447
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,160
So, during this time,

448
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,610
please think it through carefully.

449
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,170
I will consider it carefully.

450
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,910
At this critical moment
of the Kinmen battle,

451
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,590
I have been instructed by President Chiang

452
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,790
to hold this press conference

453
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,470
to inform the public about
the latest military situation

454
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,290
in Kinmen.

455
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,570
About 9,000 Communist troops,
3 regiments in total,

456
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,980
launched an attack on our Kinmen Island

457
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,380
at around 2 a.m. on the 25th.

458
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,580
Our defending forces

459
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,250
fought back valiantly.

460
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,880
Besides,

461
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,620
with approximately 60,000 men
in 22 regiments,

462
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,980
we hold an absolute advantage.

463
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,810
General Wu,

464
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,700
according to my information,

465
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,880
during the landing,

466
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,920
the Communist vessels

467
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,450
became stranded at low tide

468
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,290
due to being too close to the beach

469
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,050
and were all bombed by the National Army.

470
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,940
They currently have no ability
to organize reinforcements

471
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,720
and thus face complete annihilation.

472
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,020
I'd like to ask how much longer

473
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,380
the landed Communist forces can hold out?

474
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,410
That's difficult to determine.

475
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,310
It depends on the fighting spirit
of soldiers on both sides.

476
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,040
But I personally believe

477
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,090
our forces in Kinmen,

478
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,690
with overwhelming

479
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,260
land, sea, and air superiority,

480
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,950
are certain to win.

481
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,510
This concludes today's press conference.

482
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,250
All media representatives and journalists,

483
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,060
thank you!

484
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,480
General Wu!

485
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,790
About the current battlefield situation,

486
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,050
could you share some personal thoughts?

487
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,810
At this very moment,

488
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,530
on the Kinmen battlefield
hundreds of sea miles away,

489
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,640
our soldiers

490
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,950
are fighting bravely for the future

491
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,920
of our country and people.

492
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,690
My heart is filled with respect for them.

493
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,350
I know,

494
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,910
whether they live or die,

495
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,330
their struggle

496
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,090
is meaningful!

497
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,720
So, here,

498
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,770
as a soldier,

499
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,750
I salute them.

500
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,770
On October 24, 1949,

501
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,440
Unit One of the PLA's 10th Corps

502
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,840
was ordered to launch the Kinmen campaign.

503
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,530
The advance forces
of more than three regiments

504
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,990
landed on Kinmen beaches

505
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,670
and secured their positions.

506
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,650
Later, their landing vessels
were destroyed;

507
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,530
reinforcements couldn't reach them;

508
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,180
and the enemy reinforcements arrived.

509
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,880
The landing units clashed with vastly
superior enemy forces for days and nights

510
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,410
but were defeated when they
ran out of ammunition and supplies.

511
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,290
We don't have much time.

512
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,560
It seems Manager Wan

513
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,520
has strong infiltration capabilities
in Hong Kong.

514
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,320
Neither I nor Mr. Wu expected you
to board the ship.

515
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,630
This is thanks to Chiang's

516
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,170
being eager to boast about

517
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,610
his certain victory at Kinmen.

518
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,160
But

519
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,080
the information about
the reinforcements at Kinmen

520
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,540
was delivered, wasn't it?

521
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,540
Why did the PLA still launch the attack?

522
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,140
I didn't expect
the attack order to come early.

523
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,430
One hour before I sent the telegram,

524
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,560
the first batch, the 3 regiments,
had already departed.

525
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,610
Just 1 hour late.

526
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,770
Yes.

527
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,460
It's such a pity.

528
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,110
This is the letter from Mr. Wu to you.

529
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,410
Originally, he hoped you would pass on

530
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,920
the content of this letter as intelligence

531
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,990
to the Party.

532
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,700
Unfortunately, it seems

533
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,510
a bit too late right now.

534
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,240
I understand.

535
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,470
There's other content in the letter

536
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,330
that requires your cooperation.

537
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,170
All right.

538
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,700
Most importantly,

539
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,430
Mr. Wu hopes the Party can quickly send

540
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,560
a courier as experienced

541
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,850
as Comrade Zhang Hao.

542
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,300
It's urgent.

543
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,900
Please rest assured.

544
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,160
Your connection with the Party

545
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,420
will be restored soon.

546
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,250
That's great.

547
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,180
Please give this

548
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,200
to the new courier.

549
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,270
The situation in Taiwan is very tense now.

550
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,960
To be safe, the person's identity can only
be verified by this object.

551
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,440
Okay.

552
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,570
This is how to contact

553
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,830
the courier after arriving in Taiwan.

554
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,430
I'm leaving.

555
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,300
All right.

556
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,550
Also,

557
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,510
please tell the general

558
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,410
to take good care of himself.

559
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,460
Hope you'll all be safe in Taiwan.

560
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,870
Take care.

561
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,409
Honey.

562
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,130
Why are you waiting for me here?

563
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,409
I just like waiting for you here.

564
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,810
Where are the children?

565
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,770
It's too late. They've gone to sleep upstairs.

566
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,540
Don't move.

567
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,730
Let me sit here with you for a while.

568
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,360
You must be tired, right?

569
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,050
I'm okay.

570
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,219
How's your blood pressure?

571
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,010
It's been normal.

572
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,760
Thanks, Qian. Take care!

573
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,010
Good evening.

574
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,080
Good evening.

575
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,320
Mei.

576
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,840
I'm back.

577
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,070
Working overtime again?

578
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,260
Yes.

579
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,560
Wait a moment.

580
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,420
Look at this.

581
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,040
Isn't it pretty?

582
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,910
It's so expensive.

583
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,710
Things from Hong Kong are a bit pricey,

584
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,300
but

585
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,680
I think this dress
would look great on you.

586
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,410
Try it on.

587
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,590
I heard it on the radio.

588
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,170
Heard what?

589
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,540
The victory at Kinmen.

590
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,530
When do you plan to
counterattack the mainland?

591
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,680
Are you that eager for
the mainland recovery?

592
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,700
Does holding Kinmen mean
we can counterattack the mainland?

593
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,700
You actually believe what Chen Cheng says?

594
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,360
What I'm hoping for
isn't the mainland recovery.

595
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,820
are
still on the mainland.

596
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,750
When we left Fuzhou,

597
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,100
Shaocheng and Lanchengâ€”

598
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,780
we didn't even get to see them.

599
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,180
In these chaotic times,

600
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,940
I don't know how they're doing
on the mainland.

601
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,760
Give me your arm. I'll help you put it on.

602
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,400
I'm asking you a question!

603
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,440
When can we counterattack
and return to Fuzhou?

604
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,220
Are you that eager for

605
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,150
the mainland recovery to succeed?

606
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,920
The Nationalist Government has turned

607
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,800
the whole country into such a mess.

608
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,130
Haven't you seen it?

609
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,410
What's the point of going back?

610
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,570
To continue harming the people of Fuzhou?

611
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,150
Would you dare say such things
at Chieh Shou Hall?

612
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,170
I don't care at all

613
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,320
whether the counterattack would succeed.

614
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,460
I only care when

615
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,990
our children can be with us!

616
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,970
I don't think you even miss them.

617
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,060
I miss them very much.

618
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,900
Bikui.

619
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,590
Don't worry.

620
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,670
I'll definitely find a way

621
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,450
to make our family reunite
as soon as possible.

622
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:45,700
â™ª The moon was so beautiful,
and the sea was so quiet â™ª

623
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,640
You have to trust me.

624
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,980
I've always trusted you.

625
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:54,140
â™ª Mom was singing,
and Brother was catching a bug â™ª

626
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,290
I brought you a gift from Hong Kong.

627
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,510
I don't need gifts.

628
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,300
I don't need dresses.

629
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:02,010
â™ª That was my morning,
I was never fully awake â™ª

630
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,530
I just need you to
think about this family

631
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,190
and think about our children!

632
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:09,610
â™ª The sunset was beautiful,
and the river was clear â™ª

633
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,500
Is it waiting for you?

634
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,870
â™ª You were going over the mountains â™ª

635
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,700
Taipei isn't safe.

636
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,420
I'm afraid of the dark
when walking at night.

637
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,170
You should tell me that!

638
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,880
â™ª I was catching dragonflies â™ª

639
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,900
What good would telling you do?

640
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,380
You work night shifts
more often than I do.

641
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,570
â™ª That was my summer â™ª

642
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,480
When I was working nights,

643
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,660
were you ever at home?

644
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,070
â™ª That was my winter â™ª

645
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,580
â™ª Flagstones under my feet â™ª

646
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Sorry, Mai.

647
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,400
â™ª Stars above my head â™ª

648
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,340
It's my fault.

649
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,400
I'm sorry.

650
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,260
Let him go.

651
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,380
I'll drive you there.

652
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,650
â™ª There must still be
someone on the street â™ª

653
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,840
I don't want to break my appointment.

654
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:46,300
â™ª There must be lights
at the alley entrance â™ª

655
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:54,180
â™ª Don't be afraid if you get lost â™ª

656
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:03,550
â™ª We'll meet again â™ª

657
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:11,300
â™ª Don't be afraid if you get lost â™ª

658
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,380
The clock at home

659
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,710
chimes on time every day.

660
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,010
Why did you spend so much money

661
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,710
buying me a watch from Hong Kong?

662
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:19,550
â™ª We'll meet again â™ª

663
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,680
Don't worry about it.

664
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,950
Just tell me if you like it or not.

665
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,710
The style

666
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,670
is quite beautiful.

667
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:33,120
â™ª The sound of the waves
lulls me to sleep â™ª

668
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,640
Did you buy gifts for the children?

669
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,810
Everyone has it.

670
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:41,520
â™ª The river winds,
the moon is round and full â™ª

671
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,510
â™ª This is my home â™ª

672
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,990
â™ª This is my city â™ª

673
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,890
â™ª This is my home â™ª

674
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,390
â™ª This is my â™ª

675
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,550
â™ª My city â™ª

676
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,530
I specially sent a plane

677
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,370
and asked Li Yunshan to assist you.

678
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,920
And all you brought back is this junk?

679
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,000
What am I supposed to see here?

680
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,920
Deputy Chief Wu drinking with Americans?

681
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Director, Mr. Wu is a clever man.

682
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,790
His entire Hong Kong trip

683
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,510
was absolutely flawless,

684
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,770
but I didn't go to Hong Kong in vain.

685
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,670
Through my contacts at MI6,

686
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,760
I've managed to recover

687
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,420
the two sets of keys
obtained from Xie Zhonghao.

688
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,260
They've already been sent to Section 4.

689
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,530
Decoding the messages
sent by Zhang Hao's team

690
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,910
will happen very soon.

691
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,930
How long can we see
the decrypted messages?

692
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,440
We need to go through

693
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,050
all messages sent from Taiwan

694
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,030
in the past two and a half months.

695
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,760
The workload is indeed enormous.

696
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,670
Director Yang also said
he found it a bit difficult.

697
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,460
You believe that old fox?

698
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,530
Get me Director Yang at Section 4.

699
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,070
Assign some people to focus on the leads

700
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,940
Mr. Gu brought back from Hong Kong,

701
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,630
I want to see the results
as soon as possible.

702
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,730
Yes, that's an order.

703
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,440
Thank you for your support, Director.

704
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,190
Director.

705
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,970
Do you also suspect Deputy Chief Wu?

706
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,570
Suspicion

707
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,360
is an instinct in our line of work.

708
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,540
The Hong Kong trip
didn't go smoothly, did it?

709
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,890
I think you should pay attention
to things happened

710
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,750
at the Second Department
and the Hong Kong station.

711
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,210
It's not that we can't investigate
Deputy Chief Wu.

712
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,000
It's that his rank is too high

713
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,890
and he was personally appointed
by the President.

714
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,010
To investigate him,

715
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,950
you must be both bold and meticulous,

716
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,750
so as not to give others
ammunition against you.

717
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,990
Yes, I will follow your example, Director.

718
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,470
I'll strive toâ€¦

719
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,670
Alright, alright, stop flattering me.

720
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,370
I only ask one thing of you:

721
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,630
don't cause me trouble.

722
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,610
I'll just butter you up.

723
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,070
Get out of here.

724
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,420
Director, I'm off to investigate the case.
