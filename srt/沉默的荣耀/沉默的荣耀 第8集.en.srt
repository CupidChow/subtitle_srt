00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,900
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,950
Sir.

4
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,410
If you feel uncomfortable about this,

5
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,430
we don't have to go.

6
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,229
Nonsense.

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,120
If I wanted to feel good,

8
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,400
I would have stayed
in Fuzhou and joined the uprising

9
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,060
rather than coming to Taiwan.

10
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,259
I must first

11
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,480
know the situation
in the Southwest regions inside out,

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,540
so I can understand
what Mr. Chiang and the Japanese

13
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,200
are planning strategically
for the Southwest.

14
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,130
Where's my Yunnan map?

15
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,990
It's here.

16
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,440
Since Mr. Chiang
personally handed me the knife,

17
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,180
I must help Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping

18
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,310
take the Southwest.

19
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll make sure
the White Group is completely useless

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
and Gu Zhutong's forces will collapse.

21
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,420
I want Mr. Chiang to know

22
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,430
that using
Japanese war criminals as advisors

23
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,490
is utterly shameful and ridiculous.

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,290
Please get some rest, Sir.

25
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,620
Honey, why are you sitting here?

26
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,270
Did you stay up all night?

27
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,070
I did sleep.

28
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,770
I slept sitting on the floor for a while.

29
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,430
I'm sorry, Honey.

30
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,430
Was there some urgent military business?

31
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,910
Not really.

32
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,140
Then why in the middle of the night

33
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,540
did you rush to the office to work?

34
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,000
I suddenly remembered something important

35
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,220
that needed to be done quickly.

36
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,840
Couldn't you have told me?

37
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,130
Weren't you sleeping with the children?

38
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,730
You could have left me a note.

39
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,510
Your handwriting is so beautiful.

40
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,649
I'm sorry, Honey.

41
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,470
I didn't think it through.

42
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,930
You just agreed to my conditions,

43
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,910
but which one have you actually followed?

44
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,270
You said you'd come home on time.

45
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,780
Yes.

46
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,660
I did promise to come home
on time every night,

47
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,380
but I never said
I couldn't go to work early.

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,510
Fine.

49
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,850
Then I'll add one more condition.

50
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,320
Every morning before 6 o'clock,

51
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,460
you're not allowed to go to work.

52
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,260
Honey, that's 6 conditions now.

53
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,560
Do you agree, Wu Yuxun?

54
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,570
Alright,

55
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,790
I agree.

56
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,300
Come on now.

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,220
Don't sit here anymore.

58
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
The floor is cold.

59
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,120
Leave me alone.

60
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,240
Fine.

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
I'll sit with you for a while.

62
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,600
Chief.

63
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,740
What is it?

64
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,900
I heard from a colleague
on night duty yesterday

65
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,860
that Deputy Chief Wu was dealing
with the Southwest issue

66
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,690
and worked all night
in his office without sleep.

67
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,000
The President's birthday is approaching.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,860
Senior should prepare in advance

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
and present the Southwest
outline of the operational plan

70
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,100
on behalf of the Ministry of Defense.

71
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,010
This is an honor
for our entire Ministry of Defense.

72
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:56,540
Yes.

73
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,970
However,

74
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,160
Deputy Chief Wu has always
deeply hated the Japanese,

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,330
yet he changed his mind overnight.

76
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,400
It's truly puzzling.

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,520
Of course,

78
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,950
the Deputy Chief always
prioritizes the bigger picture.

79
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,040
Perhaps I'm being narrow-minded.

80
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,420
But Deputy Chief Wu now has access to

81
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,930
the party's most crucial
strategic information.

82
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,260
If anything goes wrong,

83
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm concerned you might be implicated.

84
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,950
Good morning, Adjutant Nie.

85
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,480
Morning.

86
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,300
You got off work?

87
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,610
Where have you been?

88
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Did you go to
pick me up after my night shift?

89
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,180
No.

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,130
Had some work at the Ministry of Defense.

91
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,040
Just finished.

92
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,940
I just saw that American officer again.

93
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,500
Yes.

94
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,220
He dropped me off for my night shift

95
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,200
and came back to pick me up after work.

96
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,460
He stayed up all night.

97
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,870
Mei.

98
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,430
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,000
Sorry for what?

100
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,750
I just feel that you've

101
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,140
been carrying too much.

102
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,890
Maybe you should quit this job.

103
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,250
Enough. Don't say anything more.

104
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,270
This isn't what I want to hear.

105
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,740
Stop talking.

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,940
I'm tired.

107
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,210
I want to move somewhere else.

108
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,940
Where do you want to move to?

109
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,820
Somewhere closer to work.

110
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,190
Mei.

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,320
I work at the Ministry of Defense.

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,510
This is the Ministry of Defense dormitory.

113
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,500
It's not easy to change accommodations.

114
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,980
I meant I'm the one moving.

115
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,230
I'm moving.

116
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,860
The training

117
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,940
has been completed today.

118
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,600
[Yongchuntang in Hong Kong]

119
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,750
Wan.

120
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,320
After these two days of training,

121
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,250
I actually feel less confident.

122
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,580
Do you think I'm up to it?

123
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,940
Time is tight and the mission is urgent.

124
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,200
In just these few days,

125
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,530
you've done very well.

126
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,340
Really?

127
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,050
If you feel it's too difficult,

128
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,950
you can still choose
to return to Shanghai.

129
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,980
I'll find another way
to handle the courier matter.

130
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,680
I don't think you have a better way.

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
It's more suitable for me

132
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,200
to go to Taiwan.

133
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,000
This is the token

134
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,010
for your rendezvous
after arriving in Taiwan.

135
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,390
Keep it safe.

136
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,720
I wish you a swift and successful return.

137
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,460
Don't worry.

138
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,720
With the East Sea Team in Taiwan

139
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,850
and you in Hong Kong,

140
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,600
I'll be safe.

141
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,480
A man should stride boldly through life.

142
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,460
Can a woman not also be as mighty
as a whale crossing the sea?

143
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,200
This is a poem Comrade Wenhan

144
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,410
gave to my old classmate Chen Xiuliang.

145
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,040
Ms. Zhu, you now

146
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,330
are equally worthy of these words.

147
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,960
Wan, you flatter me.

148
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,810
The new courier hadn't arrived yet.

149
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,620
Wu Shi understood

150
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,910
that even if he used his position
as a translator for the White Group

151
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,670
to obtain intelligence
about the Southwest operations,

152
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,580
he couldn't send it out in time.

153
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,620
So he decided

154
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,000
to exploit Chiang Kai-shek's
unwillingness to admit defeat,

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,510
as Chiang still wanted to keep

156
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,460
both Chengdu and Chongqing.

157
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,790
By drafting in advance

158
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,320
a plan that combines defense and offense,

159
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,630
he wanted Chiang to

160
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,100
accept it gladly,

161
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,530
so that the PLA

162
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,860
could break through
the Nationalist defenses step by step.

163
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,500
What's wrong with your Second Department?

164
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,840
You can't even prepare
a weekly report properly.

165
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
How could you write this report like this?

167
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,890
How are the superiors
supposed to read this?

168
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,290
I understand. I'm sorry.

169
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,740
Take it back and redo it.

170
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,300
Yes, sir.

171
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,550
What's wrong?

172
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,100
The Second Department staff

173
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,050
made a complete mess
of their weekly report.

174
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,100
I just made a few comments about it.

175
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,830
Are you okay?

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,570
I'm fine.

177
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,040
I just get so angry

178
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,100
when I see people
from the Second Department.

179
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,210
They caused us
so much trouble in Hong Kong.

180
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,170
How long has it been
since we returned from Hong Kong?

181
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,230
Three or four days.

182
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,630
Then it's about time.

183
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,130
Go buy a copy of Sing Tao Daily.

184
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,270

[BIS Agents Showed Up
Uninvited at Peninsula Hotel]

186
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,690
Senior, you were in Hong Kong
helping with frontline issues.

187
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,310
Yet these petty officials from BIS

188
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,330
were monitoring and following you.

189
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,180
As both Chief and your junior,

190
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,100
I had no idea about this.

191
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,220
Senior.

192
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,330
I'm truly ashamed.

193
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,340
Chief.

194
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,520
I can't do it anymore.

195
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,190
What can't you do anymore, Senior?

196
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,900
Translating for the President

197

199

200
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,900
No.

You can't quit, Senior.

202
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,390
The Southwest defense plan is crucial.

203
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,770
It involves too many factors.

204
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,130
The President values it highly.

205
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I need to access various materials.

206
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,720
I'm afraid

207
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,960
if something goes wrong,

208
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,250
I would be targeted by the BIS again.

209
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,080
They'll use it as an excuse

210
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,750
to link me with Communist spies.

211
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,420
The real danger
is when things keep recurring.

212
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,310
At that time, even if I'm full of words,

213

I won't be able to explain.

214
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,370
Senior.

215
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,830
I know.

216
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,890
You're naturally modest.

217
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,840
If you've been wronged

218
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,320
or upset about something,

219
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,540
you keep it all bottled up inside.

220
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,100
But you really mustn't quit.

221
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,060
You must help me.

222
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,840
Do you know

223
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,100
why the President
asked you to be the translator?

224
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,460
What he really wants

225
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,050
is for you to provide him

226
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,510
with the outline of the operational plan
for the Southwest Campaign afterwards.

227
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,480
This is a matter

228
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,890
that no one else
in our Ministry of Defense

229
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,170
can handle but you.

230
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,080
The President's birthday is coming soon.

231
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,150
This would be the best birthday gift

232
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,480
that the Ministry of Defense could offer.

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,870
Senior.

234
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,000
You can't quit.

235
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,980
Don't worry, Senior.

236
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,840

237

just come to me directly.

This way...

240
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,390
Yes, Chief.

241
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,220
You are the Chief.

242
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
I am your deputy.

243
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,370
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

244
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,840
No, no, Senior.

245
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,550
That's not what I meant.

246
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,750
Don't worry, Senior.

247
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,530
I'll get revenge for you.

248
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,910
I'll make sure Mao Qiwu severely

249
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,310
punishes that Gu fellow,

250
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,470
so I can give you a proper explanation.

251
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,580
That should be acceptable, right?

252
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,460
Fine.

253
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,260
Chief, since you're so considerate,

254
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,790
I will quickly prepare

255
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,610
the outline of the operational plan
for the Southwest Campaign.

256
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,220
Thank you for your effort, Senior.

257
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,280
I'll take my leave.

258
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Connect me to Mao Renfeng at the BIS.

259
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,110

260

You arranged this in Hong Kong already?

261
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,560
Why didn't you tell me?

262
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,530
That's so satisfying.

263
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,270
Gu Zhengwen is in big trouble now.

264
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,080
We've finally dealt with

265
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,340
a major threat.

266
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,130
We can't be that optimistic yet.

267
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,510
Gu Zhengwen took a silent loss this time.

268
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,250
He might seek revenge furiously afterward.

269
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,810
Though Gu Zhengwen is just a colonel,

270
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,010
he has Chiang Ching-kuo backing him up.

271
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,500
Chiang Ching-kuo and Mr. Chiang

272
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,440
are our real opponents.

Gu Zhengwen.

00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,670
What trouble did you stir up in Hong Kong?

275
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,110
Look. See how the Hong Kong press

276
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,120
[Is it the Nationalist Government's
wariness of the U.S.,]

another dark secret behind it?]

280

281

enough problems already?

283

If Deputy Chief Wu
resorted to such a roundabout method,

284
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,700
that actually suggests

285
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,100
my suspicions are probably correct.

what else did you bring back?

290
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,290
Any findings? Any evidence?

295
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,869
and jumped overboard
to kill herself when discovered.

296
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,900
I believe

297
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,310
she must be

to replace Zhang Hao.

299

Can you find evidence

301
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,920

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,610
Doesn't he?

341
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,680
He's always out eating and drinking

342
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920
and never takes care of me.

343
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Where's the baby?

344
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,590
We wanted to bring the baby

345
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,660
to pick you up.

346
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,160
But the baby is too young,

347
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,850
and we were worried about it
catching cold outside.

348
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,250
So we asked our neighbor
to look after it.

349
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,760
Now that Mom is here, I can help you

350
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,360
take care of the baby, right?

351
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,610
I've been wanting to write to you,

352
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,920
but I was afraid you'd be
too busy with work in Hong Kong.

353
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,680
I hope your visit
hasn't disrupted your work in Hong Kong.

354
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,560
My company transferred me
back to Shanghai.

355
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,650
I happen to have some time off,

356
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,000
so I wanted to come see you all.

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,880
That's wonderful!

358
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,370
Make way! Move aside!

359
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,250
Mom, let's move to the side.

360
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:01,960
Let me go!

361
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,290
Get moving!

362
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,350
Why are you arresting me?

363
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,850
Move!

364
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,790
Get out of the way!

365
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,500
Let me go!

366
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:05,900
Move!

367
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Make way up front!

368
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,960
Mom, I'm sure you've heard

369
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,010
how tense the situation
in Taiwan is right now.

370
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,880
Try to stay home as much as possible,

371
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
and always carry your ID when you go out.

372
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,290
Alright.

373
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,590
The prisons in Taiwan
are already overcrowded.

374
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,590
Mom, let's get in the car quickly.

375
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,090
Okay.

376
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,520
You can't catch me.

377
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,750
Young Master.

378
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,980
Yuxun.

379
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,710
How do I look in this outfit?

380
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,600
Beautiful.

381
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,280
Don't just say that.

382
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,030
Does it really look good?

383
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,590
You look good in anything.

384
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,310
If you go to the Dou's Mansion like this,

385
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,170
you'll outshine everyone there.

386
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,790
But I don't really want to go.

387
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,420
You don't want to go,

388
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,420
yet you're dressed so beautifully?

389
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,240
It's all because of you.

390
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,960
Ever since you got
promoted to Deputy Chief,

391
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,800
those Army officers' wives

392
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,790
are all flocking to me

393
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,830
like fish swimming upstream.

394
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,240
Some come to build connections.

395
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,170
Some come to fish for information.

396
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,920
You know what I'm like.

397
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,640
I get such a headache

398
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,830
from these complicated
social relationships.

399
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,290
I just can't handle it all.

400
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,440
Chief Zhou Zhirou's wife
loves playing mahjong.

401
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,940
Those Directors' wives

402
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,740
are always hovering around her.

403
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,360
It wouldn't be appropriate if I didn't go.

404
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,740
She is your superior's wife after all.

405
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,210
I'm afraid Zhou might hold it against you.

406
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,780
Mom, we're home.

407
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,430
So this is it.

408
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,770
Finally home.

409
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,530
Mom, take it slow.

410
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,240
Ju,

411
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
you're finally back.

412
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,980
The baby must be hungry.

413
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,640
Been crying all afternoon.

414
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,740
Thank you, Mei. Sorry for the trouble.

415
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
Don't mention it. We're neighbors.

416
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,780
All right.

417
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,060
This is...

418
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,330
This is my mom.

419
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,850
Hello, ma'am.

420
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:25,550
Hello.

421
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,960
I heard you're also from Shanghai.

422
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,720
Yes, that's right.

423
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,620
Me too.

424
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,900
You're from Shanghai?

425
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,720
Yes.

426
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,650
I have a small gift for you.

427
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,230
This is the latest rouge from Hong Kong.

428
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,410
Hope you like it.

429
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,720
Oh no, I can't take it.

430
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,570
This is too much.

431
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,430
Don't mention it. Please take it.

432
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,740
Then I'll accept it.

433
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,620
Take it.

434
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,420
Thank you.

435
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,660
Thanks.

436
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,890
Come here, Bao.
Let grandma hold you.

437
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,690
Go to grandma.

438
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,720
What's wrong? Are you upset?

439
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,550
You're upset.

440
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,480
Alright. What's the matter?

441
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,200
We're home, aren't we?

442
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,920
Where have we been?

443
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,770
Mei's husband

444
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,630
is Changcheng's colleague
at the Telecommunications Office.

445
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,420
We came to Taiwan around the same time,

446
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,480
and were assigned housing
next to each other.

447
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,920
They're a nice couple.

448
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,250
They've helped us a lot.

449
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,920
Bao is so well-behaved.

450
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,910
How can a baby be so well-behaved?

451
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
Let's sit for a while.

452
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,300
So well-behaved.

453
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:30,990
Yes.

454
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,840
Look.

455
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,770
I've noticed

456
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,060
that when the baby is with you,

457
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,950
it hasn't fussed at all
from downstairs up until now.

458
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,710
You two must have a special connection.

459
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,780
Of course your child
and I have a connection,

460
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,670
don't we?

461
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,880
Oh no, I forgot to buy the formula.

462
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,900
Didn't I specifically ask you yesterday

463
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,230
to buy it on your way home from work?

464
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,700
How could you forget the baby's food?

465
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,280
Yes, I...

466
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,230
I was only thinking
about the eggs you asked for.

467
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,730
I bought the eggs but forgot the formula.

468
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,490
I'll go buy it now.

469
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,620
No, no, Changcheng, Changcheng.

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,320
Wait, wait.

471
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,230
Here, Ju.

472
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,320
What a coincidence.

473
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,970
I just happened to bring you

474
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,380
two cans of formula from Hong Kong.

475
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,320
Hold it tight. I'll go get them.

476
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,580
I never expected

477
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,150
they'd come in handy so soon.

478
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:09,610
This...

479
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,920
Here, Changcheng.

480
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,100
Mom, you're really saving us.

481
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,660
I'll go boil some water.

482
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,800
I must have been out of my mind

483
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,900
to think he was talented and capable,

484
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,360
and to fall in love with him.

485
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
He was fine back on the mainland.

486
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,200
But since coming to Taiwan,

487
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,560
after two of his colleagues
were implicated through relatives

488
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,670
tied to the communists,

489
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,580
he's been more and more absent-minded,

490
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,280
distracted all day.

491
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,160
When I ask him to do something,

492
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,360
he can only remember one thing at a time,

493
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,380
like some kind of fool.

494
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Ju.

495
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,060
A couple should love
and care for each other.

496
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,160
Talk things through properly.

497
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,340
Don't get upset.

498
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,230
I've tried talking to him properly,

499
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,960
but he can't remember a single thing.

500
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
Next time he forgets,

501
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,800
write everything down on paper

502
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,870
and stick it on his forehead,

503
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,400
see if he can remember then.

504
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,200
Ju, come here.

505
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,810
Mom has a gift for you.

506
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,520
Ju.

507
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,970
Look.

508
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,130
What a beautiful necklace.

509
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,660
You were getting married during the war.

510
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,970
I couldn't attend your wedding then.

511
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,300
Now I'm making it up to you.

512
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,160
Come, let me put it on you.

513
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,890
I spent a long time
choosing this necklace.

514
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,630
I think this style suits you perfectly.

515
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,620
My daughter looks so special wearing it.

516
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,570
Beautiful and elegant.

517
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,120
I'm already a mother now.

518
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,990
Why care about looks anymore?

519
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,190
Being a mother is hard work.

520
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,010
That's why you need
to love yourself even more.

521
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,410
This is

522
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,990
what I got for the baby,

523
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,710
a longevity lock.

524
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
What do you think?

525
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,200
Is it pretty?

526
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,430
It's beautiful.

527
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,770
Come, let's put it on Bao.

528
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,930
Isn't it just perfect, Bao?

529
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,890
Do you like it?

530
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
Does it look nice?

531
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,740
It's pretty.

532
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,130
It's beautiful.

533
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,150
Ju, what's wrong?

534
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,720
It's nice to have a mother.

535
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,040
Mom.

536
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
I brought a gift for Changcheng too.

537
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,480
Changcheng.

538
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,620
Mom.

539
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,020
I picked out a tie for you.

540
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,510
I think this color

541
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,690
goes well with your clothes.

542
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,090
See if you like it.

543
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,940
I like it.

544
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,390
Mom, you really
shouldn't have spent so much.

545
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,150
Not at all.

546
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,310
Mrs. Wu.

547
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,500
You're finally here.

548
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,130
They've all been waiting anxiously.

549
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,410
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dou.

550
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,570
I had to take care of my children first.

551
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,600
Look.

552
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,800
We needed a fourth player
and were waiting for you.

553
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,840
Qing, prepare some tea.

554
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,520
Right away.

555
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,080
Seven of Bamboo.

556
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,370
Mrs. Wu, you must treat us to a meal.

557
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,490
Five of Dots.

558
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,450
Why would I treat everyone for no reason?

559
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm the loser today.

560
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,570
Look at her, still pretending not to know.

561
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,820
Don't worry. We won't make you spend much.

562
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,810
Just all of us
having a good time together,

563
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,070
and celebrating a bit.

564
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,960
Wait, what is there to celebrate?

565
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,920
Celebrate what?

566
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,680
Didn't your Deputy Chief Wu tell you?

567
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,440
He rarely tells me

568
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,790
about his work matters.

569
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,780
At yesterday's military meeting
at the Ministry of Defense,

570
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,750
the President publicly
praised Deputy Chief Wu.

571
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,480
Said he relieved
the burden of the party

572
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,310
and did an excellent job
translating for the White Group.

573
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,900
So,

574
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,340
Chief Gu personally
hosted a dinner last night.

575
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,690
Ostensibly a farewell dinner,

576
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,350
but actually to commend Deputy Chief Wu.

577
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,910
No wonder
he came home so drunk last night.

578
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,380
Wait, what does White Group mean?

579
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,720
It's the Japanese Military Advisory Group.

580
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,260
The group's Japanese leader

581
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,670
adopted a Chinese name,

582
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,010
Bai Hongliang. "Bai" means "white."

583
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,210
So everyone calls them the White Group.

584
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,680
Yuxun.

585
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,180
Why are you working
as a translator for the Japanese?

586
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,960
If Mrs. Zhou hadn't told me today,

587
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,830
were you planning to keep this from me?

588
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,070
Bikui, I'm sorry.

589
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,700
I have work that must be done.

590
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,770
I'm going to take a nap.

591
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,780
Perhaps in my dreams,

592
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,720
I can still see Jingcheng.

593
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,440
After you arrive in Taipei,

594
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,310
the superiors will use the radio

595
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,710
to send contact instructions
to the Taiwan Work Committee.

596
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,300
For 3 consecutive nights,
from 11 p.m. to midnight,

597
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,930
the signal will be embedded

598
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,360
in the advertisement for Yushan Tea House.

599
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,700
Afterward, if you see Chen Li's notice

600
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,850
looking for his brother
in the People's Daily,

601
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,790
you can go to
the Taiwan Work Committee's contact point

602
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,250
and rendezvous with them.

603
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,180
Classic street-roasted treats.

604
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,050
Rustic local flavors.

605
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,100
Tradition of mastery continues.

606
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,170
Classic street-roasted treats.

607
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,250
Rustic local flavors.

608
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,320
Tradition of mastery continues.

609
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,730
Today's newspaper.

610
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,050
Take a look at today's newspaper.

611
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,520
I'd like this daily newspaper.

612
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,890
Mom.

613
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,580
Changcheng.

614
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,650
Where's Mom?

615
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,580
Isn't Mom in her room?

616
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,980
She's not in her room.

617
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,420
Not there?

618
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,560
Go look for her quickly.

619
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,070
Make sure she hasn't wandered off.

620
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,800
I'll go look.

621
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:50,840
Mom.

622
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,760
Mom.

623
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,190
I went to buy a newspaper.

624
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,860
And got some breakfast.

625
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,130
Steamed buns and fried dough sticks.

626
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,660
That's so much trouble for you,

627
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
going out so early to buy breakfast.

628
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,320
You're always spending money on us.

629
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,280
Not at all.

630
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,050
Fried dough sticks barely cost anything.

631
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,280
Go ahead and eat.

632
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,159
It's fine. We'll wait for you, Mom.

633
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,840
Coming.

634
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,389
Changcheng.

635
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,280
This tie looks nice.

636
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,060
Yes, it suits me perfectly.

637
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,020
It looks good on you.

638
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,350
Yes.

639
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,469
Thank you for the gift, Mom.

640
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,620
By the way, Mom.

641
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,020
Were you listening
to the radio last night?

642
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,130
I was probably too excited yesterday.

643
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,850
So I couldn't sleep well at night.

644
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,860
I just wanted to listen

645
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,170
to something nice.

646
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,670
I didn't disturb you, did I?

647
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,460
No, not at all.

648
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,190
That's good.

649
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,239
Changcheng.

650
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,239
Ju.

651
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,159
I don't love
salted duck eggs as much as you do.

652
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,230
I remember you used to
eat salted duck eggs with porridge

653
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,850
and could finish two bowls, right?

654
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,510
Really?

655
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,550
Ju, eat up.

656
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,200
Mom, my taste
has become milder since I had the baby.

657
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,030
You have it.

658
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,470
Here.

659
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,940
Ju, have this.

660
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,890
Mom's is here.

661
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Ju, Changcheng.

662
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,310
I want to discuss something with you.

663
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,340
I think starting from today,

664
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,920
let me

665
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,830
take care of the food expenses.

666
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,730
Is that okay?

667
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:25,880
After all,

668
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,980
I came here to support you.

669
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,690
Right?

670
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,170
You need to raise a baby.

671
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,700
And your expenses are high.

672
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,760
Please don't.

673
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,230
We don't have much to offer you.

674
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,070
We already feel embarrassed.

675
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,560
How could we spend your money?

676
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,660
Yes, you came from so far away to help us.

677
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,230
And you're always
worrying about our livelihood.

678
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,030
This really isn't appropriate.

679
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,450
At my trading company in Hong Kong,

680
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,390
I'm the financial director.

681
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,460
My income is quite substantial.

682
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,300
Besides, if I don't

683
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,180
spend this money on you, who else?

684
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,420
Should I just let it
gather dust in the suitcase?

685
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,430
I can't just stay
and eat at your place for free.

686
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,230
Right?

687
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,110
Mom.

688
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,800
That will make
Changcheng and me feel embarrassed.

689
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,060
Ju.

690
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,150
You're family but talking like strangers.

691
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,230
If you keep being so formal,

692
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,510
I'm going to be upset.

693
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,730
Okay, I won't be so formal with you, Mom.

694
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,740
Thank you, Mom.

695
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,320
Good. That's better.

696
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,050
Let's eat now.

697
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,660
Mom hasn't started eating yet.

698
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,730
I was going to give this to Mom.

699
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,300
Here, Mom.

700
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,700
I already have some.
Well, okay. Thank you.

701
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,910
Mom, now that you're here,

702
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,860
you should stay for a while, right?

703
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,360
I'm worried Mom might leave soon.

704
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,220
That's why I'm trying
to put Mom's mind at ease.

705
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,930
You...

706
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,700
I'll stay as long as you want me to.

707
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,750
I came here to help you anyway.

708
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,670
Mom, of course I hope you can stay longer.

709
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,050
Yes, I hope so too.

710
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,690
We were just talking about it.

711
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,850
Since Mom arrived,

712
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,810
Ju's condition has improved a lot.

713
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,920
If you welcome me,

714
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,720
I'll stay a bit longer.

715
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,280
[Telecommunications Office,
Taiwan Provincial Police Department]

716
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,070
Director.

717
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,910
Busy?

718
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,600
Director.

719
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,550
Morning.

720
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,310
Leader.

721
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,510
Come in.

722
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,750
The car is ready.

723
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,440
Good.

724
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,360
By the way,

725
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,400
have someone
take this suitcase downstairs.

726
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,430
Leader, are you really
going to the Taichung mountains?

727
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,830
What's wrong?

728
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,420
Chongqing and Guiyang
may be closer to the Communist Army,

729
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
but at least they're cities.

730
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,190
Up in the Taichung mountains,
it's such a godforsaken place

731
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,890
that only the birds
bother to take a dump there.

732
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,550
What's worth going there for?

733
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,840
Isn't Liu Kangfu
from the Taiwan Work Committee?

734
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,660
I believe Deputy Chief Wu's upcoming work

735
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,340
will definitely involve
the Taiwan Work Committee.

736
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,030
Getting to know
their grassroots operations

737
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,850
can't hurt, right?

738
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,810
At a time like this,

739
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,940
you're still thinking about the case?

740
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,020
You don't understand.

741
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,060
Leader.

742
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,650
Please.

743
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,730
Mr. Gu,

744
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,980
why haven't you left yet?

745
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,400
What a situation this is.

746
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,830
The Director asked me to temporarily

747
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,290
take over the Counterintelligence Section.

748
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,090
I deliberately timed my arrival

749
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,030
to avoid making you uncomfortable,

750
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,130
but I still came too early...

751
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:23,840
Mr. Ye.

752
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,390
That's not how
we drive in Counterintelligence Section.

753
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,790
How should I drive then?

754
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,660
Watch your tone.

755
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,060
Are you alright?

756
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,650
I'm fine.

757
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,390
It's good I came early.

758
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,450
I'll see you off.

759
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,420
No need.

760
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,130
That's thoughtful of you. Thanks.

761
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,900
Uh...

762
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,800
Mr. Ye, I'd like to ask you a favor.

763
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:49,530
You see,

764
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,840
these men

765
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,130
all came from the Operations Division,

766
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,220
and you know them all.

767
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,080
They'll be working under you now,

768
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,730
so please

769
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,800
take good care of them.

770
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,180
No need to be so formal.

771
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,190
We're brothers.

772
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,790
Yes, yes.

773
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,880
We all used to be in the same division.

774
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,170
I am a man of principles.

775
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,870
I'll never play favorites.

776
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,650
Yes, yes.

777
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,310
Pickled beans with rice will be plentiful,

778
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,480
but as for bonuses,

779
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,860
that depends on their own luck.

780
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,950
Yes, yes.

781
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,380
Did you all hear that?

782
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,190
Work hard under Mr. Ye,

783
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,510
and you'll definitely be treated well.

784
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,070
Alright.

785
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,300
Get in the car quickly.

786
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,900
Get in the car.

787
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,360
Director.

788
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,860
We can't find the file
of Zhang Hao's case.

789
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,010
It's not in the archives room
or the file cabinets.

790
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,970
That's right.

791
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,650
It's best if he takes

792
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,870
this hot potato with him.

793
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,690
Nie Xi, I've moved out.

794
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,730
Your lies about our child

795
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,770
are something I can't forgive.

796
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,430
Perhaps I can sleep better somewhere else.

797
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,970
I've left you

798
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,920
a photo of our child.

799
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,860
I hope when you see her face,

800
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,970
you'll miss her as much as I do.

801
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,020
Mei.
