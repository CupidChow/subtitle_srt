In April 1949,

4
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,640
after the victory
of the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign,

5
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,200
the Third Field Army was ordered
to march south

6
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,120
to advance on Fuzhou, Xiamen
and other strategic locations.

surrounding Fuzhou from three directions,

10

But you still can't write it?

23
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,890
The character for "home"
is too difficult to write.

to be like that.

make new adjustments
to their military deployment.

to the East China Bureau

Sir, I can't get in touch
with Courier Wang.

169

According to the rules,
we all have one-on-one contact.

170

I can't rashly

171
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,530
approach other comrades
at the communication station.

172
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,060
Then go to the East China Bureau
immediately.

as soon as possible.

Sir,

178

if you go to the 318th Division yourself,

179
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,820
won't that be too dangerous?

180
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,700
Thanks for taking this run.

181
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,290

Please report this to the President,
Comrade Jianfeng.

185

When will the former members of the BIS

be officially reinstated?

However, regarding Wu Shi,

the President has repeatedly emphasized

the need to strengthen
Fuzhou's permanent defenses.

213

But the Fuzhou Pacification Office
has shown no progress.

Our agents there report

215
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,760
that Deputy Director Wu
once advised Director Zhu.

216
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,360
He said that even Shanghai
with its Stalingrad-style fortifications

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,070
couldn't hold out for two weeks,

with the sea to its southeast
and mountains to its north.

Sir, if you go yourself,

221
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,640
won't you be too conspicuous?

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,100
The BIS's informants
are everywhere now.

223

If your identity is exposed,

224
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,320
the consequences would be unimaginable.

225
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,740
We should think this through

226
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,220
and find a safer approach.

227
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,740
If something happens to you,

how will I explain to the Party
and your wife?

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,280
There's no time.
If the uprising succeeds one day earlier,

230
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,240
Fuzhou can be returned to the people
one day sooner.

231

send Secretary Gong to pick him up

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,620
left a deep impression on me.

335
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,750
At this critical moment
for saving our nation,

336
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,280
I hope you will devote all your wisdom

337
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,840
to defend our principles.

338
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,950
You are hereby appointed as Deputy Chief
of the Ministry of Defense.

339
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,430
From Zhongzheng.

340
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,980
At 14:00."

341
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,970
The President thinks highly of you.

342
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,920
Do you know

343
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,810
why the President chose you?

344
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,090
It's just because I know
a thing or two about military affairs.

345
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,440
More importantly, you don't belong
to any clique.

346
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,110
Look.

347
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,200
Although you and Bai Chongxi
were classmates,

348
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,550
many in the military believe

349
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,640
you're part of the New Guangxi Clique.

350
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,660
But Bai Chongxi has already

351
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,720
stepped down as Minister of Defense.

352
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,550
Acting President Li Zongren

353
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
has power in name only.

354
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,020
The Guangxi Clique
is no longer a concern.

355
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,040
It's the best time for the President
to appoint

356
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,730
a talent like you now.

357
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,500
Director, it's all thanks to you

358
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,160
putting in a good word
for me with the President.

359
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,000
It has nothing to do with me.

360
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,760
Not at all.

361
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,680
Sit down.

362
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,420
The President entrusting you
with important duties

363
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,090
is certainly a good thing.

364
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,560
Let me toast you with tea instead of wine.

365
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,420
I wish you a bright future.

366
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,850
Director.

367
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,850
No matter where I end up in the future,

368
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,680
I will never forget

369
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,940
your care and support.

370
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,070
What made you decide

371
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,330
to visit the 318th Division headquarters
today?

372
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,310
Yesterday I heard from my wife

373
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,000
that Commander Jie plans to move
his entire family out of Fuzhou.

374
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,420
Jie Jinghe won't move.

375
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,400
He's Tang Enbo's trusted man.

376
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,880
The Communist army is now at our borders.

377
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,540
Fuzhou is in imminent danger.

378
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,480
We're in a life-or-death battle
with the Communist forces now.

379
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,810
But Commander Jie has always been
protective of his family.

380
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,700
So I went to the 318th Division myself

381
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,100
to assess the situation.

382
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,590
Since this coward is so afraid of dying,

383
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,700
I'll send him to the front lines.

384
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,900
Didn't you once say

385
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,130
that heaven won't tolerate
the Kuomintang surviving?

386
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,200
Just last month, Mr. Chiang suspected you
of being war-weary.

387
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,160
Why did he suddenly

388
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,830
appoint you as Deputy Chief
at the Ministry of Defense?

389
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,440
You've just been to the 318th Division.

390
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,790
And now this appointment comes through.

391
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,380
It's all too coincidental.

392
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,400
Sir, going to Taiwan to take up this post

393
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,200
is not a wise decision.

394
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,420
Once Fuzhou is liberated,

395
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,530
this order will be nothing
but a worthless piece of paper.

396
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,590
You might as well stay

397
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,250
here in Fuzhou with your wife.

398
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,180
A family reunion

399
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,290
has always been your wish.

400
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,730
Go make another trip.

401
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,820
Report this situation
to the East China Bureau immediately.

402
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,440
Who is it?

403
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:53,880
It's me.

404
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,610
Who's there?

405
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,010
Mr. Wu!

406
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,820
Madam.

407
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,140
What brings you here?

408
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm in Fuzhou on official business.

409
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,290
So of course I have to visit

410
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,290
Yuxun and you.

411
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,420
Please come in.

412
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,810
Is he in?

413
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,810
Yes. Yuxun.

414
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,570
Come out and see who's here!

415
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,290
Madam.

416
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,530
I've brought some local specialties.

417
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,290
Thank you.

418
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,550
Fenfei,

419
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,610
I've been waiting for you for so long.

420
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,550
[Wu Zhongxi, Underground Member
of the Communist Party of China]

421
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,030
I really missed you.

422
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:21,770
Yuxun.

423
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,660
The Party has received
the messages you sent.

424
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,780
The leader asked me
to convey instructions from above to you.

425
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:29,980
First,

426
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,150
the intelligence you've recently provided
is very valuable.

427
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,950
On behalf of the Party,
I'd like to express

428
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,660
the most sincere gratitude to you.

429
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,210
What about the mission?

430
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,080
There's no mandatory mission.

431
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,390
Whether to stage a local uprising

432
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,190
or continue intelligence work,

433
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,250
the Party fully respects
your personal decision.

434
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,770
Is that all?

435
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,990
That's all.

436
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,290
The following is my personal opinion.

437
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:03,810
Go on.

438
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,160
Don't go.

439
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,920
Fenfei.

440
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,720
The Yangtze defense line deployment maps

441
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,030
and the troop movement plans
of the Tang Enbo and Bai Chongxi groups

442
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,180
that I provided earlier

443
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,220
helped the PLA take only three days

444
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,420
to liberate Nanjing.

445
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,880
Also, the intelligence related to the
Xuzhou Suppression General Headquarters

446
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,590
and the enemy's defense plans
in southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang

447
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,160
prevented lots of

448
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,620
needless sacrifices and city destruction.

449
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,470
What if I were the Deputy Chief then?

450
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,800
Wouldn't it be easier
to obtain intelligence?

451
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,320
The level of White Terror in Taiwan now

452
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,510
is much more severe
than what you and I experienced.

453
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,130
Our comrades are sacrificing their lives
every day.

454
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,140
And more innocent people

455
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,340
are being executed as communist spies.

456
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,180
Yuxun.

457
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,740
Fuzhou is about to be liberated.

458
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,160
If you could be in your hometown

459
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,310
to witness the birth of New China,

460
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,110
what a happy thing that would be.

461
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,700
You've spent half your life
in military service,

462
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,760
making great contributions to New China.

463
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,820
You shouldn't take such risks again.

464
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,250
Fenfei.

465
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,180
I've repeatedly considered

466
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,680
the pros and cons of going or staying.

467
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,140
Completing this uprising

468
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,860
and welcoming Fuzhou's liberation

469
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,020
is something I've long hoped for.

470
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,610
If something happens to you in Taiwan,

471
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,070
what will your wife do?

472
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,510
What about your children?

473
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,690
You're afraid I won't come back?

474
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,110
You're going to Taiwan,

475
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,330
venturing deep into the lion's den.

476
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,160
Fenfei.

477
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,290
I've already decided.

478
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,570
I plan to

479
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,150
have Bikui and the children
go to Hong Kong first.

480
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,230
You have extensive connections
and many resources

481
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,010
in Hong Kong.

482
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,100
So I want to ask you

483
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,010
to take care of them.

484
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,960
You're entrusting your family to me.

485
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,350
That's an overstatement.

486
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,460
I'm just asking you

487
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,260
to look after them temporarily.

488
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,920
Listen.

489
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,460
I can't help you

490
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,610
with this favor.

491
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,000
Fenfei,

492
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,030
you know me.

493
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,740
If you agree,

494
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,810
I'll go.

495
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,330
If you don't agree,

496
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,960
I'm still going.

497
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,610
If I can't return,

498
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,220
then so be it.

499
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,140
There are not many things in life
that one can look back on

500
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,950
without regret.

501
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,700
Yuxun.

502
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,700
I won't look after

503
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
your wife and children for too long.

504
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,570
You must come back as soon as possible.

505
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,400
I'm not going to fight alone.

506
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,820
After all, I'll be working under

507
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,450
the leadership of the Party.

508
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,240
Fenfei.

509
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,550
Thanks.

Let's go to bed.

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,580
Sit down and talk with me for a while.

Go ahead.

520
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:35,840
I'm sorry.

521
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,920
Bikui,

522
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,590
you've given birth

523
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,160
to five children for me.

524
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,240
What exactly do you want to say?

525
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,390
I want to say

526
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,880
you were only

527
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,490
eighteen when you were with me,

528
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,480
drifting from place to place

529
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,830
and suffering hardships half your life.

530
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,180
Thank you.

531
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,250
Come quickly.

532
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
It's right here.

533
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,530
Mrs. Wu.

534
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,770
Mrs. Li. What brings you all here?

535
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,740
We heard Mr. Wu got promoted,

536
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,760
so we came specially to congratulate you.

537
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,330
We've brought some small gifts.

538
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,480
Thank you.
Would you like to come in for tea?

539
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,830
We won't disturb your rest.

540
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,660
A small gift.

541
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,090
Thank you.

542
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,820
Please accept this small gift.

543
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,660
You must have many things to attend to,

544
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,330
so we'll take our leave now.

545
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,810
Why didn't you tell me

546
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,880
something this big?

547
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,740
Last night,

548
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,790
why didn't you move me inside to sleep?

549
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,250
My back hurts when I sleep on the couch.

550
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,550
What do you want me to do?

551
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,940
Mom, I'm done eating.

552
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,550
Xuecheng, you go to your room too.

553
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,750
I'm not finished yet.

554
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,810
It's okay.

555
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,930
Say whatever you want to say.

556
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,350
What you've always disliked most

557
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,610
is the power struggle.

558
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,200
The higher-up has given an order.

559
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,730
I have no choice but to obey.

560
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,880
I want you and the children
to go to Hong Kong first.

561
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,030
I've already

562
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,040
asked Nie Xi to buy tickets for the 2 PM

563
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,350
ferry to Hong Kong.

564
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,390
I've also asked someone

565
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
to look for Lancheng and Shaocheng.

566
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,140
I'll find a way

567
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,130
for our family to reunite soon.

568
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,680
I've arranged a driver and a car

569
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,410
to take you to the dock.

570
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,660
All right.

571
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,440
I'm not going.

572
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,640
I'm not going anywhere.

573
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm staying in Fuzhou.

574
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,600
Why do we have to move to Hong Kong?

575
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,840
If you don't go,

576
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,460
what will you do?

577
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,810
Do you want to end up living
on the streets alone?

578
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,850
I can stay at my classmate's place.

579
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,610
If that doesn't work out,

580
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,670
I can go to Shanghai
to find Lancheng.

581
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,210
How long can you stay there?

582
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,540
In these chaotic times,

583
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,850
your mother and I

584
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,980
don't know when we can come pick you up.

585
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,550
Fuzhou is our hometown.

586
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,510
What's wrong
with wanting to stay in my hometown?

587
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,220
Xuecheng,

588
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,220
you're 14 now.

589
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,510
You're not a child anymore.

590
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,310
There's a lot going on at home lately.

591
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,280
You need to gradually learn

592
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,070
to take care of your mother

593
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,750
and your younger brother.

594
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,830
You can't just be willful all the time.

595
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,330
I can't replace you

596
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,880
as a husband and father!

597
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,710
Mom, look at my bird.

598
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,140
Why isn't it lively?

599
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,640
Our family is moving.

600
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,270
But I still have to take care of it.

601
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,380
We won't take it with us and we can't.

602
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,030
No! I want to take it with me!

603
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,500
Please be reasonable.

604
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,180
I've already said we can't take it.

605
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,110
We can't take it!

606
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,140
I want to take it!

607
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,180
I want to take my bird!

608
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,880
What's wrong with the bird?

609
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,750
Come with me.

610
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,750
Dad, look at my bird.

611
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,370
Why isn't it lively anymore?

612
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,140
It looks fine to me.

613
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,370
Don't cry.

614
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,010
You

615
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,760
make some bird sounds and it'll perk up.

616
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,450
Xuecheng.

617
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,730
If you want it to be lively,

618
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,930
there's another way.

619
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,500
Let it go free.

620
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,530
We won't let go, okay?

621
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,430
Keep it with you.

622
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,180
Report, Deputy Commander.

623
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,440
All the spies in the division
have been controlled.

624
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,550
As soon as Jie Jinghe heard Director Zhu

625
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,610
wanted to transfer him to the front line,

626
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,140
he immediately fled
with the 954th Regiment.

627
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,640
All obstacles to our uprising

628
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,050
have been completely removed.

629
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,030
Report!

630
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,090
Deputy Commander.

631
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,020
I've brought the PLA comrade here.

632
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,840
Hello, I am the Division Commander
of the 92nd Division,

633
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,070
31st Army, Third Field Army of the PLA.

634
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,159
What is the current situation

635
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,219
at the 318th Division's position?
Report quickly.

636
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,690
Director.

637
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,300
Yuxun,

638
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,969
why are you still here?

639
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,480
Where else would I be?

640
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,429
Just what I was afraid of.

641
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,120
The 318th Division has defected.

642
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,909
Now Fuzhou city is completely exposed.

643
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,850
Let's go now.

644
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,570
If we don't go now, we'll lose
the airport and we’ll have no way out.

645
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,640
Hurry!

646
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,590
Come on! Faster!

647
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,480
[Fuzhou Pacification Office]

648
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,130
Sir,

649
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,320
I request to go to Taiwan with you.

650
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,260
You can't go.

651
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,430
I must go.

652
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,380
I have two reasons
for requesting to go to Taiwan with you.

653
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,050
Officially,

654
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,730
my duty is to assist you with your work

655
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,510
and ensure your safety,

656
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,840
so I can't be a deserter.

657
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,650
Personally,

658
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,160
my beliefs were built by following you

659
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,320
and I'm worried about you going alone.

660
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,050
What about Mei after you leave?

661
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,320
What about your parents?

662
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,850
I've arranged everything.

663
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,120
Mei wants to come with me to Taiwan.

664
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
I've also called my brother,

665
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,420
asking him to return from Guangzhou
to Fuzhou

666
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,110
to participate in Fuzhou's development.

667
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,050
