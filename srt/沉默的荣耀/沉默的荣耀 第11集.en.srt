[Silent Honor]

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,900
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,350
This fish is really good.

4
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,680
No need to pick anymore.

5
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay.

6
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,080
Here.

7
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,850
Here.

8
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,479
Here.

9
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,850
Boss,

10
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,030
do you have Rabbitfish today?

11
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,950
The Rabbitfish is sold out.

12
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,160
Would you like some Sakura shrimps?

13
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,520
Today's Sakura shrimps
are just the right size.

14
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,380
Perfect for making dried shrimp.

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,180
I don't see any Sakura shrimp.

16
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,810
On the boat.
I saved some especially for you.

17
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,450
Help me watch the stall.

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,700
Let's go. I'll take you there.

19
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,590
The Keelung Work Committee is so busy.

20
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,850
How do you have time to come here?

21
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,390
I won't be handling
committee matters anymore.

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,740
I just handed over everything yesterday.

23
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,460
What's wrong? What happened?

24
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,660
The Party is going to build

25
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,270
a new communication line on the sea.

26
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,680
I'm your direct handler.

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,030
We need you and Xue's boats

28
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,570
to rendezvous at sea for transfers.

29
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,760
You must be strictly punctual.

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,070
Nothing must go wrong.

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,010
Can you do that?

32
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,990
Rendezvous at sea?

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,040
How can I guarantee that?

34
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,660
There aren't even coordinates at sea.

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,770
It's difficult to determine locations.

36
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,180
We'd need to be closer to shore at least.

37
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,900
I know.

38
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,620
This is a challenge you must overcome.

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,910
Why not just use Xue's boat?

40
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,840
Wouldn't it be safer this way,

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880
with one less step?

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,940
His boat is too big.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,980
The provincial police are
checking strictly for illegal crossings.

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,930
This communication line at sea

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,920
is extremely important.

46
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,990
We must ensure nothing goes wrong.

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,680
I understand what you mean.

48
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,800
Look.

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,780
Here, this spot should work,

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,910
and it's relatively safe.

51
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,120
This spot could work.

52
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,690
Is there any safer location?

53
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,090
How about this? You leave first.

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,690
It's not very safe here either, alright?

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,890
I promise to complete the mission.

56
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,900
I-I'll figure out the rest.

57
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:34,940
Alright?

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,460
Okay. I'm counting on you.

59
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,210
Take care.

60
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,910
Stay safe.

61
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,630
Are you full?

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,500
Yes, I'm full.

63
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,660
Now that you're full,
come upstairs with me.

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,190
I'll read you some lessons.

65
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,720
Let's go.

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,450
Today,

67
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,790
you actually seem like a father.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,060
So I didn't before?

69
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,040
Before,

70
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,720
you were more like a warlord.

71
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,730
Yuxun.

72
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,340
I know as a deputy chief,

73
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,530
you have many constraints.

74
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,530
I understand.

75
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,520
Jingcheng

76
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,730
is our regret.

77
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,460
Shaocheng and Lancheng
are on the mainland.

78
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,360
We're willing but unable to help them.

79
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,820
But Xuecheng and Jiancheng
are right here with us.

80
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,830
I really hope that no matter what,

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,420
we can make them as happy as possible.

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,670
Right.

83
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,060
And we need to keep them safe.

84
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,659
It sounds so beautiful.

85
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,490
But

86
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,440
why does it feel a bit sad?

87
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,600
I...

88
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,530
I'm homesick.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,570
Today at the school gate,

90
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,320
when I saw Miss Wu crying,

91
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,070
I cried too.

92
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,010
It reminded me of
leaving my hometown in Zhangzhou

93
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,610
and saying goodbye to my mom.

94
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
She held me and cried just like that,

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,010
as if she would

96
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,760
never see me again in this life.

97
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,560
I missed my mom.

98
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,980
Mom's idea today was really brilliant.

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,500
Everything sold out quickly.

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,600
I really didn't expect

101
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,190
that people here love spicy food so much.

102
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,780
Well, Yunnan, Guizhou,
and Sichuan love it,

103
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,230
and Shaanxi and Shanxi
also love spicy food.

104
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,230
How much was it again?

105
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,290
Now you see how amazing Mom is, right?

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Yes, indeed.

107
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,770
Mom is really amazing.

108
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,810
Well, I was pretty amazing myself too,

109
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,690
having made all this money today.

110
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,740
Aren't you going to reward me?

111
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,030
The kids are asleep.

112
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,700
Don't mess around.

113
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,790
Where was I with the counting?

114
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,860
If we're giving credit,
Mom deserves the most.

115
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,330
Remember to buy

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,940
more dried chili peppers tomorrow
and take them to the pharmacy.

117
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,790
No problem.

118
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,360
But isn't that tomorrow's work?

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,150
Go to sleep.

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,620
By the way, Ju,

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,420
there's something

122
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,890
I'd like to discuss with you.

123
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,970
I'm thinking

124
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,690
of renting a place near you.

125
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,480
This way,

126
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,710
we won't have to live so cramped, right?

127
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,210
And being close,

128
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,690
we can look out for each other.

129
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,690
What do you think?

130
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,880
No, Mom.

131
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,750
You only have a special permit.

132
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,010
Without a household registration,
you can't rent a place.

133
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,540
Then how about I rent under Ju's name?

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,470
Would that work?

135
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,440
Changcheng?

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,690
Mom, it's like this.

137
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,750
Since the government retreated to Taiwan,

138
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,550
large numbers of people
have flooded into Taiwan.

139
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,460
So now, rental prices in Taipei
have skyrocketed.

140
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,250
They're ridiculously expensive, right?

141
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,309
That's right, Mom.

142
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,340
We can squeeze in at home.

143
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,539
Why waste that money?

144
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,679
Better to spend it on food and drinks.

145
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,330
I was just thinking my staying here

146
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,280
might be inconvenient for you two.

147
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,050
Actually, your living elsewhere

148
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,850
might not be convenient either.

149
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,090
It's okay, Mom.

150
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,500
This way, we can save
quite a bit of money.

151
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,220
Right, let's save money to buy nice food.

152
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,650
Here.

153
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm done. You two eat, Mom.

154
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,370
We've finished eating too.

155
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,460
Mom.

156
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,520
Thank you for helping Changcheng
with the business to make money.

157
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,690
Aren't we family?

158
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,970
No need to be so formal.

159
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,850
When you're not busy,

160
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,640
you can also lend a hand.

161
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,950
This way,

162
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,680
Changcheng will have less pressure.

163
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,710
Times are tough now,

164
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,250
and he's under a lot of pressure, right?

165
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,710
Thank you, Mom.
It's so good to have you here.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't mention it.

167
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,130
I'll put this in the kitchen for you.

168
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,050
Mei's house

169
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,650
has been so quiet these days.

170
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,230
Right. Normally at this time,

171
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,560
she should be watering plants in the yard.

172
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,820
Could they have moved away?

173
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,410
I don't think so.
We've been neighbors for so long.

174
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,170
If they were moving,

175
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,430
she would have told us.

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,960
Perhaps their whole family
went on a trip?

188

They're always the fussiest,

189
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,460
asking for the call log every other day.

190

they just like ordering people around.

I'll have a copy of the People's Daily.

It's such a trivial matter.

Why did you go to the trouble of
coming yourself, Director Wang?

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,880
How could I possibly know
he was a Communist spy?

212
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,510
I had no idea!

213

anti-Chiang statements in mainland.

For this kind of obvious collaboration
with Communists,

we must bring her in for questioning.

Of course, absolutely.

Don't worry. I'll tell you later.

Isn't that Adjutant Nie?

228
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
Adjutant Nie.

229
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,750
Morning.

230
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,260
What is it?

231
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,300
How's it going? Any news from Chiang?

232
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,010
Chiang has discovered

233
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,250
that the PLA's main aim of attack
isn't northern Sichuan,

234
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,620
so he's adjusting his overall deployment.

235
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,150
He urgently ordered

236
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,840
Sun Yuanliang's 16th Corps
stationed in eastern Sichuan

237
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,360
to move to the outskirts of Chongqing,

238
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,400
Luo Guangwen's 15th Corps
to be redeployed to southern Sichuan,

239
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
and the 1st Corps of Hu Zongnan's troops

240
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,930
stationed in northern Sichuan
to move east to Chongqing,

241
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,700
so as to strengthen the defense line
in southeastern Sichuan.

242
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,150
The PLA is advancing on multiple fronts,

243
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,310
forcing Chiang to frequently move troops

244
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,510
between eastern, northern,
and southern Sichuan.

245
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,910
His troops are exhausted
from constant movement.

246
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,630
This is very favorable for
liberating southwest China.

247
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,090
Do not celebrate too soon.

248
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,170
Following the liberation of Wujiang River
and Pengshui River,

249
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,480
Chiang set up

250
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,360
four new defense lines at Baima Mountain.

251
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,550
They've built fortifications
on high ground,

252
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,690
and the fourth supply zone
is rapidly preparing

253
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,500
large quantities of high explosives
and other demolition materials.

254
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,980
Liu and Deng are focused on pursuing
and eliminating Song Xilian's corps.

255
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,020
If the PLA were to enter Baima Mountain,

256
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,200
the consequences would be unimaginable.

257
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,090
We must send this intelligence out
immediately

258
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,950
so the PLA can prepare in advance.

259
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,080
But we haven't heard from the courier yet.

260
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,170
It's been almost a month
since we returned from Hong Kong.

261
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,630
They should be here by now.

262
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,670
We can't remain passive like this.

263
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,150
We can only wait two more days.

264
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,580
If there's still no word from the courier
after two days,

265
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,700
we'll have to find another way

266
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,500
to send out the intelligence
about the Southwest.

267
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,720
When Taiwan is liberated,

268
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,430
I'll bring my daughter to see this sea.

269
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,060
How's it going?

270
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,270
Any progress with Adjutant Nie?

271
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,010
Stop talking nonsense.

272
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,340
What feelings could I possibly have
for him?

273
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,270
It's just that his cold, distant demeanor

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,460
has piqued a bit of my curiosity,
that's all.

275
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,170
So what are you planning to do?

276
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,650
Treat him to a meal, maybe?

277
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
That should work.

278
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,690
How about I treat him?

279
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,530
After all, I'm the one who caused trouble.

280
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,880
What's wrong? Are you upset?

281
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,780
What's wrong?

282
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,090
We'll go together.

283
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,730
I rarely get to see him.

284
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,090
How am I supposed to have a meal with him?

285
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,220
Make some dishes and bring them to him.

286
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,580
He won't have the heart to refuse.

287
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,410
This way, you can show your
domestic skills

289

in a room with him.

290
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,960
He's... From Fuzhou, right?

291
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,240
I don't know how to make their food.

292
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,080
Just make what you're good at.

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Chongqing food?

294
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,340
Can he handle Chongqing food?

295
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,910
Who cares?

296
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,930
It's the thought that counts.

Is it enough?

300
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
I think... You need to make it
this much longer.

hometown dishes and brought them to you.

338
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,860
Zhenhua had something to do,

339
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,760
and I was worried the food would get cold,

340
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,220
so I brought it over first.

341
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
As a thank-you gift,

342
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,740
it might not be much,

343
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,280
but I hope you don't mind.

344
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,490
It was nothing.

345
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,220
There's no need to be so formal.

346
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,020
Alright then, thanks.

347
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,290
Anything else?

348
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,020
Can I listen to music here with the radio

349
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,190
while you're eating?

350
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,020
Where's your radio?

351
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,470
Radios are so expensive.

352
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,770
I can't afford one.

353
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,180
When I was in college,

354
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,430
I always borrowed my classmates' radios.

355
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,030
It's okay.

356
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,300
If it's inconvenient for me to come in,

357
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,050
you can lend me your radio.

358
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,700
Then after you finish eating,

359
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,060
when I come to get the food container,

360
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,080
I can return the radio to you.

361
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,630
Sure.

362
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,860
It's not inconvenient at all.

363
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,130
Let me turn it on for you.

364
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,150
Thank you.

Adjutant Nie.

369
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,470
Is the food too spicy?

370
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,930
I don't know how to cook without chili.

371
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,580
Actually, the weather here is quite humid,

372
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,580
so eating some chili pepper
can help reduce dampness.

373
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:45,730
Right.

374
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,560
Back in my hometown during winter...

375
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,630
My brother would tell me to
eat chili pepper in summer,

376
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,060
saying it could cool you down;

377
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,250
and in cold weather, he'd also
tell me to eat chili pepper,

378
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,910
saying it could keep you warm.

379
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,410
Your brother...

380
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,270
What does he do?

381
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,850
My brother was a pilot
in the Nationalist Army.

382
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,790
He died serving our country.

383
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,410
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,530
It's okay.

385
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,080
I'm done eating.

386
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,770
Thank you for your hometown dishes.

387
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,650
It's getting late.

388
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,650
You should go now.

389
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,320
I noticed you've barely eaten anything.

390
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,130
Are you feeling uneasy with me around?

391
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,820
No, not at all.

392
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,020
Please eat a bit more.

393
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,390
Well, how about I leave first?

394
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,650
Take your time eating.

395
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,260
Have some more.

396
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,190
I'll go now. You're too skinny. Eat more.

397
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm full.

398
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,670
You've barely touched your food
and you're full?

399
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,890
Dou, go check.

400
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,290
Brother Nie.

401
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,570
You've finished eating?

402
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,360
Nie Xi, you're here.

403
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,820
Madam.

404
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,610
Have you had breakfast?

405
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,860
Sir. Not yet.

406
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,190
I knew you hadn't eaten.

407
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,020
Come on, eat.

408
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,860
We've even got the bowl and chopsticks
ready for you.

409
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,210
Mom, I'm done too.

410
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,520
-I'm off to school.
-You're done too?

411
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,650
I'm about to be late.

412
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,380
Qian.

413
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,580
Qian?

414
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,760
Have you posted the missing-person notice?

415
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,420
Yes, I have.

416
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,050
She should see it in no time.

417
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,920
Xuecheng needs to go to school.
Give her a drive.

418
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,260
I've been thinking.

419
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,150
We'll meet Mrs. Chen

420
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,190
at the Power Company Guesthouse.

421
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Has that place not been vacated yet?

422
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,390
Xuecheng!

423
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,030
Take two eggs to eat in the car.

424
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,960
I'm about to be late.

425
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,250
Xuecheng, don't run!

426
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,690
It hasn't been vacated.

427
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,040
There're only some old books left there.

428
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,640
No one will look for me there.

429
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,820
It's indeed a good place
where we won't be disturbed.

430
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,120
Why did you buy two

431
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,580
copies of the People's Daily?

432
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,970
I bought one but the vendor gave me two.

433
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,430
Here.

434
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,320
I thought I'd leave a copy for Mom.

435
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,220
Thank you.

436
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,730
Good girl.

437
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,520
[Missing-Person Notice: Brother comes from
the Northeast to Taiwan to seek sister.]

Mom, the meal's ready.

441
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,620
Okay, coming.

442
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,570
Rickshaw!

443
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Coming.

444
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
This way, please.

445
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,400
This is Room 3.

446
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,550
Please come in.

447
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,490
Thank you.

448
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,740
I'm sorry.

449
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,930
I think I might got the wrong room.

450
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,060
You're not in the wrong room, Mrs. Chen.

451
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,570
Please have a seat.

452
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,460
Are you Comrade East Sea?

453
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,350
Was your journey smooth?

454
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,220
I've finally met you, Comrade East Sea.

455
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,360
Don't worry.

456
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,260
I came all the way here

457
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,450
and felt very safe.

458
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,490
There was no problem at all.

459
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,260
That's good.

460
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,300
You look so young.

461
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,280
Actually,

462
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,950
Comrade East Sea will be waiting for
you at this address.

463
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,780
So,

464
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,070
you can have a rest here
and have some tea.

465
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,200
There's no rush.

466
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,950
The address for your meeting with
Comrade East Sea

467
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,390
can't be published in newspapers.

468
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:34,970
So,

469
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,390
for safety reasons,

470
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,080
we have to use this place
as a relay point.

471
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,340
I hope you understand.

472
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,740
Alright.

473
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,840
If I remember correctly,

474
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,580
Hangzhou South Road

475
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,770
is quite far from here.

476
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,540
Then I won't stay longer.

477
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,800
I'll take my leave now.

478
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,600
Mrs. Chen, please be careful.

479
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,530
Okay, thank you.

480
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,820
By the way, I shouldn't take this with me.

481
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,130
Alright, goodbye.

482
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,780
Mrs. Chen.

483
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,330
I'm heading the same way.

484
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,600
Would you like me to give you a ride?

485
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,260
Sure, thank you.

486
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,800
Please.

487
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,040
Mrs. Chen, please wait for me a moment.

488
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,650
Okay.

489
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,580
You want to buy cigarettes, Sir?

490
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,710
Do you have Hatamen?

491
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,780
Okay, thank you.

492
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,040
Welcome back anytime.

493
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,200
You can smoke if you want.

494
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,380
I don't mind the smell.

495
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,410
Mrs. Chen, I don't smoke.

496
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,680
I was just worried about being followed,

497
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,880
so I stopped to check.

498
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,890
My mentor's wife also really dislikes
the smell of smoke,

499
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,490
so nobody smokes in this car.

500
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,570
Who is this mentor's wife
you're referring to?

501
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,390
Comrade East Sea is my mentor.

502
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,510
The Power Company Guesthouse
we're heading to

503
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,800
was where they used to live.

504
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,060
They've moved out now,

505
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,570
so we won't be disturbed.

506
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,490
Deputy Chief Wu, you're really here.

507
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,350
I heard some noise from your room,

508
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,840
so I came to check.

509
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,970
Wait, why

510
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,150
haven't you moved out yet?

511
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,000
I came back to pack up my books.

512
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,580
Why haven't you moved out either?

513
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,300
Didn't the Ministry of Defense
assign you housing?

514
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,380
Please don't get me started.

515
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,060
I was in Chongqing all this time,

516
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,870
and then Guangzhou fell,

517
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,740
suddenly a large group of people arrived.

518
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,780
While I was away,

519
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,340
they took over my house.

520
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,450
That's because your standards
are too high.

521
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,760
If you lower your standards a bit,

522
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,360
you could move out tomorrow.

523
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,020
Seems like nothing escapes your notice.

524
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,480
Director Duan, pardon me.

525
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,230
My place is a mess,

526
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,820
so I won't invite you in.

527
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,610
Deputy Chief Wu.

528
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,370
I have some work matters

529
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,610
that I'd like to report to you in person.

530
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,890
Come in then.

531
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,410
Okay.

532
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,120
Mrs. Chen, I'll stop here.

533
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,600
It's on the second floor
of that building ahead,

534
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,380
the room on the far left.

535
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,580
Aren't you coming up?

536
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,910
I'll stay outside.

537
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,040
It's the rule.

538
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,180
All right.

539
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,409
You truly have an impressive collection
of books.

540
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,179
The books you left behind after moving

541
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,570
would be enough for me
to read for a lifetime.

542
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,699
I haven't had time to tidy up
since moving.

543
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,360
There's hardly a place to sit.

544
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,860
Let's make it short.

545
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,840
What's the matter?

546
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,350
Sir, about this matter,

547
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,760
I need to have a proper talk with you.

548
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,820
Please sit down.

549
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,510
This trip to Chongqing

550
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,480
has delayed so many of my plans.

551
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,840
I finally managed to return,

552
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,300
but you were never around.

553
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,969
I came looking for you several times
recently,

554
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,010
but you were always away,

555
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,620
so I never had the chance

556
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,820
to apologize to you in person.

557
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,640
During your visit to Hong Kong,

558
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,700
our work was indeed inadequate.

559
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,160
Not only did we fail to ease your burden,

560
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,560
we even caused a scandal.

561
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,310
By the way,

562
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,740
we've severely reprimanded

563
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,740
Director Zhang.

564
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,910
But today,

565
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,270
on behalf of our Second Department,

566
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,330
I want to offer my sincere apologies.

567
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,030
That won't be necessary.

568
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,570
It's been a long time since that incident.

569
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,660
It's alright.

570
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,780
No, no, Sir.

571
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,820
Sir,

572
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,450
your willingness to overlook this

573
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,650
shows your focus on the bigger picture.

574
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,240
But internally, we must examine ourselves

575
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,490
to prevent similar issues in the future.

576
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,320
However, that being said...

577
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,760
Please sit, Deputy Chief Wu.

578
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,490
If the BIS

579
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,090
had given us advance notice,

580
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,990
we wouldn't have been
caught off guard, right?

581
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,950
I heard Mao Renfeng

582
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,090
sent that troublemaker Gu Zhengwen

583
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,750
to the mountains in Taichung.

584
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,950
Think about that.

585
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,410
Is he really trying to
acknowledge his mistakes

586
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,740
and solve the problems?

587
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,210
It's clearly a promotion
disguised as punishment, right?

588
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,260
I'll get it.

589
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,230
May I ask who you're looking for?

590
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,110
Who else would I be looking for?

591
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,720
Your wife, of course.

592
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,550
We've been friends for so many years.

593
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,410
Can you believe

594
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,900
she actually moved without telling me?

595
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,760
Where is she?

596
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,930
Oh, you're a friend of my wife Bikui?

597
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,220
Didn't she tell you we recently moved?

598
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,850
She didn't say anything.

599
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,070
Think about it. Bikui and I

600
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,360
have been friends for so many years...

601
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,200
Please come in.

602
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,560
Moving is such a big deal.

603
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,590
How could she not let me know?

604
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,920
Is she planning to cut ties with me?

605
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,940
You know what?

606
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,180
I've been thinking about this for a while,

607
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,140
trying to figure out what went wrong.

608
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,320
I want to ask,

609
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,120
was it because

610
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,340
I didn't invite her that time
we ate at Tan's Restaurant

611
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,650
that she got upset?

612
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,010
A few days ago, my wife did seem

613
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,220
to be in a bad mood.

614
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,250
But that was nothing serious.

615
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,910
We've been very busy lately.

616
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,610
She'll probably let it slip from her mind.

617
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,210
Please don't worry about it.

618
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,340
You see?

619
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,340
When they told me

620
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,960
that Bikui was upset,

621
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,130
I didn't believe it at first.

622
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,390
Who would have thought
it turns out to be true?

623
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,300
Actually, about this matter,

624
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,640
I need to explain to you.

625
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,050
Because the people who went that day

626
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,280
were all smokers,

627
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,490
but Bikui doesn't like the smell of smoke,

628
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:37,950
right?

629
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,630
Yes, right.

630
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,070
That's why I didn't invite her.

631
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,600
That really wasn't my fault,
don't you think?

632
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,030
Sir.

633
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,630
Since you have a guest visiting,

634
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,890
I'll take my leave now.

635
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,910
Alright.

636
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,660
Take your time.

637
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:50,890
Okay.

638
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,430
Enjoy your chat.

639
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,030
Take care.

640
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,550
Sure.

641
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,650
So don't you think you should

642
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,000
explain to Bikui for me

643
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,450
that this really wasn't my fault?

644
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Comrade East Sea.

645
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,920
I'm Mrs. Chen, Zhu Feng.

646
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,580
Comrade Zhu Feng, welcome.

647
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,640
Just call me Wu Shi.

648
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,680
Who was that?

649
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,740
Director of the Second Department
of the Ministry of Defense—

650
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,270
the head of secret service.

651
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,460
Is he dangerous?

652
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,210
He's alright.

653
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,030
We all used to live here.

654
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,720
I just didn't expect
he hadn't moved out yet.

655
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,320
This is a letter from Mr. Wan,

656
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,840
Comrade Wan Jingguang.

657
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,820
Let me pour you some hot tea.

658
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,090
No need. Thanks.

659
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,330
You have relatives
in the Police Department?

660
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:30,910
Yes.

661
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,510
My daughter and son-in-law are both
former Military Intelligence members.

662
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,890
My daughter is a civilian

663
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,360
and doesn't know the operational work,

664
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,330
while my son-in-law has always
worked in communications.

665
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,860
After Dai Li's plane crash,

666
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,770
the Military Intelligence downsized.

667
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,070
They were both assigned to the
Provincial Military Affairs Department.

668
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,590
My son-in-law is now the director of
the Telecommunications Office.

669
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,800
I live with them.

670
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,890
Have you made a rendezvous
with the Taiwan Work Committee?

671
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,550
Yes, I have.

672
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,050
This intelligence is crucial
to the front-line battle situation.

673
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,910
It's extremely time-sensitive.

674
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,270
We must send it out as soon as possible.

675
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,760
There's no time to waste.

676
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,570
This is a film roll.

677
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,230
It's very small.

678
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,890
There's too much information.

679
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,550
Paper would be inconvenient.

680
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,610
If something unexpected happens,

681
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,240
pull the film out from here

682
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,910
and it will be exposed.

683
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,570
The enemy won't know the contents.

684
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,370
I understand.

685
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,200
Also,

686
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,740
meeting here isn't a long-term solution.

687
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,220
Besides, with my current identity,

688
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,140
it's not convenient for me
to appear in public places.

689
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,940
You were quick to react earlier.

690
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,490
We can use that to our advantage.

691
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,660
You can continue to pose as
my wife's friend

692
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,430
and come to my home for the rendezvous.

693
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,890
But you'll need to wait for
my notification.

694
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,590
No problem.

695
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,800
My identity is quite flexible.

696
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,530
Whatever's convenient for you.

697
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,070
Alright.

698
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,840
I need to talk to my family first.

699
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,860
I'll leave you a phone number.

700
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,300
You can call during the day.

701
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,900
My son-in-law won't be home
since he's at work.

702
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,240
I'll have my adjutant Nie Xi
give you a ride.

703
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,470
The car's downstairs.

704
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,360
Remember, he'll call you.

705
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,610
Okay.

706
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,100
Goodbye.

707
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,710
Goodbye.

708
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,780
See you.

709
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,770
See you, Mrs. Chen.
