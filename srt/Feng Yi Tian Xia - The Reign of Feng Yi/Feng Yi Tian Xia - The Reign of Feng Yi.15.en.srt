00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,870
[Episode 15]

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,900
I didn't expect

3
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,689
to wear a wedding gown one day.

4
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,310
Do I look good?

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,690
Wait.

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,150
Sima Qi,

7
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,100
do your eyes need manual focus?

8
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,100
I want to see more clearly.

9
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,150
What's wrong?

10
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,920
Let me help you.

11
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,320
Consider it my way of repaying you for shaving my beard.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,050
You know how to do that?

13
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,910
Do you know how to do that?

14
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,759
Considering your eyes,

15
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,140
I don't want to look ugly

16
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,570
on our wedding day.

17
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,380
Trust me.

18
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,950
Sima Qi,

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,440
it hurts.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,600
What's wrong?

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,310
Nothing. Don't move.

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,990
Almost done.

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,350
Done.

24
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,670
Young man, you're really good.

25
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,230
You must have helped many girls wear hairpins.

26
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,320
This is my first time helping a girl wear a hairpin.

27
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,660
I swear.

28
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,300
I don't believe you.

29
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,730
Really.

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,270
Really.

31
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,450
I'm not lying.

32
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,250
You fooled me.

33
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,680
It's time.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,110
Are you two ready?

35
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,610
Are you ready?

36
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,730
Are you ready?

37
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,370
I'm ready too.

38
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,110
Let's go.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,270
She still didn't drink it?

40
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,790
She spat out every sip she took.

41
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,810
She really can't swallow it.

42
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,020
Do you know where there are mulberries and hawthorns nearby?

43
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Please forgive me, My Lady.

44
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,820
Get up!

45
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,880
Why are you kneeling?

46
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,170
I know

47
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,470
I crossed the line again.

48
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,070
But I hope you can put your health first.

49
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,830
I made these appetizing snacks myself.

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Please don't mind.

51
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,860
Have some.

52
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,870
They can relieve the bitterness of the medicine.

53
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,140
No need.

54
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,790
I will take the medicine.

55
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,790
Don't worry, My Lady.

56
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,040
I will throw away the hairpin.

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,210
I will never cross the line again!

58
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,380
Grand Tutor,

59
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,020
please leave.

60
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,390
I'm going to throw away the hairpin now!

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,480
My Lord. My Lady.

62
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,260
Mao came back with Master.

63
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,260
What?

64
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,590
Nanfeng.

65
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,590
Father.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,390
Father.

67
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,990
I've been looking for you.

68
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,690
Father.

69
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,470
I've been looking for you.

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,240
I finally see you.

71
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,080
Father.

72
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,870
You've suffered.

73
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,760
Where are Mr. Sima and City Lord?

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,110
I thought they were with you.

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
I thought they came back in advance.

76
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,310
Oh no!

77
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,150
What's wrong?

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,130
They're here.

79
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,950
They're here.

80
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,510
Congratulations.

81
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,030
Wish you a lifetime of happiness together.

82
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,860
Take the first bow to Heaven and Earth!

83
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,670
Take the second bow to the parents!

84
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,750
Take the third bow to each other!

85
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,980
The ceremony has been completed!

86
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,050
Come on.

87
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,060
Sit.

88
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,140
I...

89
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,120
have something for you.

90
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,340
Something?

91
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,480
What do you want to give me?

92
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,150
You made it?

93
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,000
So beautiful.

94
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,190
According to the wedding custom,

95
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,440
you should call me Honey now, right?

96
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,990
My Lord,

97
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,440
a gentleman should have self-control and behave well.

98
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,570
This is my wedding.

99
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,780
I can do

100
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,500
whatever I want.

101
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,100
Then...

102
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,990
may I ask

103
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,430
what you want to do?

104
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,960
Or...

105
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,250
what do you dare to do?
