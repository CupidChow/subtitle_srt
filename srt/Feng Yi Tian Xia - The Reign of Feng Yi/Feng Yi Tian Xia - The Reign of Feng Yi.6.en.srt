00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,860
[Episode 6]

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,220
Kneel!

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:08,470
My Lord.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,830
Mao,

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,300
do you know why we're fighting for power?

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,000
Because the people are suffering.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,390
Upright people can work with each other yet remain different.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,590
As long as it's good for the country and the people,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,510
what's the harm in making a deal with the devil?

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,020
Still kneeling?

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,320
Aren't you tired?

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,580
I always do as you say.

13
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,270
Yes, you're right.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,870
Have you found the tally?

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,380
Probably...

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,910
Come on,

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,660
can you work harder?

18
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,420
The entanglement between Princess of Yandan and me

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,560
was cleverly resolved by me.

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,360
I, along with the kind lady, and...

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,370
Greetings, City Lord.

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,650
And Yuan Qingheng.

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,340
Sorry,

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,570
I really don't know how to describe Yuan Qingheng.

25
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,550
Anyway,

26
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,200
we pulled off a self-sacrifice trick together.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,539
This narration is way too long.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920
Isn't this Princess Chun Yuzhi,

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,070
who swore she would marry no one but Sima Qi?

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,350
Where did this nobody come from? Get lost!

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,110
You talk rudely. Slap her!

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,620
Her Ladyship fell into the water!

33
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,550
Help!

34
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,150
Her Ladyship fell into the water!

35
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:02,790
Her Ladyship fell into the water!

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,430
Help!

37
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,310
Help!

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,110
Help!

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,560
My Lady!

40
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,310
City Lord!

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,470
City Lord!

42
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,790
Her Ladyship was pushed into the water by the Princess of Yandan!

43
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,390
What?

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,530
-What?
-Please go there and take a look.

45
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,160
Lead the way.

46
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,470
Over there.

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,230
Honey?

48
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,120
You...

49
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,690
Her Ladyship is of noble status,

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,820
yet you humiliated her!

51
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,240
The autumn water is cold.

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,590
If anything happens to Her Ladyship,

53
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,460
you'll be held accountable!

54
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,570
Yes!

55
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,750
I...

56
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,630
Yuzhi, apologize.

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,730
Brother,

58
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,790
she was the one who came to pick a fight.

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,740
How did my wife become like this?

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,720
Summon an imperial physician! Hurry!

61
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,360
City Lord,

62
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,910
you must seek justice for me.

63
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,350
The villain cries first.

64
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,130
Don't think that I'll be scared just because you're crying.

65
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,850
Shut up!

66
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,920
You pushed someone into the water and still don't repent.

67
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,510
Hurry up and take your good sister

68
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,770
and disappear from my sight.

69
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,200
I didn't expect you to be such a vicious woman.

70
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,540
Exactly!

71
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,160
I never thought that the Princess of Yandan could be so vicious.

72
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,770
I...

73
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:12,970
Let's go.

74
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,240
Brother, I...

75
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,300
Let's go!

76
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,780
Brother.

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,030
Qingheng, at this moment, the one who truly understands you is me.

78
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,350
The City Lord is becoming more and more ambitious.

79
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,910
He dares to play tricks behind my back.

80
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,010
Zhang Dequan.

81
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,030
I'm here.

82
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,870
Prepare things as you said.

83
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,780
Yes.

84
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,110
The chill in me hasn't worn off yet.

85
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,300
Get another cloak for me.

86
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,430
Yes.

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,790
The autumn water is cold.

88
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,390
My Lady, your health is very important.

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,560
You shouldn't have used yourself to lure the enemy.

90
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,720
I was sacrificing for my husband.

91
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,360
It was nothing.

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,630
Grand Tutor,

93
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,480
how long are you going to bow?

94
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,190
It's rare that you're free today.

95
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,450
The planting festival is coming.

96
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,040
Could you help me think of some activities

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
to celebrate with the people?

98
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,470
How about setting off river lanterns?

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,610
I've traveled outside for many years.

100
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,240
But I've never had a chance

101
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,860
to set off the blessing lanterns in the capital.

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,909
I bought one three years ago.

103
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,790
-But in the end...
-Qingheng.

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,390
I know.

105
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,600
It's all in the past.

106
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,040
Now you are the esteemed wife of the City Lord.

107
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,160
You should be in a happy marriage with him.

108
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,600
The past?

109
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,320
The past?

110
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,750
Then why do you still keep this blessing knot?

111
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,910
Do you want to push me to the City Lord this much?

112
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,630
On the day of our wedding,

113
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,170
you said we had no further ties.

114
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
Then why do you care?

115
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,410
I...

116
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,880
Qingheng,

117
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,150
three years ago, I wronged you.

118
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,510
No.

119
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,540
Honey.

120
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,750
I'm here. How long have you been waiting?

121
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,470
Have a seat.

122
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,210
Honey, are you alright?

123
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:19,800
Yes.

124
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,750
City Lord,

125
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,070
Her Ladyship has done so much for you.

126
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,090
You should cherish her more.

127
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,070
I know.

128
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,540
My wife is the most gentle and considerate.

129
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,830
Without you,

130
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,430
I wouldn't know what to do.

131
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,260
City Lord, I know you're wise.

132
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,300
Yandan has come on very aggressively this time.

133
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,640
It's not that simple.

134
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,590
Of course.

135
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,680
The City Lord's move is quite clever.

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,520
He no longer needs to enter into a political marriage,

137
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,090
and the blame has shifted to Yandan.

138
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,910
Yandan has no excuse,

139
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,770
so the war won't happen.

140
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,370
My Lord,

141
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,550
this stupid City Lord seems to have really changed a lot.

142
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,510
But when it comes to right and wrong, it's just petty cleverness.

143
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,570
Avoiding war is the true responsibility of an emperor.

144
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,400
Next,

145
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,380
it's our turn.

146
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,799
Is this the Seventh Princess who visited the mansion last time?

147
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:39,580
My Lord,

148
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
could it be you like her?

149
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,400
Mao,

150
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,940
don't be nosey.

151
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,750
So, it's one-sided love?

152
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,410
Mao.

153
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,690
Can't I just say?

154
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,230
I'll stop.

155
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,520
The Seventh Princess really looks like the City Lord.

156
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,980
No wonder they are siblings.

157
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,210
But My Lord,

158
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,910
if we're going to kill the City Lord,

159
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,190
then the Seventh Princess...

160
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,370
The Seventh Princess has nothing to do with it.

161
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,360
The purpose of Lady Dowager and Yandan forming an alliance

162
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,620
is to establish a trade market.

163
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,060
I can offer them the same thing.

164
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,680
But right now, there's a lack of trust between us.

165
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,650
Marriage is the best way to build trust.

166
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,350
I never intended to use this method

167
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,900
from the beginning.

168
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,180
But since you're willing...

169
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,470
Are you sure?

170
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,220
It's not too late to change your mind.

171
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,270
To escape this dog-eat-dog City Lord's Mansion

172
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,900
and to break free from the Lady Dowager's control,

173
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,770
I've been waiting for this opportunity for so long.

174
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,820
It's all my fault.

175
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,750
I failed to protect my sisters.

176
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm useless.

177
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,680
It's all your fault.

178
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,210
It's your fault for starting to seize power only now.

179
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,140
If you had started it earlier,

180
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,180
the Lady Dowager wouldn't have had the energy to meddle with us.

181
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,670
Alright, alright.

182
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,010
Anyway,

183
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,850
the Young Lord Chun Yu of Yandan will appear at Chunting Pavilion.

184
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,510
By then, I'll arrange

185
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,210
a "hero saving the beauty" plan.

186
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,760
There will be kidnappers abducting you

187
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,530
and using the sachet as a token to...

188
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,320
Stop the carriage now.

189
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,290
What's wrong?

190
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,710
This trip concerns my life.

191
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,470
I value it more than you do.

192
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,510
Trust me.

193
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,790
Why do I feel something is wrong?

194
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,410
Help!

195
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
The people of Yandan are bullying us!

196
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,430
They broke my leg and are trying to escape!

197
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,640
It hurts so much!

198
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,030
You're slandering us!

199
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,710
You clearly staged an accident for compensation.

200
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,480
You want compensation, right?

201
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,740
Fine, I'll give you what you want.

202
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,540
Stop!

203
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,550
You Yandan people hit him and now want to kill him too?

204
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,490
You clearly have no respect for Fengyao.

205
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,580
Such malicious intent cannot be tolerated!

206
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,150
Exactly! Such malicious intent cannot be tolerated!

207
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,880
This person is escalating a personal grudge into a conflict between the two cities,

208
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,390
forcing us to swallow this loss.

209
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,390
Kill me! Kill me!

210
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,980
You staged an accident just for compensation.

211
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,350
Why did you say they have malicious intent?

212
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,550
Everyone knows that Yandan and our city have a friendly relationship

213
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,880
and are considering a marriage alliance.

214
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,270
Yet, at this critical moment, you are sowing discord between the two cities.

215
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,280
If a war truly breaks out, causing devastation and suffering,

216
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,150
can you bear the responsibility?

217
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,880
Nonsense!

218
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,770
Bah! Traitors!

219
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Who sent you here?

220
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,750
It hurts! My leg is broken!

221
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,710
With such a petty trick,

222
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,030
you want to stir up conflict between the two cities?

223
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,180
Miss, you're a hero. May I know your name?

224
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,100
Wait a moment, Young Lord of Yandan,

225
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,260
are you sure you're acting out "love at first sight" here

226
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,450
and not "long-lost sisters reunited"?

227
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,960
Impressive, truly impressive.

228
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,350
Sima Qi?

229
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,840
What a coincidence.

230
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,070
Are you trying to kill me again?

231
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,510
You must be joking.

232
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm loyal and devoted.

233
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,740
When have I ever tried to assassinate you?

234
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,110
You...

235
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,800
Stop!

236
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,730
You pointed your sword at my neck last time.

237
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,640
This time, we're even.
