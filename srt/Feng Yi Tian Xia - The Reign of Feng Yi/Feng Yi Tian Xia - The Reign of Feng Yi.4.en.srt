00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,900
[Episode 4]

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,390
Mr. Sima, something happened.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,190
Wake up.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,950
You'd better have a good reason for waking me up.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:12,820
Go ahead.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,870
Mr. Sima, the tally's whereabouts is still unknown.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,910
I think...

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,150
the tally is already in Lady Dowager's hands.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,350
Should we explore Lady Dowager's room at night?

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,430
Have two strings to our bow.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,990
Find a reliable craftsman to do it.

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,230
You want to forge the tally?

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,510
Will it be seen through?

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,470
Forge 800 tallies.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,710
So many?

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,060
The tally is an extra guarantee.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,030
If we can't find it, we can just forge some

18
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,150
so that the city guards can't tell which is true.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,650
It's fine as long as the city guards

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,580
can stay put on the day of the rebellion.

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,270
After the morning court tomorrow,

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,600
Yandan City's young lord and princess will come.

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,250
The palace will be poorly guarded by that time.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,550
It's our best chance.

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,790
I'll go explore myself.

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,720
You...

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,140
Go ahead.

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,220
You'll go personally?

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,530
The tally is not big.

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,490
You didn't even see Princess clearly last time.

31
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,810
This time, you...

32
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,150
It's fine if you go.

33
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:26,350
Okay.

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,500
I really need to treat my hyperopia as soon as possible.

35
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,039
It's really getting in the way.

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,910
He died of a sudden stroke?

37
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:43,970
Sima Qi,

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,950
Mr. Qin is an important official of our city.

39
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,910
The report has been submitted.

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,930
It's the truth.

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,000
Lady Dowager, my condolences.

42
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,070
Pass my order.

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,430
Give Mr. Qin a grand funeral with 100,000 taels of silver.

44
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,229
Lady Dowager,

45
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,500
the floods in Huainan have devastated the crops.

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,600
Countless people died of hunger.

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,470
That's hundreds of thousands of lives.

48
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,470
The money...

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,790
How dare you!

50
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,760
Are you teaching me how to do things?

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,930
I dare not.

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,450
Mr. Sima,

53
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,750
remember,

54
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,630
the stability of the court is naturally

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,250
due to the functioning of its established system.

56
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,560
Now,

57
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,000
the priority is to receive Yandan's envoy.

58
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,590
Yes.

59
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,230
Lady Dowager,

60
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,710
Mr. Qin's death was an accident,

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,690
but the tally is missing, and City Lord is disloyal.

62
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,060
We must take precautions.

63
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,440
Could it be...

64
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,940
the two of them

65
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,870
have collaborated?

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,570
What?

67
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,860
You want to meet Zhuo Tian's leader

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,990
at 3 p.m. tomorrow?

69
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,640
The welcome banquet for Yandan's envoy is about that time.

70
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,770
We'll be very busy.

71
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,220
I know.

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,810
But I think

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,720
Sima Qi took the tally.

74
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,520
He has the initiative now.

75
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,390
Just because Yandan's envoy will come,

76
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,070
he will think twice and won't make any move.

77
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,910
-Yan...
-Someone is here.

78
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,590
City Lord.

79
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,910
What kind of etiquette is this?

80
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,300
This is rare.

81
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,190
Fengyao City's two young talents

82
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,310
in literature and martial arts

83
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,590
are both here today.

84
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,590
Good.

85
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,430
I dare not compare myself to Mr. Yuan.

86
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,950
You were brilliant and passionate back then.

87
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,470
But now, you're helping the evil do bad things.

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,750
Mr. Yuan, you've become more clear-minded.

89
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,020
I'm not like you, Mr. Sima.

90
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,170
You're worried about the country and the people in the court.

91
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,630
But in private,

92
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,330
who knows how many tricks you've played?

93
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,010
Who is the evil? What bad things?

94
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,200
Mr. Sima, you don't even want

95
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,510
to pretend to be loyal now?

96
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,030
I... always hate hypocrisy.

97
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,550
Really?

98
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,490
Then please remember, Mr. Sima,

99
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,240
as long as I hold this position,

100
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,960
you will be shackled by me.

101
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,910
Guards!

102
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,840
-Yes!
-Yes!

103
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,710
Punish him!

104
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,750
Damn City Lord, just you wait!

105
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,510
Luckily, no one has seen me.

106
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,380
Otherwise...

107
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,480
Isn't this Grand Commander Sima?

108
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,090
I heard he offended City Lord.

109
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,990
He's standing here as punishment.

110
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,020
Tell you what, from a distance,

111
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,420
I'd think he's here receiving guests.

112
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,360
City Lord, don't you think you've gone too far?

113
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,130
Sima Qi will take revenge.

114
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,610
How?

115
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,830
He wants to kill me anyway.

116
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,550
What's the big deal about making a fool of him?

117
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,750
Reward those two maids generously later.

118
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,990
I can't do anything about him now.

119
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,150
But now, he doesn't dare to do anything to me either.

120
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,950
The most important thing now is

121
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,090
to find Zhuo Tian's leader

122
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,240
and meet them.

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,520
Mother will be busy with Yandan's matter tomorrow.

124
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,340
She won't keep an eye on me the whole time.

125
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,320
But my identity can't be exposed now.

126
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,720
What should I do to conceal it?

127
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,490
Go meet them 30 minutes before the banquet.

128
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,830
All the officials will be in the mansion by that time.

129
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:44,980
Right.

130
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,480
Meet them in Wangjiang Pavilion.

131
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,600
It has an open view, making it perfect for a private conversation.

132
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,540
That makes sense.

133
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,560
Somehow,

134
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,630
I have a sense of foreboding.

135
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,909
Your sense of foreboding is about to come true.

136
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,070
I hope we can meet successfully tomorrow.

137
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,710
By the way,

138
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,590
open an umbrella for Sima Qi.

139
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,270
Don't let the sun fry his brain.

140
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,420
Don't tell him it's my order.

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,130
Mr. Sima.

142
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,480
[See you in Wangjiang Pavilion at 3 p.m.]

143
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,830
What?

144
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,250
Zhuo Tian's leader

145
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,310
is Sima Qi?

146
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,550
We humiliated him yesterday.

147
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,549
I'm doomed.

148
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,600
I've meticulously funded

149
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,140
this organization for so many years.

150
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,870
But now, a humiliation has made everything I did in vain.

151
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,740
If I give him more money,

152
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,220
will he cool down?

153
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,630
No. Get up.

154
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,110
Let's go explain to him.

155
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,150
Calm down.

156
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,380
How can I calm down?

157
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,030
If this continues, he'll hold deeper grudges.

158
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,190
Then all the money we donated

159
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,780
will be in vain!

160
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,470
When there's a problem,

161
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
just put it aside.

162
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,220
If I'm lucky,

163
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,050
I'll die tomorrow.

164
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,720
City Lord!

165
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
You're right.

166
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,430
Officials, I'll drink with you.

167
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,240
How come the sponsor didn't ask for a meeting today?

168
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,210
Did something happen?

169
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,490
And how come Seventh Princess

170
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,940
is not here?

171
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,340
Mr. Sima, I'll drink with you.

172
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,400
Gosh!

173
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,140
Has Sima Qi noticed something amiss?

174
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,510
What's so enjoyable about just drinking?

175
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,960
The musical performance is really boring.

176
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,950
How about this?

177
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Let me show you a set of whip techniques.

178
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,670
You...

179
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,540
Since you're in the mood, go ahead.
