00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,880
[Episode 19]

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,680
You speak thoughtlessly and inauspiciously.

3
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,000
This whole thing should be called the Lady Dowager's plot,

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,440
not death news.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,830
So,

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,270
when do you plan to tell the City Lord

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,740
about the Lady Dowager's plot?

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,110
Why didn't you tell me?

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,220
You guys talk. I'll leave.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,480
Why didn't you tell me?

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,670
Because while you were in a coma,

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,760
I thought a lot.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,240
And also,

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,510
you've been inciting me to usurp the throne.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,650
So...

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,760
So,

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,580
you actually don't want to be the City Lord, do you?

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,370
So?

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,800
So, we can take this chance to fake our death and escape.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,300
We can run away from the capital, be far from the court,

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,080
and have your freedom back.

22
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,470
And what about you?

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,030
Me?

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,830
You want to escape from the capital alone,

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,729
traveling the world?

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,789
-Take me with you.
-What kind of person do you want to be?

27
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,420
Someone who cares for the world and the people

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,940
and who takes the world as his responsibility—

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,680
that's you.

30
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,509
Sima Qi,

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,060
listen carefully.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,660
I don't want you

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,850
to live a life of mediocrity

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,450
and give up your future because of me.

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,350
Sima Qi,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,840
can you find some time

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,350
to treat your hyperopia?

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,710
Sima Qi, look at me.

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,380
You can wait until I establish myself in the position of City Lord,

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,200
then usurp the throne.

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,950
Why do we let Lady Dowager take advantage?

43
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,820
But the situation is out of control.

45
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,470
We...

46
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,829
It's just a few difficulties.

47
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,390
But difficulties are meant to be overcome.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,970
We will find a way.

49
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:50,930
Yes.

50
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,930
Difficulties are meant to be overcome.

51
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,210
We can do it!

52
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,210
Have you found a way yet?

53
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,410
No.

54
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,070
They underestimated the difficulties.

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,900
Tomorrow is my funeral ceremony.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,770
Wait.

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,760
Why does that sound so weird?

58
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,090
Dinner is ready.

59
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,570
Have some food.

60
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,450
Stop worrying.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,420
Your brain doesn't work on an empty stomach.

62
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,610
Let's eat first.

63
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,490
So,

64
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,990
I just need to prove

65
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,010
that the child isn't mine

66
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,880
and that he doesn't have the Feng family's bloodline, right?

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,020
Yes.

68
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,400
But how do you prove his bloodline?

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,019
It seems like we've hit a dead end again.

70
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,279
Mother is really good at playing the political game.

71
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,700
How can I prove the bloodline?

72
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,650
But I'm a woman.

73
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,370
How could I have a child with Qiang Wei?

74
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,970
If she pushes me too far,

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,950
I'll reveal my gender and drag her down with me.

76
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,730
What did you just say?

77
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
I said my mother is good at playing the political game.

78
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,490
You said you'd reveal your gender.

79
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,320
Yes.

80
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,409
Bloodline is hard to prove,

81
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,730
but it's easy to prove that I'm a woman.

82
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,970
It's just that,

83
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,840
by then, both the Lady Dowager and I will have to die.

84
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,960
No.

85
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,690
How would you die?

86
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,320
You are now the only unquestionable heir

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,610
of the Feng bloodline.

88
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,950
Do you remember who founded Fengyao City?

89
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
My grandfather.

90
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,510
Think carefully.

91
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,320
Why was Fengyao City

92
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,890
named "Fengyao" when it was founded?

93
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,040
Because my ancestor who conquered this city back then

94
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,860
was a female commander.

95
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,370
And she was the one who founded Fengyao City.

96
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,760
But just before the grand coronation,

97
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,770
she suddenly died.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,130
So her brother,

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,690
my grandfather, succeeded her.

100
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,150
Because it was too rushed,

101
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,810
they didn't even have a male dragon robe that day.

102
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,930
I know where the phoenix robe for the coronation is.

103
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,250
Are you saying...

104
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Feng Yi,

105
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,480
it was you who told me

106
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,960
not to be constrained by my identity.

107
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,010
Why can't a woman be the City Lord?

108
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,570
Me?

109
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,770
Can...

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,360
Can I do it?

111
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,650
You can. Of course you can.

112
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,120
I think Sima Qi was right.

113
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,330
Who says a woman can't rule the world?

114
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,260
Besides,

115
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,580
you've been the City Lord for so many years already.

116
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,980
It's just a hat.

117
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,320
Who doesn't wear many hats?

118
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,950
You can put one on, so you can also take it off.

119
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,520
Feng Yi, can you do it?

120
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
I can do it.

121
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,610
Yes.

122
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,070
I told you not to be constrained by your identity,

123
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,520
yet I am bound by the biggest identity of all.

124
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,370
You're right.

125
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,630
Who says the City Lord can't be a woman?

126
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,440
That's great.

127
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm glad you've come round.

128
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,860
As long as you wear the phoenix robe

129
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,760
and reveal your true identity during the ruler's funeral,

130
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,050
everything will fall into place.

131
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,170
The only problem now

132
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,320
is manpower.

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,130
We can't go there alone.

134
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,890
Yes.

135
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,770
But where can we get the manpower?

136
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,570
The Yuan family can help the City Lord.

137
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,360
Yuan Qingheng?

138
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,280
You saw the message Sima Qi left for you?

139
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,159
What are you doing?

140
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,140
The City Lord's wife has committed a serious crime.

141
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,800
I came to atone for her.

142
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
Nanfeng, I'm here.

143
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,409
It has been so many years,

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,690
and you still keep it.

145
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,520
It has been so many years, and I still like you.

146
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,320
Nanfeng, what did you say?

147
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,450
Do you know how happy I was when I found out

148
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,410
you were coming to propose?

149
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,210
You were just two hours late,

150
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,230
and the Lady Dowager had already designated me as the City Lord's wife.

151
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,200
It's alright.

152
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,190
My feelings for you have never changed.

153
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,570
Me too.

154
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
And I'm about to be free.

155
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,780
Nanfeng,

156
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,210
tell me,

157
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,289
what have you done?

158
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,820
Qingheng,

159
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,880
I did something bad to the City Lord. What should I do?

160
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,909
It's okay.

161
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,610
I'll atone with you.

162
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,640
Trust me.

163
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,040
As long as she redeems herself, I will forgive Yue Nanfeng.

164
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,820
Thank you, City Lord.

165
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,420
Sit.

166
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,250
After I received the news yesterday, I thought about it all night.

167
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,940
Sima Qi has private troops,

168
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,650
and the Yuan family is an ancient noble family.

169
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,750
By then,

170
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
we can disperse Sima Qi's private troops

171
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,150
and have them mix in with the officials to enter the palace.

172
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,600
When the City Lord calls out,

173
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,920
as long as we can withstand the Lady Dowager's assassination attempt,

174
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,850
we won't lose.

175
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,040
About tomorrow's funeral,

176
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,940
let's plan it thoroughly.

177
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,570
-I'm a stupid general?
-Stop!

178
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,610
You're just a stupid scholar!

179
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,850
How's the discussion going?

180
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,660
We were discussing

181
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,420
how to turn tomorrow's funeral

182
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,480
into a welcoming ceremony.

183
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,540
Are we going with my idea or yours?

184
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,790
My shadow guard team has over twenty people.

185
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
Twenty?

186
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,800
Your vase looks quite pretty.

187
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,370
Right?

188
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,780
I didn't like the one in my room before.

189
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,050
And the last time I assassinated Mr. Qin,

190
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,530
I saw this one in the hall downstairs.

191
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,580
I thought it was quite pretty.

192
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,040
You were there that day?

193
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,220
Well...

194
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,530
Yes.

195
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,720
Downstairs in the hall?

196
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,190
Downstairs in the hall?

197
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,090
Downstairs in the hall!

198
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,040
-The tally?
-The tally?

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,850
I never expected

200
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,140
that the small deviation this time

201
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,340
would turn out to be so wonderful!

202
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,370
I'm not dead yet,

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,150
and you are crying for me.

204
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,970
Do you really want to send me off for real?

205
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,010
City Lord, you're alive?

206
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,470
Heaven showed us its blessings. Fengyao is truly fortunate!

207
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,010
Yes.

208
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,860
Kneel down and welcome the City Lord!

209
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,050
Wait.

210
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,090
Ridiculous.

211
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,470
The former City Lord is dead.

212
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,080
This person is an impostor.

213
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,470
His intention is sinister,

214
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,590
attempting to deceive us.

215
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,280
Anyone who colludes with the enemy will be executed without mercy!

216
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,260
Lady Dowager, are you losing your vision in your old age?

217
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,290
You can't recognize me,

218
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,190
but you can at least recognize the object, can't you?

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,400
This is the tally.

220
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,330
Imperial Guards!

221
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,650
Yes!

222
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,100
Sorry for being late to save you, My Lord.

223
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,130
Grand Commander Zuo,

224
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,170
do you recognize this tally?

225
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,640
There's another one?

226
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,290
Impossible.

227
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,530
Zhang Dequan.

228
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,150
What?

229
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,580
Why are there so many of them?

230
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,940
They are all real.

231
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,330
How is that possible?

232
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,910
Wait.

233
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,200
These tallies are all fake.

234
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,870
If you don't believe me, look at the right corner of the tallies.

235
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,920
Is the character "Yi" carved there?

236
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,170
This is "Yi"?

237
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,240
That must be a scratch.

238
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,610
Sima Qi,

239
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,600
you'd better keep quiet.

240
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,490
The most skilled craftsman in the capital has the surname "Yi."

241
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,240
All his work

242
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,630
is carved with his surname.

243
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,850
Grand Commander Zuo,

244
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,060
the Lady Dowager is fooling you.

245
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,370
Archers, ready!

246
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,610
Wait!

247
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,250
It looks like I have to reveal a secret.

248
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,710
Actually, I'm a woman.

249
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,700
You...

250
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,050
You...

251
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
You are a woman?

252
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,960
A woman?

253
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,210
Why didn't we know this before?

254
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,420
Eighteen years ago, the late City Lord passed away with no sons,

255
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,370
so, as his unborn child, I had to be male.

256
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
However, whether male or female,

257
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,430
I am still the late City Lord's child.

258
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,760
But I am a woman.

259
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,370
The child in Qiang Wei's womb

260
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,810
cannot be mine,

261
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,090
nor can it have the Feng family's bloodline.

262
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,010
Grand Commander.

263
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,090
Grand Commander Zuo,

264
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,940
you and the late City Lord shared 30 years of loyalty between ruler and subject.

265
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,690
Can you bear

266
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,830
to see his bloodline end here?

267
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,810
Nonsense!

268
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,210
She's an impostor!

269
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,450
Hurry! Shoot!

270
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,130
Lady Dowager,

271
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,210
Qiang Wei is in my hands.

272
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,160
You...
