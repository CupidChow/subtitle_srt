00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,910
[Episode 3]

2
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,110
What do you want?

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,870
Look! Shooting stars!

4
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,390
After her!

5
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,430
Sima Qi?

6
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,690
Where is she?

7
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,710
Go take a look over there!

8
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,850
You are...

9
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,730
Sima Qi has hyperopia.

10
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,120
I don't think he can recognize me.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,430
Why is he picking up his sword?

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,900
Calm down. I'll make up a good story for you.

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,670
I'm... Seventh Princess.

14
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,580
Seventh Princess?

15
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,360
Today is the Lantern Festival.

16
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,820
I snuck out to have fun.

17
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,270
Sorry for being rude.

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,940
I have hyperopia.

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,500
I almost mistook you for someone else.

20
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,650
Seventh Princess, please forgive me.

21
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,420
Thank God.

22
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,550
You must have mistaken me for City Lord,

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,990
since we look so alike.

24
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,590
Mr. Sima, thank you

25
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,260
for saving me just now.

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,910
As for what happened just now, I will...

27
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,700
Take responsibility?

28
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,150
No need for that.

29
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,630
Don't take it to heart.

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,829
I'll adjust my clothes.

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,710
Luckily, I'm smart.

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,950
Earlier this month,

33
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,120
Lady Dowager showed her intention of bestowing marriage

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,870
on me and Seventh Princess

35
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,370
in an attempt to win me over. So it's her.

36
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,950
I... should get going.

37
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,560
Princess.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:46,680
Princess.

39
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,310
She's there!

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,670
Princess.

41
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,310
Why are they chasing you?

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,820
What else could it be? They want to rob me.

43
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,700
Step back.

44
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,470
Let me handle them.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,840
Be careful!

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,040
Was she trying to save me just now?

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,470
My head hurts so much.

48
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,790
Was I...

49
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,680
worried about Sima Qi just now?

50
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,170
Princess,

51
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,590
I got your wallet back.

52
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,370
Are you okay?

53
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,190
I'm fine. I should go back to the palace now.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,750
These candies...

55
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:03,800
Wait!

56
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Princess.

57
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,590
May I ask

58
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,100
where you got the candies?

59
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,940
These are my...

60
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,159
Princess!

61
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,120
I've spent so many years looking for her, but I couldn't find her.

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,840
She has the candies.

63
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,430
Could it be she's the one?

64
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,480
What...

65
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,670
are you doing?

66
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,100
She doesn't seem to remember me.

67
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,270
Princess, going back to the palace drunk

68
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,810
might damage your reputation.

69
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,330
So... I brought you to my house to rest for a while.

70
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,810
I'm going to get you some hangover soup.

71
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,000
The tally, I'm coming for you.

72
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,080
Where is it?

73
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,260
Why did you get up on your own?

74
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,560
I have an idea.

75
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,720
Let's go.

76
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,670
Princess.

77
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,000
When it stops snowing,

78
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,350
let me send you back.

79
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,190
Set sail with the wind in March.

80
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,440
Peach blossoms fall all over the ground in the capital.

81
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,210
Heaven has its return, but Earth doesn't.

82
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,680
Drink warm porridge, put on more clothes, and don't wander outside.

83
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,510
So you are Seventh Princess.

84
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,530
So you've always been around me.

85
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,100
The tally's whereabouts is unknown.

86
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,100
Sima Qi is a big threat.

87
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,770
The situation is so dire now.

88
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,060
No.

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
I need to meet Zhuo Tian's leader as soon as possible

90
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,210
to devise a strategy.
