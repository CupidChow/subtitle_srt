00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,960
[Episode 8]

2
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,780
You just fell asleep.

3
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,690
The City Lord's Mansion is ahead.

4
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,990
I'll take you back.

5
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,940
Sima Qi,

6
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,890
are you really not going to usurp the throne?

7
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,790
My Lord,

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,150
I am willing to follow your lead.

9
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,240
[East Gate]

10
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,130
My Lord, where have you been?

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,390
I've finally found you.

12
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,590
Let's talk when we get back.

13
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,470
Okay. Let's go.

14
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,030
Mao.

15
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,060
My Lord.

16
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,539
Check where the City Lord was during the last Lantern Festival

17
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,150
and whether he was in the City Lord's Mansion or not.

18
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,030
Is this related to usurping the throne?

19
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,230
Just do it.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:22,990
My Lord,

21
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,310
Sima Qi knows you're the benefactor behind the scenes now?

22
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
I think...

23
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,480
we both misunderstood Sima Qi.

24
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,460
He is completely loyal.

25
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,810
He's a good official.

26
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,390
My Lord, are you alright?

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
You weren't like this before you left.

28
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:48,970
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,050
I'm fine.

30
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,710
I just think

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,950
Sima Qi is quite a good person.

32
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,110
Give Sima Qi an umbrella.

33
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,190
Don't let the sun fry his brain.

34
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,550
Don't tell him it's my order.

35
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,710
Let's talk when we get back.

36
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,230
City Lord,

37
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,680
you... you must prioritize the people of the city.

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,070
What exactly is he trying to say?

39
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,860
Be happy.

40
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,130
So it was you all along.

41
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,860
But why is it you?

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,720
I've finally found you.

43
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,540
But you're the City Lord.

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,770
What can I do?

45
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,640
My Lord!

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Why are you dressed like this in my chambers?

47
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,310
My Lord, please forgive me.

48
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,340
I didn't mean to.

49
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,150
Get up.

50
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,390
You may leave.

51
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,790
My Lord.

52
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,680
Seriously?

53
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,030
Yuan Qingheng could really go this far?

54
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,220
My Lord,

55
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,860
I'm just concerned about you.

56
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,660
What is...

57
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,300
What is this pink powder?

58
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,060
My Lord.

59
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,790
My Lord,

60
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,440
I've been admiring you for a long time.

61
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,390
Please grant me your favor for once.

62
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,630
My Lord!

63
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,110
Feng Yi didn't expect that

64
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,560
the amount of exercise she did today would meet the standard in this way.

65
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,610
My Lord!

66
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
My Lord!

67
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,190
I was so scared.

68
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,840
I finally made it out.

69
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,670
Luckily, I had spare clothes at the palace gate.

70
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,190
Ms. Feng?

71
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,810
Ms. Feng, why are you here?

72
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,530
Jiyue?

73
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,350
Jiyue, help me.

74
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,930
I think I've been drugged.

75
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,510
Hurry and find me a doctor.

76
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,630
No need to find a doctor.

77
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,950
My family has been in the medical profession for generations.

78
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,680
I'll check you out.

79
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,110
What's wrong?

80
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,260
Do you mind if we come in to take your pulse?

81
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,520
A doctor smiling isn't terrifying,

82
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,810
but a doctor frowning is truly terrifying.

83
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,159
Physician Lin,

84
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,070
is there something wrong with me?

85
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,870
Open your mouth.

86
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,750
Has anyone tampered with your food recently?

87
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,340
Well…

88
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,560
At my place,

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,110
from the raw ingredients to the cooked dishes,

90
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,750
and finally to my mouth,

91
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,030
it passed through at least 20 people.

92
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,290
It was like a sieve, full of holes.

93
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,910
I don't know if anyone tampered with it.

94
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,830
Your house is that big?

95
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,790
Listen to me.

96
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,230
You've been poisoned by a chronic toxin called Zhiman.

97
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,990
Although you haven't been poisoned for long,

98
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,539
if it continues over a longer period,

99
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,809
you're certain to die in two years.

100
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,710
Certain to die?

101
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,170
Moreover, this toxin is very difficult for outsiders to diagnose.

102
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,880
What's worse is that

103
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,510
it can only be cured with a herbal bath.

104
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,270
A herbal bath?

105
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,110
Well, I'll go and prescribe the medicine for you.

106
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,730
Who poisoned me?

107
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,750
Say it again. What did you do?

108
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,070
Well, it was not entirely my fault.

109
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,290
I only found out about it last night.

110
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,110
Someone in the organization turned the head chef of the Imperial Kitchen,

111
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,590
and he immediately poisoned the City Lord.

112
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,660
He thought he had made a great contribution,

113
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,510
so he reported it to me.

114
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,230
Don't you oversee your people's actions?

115
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,070
When it comes to power...

116
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,780
I'm just a flag

117
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
they need.

118
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,310
So,

119
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,990
you're also just a puppet?

120
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,380
Why would a puppet make things hard for another puppet?

121
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,130
I'm already miserable enough.

122
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,270
How about having a cup of tea?

123
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,150
There's something worse.

124
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,410
This poison can only be cured with a herbal bath.

125
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,910
But there is no bath here.

126
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,300
Am I really going to die from this poison?

127
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,040
No need.

128
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,030
I have it. I have it.
