00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,960
[Episode 16]

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,310
Then...

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,310
may I ask

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,620
what you want to do?

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,110
Or...

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,300
what do you dare to do?

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:32,710
I...

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,950
I want...

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,760
to...

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,870
set off...

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,720
fireworks with you.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,230
Let's go.

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:02,910
Let's go.

14
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,230
A guard just reported that

15
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,310
they found a mark

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,590
left by Mr. Sima in the forest.

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,150
Then what are we waiting for?

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,440
Let's go find them now.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,230
Take good care of Master and Nanfeng.

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,130
Especially Nanfeng.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,590
When it's time,

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,550
remind her to take the medicine.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,590
Yes, My Lord.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,450
This is it.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
Close your eyes.

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,820
Guess what I found here.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
What is it?

28
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,680
Imagine

29
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,840
what fireworks are like first.

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,840
Fireworks... must be colorful.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,070
Then imagine

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
where fireworks bloom

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,090
and where they fly to.

34
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,530
Are you stupid, Sima Qi?

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,329
Fireworks must bloom in the sky

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,300
and fly to a place of freedom.

37
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,040
If only

38
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,950
people were like fireworks.

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,000
I would rather bloom briefly

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,220
than live like a puppet.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,110
Turn around.

42
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,960
Three.

43
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,500
Two.

44
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,410
One.

45
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,530
Open your eyes.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,650
Fireworks! It's really fireworks!

47
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,330
Look!

48
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,990
Do you like it?

49
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,350
My Lord.

50
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,990
Call my name.

51
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,450
Feng Yi.

52
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,790
Sima Qi,

53
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:47,990
you and I...

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,840
have become us.

55
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,650
Sima Qi.

56
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,510
I love you.

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,590
I love you too.

58
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,750
You know what?

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,530
You saved me.

60
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,820
Your appearance made me realize

61
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,230
there are sincere people

62
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,340
like you in this world.

63
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,190
Your encouragement has helped me face everything bravely

64
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,310
and stopped me from complaining.

65
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,550
Because of you,

66
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,870
I started to believe in myself.

67
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,500
It feels so good.

68
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,570
Thank you for appearing in my life.

69
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,159
Feng Yi,

70
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,180
you know what?

71
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,150
Actually, you are my salvation.

72
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,100
Without you,

73
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,170
I wouldn't have become who I am.

74
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,400
Do you admit your mistake?

75
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,500
But Father,

76
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,950
everyone knows

77
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,010
Lady Dowager has been attending to state affairs!

78
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,260
Her behavior goes against Fengyao's law!

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,130
How dare you quibble!

80
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,560
Politics are not something you young people can discuss.

81
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,290
And you are incorrigible.

82
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,150
You and those young people

83
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,230
chant every day,

84
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,910
"a woman is in power,

85
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,070
and Fengyao is doomed."

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,030
Have you considered my feelings?

87
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,180
Everyone bears responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation!

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,130
You're insufferable.

89
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,400
I asked you to stand on the street as punishment last night.

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,830
Looks like the punishment was not severe enough!

91
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,670
Don't go out again

92
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,940
and don't cause trouble.

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,470
According to the Sima family's rules,

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
if you can defeat me with our family's swordsmanship,

95
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,510
I'll let you make your own decisions!

96
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,690
Mr. Sima,

97
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,040
why don't you stop practicing?

98
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,060
Go away.

99
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,810
We'll meet.

100
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,940
We won't meet.

101
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,970
I don't know when we'll meet again.

102
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,600
With each candy I eat, there will be fewer left.

103
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,890
Right.

104
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,610
I can start with another one.

105
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,110
We'll meet.

106
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,350
We won't meet.

107
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,430
We'll meet.

108
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,680
Will we meet again?

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,630
Feng Yi.

110
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,390
I've been looking for you.

111
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,350
I know.

112
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,170
My Lord!

113
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,130
My Lord! I finally... found you.

114
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,020
Why... Why...

115
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,480
Why...

116
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,540
Why are you wearing women's clothes?

117
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,510
Calm down.

118
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,300
Let me make up a story for you.

119
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,680
Show your complaints through the bullet-screen comments.

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,910
Forget it, My Lord.

121
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,550
No need to make up a story.

122
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,920
I... I...

123
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,280
I... I accept it.

124
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,500
We should go back now.

125
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,240
Xiuxiu! Where are you? Xiuxiu!

126
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,770
Your Majesty,

127
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,630
bad news.

128
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,850
The assassins failed

129
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,180
to kill Yue Chenyi,

130
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,820
Yue Nanfeng's father.

131
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,190
What?

132
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,010
A team of killers

133
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,270
couldn't even take care of

134
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,130
a defenseless scholar?

135
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,720
They're so useless.

136
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,530
Exactly.

137
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,320
Right,

138
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,080
the one sent to follow Feng Yi was also left behind.

139
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,780
I'm afraid something might go wrong with the matter concerning military provisions.

140
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,800
I guess I'll have to use that trump card.

141
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,790
Yi,

142
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,310
since Mr. Qin died suddenly,

143
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,070
you've left me no choice.

144
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,560
Your Majesty,

145
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,560
he who hesitates is lost.

146
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,050
Concerning the city lord, proceed according to the original plan.

147
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,810
Yes.

148
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,240
As for the Yue Family...

149
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,750
The wolves I raised have become

150
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,090
more ambitious.

151
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,770
Instead of teaching them again,

152
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,520
why don't I just raise another batch?

153
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,880
Your Majesty, that's a wise decision.
