00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,860
[Episode 1]

2
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,430
Once upon a time, there was a city

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,870
called Fengyao.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,320
Its City Lord had 8 daughters.

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,830
Finally, on his deathbed,

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,740
a son was born

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,750
to inherit the title of City Lord.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,270
However, no one but the Lady Dowager knew

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,780
that this Young Lord was actually a woman.

10
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,430
Who says a woman disguised as a male City Lord

11
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,750
has to live a miserable life?

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,190
I have power and influence,

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,280
so I can do whatever I want.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,370
Outrageous!

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,780
Only when a man desires little and remains untempted by material things

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,030
can he walk the righteous path.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,330
Despite your noble status,

18
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,740
you forcibly brought me here.

19
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,070
Do you know I work for your mother?

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,510
Aren't you afraid

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,830
I'll report this to her?

22
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,039
You've neglected my guest.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,950
My Lord.

24
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,110
Since that's the case...

25
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,920
Could it be this old man has no interest in women?

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,400
Then I shall humbly oblige.

27
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,430
Actually, Feng Yi didn't expect

28
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,229
that the honey trap would work.

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,630
Thank you.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,570
It should have been like this long ago.

31
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,700
Since you're here, make yourself comfortable.

32
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,430
I invited you here today

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,889
for one reason.

34
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,110
You haven't had the time to send the confidential package

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,790
my mother gave you this morning out of the city yet, have you?

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,170
Mr. Qin!

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,079
What...

38
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,470
What are you doing?

39
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,290
Given my position,

40
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,900
the contents of this confidential package

41
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,030
should be mine.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,640
Move! Move!

43
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,280
Move!

44
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,240
Move!

45
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,710
Bravo! Bravo!

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,710
Bravo! Bravo!

47
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,030
Are you okay?

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,580
Honey, are you okay?

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,430
Did you get scared?

50
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,870
Move! Move!

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,180
Mom, when I grow up, I want to be the Grand Commander too.

52
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,520
What do you want?

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,150
What?

54
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,190
What's going on?

55
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,070
I don't know.

56
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,830
He's dead! He's dead!

57
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,350
He's dead!

58
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,970
He's dead!

59
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,740
No way. Mr. Qin died suddenly?

60
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,950
Mr. Qin.

61
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,800
Mr. Qin, I didn't mean it.

62
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,830
I just wanted to find something.

63
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,510
-I...
-Freeze.

64
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,310
You assassinated Mr. Qin.

65
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,510
You should be executed on sight.

66
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,390
Mr. Sima,

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,020
it's me.

68
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,980
How dare you move?

69
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,760
Sima Qi, Grand Commander of the Xiaoqi Guard!

70
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,740
Yes!

71
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,880
This is what they call professional instinct.

72
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,660
Is Sima Qi's farsightedness really this serious?

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,670
Since you recognized me, then…

74
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:36,930
Guards!

75
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,750
Yes!

76
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,530
Kill him on sight!

77
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,460
Sima Qi, why are you rebelling?

78
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,990
What do you think?

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,120
Long live the City Lord!

80
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,430
You may rise.

81
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,070
Thank you, City Lord.

82
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,840
City Lord, the people of Huainan are insatiable.

83
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,840
It's useless to provide disaster relief now.

84
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,980
Please send troops to suppress them.

85
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,030
Okay.

86
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,500
Approved, approved.

87
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,740
But this is a serious matter.

88
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,920
The ministers are endlessly arguing over this.

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,260
You.

90
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,870
You look pretty.

91
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,360
Everyone, listen to him.

92
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,870
Dismiss.

93
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,390
Stupid City Lord. That's absurd.

94
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,030
The City Lord has already met with a group of ministers today

95
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,409
and won't be seeing you.

96
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,850
Grand Commander, please leave.

97
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,510
There's been severe flooding in Huainan.

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,590
The disaster victims are starving

99
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,180
and waiting for the court's relief grain.

100
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,270
Yet, the City Lord actually sent troops to suppress them!

101
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,970
Absurd!

102
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,600
My Lord, watch your words.

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,870
Feng Yi, you are absurd.

104
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,120
I swear to use your life and the Lady Dowager's

105
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,640
as a sacrifice to the world!

106
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,270
Over these years, I've done too many absurd things.

107
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,870
Leave us.

108
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,890
Now!

109
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,750
Bravo! Bravo!

110
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,800
Amazing!

111
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,470
Bravo!

112
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,430
Gosh.

113
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,740
I need to think of a way out.

114
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,150
Whose gold is this?

115
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,510
Money!

116
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,030
A lot of money!

117
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,950
Don't push me!

118
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,990
Don't push!

119
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,909
My money! My money!

120
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,820
Stop pushing!

121
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,610
Give it back to me!

122
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,190
Give it back to me!

123
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,670
Everything went smoothly.

124
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,030
Perfect. I'll do it.

125
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,990
Whose gold is this?

126
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,340
What?

127
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,590
To disperse the chasing team by exploiting the people's greed,

128
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,550
you should have thrown the gold on the ground.

129
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,310
Why didn't this go as I expected?

130
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,170
Go!

131
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,430
Watch me repeat my old trick.

132
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,640
You may rise.

133
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,240
Thank you, City Lord.

134
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,810
Greetings, City Lord.

135
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,700
Thanks to the Grand Commander's professional instinct.

136
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,060
Mr. Sima intends to rebel.

137
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,310
Guards!

138
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,160
Forgive me, City Lord.

139
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,080
My poor eyesight and eagerness to solve the case

140
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,020
made me overlook the situation. That's why I…

141
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,130
Yes.

142
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,560
Yes, we can prove that

143
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,700
Mr. Sima has poor eyesight. He has always been...

144
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,520
blind.

145
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,950
Boastful.

146
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,330
Brazen.

147
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,980
And a breaker of the law.

148
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,070
Anyway, Mr. Sima is a good official.

149
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,260
Please forgive him.

150
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,800
Please forgive me.

151
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,360
Sima Qi,

152
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,820
just you wait.

153
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,300
City Lord,

154
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,660
I heard that Mr. Qin died unexpectedly at a music house.

155
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,580
Are you alright?

156
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,110
City Lord?

157
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,990
Qing, you've come at the perfect time.

158
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,290
Help me think

159
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,230
where I hid that jar of aged wine

160
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,910
from Persia's tribute last time.

161
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,710
Hurry up.

162
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,230
Help me find it.

163
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,850
At a time like this,

164
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,390
how can you still be in the mood for drinking?

165
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,540
How did Mr. Qin die, and why?

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,640
Was our plan exploited by others?

167
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,870
Is someone trying to frame you,

168
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,980
or have we fallen into a trap?

169
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,100
Why aren't you worried at all?

170
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,710
I found it.

171
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,550
Qing, come here.

172
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,010
Didn't you say

173
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,910
this jar of wine was meant for celebrating our success?

174
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,870
Did our plan work?

175
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,110
Did we get the tally?

176
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,420
The tally?

177
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,540
Quite the opposite.

178
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,740
Sima Qi wants to usurp the throne.
