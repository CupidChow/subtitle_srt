00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,910
[Episode 2]

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,070
Did our plan work?

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,270
Did we get the tally?

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,630
The tally?

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,020
Quite the opposite.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,900
Sima Qi wants to usurp the throne.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,070
Sima Qi,

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,190
the new Grand Commander of the Xiaoqi Guard

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,980
Our City Defense Grand Commander is attempting to usurp the throne.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,940
You heard it right.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,760
City Lord Feng Yi has been funding an organization.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,550
Here is the thing.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,910
Three years ago,

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,910
after I came of age,

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,550
the Lady Dowager prepared a stand-in

16
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,060
to consummate my marriage on my behalf,

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,150
intending to eliminate me

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,350
after the young City Lord was born.

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,230
I was trapped in a perilous situation.

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,470
At this point, you said:

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,430
"City Lord, I understand that

22
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,190
you're currently powerless to stop the Lady Dowager from plotting against loyal ministers,

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,350
and that your life is in danger.

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,580
But the more dire the situation, the less you should give up!"

25
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,590
Just when I was feeling helpless and desperate, you suggested:

26
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,110
"Why not start building your own forces?

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,700
That way,

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,990
you'll have a chance to stand against the Lady Dowager

29
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,150
and restore stability to the people."

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,060
At this moment,

31
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,450
I saw hope again.

32
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,500
You are right.

33
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,090
One payment per issue. This is the 35th issue.

34
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,100
The organization has got news that

35
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,830
the Lady Dowager will soon hand over the tally

36
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,150
to Mr. Qin and have him send it out of the city.

37
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,310
He will be assisting the Yue Family

38
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,070
in privately resolving the issue of embezzling military grain.

39
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,310
It's a rare opportunity for the tally to be taken from the City Lord's Mansion for the first time.

40
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,750
If you can get the tally at the city gate,

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,150
you will gain military authority

42
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,390
and stage an immediate rebellion.

43
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,830
Yes.

44
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,590
If Sima Qi usurps the throne,

45
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,380
won't all my plans

46
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,780
be ruined?

47
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,700
Do you think the organization we sponsored

48
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,350
can kill Sima Qi?

49
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,150
City Lord.

50
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,910
Three years ago,

51
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,500
I asked you to find the most promising organization

52
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,950
and handpick key candidates for cultivation.

53
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,780
How could you have overlooked Sima Qi?

54
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,340
That's my case-dough!

55
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,070
I've sponsored it for three years!

56
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,190
Three years!

57
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,510
My Lord, we found nothing.

58
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,310
Now, the plan to intercept Mr. Qin and seize the tally

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,340
has been ruined by the City Lord.

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,230
Your desire to kill the City Lord is becoming clear,

61
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,110
and Mr. Qin suddenly died. What if

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,710
Lady Dowager takes advantage of it...

63
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,940
Don't worry.

64
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,070
The coroner has confirmed that

65
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,590
Mr. Qin died of an accidental stroke.

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,980
The Lady Dowager has no evidence and won't dare to act rashly.

67
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,860
But what if...

68
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,110
If something unexpected happens,

69
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,670
just give this memorial to the Minister

70
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,670
and ask him to submit it.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,110
The floods in Huainan have left the disaster victims starving,

72
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,230
and they're waiting for the 10,000 bushels of relief grain

73
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,380
mentioned in my memorial.

74
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,100
Have you arranged everything?

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,310
You...

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,790
Any problems?

77
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,430
I've arranged everything.

78
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,579
But My Lord,

79
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,840
we're focused on disaster relief, helping the people;

80
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,560
why do we still have to send money to corrupt officials?

81
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,400
That's a question for our City Lord.

82
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,670
The three-year drought in Suizhou;

83
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,750
the Yellow River flooding every year;

84
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,340
and the people living in misery;

85
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,590
this position of City Lord

86
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,940
can no longer be manipulated by Lady Dowager and City Lord.

87
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,300
At this moment, Mao thought through

88
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,310
all the sorrowful matters.

89
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,200
Should we do it in advance?

90
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,110
Has the tally...

91
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,180
If he had found the tally,

92
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,820
the City Lord's Mansion would have sent people by now.

93
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,450
Feng Yi and the Lady Dowager have already grown suspicious of each other,

94
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,230
and the General Zuo of the Palace Guards is loyally stubborn,

95
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,350
following the tally without recognizing people.

96
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,720
Send more people

97
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,720
to search the music house.

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,670
Got it?

99
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,390
Otherwise, once the case is transferred to the the capital office tomorrow,

100
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,220
it will be very difficult for us to search.

101
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,940
We must find the tally this time.

102
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,270
By then,

103
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,880
when I seize the world,

104
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,190
I'll use Lady Dowager and the incompetent Emperor Feng Yi...

105
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,570
They probably didn't see it at this distance.

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,330
I'll use Lady Dowager and Feng...

107
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll use Lady Dowager and the incompetent Emperor Feng Yi

108
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,270
for a blood sacrifice to the world.

109
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,030
The world.

110
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,350
Blood sacrifice to the world!

111
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,420
The world!

112
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,900
Actually, Sima Qi's usurping of the throne

113
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,170
is not that scary.

114
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,580
I have a solution.

115
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,350
Tell me.

116
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,060
Although Sima Qi is the Grand Commander,

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,710
his tally has been taken back.

118
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,570
As long as we get the tally first,

119
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,130
we still have the advantage.

120
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,710
But now the tally is missing.

121
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,960
If Sima Qi gets it first...

122
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,350
Yes, the tally...

123
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,230
I shouldn't be back yet.

124
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,510
I should find it first.

125
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,550
City Lord, do you know where the tally is?

126
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,190
Then leave now.

127
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,890
We absolutely cannot let it fall into Sima Qi's hands.

128
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,650
Yes.

129
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,290
Wait.

130
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,330
I...

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,990
I asked Her Ladyship to see you.

132
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,470
What's going on?

133
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,820
Having a son early on is the foundation for the stability of the royal city.

134
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,750
You've been too restrained

135
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,160
for the people.

136
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,460
Yuan Qingheng.

137
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,790
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

138
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,010
There are too many people in the Yue Mansion.

139
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,790
Let's go there until later tonight when there are less people.

140
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,390
It doesn't matter.

141
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,090
City Lord.

142
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,730
I'll take my leave.

143
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,420
City Lord, I've heard that you've been feeling unwell,

144
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,650
so I specially made this soup for you.

145
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,910
Honey.

146
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,740
Being the City Lord has its perks.

147
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,330
It's very convenient to issue a decree for myself.

148
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,960
The tally!

149
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,430
I'm coming.

150
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,990
Sima Qi.

151
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,820
Where did he go?

152
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,490
Who?

153
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,919
Who are you?

154
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,610
Why are you in my room?

155
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,390
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,510
This feeling is so familiar.

157
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,250
Fortunately, I fooled it.

158
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,930
Otherwise, if I hadn't gotten the tally

159
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,560
and had been killed by Sima Qi instead,

160
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,160
it would have been a huge loss.

161
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,120
Miss, please have a seat.

162
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,310
You...

163
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,070
Were you in this room all the time?

164
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Then I...

165
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,550
Miss, don't worry.

166
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,940
This is a place full of affairs.

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,150
There's no need for me to offend you

168
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,440
and bring trouble upon myself.

169
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,290
Wouldn't it be more convenient for you to pretend you didn't see anything?

170
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,020
You are so smart.

171
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,380
You are so beautiful.

172
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,420
I'd love to be friends with you.

173
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,090
Are you...

174
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,870
Aren't you going to make friends?

175
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,710
So naturally, we should have a drink.

176
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,500
Here.

177
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,090
You're so straightforward.

178
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,860
You must be knowledgeable.

179
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,150
As for my personal matter as a girl,

180
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,380
I would appreciate it if you could keep it confidential.

181
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,100
Sure.

182
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,360
Candied haws!

183
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,860
Sachets! Sachets!

184
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,500
Boss, let me see this.

185
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,340
Miss, take a look.

186
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,310
Candied haws!

187
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,100
Candied haws!

188
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,990
Sachets!

189
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,000
Knowledgeable.

190
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,140
I spend every day trapped in the inner palace,

191
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,710
playing the role of a puppet city lord.

192
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,990
How can I be knowledgeable?

193
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,950
Do you want some candied haws?

194
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,660
They're big and sweet, really delicious.

195
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,950
Boss, I'll take one.

196
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,180
So much money.

197
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,930
No need for so much, Miss.

198
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,880
It's for you. Wishing you peace and happiness.

199
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,720
For me?

200
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,070
Thank you, Miss.

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,710
Lanterns. Have a look.

202
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,430
If I weren't the City Lord,

203
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,960
living a simple and ordinary life,

204
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,440
busy with everyday tasks,

205
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,600
wouldn't that be nice?

206
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,090
Then I could find a wife;

207
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,710
no,

208
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,120
I mean a husband;

209
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,400
and I spend my days helping him with his work, raising children,

210
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,520
and doing some farming.

211
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,770
It would definitely be very happy.

212
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,140
Small pendants for sale!

213
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,130
Lanterns for sale!

214
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,180

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,040
Miss, come and look at the lanterns.

216
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,200
Thief! Stop!

217
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,280
Stop!

218
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,970
Stop!
