00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,890
[Episode 7]

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,630
You pointed your sword at my neck last time.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,420
This time, we're even.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,329
Sima Qi, will you stop already?

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,590
Stop!

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,170
Stop!

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,880
Stop!

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,000
Sima Qi, are you out of your mind?

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,990
If you have a problem with me,

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,740
can't you wait until Yandan's envoys leave?

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,010
If we have an internal conflict now,

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,920
how can the two cities sign the peace treaty?

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,350
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,220
Playing dumb with me, huh?

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,990
I'll use you as my shield.

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,170
Let's see how your men are going to lay a finger on me.

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,290
My men?

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,570
Shield?

19
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,110
Just keep playing dumb.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,380
You're being hunted?

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,720
Let go!

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,280
No!

23
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,540
They're really not my men.

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,320
How is that possible?

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,920
If I let you go, they'll stab me right away.

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,790
Let go!

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,440
Not a chance!

28
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,620
That makes sense!

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,960
They're really not your men? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

30
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,129
I told you already!

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,960
Then who's after me?

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,980
I was going to ask you that!

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,470
Aren't you supposed to be super good at martial arts?

34
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,940
One against seven, and unarmed.

35
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,740
Are you serious?

36
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,710
Look! Someone's tossing silver over there!

37
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,980
Where is it?

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
-Where's the silver?
-Where's the silver?

39
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:20,830
Run!

40
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,230
Why are you running? Go after her!

41
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,900
Stop running! Go after her! Stop!

42
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,070
Chase her! Stop!

43
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,150
Stop! Stop!

44
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,190
Stop! Stop! Stop!

45
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,539
Boss,

46
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,330
today's script is different from the one you gave us earlier.

47
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,450
Don't lean on me. I'm tired too.

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,350
As an actor,

49
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,530
one needs to truly listen, watch, and feel.

50
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,390
That's professional.

51
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,509
Are we hunting someone?

52
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,170
Is Princess Yunzhen being rescued?

53
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,480
This is called:

54
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,050
"When I need to cooperate with the performance, I improvise."

55
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,310
Wait.

56
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,180
So...

57
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,220
you guys...

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,740
were hired to act in cooperation with Princess Yunzhen?

59
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,390
Yes.

60
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,790
How did you know?

61
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,260
You spoke too loudly.

62
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,260
But why are you chasing me?

63
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,890
Well...

64
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,150
Aren't you Princess Yunzhen?

65
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,680
Then the sachet you're wearing...

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,640
And using the sachet as a token to...

67
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,350
Stop the carriage now.

68
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,460
Finally, it's my turn to show up.

69
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,210
Why do I feel something is wrong?

70
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,500
Master, I'm still here.

71
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,990
Boss, Boss.

72
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,520
That looks like the target we're supposed to follow.

73
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,920
No.

74
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,350
Weren't we told to pretend to kidnap a woman?

75
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,010
She looks quite similar to the one in the portrait.

76
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,320
The sachet?

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,770
Boss, the sachet.

78
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,630
Yes, it's her.

79
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,330
Go! Go!

80
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,670
Well then,

81
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,079
can we finish up now

82
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,110
and collect our pay?

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,510
Yes.

84
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,060
Go and find the contact person to get the money.

85
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,840
Alright. Work's done!

86
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,020
Work's done!

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,550
Let's go.

88
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,230
Let's go collect our pay.

89
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:28,910
Let's go collect our pay.

90
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,220
Work's done!

91
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,420
If there's more work, please remember to call me.

92
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,540
Oh my god.

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
Let's go.

94
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,870
Aren't you out of energy and unable to run anymore?

95
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,870
Once we get the money, we'll have energy.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,079
Let's go!

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,480
My Lord.

98
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,550
Let me find an excuse.

99
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,280
No, let me explain.

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,240
Actually, this whole thing

101
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,510
was just a misunderstanding.

102
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,420
Control yourself.

103
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,630
Control yourself.

104
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,000
Aren't you always trying to kill me?

105
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,870
Why did you pretend to be nice and save me this time?

106
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,210
I just subconsciously jumped in after you.

107
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,810
How about you jump in again,

108
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,260
and I promise I won't save you.

109
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,390
Get lost!

110
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,710
You can't die now.

111
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,470
The envoys from Yandan are still here.

112
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,150
You must be safe.

113
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,240
Isn't it better

114
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,220
that the envoys from Yandan are still here?

115
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,490
This way, you can use Yandan's influence to usurp the throne.

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,070
Usurping is a means, not the goal.

117
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,870
What's the difference?

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,040
If you were a wise ruler,

119
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,600
why would I need to usurp the throne

120
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,350
and cause a war,

121
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,790
bringing suffering to the people?

122
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,580
No way.

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,760
Nowadays, there's actually someone who wants to

124
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,200
usurp the throne not for gain, but for ideals?

125
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,440
How do you know the slogan of our organization?

126
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,260
It seems our goals are aligned.

127
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,330
If I could get Sima Qi's support, it would be a good thing for me.

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,490
I'll lay my cards on the table.

129
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,840
Actually,

130
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm the benefactor behind your Zhuo Tian Organization.

131
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,520
Impossible.

132
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,450
You don't believe me?

133
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,690
The first time we met

134
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,280
was two years and eleven months ago.

135
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,510
One installment per period.

136
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,290
In total, I've provided 35 installments of funding.

137
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,720
Up until now,

138
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,310
the total amount has been 2500 taels of silver.

139
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,160
Did you plant a spy by my side?

140
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
Why do you still not believe me?

141
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,410
Do I have to use the trump card?

142
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,480
Do you remember the first time we met?

143
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,770
Who is it?

144
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,240
Impudent!

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,610
Who are you? Why are you here?

146
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,620
I'm the Chief's guard.

147
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,890
Located on a high ridge,

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,159
the landscape of rivers and mountains has always been beautiful.

149
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,810
The gate faces the sea,

150
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,510
where three rivers converge and flow for eternity.

151
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,040
Could it be that you're the benefactor?

152
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,180
We agreed that during this meeting,

153
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,970
we would not probe each other's identities.

154
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,530
What are you doing, sneaking around behind the curtain?

155
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,600
I...

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,840
I'm here to survey the terrain

157
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,290
to check if there are any flaws.

158
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,730
Really?

159
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,080
Chief, bad news!

160
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
The benefactor is wearing a mask.

161
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,230
None of us who are lying in ambush nearby

162
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,330
can tell who it is.

163
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,330
Chief?

164
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
It seems you are very suspicious.

165
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,250
Looks like you're not lacking money?

166
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,409
It's my fault.

167
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,770
From now on, I'll put you first

168
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,490
and never inquire about your identity.

169
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,450
I believe you now.

170
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,710
So do you have the tally?

171
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,240
No.

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
Where would it be?

173
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,240
My spiritual nourishment

174
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,690
has been ruined.

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,200
These candies...

176
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,810
Are you interested?

177
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,600
I made them myself.

178
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,410
Try them.

179
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,250
There is no other type like it in the world.

180
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,440
Isn't this candy from the Seventh Princess?

181
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,370
Could the Seventh Princess be the City Lord?

182
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,120
Take it.

183
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,770
Oh no.

184
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,970
I should have given them all to him.

185
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,250
Be happy.

186
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,640
You must have mistaken me for my brother.

187
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,010
It's all because our eyes look so much alike.

188
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,400
The girl I've been thinking about day and night for three years

189
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,800
turned out to be the City Lord in disguise.

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,240
But...

191
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,960
the Lady Dowager's palace has tight security.

192
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,930
How did you manage to sneak in?

193
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,530
I am the City Lord.

194
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,560
Tomorrow,

195
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,390
let's do this.

196
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,880
After some intense discussion,

197
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,630
they peacefully parted ways.

198
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,720
Just kidding.

199
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,810
Don't take it seriously.

200
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,470
My Lord, are we still going to usurp the throne?

201
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,420
Lower your voice.

202
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,810
Let's be prepared for both options.

203
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,640
I'll go urge the craftsman.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,210
He's been having diarrhea recently.

205
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,490
We can't let this delay the process.

206
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,680
Absurd.

207
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,950
Diarrhea is a sign of discomfort

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,970
in the spleen and stomach.

209
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,210
They are the foundation of the body

210
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,920
and the source of one's energy.

211
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,890
He has such a serious illness. He should be given time off.

212
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,230
Let him rest properly before working again.

213
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,730
Then I also want to...

214
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,140
No, you don't.
