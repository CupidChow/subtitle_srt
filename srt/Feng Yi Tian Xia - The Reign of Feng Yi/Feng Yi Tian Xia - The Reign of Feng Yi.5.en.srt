00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,870
[Episode 5]

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,230
How dare you!

3
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,430
What do you mean?

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,230
Princess of Yandan, what are you up to?

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,110
Please forgive us, City Lord.

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,510
The purpose of our diplomatic mission this time

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,080
is to find a husband for the Princess.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,490
Yuzhi once vowed

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,950
that she would marry anyone

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,430
who could block her whip attack.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,350
Therefore, her offensive behavior was excusable.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,470
Summon an imperial physician

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,380
to check if the Princess is injured.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,680
No need.

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,910
My brother just said

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,790
that I would marry only the person

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,290
who could block my whip attack.

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,820
I don't care about Sima Qi,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,690
but my money can't go to waste.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,590
All you want is our Yandan's horses.

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,420
If you grant this marriage,

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,050
we will immediately offer you

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,660
our fully-grown blood-sweating horses.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,930
I already have someone in my heart.

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,510
Besides, I would never rely on a woman to get things.

26
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,530
What's going on?

27
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,110
Sima Qi suddenly became handsome?

28
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,030
How dare you!

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,340
Guards!

30
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,310
Wait.

31
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,150
Young Lord of Yandan, harmony brings prosperity.

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,070
There's an old saying:

33
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,840
"You can't force love."

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,370
The Grand Commander of the Xiaoqi Guard is nothing special here,

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,979
whether in terms of his appearance or rank.

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,610
Some other day, I'll find the Princess someone

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,870
more handsome and with a more promising future. Okay?

38
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,030
You won't find one.

39
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,190
I'll take my leave.

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,840
Mr. Sima, please wait.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,590
Young Lord, you may not know,

42
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,010
but I'm in charge of the affairs of our city.

43
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,240
Seeing that the Princess has taken a fancy to Mr. Sima,

44
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,690
I hereby grant him to her as her Prince Consort

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,960
to forge a bond that will bring a century of harmony between our cities.

46
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,950
City Lord, what's with the look on your face?

47
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,420
You have a good plan, but I have a countermeasure.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,550
Good.

49
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,180
Great.

50
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,990
The Grand Commander of the Xiaoqi Guard is a valiant warrior.

51
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,640
Now, with Yandan's support,

52
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,980
he'll surely make great achievements in court in the future.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,390
Music.

54
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,820
Dance!

55
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,570
Wait.

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm getting old and often muddle-headed.

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,220
Just now, I heard Mr. Sima mention that his heart already belongs to someone else.

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,780
The Princess holds a noble status,

59
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,360
and I cannot matchmake her recklessly.

60
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,510
I found she has a childlike nature

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,579
and likes to joke.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,150
The City Lord is gentle.

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,320
You two seem to be a perfect match.

64
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
Lady Dowager...

65
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,820
You truly understand your son well.

66
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,990
Princess of Yandan is intelligent

67
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,100
and beautiful.

68
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,650
She is indeed different from other women I've met,

69
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,910
and I quite admire her.

70
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,570
Very well.

71
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,370
In that case,

72
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,930
-I'll…
-You've gone too far!

73
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,540
How dare you go back on your word

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,870
in front of everyone?

75
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,910
Do you think Yandan is without strength?

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,040
Exactly.

77
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,880
The Princess of Yandan is not a commodity

78
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,330
to be manipulated as you please.

79
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,870
You can't just change your mind.

80
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,030
Young Lord, are you going to confront us directly?

81
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,500
That's right.

82
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,830
If you want a fight, you'll get a fight.

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,670
If you want a fight, you'll get a fight.

84
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,810
Guards!

85
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,460
City Lord, please don't!

86
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,150
Please forgive me, City Lord.

87
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,740
I made a stupid statement.

88
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,070
Please forgive me.

89
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,550
Yuzhi,

90
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,260
dance for your future husband to apologize.

91
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,860
Brother!

92
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,050
Do it!

93
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,710
I...

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,060
I drank too much just now. Please excuse me.

95
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,800
Oh no. I was too careless.

96
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,540
The Young Lord of Yandan changed his attitude so quickly.

97
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm afraid there might be a trap.

98
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,659
What should I do?

99
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,070
Sima Qi?

100
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,070
Grand Commander, why are you here?

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,909
I have a question,

102
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,530
and I hope you can tell me the answer.

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,130
Go ahead.

104
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,790
Why did you help me?

105
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,530
What else could it be?

106
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,710
You're my only promising candidate.

107
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,880
But if I tell the truth now,

108
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,060
I'll definitely die.

109
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,520
I have to find an excuse.

110
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,560
City Lord?

111
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,870
I'm trying…

112
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm trying to win your favor.

113
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,890
What do you mean?

114
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,770
Whether the country prospers or falls,

115
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,440
the people always suffer.

116
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,340
Grand Commander, if there's nothing else,

117
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,180
I really need to use the restroom.

118
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,210
You...

119
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,700
My Lord, aren't we leaving?

120
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:44,909
Mao,

121
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,940
this City Lord

122
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,990
is not as incompetent as we thought.

123
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,050
Please forgive my dullness.

124
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,440
But I think

125
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,110
that the Young Lord of Yandan

126
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,810
is really afraid of death as rumored.

127
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,430
And he's flexible.

128
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,750
But once he returns to Yandan,

129
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,320
there will surely be a war between the two cities,

130
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,910
and the people will suffer.

131
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,530
How about we...

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,370
This is the worst solution.

133
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,940
Send a visitation letter to the Young Lord Chun Yu of Yandan.

134
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,630
If it really comes to that,

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,380
we will have no other choice but to do it.

136
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,750
I'm doomed.

137
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,430
In order to save Sima Qi,

138
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,710
if I end up causing a war between the two cities,

139
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,200
wouldn't I become a sinner?

140
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,020
City Lord,

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,680
I have a plan for Yandan's matter.

142
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,110
What is it?

143
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,830
I can offer you a plan,

144
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,220
but tonight,

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,110
you must summon Her Ladyship to your chambers to fulfill her duty.

146
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,470
Forget it.

147
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,510
It's just a plan.

148
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,630
I'll think of something myself.

149
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,650
City Lord.

150
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,600
Having a son soon is the foundation of the city's stability.

151
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,020
If you work diligently,

152
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
I'll offer you another benefit.

153
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,170
What is it?

154
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,750
I guess...

155
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,520
you...

156
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,290
What a sin!

157
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,010
I'll go.

158
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,470
Qingheng, happy birthday.

159
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,880
Nanfeng,

160
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,290
I...

161
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,670
I like you.

162
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,470
After today, I will come of age.

163
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,520
If I may,

164
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,110
I would like to always stay by your side

165
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,310
and be with you.

166
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,040
Nanfeng,

167
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,650
do you have someone you like?

168
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,360
Yes.

169
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,870
I have someone I like.

170
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,230
We are childhood sweethearts and grew up together.

171
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,100
I play the qin, and he reads beside me.

172
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,190
Now,

173
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
he's right in front of me.

174
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,000
Nanfeng,

175
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,550
I am determined to be with you year after year,

176
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,790
guarding your safety forever.

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,830
Is this really the City Lord's idea?

178
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
He actually came up with

179
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,650
such an unconventional solution.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Such a unique way of thinking.

181
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,340
This City Lord

182
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,490
is really using a sledgehammer to kill a fly.

183
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,630
Mao,

184
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,750
see our guest out.

185
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,230
My Lord, this way please.

186
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:33,940
My Lord,

187
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,970
can we really trust this stupid City Lord and Yuan Qingheng?

188
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,260
