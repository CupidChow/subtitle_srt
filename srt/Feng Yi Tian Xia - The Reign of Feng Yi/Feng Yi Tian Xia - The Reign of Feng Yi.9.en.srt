00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,960
[Episode 9]

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,080
My Lord,

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,860
let me take you to the room to get changed.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,770
No need. I can go by myself.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,250
My Lord. My Lord!

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,410
Have you...

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,290
been to my mansion before?

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,010
Crap!

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,330
I came here as Seventh Princess last time.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,750
How could I forget?

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,390
I mean...

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,700
I can get changed myself.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,020
You don't need to serve me.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,700
That's right.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,520
Set sail with the wind in March.

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,489
Peach blossoms fall all over the ground in the capital.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,230
Give it to me!

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,530
What? I can't read it?

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,940
I wrote it casually on the Lantern Festival

20
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,530
three years ago.

21
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,020
I was too young and I wasn't very good at writing poems at that time.

22
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,310
I'm worried you might laugh at me.

23
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,140
On the Lantern Festival

24
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,140
three years ago?

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,500
Heaven has its return, but Earth doesn't.

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,650
Drink warm porridge, put on more clothes, and don't wander outside.

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,140
Mr. Sima, is there someone you miss?

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,480
Yes.

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,329
And no.

30
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,860
What does that mean?

31
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,500
I've been missing her for a long time,

32
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,470
but I can't find her.

33
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,740
As time goes by,

34
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,340
I don't know where to start.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,650
So you...

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
met her on the Lantern Festival three years ago?

37
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,870
It was raining heavily on the Lantern Festival.

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,170
She opened an umbrella for me.

39
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,000
Three years ago?

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,940
Did it truly happen?

41
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,029
Is he a fool?

42
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,860
It's cold in spring in March and it's raining,

43
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,090
but he's doing horse stance here.

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,120
Isn't he afraid of catching a cold?

45
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,360
My Lady, let's just go back.

46
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,750
You dropped your candies.

47
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,650
If you continue to stand in the rain like this,

48
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,470
you'll get sick tomorrow.

49
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,600
I don't know what happened to you,

50
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,040
but what I want to tell you is

51
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,030
don't ever

52
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,090
be too hard on yourself.

53
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,730
Go home and sleep.

54
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
Things will get better.

55
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,659
Take the umbrella.

56
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,810
See you.

57
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,650
Take this. It's sweet.

58
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,550
Take it.

59
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,990
Crap.

60
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,980
I should have given him all.

61
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,500
Be happy.

62
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,650
It's him.

63
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,120
Should I take a bath or not, Mr. Sima?

64
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,870
Yuan Qingheng only allowed me to have one day off.

65
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,340
If I still don't take a bath, I'll be poisoned to death.

66
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,900
You should take a bath. Immediately.

67
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,490
I won't let you die.

68
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,630
My Lord.

69
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,100
Physician Lin said during the bath,

70
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,220
it might hurt a lot.

71
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,990
Let me serve you.

72
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,620
Crap.

73
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,900
What should I do?

74
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,380
Calm down.

75
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,190
He should be the one panicking.

76
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,740
Okay.

77
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,400
Since you

78
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,000
want to serve me,

79
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,169
of course I'm happy.

80
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,970
I'm just wondering...

81
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,300
how...

82
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,330
you want to serve me.

83
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,720
Mr. Sima, your lips...

84
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,580
are so...

85
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
The f-fragrant powder spilled.

86
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,390
Crap.

87
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,890
Luckily, I didn't show my timidity.

88
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,220
All right.

89
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,960
Help me with the herbal bath first.

90
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,640
Physician Lin's medicine

91
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,890
is... really effective.

92
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,410
My Lord.

93
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,640
Give me your hands.

94
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,700
My Lord.

95
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,800
If it hurts,

96
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,400
just bite me.

97
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,940
My Lord.

98
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,210
It's snowing.

99
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,850
What?

100
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,510
It's snowing.
