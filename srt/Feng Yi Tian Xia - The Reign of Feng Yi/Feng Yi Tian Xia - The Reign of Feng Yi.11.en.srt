[Episode 11]

2
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,830
Mr. Sima.

3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,310
Sima Qi?

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,430
You're awake.

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,550
You are...

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,670
My name is Doudou.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,250
Sima Qi is my older brother.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,440
Doudou.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,340
What a cute name.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,350
Doudou, where's your brother?

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,630
He went to the fair.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,910
He'll be back shortly.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,430
He told me to take good care of you

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,070
when you wake up.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,710
Thank you, lovely little Doudou.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,870
Sister, you're pretty too.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,550
So cute.

18
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,100
Doudou.

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,630
Brother, you're back.

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,940
Mr. Sima. You're back from the fair?

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,230
I went to buy some ingredients

22
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,390
to make you tomato, minced meat and mushroom noodles.

23
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,400
Bad Sima Qi.

24
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,820
You never make this noodle dish for me.

25
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,110
Look, your sister is angry.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,410
Hurry up and cook.

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,130
Okay, I'll go right away.

28
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,310
The noodles are ready.

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,550
The noodles are ready.

30
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,060
Come sit on my lap.

31
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,370
This noodle dish my brother makes is unmatched.

32
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,070
Really? Let me try.

33
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,820
Try it.

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,830
This noodle dish...

35
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,030
Is better than all the dishes cooked by the Imperial Kitchen.

36
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,910
Our whole family loves it.

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,590
How about I feed you?

38
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:19,990
Okay.

39
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,230
It's really delicious.

40
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,410
So delicious.

41
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,140
Mr. Yuan is waiting.

42
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,060
I'll get going then.

43
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,180
See you next time.

44
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,170
[Sima's Mansion]

45
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,340
My Lord.

46
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,910
Don't be sad.

47
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,950
According to my observation,

48
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,030
this stupid lord trusts you more and more.

49
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,870
How could you talk like that? That's City Lord you're talking about.

50
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,860
Show some respect.

51
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,370
But you love calling him that.

52
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,150
I was just...

53
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

54
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,950
Mind your words.

55
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,230
It's very dangerous.

56
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,130
Jiyue, thank you for the herbal bath yesterday.

57
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,250
I feel much better now.

58
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,520
Let me check your pulse again.

59
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,910
Ms. Feng, you're poisoned again.

60
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,660
Ms. Feng, you're poisoned for the third time.

61
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,970
Ms. Feng, you're poisoned for the fourth time.

62
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,860
That disgusting poisoner.

63
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,280
I'll definitely find you.

64
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,150
Except this, this,

65
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,920
and this,

66
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,310
everything should be fine.

67
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,290
Wait.

68
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,160
Just to make sure.

69
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,010
This...

70
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,210
This...

71
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,550
This...

72
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,650
Wait.

73
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,440
This...

74
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,070
My Lord.

75
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,360
What should we do now?

76
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,429
We've eliminated

77
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,110
all external factors.

78
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,510
Who on earth wants to poison me?

79
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,380
It's always like this.

80
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,900
Why do so many people want me dead?

81
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,340
According to Lin Jiyue,

82
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,950
the poison in your body was accumulated over time.

83
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,580
It's been so long.

84
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,850
Haven't you checked your pulse?

85
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,970
Of course I have.

86
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,360
Twice a week without fail.

87
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,630
Those quacks from the Imperial Hospital...

88
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,460
Wait.

89
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,500
Is the head of the Imperial Hospital surnamed Yue?

90
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,310
-Lady Dowager?
-Lady Dowager?

91

[Harmonious Marriage]

92
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,070
My Lord. My Lord.

93
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,860
You...

94
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,040
Are you alright?

95
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,030
My Lord.

96
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,530
Weird. I should have suspected her earlier.

97
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,790
She always loves to control me,

98
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,980
and she always has a murderous intent.

99
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,810
When Mr. Qin dropped dead last time,

100
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,690
it was dealt with abruptly.

101
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,050
I know she must have something up her sleeves.

102
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,720
But she just wants to kill me.

103
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,640
I still remember when I was little, she held me

104
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,280
and taught me to write and make candies.

105
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,370
Why?

106
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,430
Sima Qi.

107
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,910
Is power really that important?

108
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,030
I can't give you the answer you want.

109
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,000
Only if you are strong enough

110
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,050
can she see you,

111
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,550
and you can talk to each other as equals.

112
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,080
You can ask her then.

113
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,930
The palace gate is going to be locked.

114
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,050
We should go.

115
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,450
All these years,

116
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:36,880
has City Lord always kept the servants out

117
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,580
when she sleeps?

118
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,910
But if we leave,

119
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,030
she'll really be alone.

120
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,370
Let's go.
