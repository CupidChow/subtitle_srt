00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,900
[Episode 20]

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,390
Now! Release!

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,200
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,190
Qiang Wei is still in my hands.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,080
You...

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:17,680
You...

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,510
You betrayed me.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,660
And you betrayed me too!

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,950
You all betrayed me.

10
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,350
Yi.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,810
Yi.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,110
You are so cruel!

13
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,300
Mother.

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,009
Stop.

15
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,610
I can spare your life.

16
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,160
Yi,

17
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,060
I underestimated you.

18
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you still remember

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,030
I was the one who helped you ascend the throne?

20
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,540
Instead of being grateful,

21
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,190
you collaborated with outsiders

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,260
to detain me here and humiliate me

23
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,020
in front of everyone.

24
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,340
Can you make the officials obey?

25
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,270
Yi.

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,130
Yi.

27
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,790
Why don't you just die?

28
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,440
You helped me ascend the throne?

29
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,010
Mother,

30
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,910
I...

31
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,270
am just your puppet.

32
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,310
Look what you've done all these years.

33
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,660
You tyrannized the people

34
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,900
and feathered your nest.

35
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,760
Given what you did in the court,

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,110
you don't deserve the officials' admiration at all.

37
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,680
Guards.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,850
Yes.

39
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,510
Lady Dowager plotted a rebellion.

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,810
Since she raised me,

41
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,270
she'll be grounded in the Fengqi Palace, and I never want to see her again.

42
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,310
Yi, no!

43
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,610
No!

44
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,400
Yi!

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,270
Yi!

46
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,829
Yi!

47
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,990
My Lord, that's a wise decision.

48
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,420
My Lord, that's a wise decision.

49
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,990
Mother.

50
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,850
This is the last time

51
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,960
I call you Mother as your daughter.

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,750
Your daughter has always wanted to tell you something.

53
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,959
In fact, she never wanted to take over power.

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,200
She just wanted to live aboveboard.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
She didn't want to live cautiously, speak insincerely,

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,090
or be manipulated by others.

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,900
She could give up the position of city lord.

58
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,940
But being a woman is not her fault.

59
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,380
It shouldn't become her lifelong burden or shackle.

60
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,120
This is a suspended animation pill.

61
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,490
Yuan Qingheng is right behind you.

62
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,780
Let bygones

63
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,760
be bygones.

64
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,870
I hope in the future,

65
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,600
you and Yuan Qingheng can live happily.

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,370
I feel guilty for everything

67
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,710
I've put you through all these years.

68
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,680
I feel guilty towards you.

69
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,420
The phoenix robe of Grand Commander who established Fengyao

70
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,210
has been brought here.

71
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,970
My Lord, please get changed.

72
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,100
The late forebear, Feng Qingqi,

73
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,440
with God's blessing,

74
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,000
saved the people from perils,

75
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,570
pacified the realm from chaos and strife,

76
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,610
expanded the frontiers,

77
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,550
resolved discord with wisdom,

78
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,680
and pledged peace for the nation,

79
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,270
thus founding Fengyao.

80
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,610
Yet God's blessing was withdrawn too soon.

81
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,200
He died early.

82
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,610
With solemn reverence, I bestow upon him the posthumous title of Zhuangwu

83
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,090
and move his tablet to the Heavenly Lord Temple,

84
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,350
enshrining it in a separate chamber.

85
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,789
Respect this.

86
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,790
Abolish the old system and establish a new order.

87
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,630
Change the reign title to Tianshou.

88
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,340
Grant a general amnesty to the nation!

89
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:56,410
Long live the City Lord!

90
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,870
It's the Lantern Festival again.

91
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,960
It feels great that I don't need to attend court.

92
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,470
I really want to be an ordinary couple with you

93
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,960
and live a peaceful life.

94
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,770
My Lord,

95
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,430
you still need to govern the whole city.

96
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,800
Alright. Got it.

97
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,850
I've governed it well, right?

98
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,740
I should thank you for your help.

99
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,000
Your governance is effective.

100
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,280
My help

101
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,840
is just icing on the cake at most.

102
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,690
Look.

103
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,940
This is your world , Feng Yi.

104
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,570
Do you think...

105
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,960
Do you think Yuan Qingheng and Nanfeng

106
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,670
have arrived in Jiangnan?

107
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,510
They've been to many places this year.

108
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,030
Even the messengers couldn't catch up with them.

109
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,080
So,

110
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,230
don't worry about them, okay?

111
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,110
You're right.

112
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,400
We all should live our own life well.

113
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,410
By the way,

114
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,300
we've been married for so long.

115
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,610
You haven't called me Honey yet.

116
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,590
Calling you that... will diminish my prestige.

117
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,170
Well...

118
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,110
you're so stubborn.

119
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,480
No.

120
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,200
Look at you.

121
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,810
Why are you so obsessed with that appellation?

122
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,480
Because

123
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,830
I lack a sense of security.

124
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,910
Sima Qi.

125
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,330
Let's... have a wedding again.

126
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,210
An official wedding.

127
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,160
Really?

128
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,380
You're not lying to me?

129
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,160
Of course not.

130
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,600
Okay.

131
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,910
I trust you.

132
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,250
Feng Yi!

133
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,960
From today onwards,

134
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,740
you'll be my man.

135
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,310
With Heaven above

136
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,080
and Earth below as my witnesses,

137
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,340
I, Sima Qi,

138
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,280
take Feng Yi as my wife today.

139
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,300
In life or death, in sickness or old age,

140
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,420
I'll never leave her.

141
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,180
Plant flowers in spring.

142
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,140
Enjoy lotus flowers in summer.

143
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,110
Brew wine in autumn.

144
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,960
Enjoy snow in winter.

145
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,080
You're the only one I want.

146
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,550
-May flowers bloom forever,
-May flowers bloom forever,

147
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,770
-the moon remain full,
-the moon remain full,

148
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,520
-and everyone live a long life.
-and everyone live a long life.
