00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,910
[Episode 12]

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,870
I'm poisoned again.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,670
What can I do?

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,590
I'm also devastated.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,860
Mother, you're not trying to poison me to death,

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,040
but starve me to death, right?

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,950
Actually, I have an idea.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,890
Her Ladyship

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,370
has been homesick lately.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,520
I'm her husband,

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,280
and I didn't know about this.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,250
How did you know?

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,330
I went out with Sima Qi last night

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,390
and ran into Her Ladyship.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,520
We heard her playing the Song of Xiaoxiang at Wangjiang Pavilion.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,470
Mr. Yuan.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,830
Let's go.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,200
Although I don't know much about music,

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,270
I believe this song is about happiness and celebration.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,150
But the way Her Ladyship played it

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,539
was obviously sad.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,470
This is the first song her mother taught her.

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,510
How did you know?

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,570
The Yuan and Yue families have been friends for generations.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,070
It's not surprising that I know, right?

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,590
But what does this have to do with detoxification?

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,650
The military pay deficit case?

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,090
That's right.

29
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,110
Lady Dowager relies on the Yue Family.

30
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,910
As long as we can find evidence

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,960
to prove that the Yue Family is related to the military pay deficit case,

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,910
we can demote him from the imperial court.

33
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,470
This way, Lady Dowager won't be able to behave unscrupulously anymore.

34
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,610
That's right.

35
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,070
We can use the excuse of

36
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,750
my wife going home to visit her parents

37
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,640
to get me detoxified and find evidence.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,230
Qingqing.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,860
You and my wife have been friends since childhood,

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,780
so it'll be your job to convince her.

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,750
My wife is so understanding.

42
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm sure she'll agree.

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,020
I'm willing to do anything for you, My Lord.

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,660
My Lady.

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,880
His Lordship said he's aware that you're homesick,

46
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,690
and he specifically asked me to come and tell you that

47
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,430
he'd like to take you back to your hometown to visit your parents.

48
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,590
I'm homesick?

49
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,100
Last night, I heard you play

50
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,310
the Song of Xiaoxiang in the palace...

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,240
Just because you're smart, Mr. Yuan,

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,020
you think you can read everyone's mind?

53
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,600
My mother taught me this song when I was a kid.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
I missed her.

55
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,270
But she passed away when I was still a little girl,

56
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,710
and my father was isolated by my family and has lived a vagabond life.

57
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,710
So I already have no maiden family to go back to.

58
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,550
I'm sorry

60
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,250
for making you sad.

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,650
I shouldn't...

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,000
No.

63
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,900
I, your humble servant, shouldn't have speculated your thoughts, Your Ladyship.

64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,150
I know what you're thinking.

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,790
His Lordship can still

66
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,510
leave the palace in the name of my homesickness.

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,410
Actually, not long after the military pay deficit case broke out,

68
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,670
my father disappeared.

69
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,430
I've always had doubts too.

70
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,170
I'll definitely help you and His Lordship

71
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,190
find out the truth, My Lady.

72
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,870
My dear, are you alright?

73
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,670
We already left the palace.

74
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,430
Just call me Nanfeng,

75
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,350
and I'll call you Master Feng.

76
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,510
Right, right. Nanfeng.

77
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,000
Get some sleep.

78
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,990
Your health is the most important.

79
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,170
Stop!

80
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,390
Stop!

81
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,960
Her Ladyship is not feeling well?

82
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,930
It's so hot.

83
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,430
Nanfeng, you're having a fever.

84
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:32,980
Pardon me.

85
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,120
It's too hot.

86
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,390
It's already a high fever.

87
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,250
If she doesn't treat the fever and recuperate,

88
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,440
I'm afraid it might develop into a chronic illness.

89
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,540
I'm okay.

90
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,380
We have to keep moving.

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,690
We don't have much time. There's no need to accommodate me.

92
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,200
How about this, Mr. Yuan?

93
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,100
Take Her Ladyship to an inn to rest.

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,200
I'll take Master Feng to Lingnan as fast as possible.

95
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,480
We'll meet again when you're safe.

96
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,120
But in this case, the guards will be dispersed.

97
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,200
Master Feng, your safety is important.

98
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,690
Your health is more important.

99
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,700
As you said, let's split up.

100
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,110
This is the jade pendant only owned by the Yue Family.

101
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,250
One jade pendant represents one person.

102
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,400
This is mine.

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,200
Take it.

104
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,470
It'll be more convenient for you to do things on the Yue Family's territory.

105
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,210
I'll hit the road then.

106
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,159
Take good care of yourself.

107
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,070
The rest of you, on my command.

108
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,140
Back to the inn.

109
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,409
Let's go.

110
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,760
My Lady!

111
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,550
I'm sorry that I offended you.

112
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,350
Please forgive me, My Lady.

113
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,940
This has nothing to do with you.

114
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,590
Please rise.

115
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,540
I'll take a look outside.

116
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,240
Thank you for protecting me, Mr. Yuan.

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,080
My Lady, it was because a stone got stuck in the wheel.

118
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,390
It's fixed now.

119
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,150
Since it has been moved,

120
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,400
let's keep going.

121
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,110
Why is there a hairpin here?

122
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,720
Why does this hairpin look so familiar?

123
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,030
It looks like...

124
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,830
You're mistaken.

125
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,990
But I...

126
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,580
All right.

127
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,240
Let's keep going.

128
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,950
Why's there a person over there?

129
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,570
Let's go take a look.

130
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,230
This man is covered with injuries,

131
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,740
yet he's still so active.

132
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,000
He indeed has great perseverance.

133
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,630
What's your relationship with Yue Nanfeng?

134
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,170
You know my wife?

135
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,300
I, Yue Chenyi,

136
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,680
am Yue Nanfeng's father.

137
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,390
Greetings, My Lord.

138
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,270
God bless you, My Lord.

139
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,940
Please rise.

140
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,460
Please rise.

141
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,240
I have something to report.

142
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,120
The Yue Family is a big family.

143
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,620
Not only did they fail to set an example for the public,

144
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,860
but they also embezzled military pay.

145
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,580
I was unwilling to go along with them in their evil deeds,

146
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,060
so they've been trying to hunt me down.

147
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,570
Please enlighten me, My Lord.

148
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,270
I didn't expect

149
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,380
that it's only been three days,

150
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,630
and a piece of pastry brought us

151
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,280
to the evidence of the Yue Family's corruption.

152
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,070
My Lord.

153
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,590
What should we do now?

154
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,190
What should we do?

155
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,290
Go back, of course.

156
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,670
Go back and meet with Nanfeng.

157
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,670
If she knows this news,

158
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,990
I'm sure she'll be very happy.

159
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,970
My Lord.

160
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,340
Okay.

161
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,160
My Lord, that man is in bad condition.

162
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,770
He may not be able to travel with us.

163
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,670
In that case,

164
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,920
you guys escort him back carefully.

165
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,460
Mr. Sima and I will meet with Nanfeng first.

166
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,650
I can't wait

167
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,970
to tell her this good news.

168
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,850
What if they encounter an accident

169
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,650
on their way back?

170
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,910
This place is so close to the capital.

171
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,630
There won't be any bandits here.

172
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,220
This is why people say "Don't jinx it."

173
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,670
I was careless.

174
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,090
Am I a jinx?

175
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,750
I paved this way.

176
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,140
I planted these trees.

177
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,080
If you want to pass through,

178
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,790
you've got to...

179
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,420
You've got to...

180
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,460
What was it again?

181
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:18,740
Whatever.

182
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,750
You've got to pay with your lives!

183
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,630
Boss, we're not here to kill.

184
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
What we want is money.

185
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,780
Right.

186
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,910
I won't kill you if you pay!

187
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,370
How much do you want?

188
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,090
How much do we want?

189
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,320
They look like evil wealthy nobles

190
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,840
who oppress the people.

191
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,680
How about this?

192
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,560
100 taels of gold, no bargaining.

193
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,630
100 taels is too much.

194
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,620
We've never robbed so much before.

195
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,570
Besides,

196
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,810
what if they can't afford so much?

197
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,530
We should ask for as much money as we can,

198
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,170
so that we can get the upper hand.

199
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,900
My friend, you're right.

200
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,220
Let's do it then.

201
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,200
100 taels of gold.

202
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,830
Not even a copper coin less.

203
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,670
Well,

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,090
do you take cheques?

205
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,180
Gold is too heavy. I don't have it with me.

206
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,690
No cheques. We only take real gold and silver.

207
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,660
I have ten taels of gold

208
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,170
and three copper coins.

209
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,310
Deal.

210
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,130
Wait. That's not right.

211
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,230
It's a loss.

212
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,660
They gave us this money so easily.

213
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,600
We can't go back on our word.

214
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,650
I've said,

215
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,650
we must be bandits with a code of conduct.

216
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,500
Guys, let's go!

217
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,530
Let go of me!

218
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,040
Feng Yi. Feng Yi!

219
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,980
Why did you fool me, an honest man?

220
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,160
Do you think honest men are easy to fool?

221
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,150
Here are the three copper coins you gave me.

222
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,570
You're right. These are counterfeit coins from ancient times.

223
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,020
They...

224
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,960
They are all fake!

225
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,770
All my life,

226
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,800
what I hate most

227
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,730
is people who resort to deceit and break their promises.

228
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,400
I'm telling you.

229
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,410
I'll chop them up today!

230
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,190
Right.

231
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,800
We'll chop you up!

232
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,410
Because you fooled honest people like us,

233
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,050
I'll chop you two up!

234
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,040
-I'll chop you two up!
-Wait!
