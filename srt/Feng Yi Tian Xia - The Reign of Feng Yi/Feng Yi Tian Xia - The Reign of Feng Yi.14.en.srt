00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,940
[Episode 14]

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,700
Nanfeng.

3
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm late.

4
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,220
No, I came early.

5
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,500
Let's go and visit the market.

6
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,740
The capital is as flourishing as ever.

7
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,539
No matter how flourishing it is, it's always the same.

8
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,690
Unlike you, who travels around,

9
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,410
meeting different people in different places.

10
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,180
I heard Jiangnan is full of beauties.

11
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,509
Is there anyone you fancy?

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,170
Nanfeng, don't overthink it.

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,890
I… I was with the teacher every day.

14
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,530
All I got to meet were scholars.

15
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,210
You don't need to explain.

16
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,539
Judging by your disheveled look,

17
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,090
I can tell.

18
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,810
I've gotten used to being carefree outside.

19
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:47,940
Now that I'm back, I'm not quite used to it.

20
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,530
My father has already nagged me about it several times.

21
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,460
Come and take a look. Solve some riddles.

22
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,150
[Farewell is in sight. Be there or be square]

23
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,210
Miss, come and have a look.

24
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,009
Here.

25
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,090
Nanfeng, which one do you like?

26
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,290
This one.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
Take a guess.

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,660
Farewell is in sight. Be there or be square.

29
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,330
Put it together and guess the word.

30
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,070
-Farewell is in sight?
-Farewell is in sight?

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,580
Yes.

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,570
Be there or be square?

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,660
That is "hoping."

34
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,700
Yes.

35
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,270
Congratulations, Sir.

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,890
It's yours, Miss.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,010
Thank you.

38
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,420
I have never set off river lanterns before.

39
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,870
Let's go and set off a river lantern.

40
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,810
Take care.

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,900
Come and take a look.

42
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,079
Guess some riddles!

43
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,130
My Lady, I've finally found you.

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,970
Something serious has happened.

45
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,050
The Lady Dowager came to match the horoscopes.

46
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:01,890
She said tomorrow

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,810
you and the City Lord will be engaged.

48
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,100
Why so suddenly?

49
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,130
Nanfeng?

50
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,570
What happened?

51
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,620
It's nothing.

52
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,130
Lan, wait for me over there.

53
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,820
Let's set off a river lantern.

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,620
Didn't you say you've never done that before?

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,450
Nanfeng,

56
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,890
I have something to tell you.

57
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,770
This is a hairpin my mother gave me.

58
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,180
She told me to give it to my future wife.

59
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,540
But I accidentally left it

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,980
at the river lantern stall.

61
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,740
That's way I hurried back to retrieve it.

62
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,350
Because I was afraid that when I say what I'm about to say,

63
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,300
it wouldn't sound sincere enough.

64
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,580
Qingheng.

65
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,100
This is the peace knot

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,060
you braided for me yourself when I left.

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,530
I've been keeping it with me all along.

68
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,089
We've known and understood each other

69
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,500
since we were little.

70
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,560
Every time I see it,

71
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:22,990
I feel like

72
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,450
no matter how many places I've been to

73
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,130
or how many sights I've seen,

74
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,610
without you,

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,980
everything is meaningless.

76
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,740
So I rushed back,

77
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,380
just to settle our marriage

78
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,890
before the Yue Family

79
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,220
settles the City Lord's wife.

80
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,730
So, Nanfeng,

81
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,180
are you willing to?

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,680
Qingheng, wait for me for two days.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,960
No, tomorrow.

84
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,990
Tomorrow, I will give you an answer.

85
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,080
I understand.

86
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,810
For such a serious matter,

87
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,130
you must discuss it with your father.

88
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,540
I haven't seen him in a long time.

89
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,420
How about I

90
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,620
bring my mother along to visit your family tomorrow?

91
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,150
No.

92
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,540
I'll tell them myself.

93
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,850
Okay.

94
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,330
My Lady, Master must be losing patience.

95
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,940
Well, you should go back now.

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,250
Don't make your father worry.

97
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,090
We...

98
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,940
still have plenty of time.

99
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,730
My Lord, Mr. Yuan is here.

100
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,460
Greetings, My Lord.

101
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,580
Yuan Qingheng?

102
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,620
Qingheng?

103
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,380
Qing!

104
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
You're back.

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,040
You're finally back.

106
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,060
If you hadn't come back, I would be doomed.

107
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,580
My mother has been becoming more and more stubborn lately.

108
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,170
You know what?

109
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,320
She found a girl from the Yue Family to be my wife.

110
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,890
As the City Lord,

111
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,100
I'm just a puppet at their mercy.

112
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,140
A girl from the Yue Family?

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,170
Do you know which one?

114
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,760
The gentlest and most virtuous one from the Yue Family,

115
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,690
Yue Nanfeng.

116
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,620
Here's the deal.

117
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,210
Now that you're back,

118
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,610
it would be best if you could handle my wedding.

119
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,470
Did Nanfeng say anything?

120
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,260
Sima Qi,

121
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,270
I've never

122
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,620
tried shaving before.

123
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,280
You better not complain if it hurts.

124
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,280
Come on.

125
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,610
My Lord,

126
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
you're not young anymore.

127
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,770
How come I never suspected it before?

128
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,620
You look so delicate.

129
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,380
Mind your own business.

130
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,580
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,820
I'm just worried that all the herbal medicine you've been taking

132
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,480
might stunt your growth

133
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,020
and cause some side effects.

134
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,730
Sima Qi,

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,970
I'm giving you two choices right now.

136
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
First,

137
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,290
you can keep saying things that make me angry.

138
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,650
Second,

139
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,720
you can obediently let me shave your beard.

140
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,680
I choose you.

141
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,770
I said I choose you.

142
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,650
I said I choose you.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,580
Come on.

144
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,900
Here.

145
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,280
I'm gonna do it.

146
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,990
I'm ready.

147
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,240
It's okay.

148
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,000
Like this,

149
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,700
just slide it down slowly from top to bottom.

150
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,020
It's okay.

151
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,140
Let...

152
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,210
Let me give it a try.

153
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,470
Come on.

154
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,260
Feng Yi.

155
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,370
Could you move back a little?

156
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,290
I can't see your face clearly.

157
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,010
Come on.

158
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,620
How come your hyperopia still hasn't been treated?

159
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,910
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,170
Here.

161
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,780
Shave my beard.
