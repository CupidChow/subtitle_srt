00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,910
[Episode 13]

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,500
-I'll kill you!
-Wait!

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,830
Wait?

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,190
What are you doing?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,690
Stop struggling.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,890
You've been poisoned by my Weakening Powder.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,079
You can't escape.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,150
Today, I'll make you watch

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,610
as your brother's body is torn apart!

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,220
Boss!

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,390
Why are you helping me?

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,110
Sir, please.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,180
Sir, we can talk.

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,650
Everything can be discussed.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,410
The storybooks always say that

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,830
-those who talk too much always get retaliated against and killed.
-I have mountains of gold and silver.

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,050
Please, don't kill us.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,150
Kill them!

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,350
Kill them!

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:46,840
Okay.

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,420
Stop!

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,630
What are you doing?

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,320
Dad.

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,880
Didn't you promise

25
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,670
to give them to me as my husbands?

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,390
Look what I've done.

27
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,500
I got so excited that I forgot about it.

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,230
Well,

29
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,930
these two aren't dead yet.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,510
Pick whichever one you want.

31
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,950
Whichever one you choose

32
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,760
will be your husband.

33
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,850
And I'll kill the other one.

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,430
My machete!

35
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,230
Well,

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,510
I think

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,580
this one's too short.

38
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,070
Your child will inherit it.

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,190
I'll kill him and leave this one to you.

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,370
Wait!

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,509
I'm pretty, so our child will be pretty too.

42
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,030
That makes sense.

43
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,880
Then I'll kill this lummox

44
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,200
and leave this one to you.

45
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,890
No!

46
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,620
He's well-educated. Your child will be smart.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,440
Intelligence is also important.

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,890
Which one do you want, dear?

49
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,950
You choose.

50
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,960
I've made up my mind.

51
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,910
I'll choose...

52
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,130
Then I'll kill this one.

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,440
He.

54
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,050
Then I'll kill this one.

55
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,970
-Wait!
-Feng Yi!

56
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,350
Don't kill him now.

57
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,380
It's inauspicious before marriage.

58
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,180
You can kill him after my wedding.

59
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,310
Inauspicious?

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,820
You're right.

61
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,210
Well...

62
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,570
What are you waiting for?

63
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,660
Take the groom away.

64
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,500
Feng Yi!

65
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,360
Feng Yi!

66
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,020
Feng Yi!

67
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,370
You are lucky.

68
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,380
This girl

69
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,260
doesn't seem that simple.

70
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,780
When will we meet up?

71
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,730
My Lord, we'll be there before nightfall.

72
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,990
This woodshed is right behind my father's room.

73
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,120
We must keep our voices down.

74
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,230
Aren't you curious why I came here?

75
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,910
You don't want to get married?

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,990
How did you know?

77
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,480
Then...

78
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,390
why are you saving us?

79
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,880
I'm not saving you.

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,760
I'm saving myself.

81
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,020
Saving yourself?

82
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,170
I don't want to get married.

83
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,830
I want to roam the world.

84
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,910
But my father believes that a woman

85
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,570
should focus on supporting her husband and raising children.

86
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,110
He thinks if I get married, I'll settle down.

87
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,079
I'm so sick of it.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,400
Until today, when I saw you two,

89
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,530
I knew

90
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,230
my chance had come.

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,920
Well...

92
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,580
You pretend to be me to get married.

93
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,060
I'll slip away when the crowd is large.

94
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,920
So what can I get from that?

95
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,820
Come on.

96
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,950
Let me tell you.

97
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,390
Get in.

98
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,970
Feng...

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,160
Mr. Feng?

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,330
Hurry.

101
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,670
Mr. Feng...

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,320
Get up.

103
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,580
Sit down.

104
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,020
Why are you here?

105
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,190
To bring you your wedding clothes.

106
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm here to try on the wedding dress.

107
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,470
What's going on here?

108
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,620
I asked Mr. Feng to marry you instead of me.

109
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,230
I've already told the whole village

110
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,670
that I'm going to form a bond with you,

111
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,380
so no one will come before the wedding.

112
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,740
By then, make some noise to deceive them,

113
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,310
making them believe I'm still here.

114
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,980
Then, I'll slip away to the sentry post.

115
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,440
At tonight's wedding,

116
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,350
when everyone's attention is on it,

117
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,650
I'll take the chance to slip away.

118
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,870
By tomorrow morning, when they realize I'm gone, I'll already be far away.

119
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,470
Then I can go wherever I want to go in this vast world.

120
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,100
So, does this mean

121
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,430
I'll be marrying Mr. Feng?

122
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,090
I know it's a bit unfair

123
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,670
to ask Mr. Feng to dress as a woman,

124
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,520
but you and he are more alike.

125
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,070
It's not unfair.

126
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,470
Feng Yi, you're not just okay with it,

127
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,500
you're overjoyed.

128
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,880
But what about tomorrow morning, when we wake up?

129
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,050
Oh right,

130
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,450
here's the antidote for the Weakening Powder you were poisoned with.

131
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,120
It should take effect in about seven hours.

132
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,710
By then, everyone will be asleep,

133
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,830
and I'll be far gone.

134
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,909
You can take Mr. Feng

135
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,960
and go wherever you want.

136
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,470
Alright.

137
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,580
Do you have any other questions?

138
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,980
If not, I'll slip away now.

139
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,150
Okay.

140
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,520
Sima Qi.

141
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,810
Sima Qi?

142
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,030
My Lord,

143
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,630
please get ready.

144
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,310
I've been trained.

145
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,020
The Weakening Powder has little effect on me.

146
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,909
The antidote I took earlier has already cured most of it.

147
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,940
Later, once we find the opportunity,

148
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,690
I'll take you out.

149
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,050
Let's go.

150
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,810
Don't be impulsive.

151
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,230
What about Xue Xiuxiu

152
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,380
if we leave now?

153
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,670
There's no time to think about that.

154
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,820
Your safety is the most important.

155
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,909
Let's go right now.

156
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,490
City Lord, let's go.

157
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,100
I'm not leaving.

158
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,550
It's not

159
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,550
just for Xue Xiuxiu.

160
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,730
I want to experience what it feels like to get married,

161
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,000
which is why I agreed to her.

162
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,710
Are you out of your mind?

163
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,580
Woodhead.

164
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm not leaving. Why are you in such a rush?

165
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,880
It's just seven hours.

166
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,380
If we wait until the poison is completely neutralized before we leave,

167
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,580
the chances of successfully escaping will be higher.

168
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,730
Besides,

169
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,500
before you leave,

170
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,950
didn't you leave a distress signal for Yuan Qingheng?

171
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,550
When he notices we're gone,

172
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,880
he'll naturally follow the trail to find us.

173
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,110
So no matter what happens,

174
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,670
we'll be safe here.

175
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,490
So we're going to wait for seven hours, doing nothing?

176
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,600
Come.

177
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,400
Sima Qi,

178
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,180
I...

179
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
I've thought about it.

180
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,140
I...

181
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,390
like you.

182
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,480
What about you?

183
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,610
Do you like me?

184
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,960
I knew you wouldn't dare to tell me.

185
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,260
I know

186
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,860
our positions are different,

187
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,950
and it's difficult for us to have a happy ending. We can only give up.

188
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,590
But right now,

189
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,190
you are not the Grand Commander,

190
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,880
and I am not the City Lord.

191
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,310
We can cherish this moment.

192
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,810
Feng Yi.

193
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,200
You were wrong about one thing.

194
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,310
I never planned to give up.

195
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,100
My original plan

196
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,510
was to protect you for a lifetime.

197
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,550
Since that's the case,

198
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,230
there's something I need to discuss with you.

199
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,380
What is it?

200
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,950
For the next few days,

201
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,780
you must follow my arrangements.

202
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,040
Safety comes first, okay?

203
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,840
Okay.

204
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,790
Feng Yi.

205
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,510
I like you too.

206
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,040
Lan, I really can't drink anymore.

207
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,580
Stop persuading me.

208
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,840
It's me.

209
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,600
Where is Lan?

210
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
How could you not take the medicine?

211
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,530
I prepared fig paste for you.

212
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,570
Maybe it can help mask some of the strange taste of the medicine.

213
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
Grand Tutor,

214
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,570
where is Lan?

215
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,450
I sent her to decoct the medicine.

216
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,310
Grand Tutor, you truly are capable.

217
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,060
Not only can you order my maid around,

218
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,050
but you also noticed my homesickness through just one song.

219
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,630
You were so confident

220
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,980
that I would agree to the City Lord's request.

221
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,690
If only I were truly that good at predicting.

222
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,770
I advised the City Lord to visit your family because,

223
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,840
on the one hand, it was indeed the best solution,

224
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,870
on the other hand,

225
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,090
I wanted to fulfill my promise from years ago.

226
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,440
You could say

227
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,680
that we've traveled together on this journey,

228
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,590
Nanfeng.

229
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,010
It's very difficult to find it in such a remote place.

230
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,410
It tastes no worse than the ones my mother made for me when I was a child.

231
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,160
This was your favorite when you were young.

232
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:49,970
Yes.

233
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,640
But after my mother passed, I never ate it again.

234
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,290
Qingheng,

235
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,880
whether we forget the past or not,

236
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,750
everything has already changed.

237
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,220
I've also come to understand much more.

238
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,090
Since the hairpin has broken,

239
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,640
there's no use in reattaching it.

240
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,290
Throw it away.

241
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,230
What about the old knot?

242
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,640
It has been thrown away too.

243
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,720
My Lord.

244
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,280
The City Lord sent someone to report

245
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,650
that there's been progress

246
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,640
and he will meet up with us in a few days.

247
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,870
Take care of Her Ladyship.

248
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,850
Yes.

249
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,600
Lan.

250
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,810
You can have this fig paste.
