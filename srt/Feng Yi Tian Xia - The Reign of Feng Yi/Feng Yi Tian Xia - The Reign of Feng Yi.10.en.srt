[Episode 10]

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,270
My Lord.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,550
It's snowing.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,109
What?

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,910
It's snowing.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,230
My Lord.

7
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,820
I know you are a woman,

8
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,099
but I will keep the secret

9
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,380
and protect you.

10
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,830
It's spring but it's still snowing.

11
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,960
Be careful not to catch a cold.

12
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,270
On this same day last year within this door,

13
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,390
a comely face and peach blooms

14
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,370
together did glow.

15
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,190
She I've admired has gone

16
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,910
I know not where.

17
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,990
The peach blooms are smiling still

18
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,829
in the breeze to blow.

19
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,620
[Qingxin Pavilion]

20
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,670
Mr. Sima, are you

21
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,350
wearing makeup?

22
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,640
You'll catch a cold if you don't wear shoes.

23
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,330
I'm not that delicate.

24
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,240
My Lord,

25
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,110
you should take care of yourself.

26
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,510
If I die early,

27
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,740
it'll be more convenient for you to usurp the throne.

28
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,570
You made others think

29
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,130
you're very fatuous.

30
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,750
Otherwise,

31
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,750
I wouldn't have had so many supporters.

32
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm just a puppet.

33
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,030
I'm sorry, My Lord.

34
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,390
I shouldn't have brought it up.

35
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,710
Have some ginger soup to ward off the cold.

36
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,590
I made it myself.

37
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,520
Don't worry. It's not poisoned.

38
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,350
Mr. Sima, you're really good at cooking.

39
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,870
I'm... a bit interested in cooking.

40
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,910
I can cook some common dishes.

41
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,340
Then... can you cook

42
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,070
Sweet and Sour Pork Tenderloin and Buddha Jumps over the Wall?

43
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,820
Yes.

44
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,950
How about Stewed Pork Ball in Brown Sauce?

45
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,330
Yes.

46
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,840
What's your signature dish?

47
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,790
My signature dish?

48
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,790
Bolognese Linguine with Mushrooms.

49
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,240
Bolognese Linguine with Mushrooms?

50
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,220
Sounds very delicious.

51
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,540
Can you cook it for me someday?

52
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,909
Sure.

53
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,150
But I don't think we can do it today.

54
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,590
I guess Mr. Yuan is about to come.

55
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,420
Don't worry about him.

56
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,520
After all, I'm the city lord.

57
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,190
Being the city lord does have its benefits.

58
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,370
Do you have wine here?

59
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,500
Wine?

60
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,080
Yes.

61
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,000
My Lady, it's late.

62
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,909
Drinking too much is bad for your health.

63
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:43,990
I feel cold in my heart.

64
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,170
Drinking wine can warm it up.

65
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,080
My Lady,

66
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,830
nothing is impossible for a willing heart.

67
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,410
The moon is very bright.

68
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,510
But it's useless.

69
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,520
It's still bright although it's useless.

70
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,060
At least

71
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
we are looking at

72
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,740
the same moon.

73
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:16,970
Nice wine.

74
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,190
Sima Qi.

75
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,430
Do you know how hard my life has been all these years?

76
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,750
Do you know how...

77
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,550
how hard it was

78
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,990
for a puppet city lord to save those money?

79
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,120
The money you donated to the people of Huainan

80
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,110
was all saved by me penny by penny.

81
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,950
I know.

82
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,630
I know.

83
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,550
Sima Qi.

84
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,580
If...

85
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,040
you meet the person from three years ago again,

86
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,590
what would you say to her?

87
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,750
I'd ask her how she has been.

88
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,180
You're so cowardly.

89
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,500
It's been three years.

90
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,130
You finally found her,

91
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,590
but you only want to know how she has been.

92
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,710
If I really miss someone,

93
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,470
I won't ask for anything else.

94
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
I just want her to be safe and happy.

95
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,010
What about me?

96
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,750
What should I do?

97
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,350
I don't want to live like this forever.

98
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,220
I know

99
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,620
it was you three years ago.

100
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,310
You are also Seventh Princess.

101
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,250
I know everything.

102
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,050
Yes, it's me.

103
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,610
Today,

104
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to...

105
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,310
I want to act recklessly once.
