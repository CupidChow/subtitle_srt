00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,880
[Episode 18]

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,820
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,360
My dear.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,590
Dear ministers.

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,820
Let's have a drink together.

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,150
My Lord.

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,640
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

8
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,190
Cheers.

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,120
I have something to talk to you about in private, My Lord.

10
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,510
May I?

11
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,910
Just go ahead.

12
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,810
I think it's better for the two of us to discuss this matter alone.

13
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,610
Follow me.

14
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,310
Go ahead.

15
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,829
How did you know who I am?

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,670
Someone revealed it to me, of course.

17
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,100
What do you want?

18
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,510
Who would have thought

19
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,430
the City Lord

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,030
would actually be a woman?

21
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,260
I, Sun Jun, love beautiful women the most in my life.

22
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,910
But I've never been with

23
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,490
a beauty who's also a lord...

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,120
How dare you!

25
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,170
This is the City Lord's Mansion.

26
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,900
Guards! Guards!

27
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,550
Guards!

28
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,090
My dear.

29
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,250
I'm so glad you're here.

30
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,670
Help me.

31
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,150
He wants to kill me!

32
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm sorry, My Lord.

33
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,270
What do you mean?

34
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,190
No wonder.

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,240
No wonder no one is around.

36
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,230
Nanfeng...

37
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,820
Lady Dowager asked you

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,320
to take her out of the palace as soon as possible.

39
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,600
Mr. Yuan.

40
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,040
Why is City Lord not back yet?

41
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,950
City Lord?

42
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,760
Isn't she having a secret talk with Yandan's envoy?

43
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,570
What's wrong?

44
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,480
I don't know why, but I'm feeling uneasy.

45
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,870
Feeling uneasy?

46
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,590
Your Majesty.

47
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,780
Yandan's envoy has already taken action.

48
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,190
This is my favorite brush.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,890
It's made of rat whiskers and bamboo textiles.

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,160
It's just that

51
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,540
I failed to control my emotions last time

52
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,830
and broke it.

53
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,670
If you ask me, Your Majesty,

54
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,810
just throw this brush away.

55
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Why keep it?

56
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,300
What do you think?

57
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,330
I want to keep it as a souvenir.

58
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,070
She's the child I raised myself.

59
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,130
Yet she bit me.

60
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,350
Dezi.

61
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,430
Do you think I'm ruthless,

63
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,280
and I'm betraying our country for power?

64
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,790
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,460
What are you talking about?

66
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,200
You

67
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,670
are only doing business with Yandan.

68
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,640
How can this be considered as treason?

69
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,210
But I actually am committing treason.

70
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,990
If I can't have this power,

71
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,050
I'd rather destroy it.

72
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,909
Bastard! Shameless!

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,980
Untie me right now!

74
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,890
Otherwise,

75
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,930
I will tear you into pieces!

76
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,430
Keep yelling.

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,090
The angrier you are, the more excited I get.

78
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,220
[East Gate]

79
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,470
Who's in the carriage?

80
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,310
Yan... Yandan's envoy is drunk.

81
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,430
Lift the curtain and let us check.

82
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,140
City Lord rewarded him with a beautiful woman.

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,910
They're making out.

84
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,780
This is the token of Her Ladyship.

85
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,630
You're free to go.

86
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,890
Sorry, I'm late.

87
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,760
You're finally here.

88
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,630
It's okay.

89
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,590
It's okay.

90
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,909
It's okay.

91
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,350
It's okay.

92
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,550
Let's go.

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,550
Come on.

94
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,860
I'll take you home right now.

95
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,740
Don't be afraid. Let's go.

96
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,110
Hurry up.

97
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,390
Anyway,

98
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,760
I was saved in the end,

99
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,910
though it was a bit different from what I imagined.

100
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,790
Ms. Feng, it's me.

101
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,850
I'm Jiyue.

102
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
Are you okay?

103
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm sorry, Jiyue.

104
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,760
I... I'm traumatized.

105
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,740
It's okay.

106
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,350
Speaking of which,

107
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,640
I should say sorry.

108
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,090
I didn't expect

109
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,840
the City Lord I had been trying to assassinate

110
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,790
would actually be you.

111
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,340
I didn't expect

112
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,600
you to be

113
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,870
the leader of the killer organization imprisoned by Lady Dowager, either.

114
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,140
Stop!

115
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,830
Ms. Feng, it's me.

116
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,310
I'm Jiyue.

117
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,540
You're really something.

118
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,800
No, no.

119
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,500
Come to think of it, I should thank Mr. Sima.

120
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,350
He wiped out our organization,

121
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,670
and all those top killers of our organization died.

122
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm the richest among them,

123
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,520
so I became the leader.

124
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,580
Speaking of which,

125
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,430
how long have I been in a coma?

126
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,550
Where is Sima Qi?

127
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,570
It's been three days.

128
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,180
Over the past three days,

129
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,870
he's been here with you all along.

130
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,520
How is Feng Yi?

131
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:03,990
You're finally awake.

132
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,010
I'll take my leave.

133
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,520
Are you okay?

134
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,470
Do you still feel uncomfortable somewhere?

135
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,190
Come here.

136
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,190
When do you plan to

137
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,470
tell City Lord about her death?

138
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,760
Lady Dowager will hold the funeral for City Lord in three days.

139
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,970
City Lord will become the late City Lord...

140
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,180
Lower your voice.

141
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,470
She can hear us.

142
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,330
There's no one here.

143
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Jiyue!

144
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,870
It's such a long corridor.

145
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,280
If you want to whisper,

146
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,160
why do you have to do it near my bed?

147
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,380
Tell me.

148
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,950
When did I die?

149
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,790
Is the person in front of you now

150
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,630
a ghost?

151
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,550
Say it.

152
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,870
My Lord.

153
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,030
Do you remember

154
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,190
you were once drugged by Yuan Qingheng with supplements and left the city to avoid trouble?

155
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,330
You complained that you met a maid who volunteered to sleep with you.

156
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,860
My Lord.

157
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,790
I remember it vaguely.

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,290
That's why

159
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,430
I was diagnosed with poisoning by Jiyue.

160
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,650
But what does this have to do with my death?

161
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,440
That maid's name is Qiang Wei.

162
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
Lady Dowager has been planning

163
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,260
something big since then.

164
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,750
Feng Yi.

165
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
Look. I'm back, aren't I?

166
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,170
We could have lived in peace.

167
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,760
You could have been an idle city lord

168
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,930
and let me run the government. Wouldn't that be great?

169
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,190
You forced me

170
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,530
to become like this.

171
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,500
Dezi.

172
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,130
Is everything ready?

174
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,200
Your Majesty,

175
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,960
everything is ready.

176
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,000
Time for morning court!

177
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,970
W-What's going on?

178
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,100
City Lord was accidentally killed by another city.

179
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,810
His body hasn't been returned yet.

180
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,820
I'm heartbroken.

181
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,330
However, the city cannot operate without a lord for even a day.

182
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,760
God favors me,

183
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
and I found

184
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,820
a concubine who was once

185
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,460
bedded by City Lord.

186
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,680
The Bedtime Record, the eunuchs and maids who witnessed this,

187
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,910
and various records of Qiang Wei's action

188
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,780
are all evidence that can prove that

189
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,720
the child in her womb is the descendant of the Feng's Family.

190
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,030
I asked the Heavenly Chamber to tell fortunes all night.

191
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,040
The baby in her womb

192
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,030
is the hope God bestowed upon our city.

193
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,190
It's a boy.

194
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,290
From now on,

195
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,280
this child's name will be Yuejin.

196
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,390
and he will be crowned lord.

197
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,910
I wonder if you have any objections, ministers?
