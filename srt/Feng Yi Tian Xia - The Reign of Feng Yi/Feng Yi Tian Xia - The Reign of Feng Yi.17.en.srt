00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,940
[Episode 17]

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,990
Welcome back, My Lord!

3
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,990
Open it and take a look.

4
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,990
My Lord, is this...

5
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,910
That's right.

6
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,910
The truth of the military pay deficit case is recorded here.

7
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,350
This... This...

8
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,430
This case was committed by the Yue Family

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,430
in collusion with some scumbags in the imperial court and the army.

10
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,590
They embezzled a huge amount of military pay.

11
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,550
It's unforgivable.

12
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,630
My Lord, this case involves too many significant parties,

13
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,150
especially the Yue Family.

14
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,700
We cannot act rashly.

15
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,470
Please think twice, My Lord.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,970
The truth is right in front of us.

17
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,259
There's no need to hesitate anymore.

18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,870
On my command.

19
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,070
Arrest everyone

20
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,620
on this list!

21
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,240
Help, Your Majesty!

22
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,470
Your Majesty, help!

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,050
Help!

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,220
Your Majesty, save me!

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,820
Help! Your Majesty!

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,910
Help, Your Majesty!

27
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,470
Please help us!

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,660
You're disobeying City Lord's order

29
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,910
and begging Lady Dowager instead?

30
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,110
How dare you be so rebellious!

31
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,030
Take them all away!

32
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,990
Help, Your Majesty!

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,590
Help, Your Majesty!

34
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:13,950
Go.

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,030
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

36
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,740
Help, Your Majesty!

37
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,590
Help, Your Majesty!

38
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,150
Help, Your Majesty!

39
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,310
Your Majesty, save me!

40
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,329
Your Majesty!

41
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,120
Help!

42
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,430
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,790
According to the law of Fengyao City,

44
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,350
the morning court is where the lord and officials meet to discuss official business.

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,360
No outsiders are allowed to be here.

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,010
Please go back to the palace to rest, Your Majesty.

47
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,340
Your Majesty, don't worry.

48
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,390
From now on, this place will be under my charge.

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,790
You...

50
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,200
This is nice.

51
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,380
I'm too old.

52
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,020
My health

53
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,240
is getting worse day by day.

54
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,070
From now on,

55
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,530
please handle everything carefully yourself, My Lord.

56
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,510
Dezi.

57
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,710
Take me back to the palace to rest.

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,900
Yes.

60
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,030
Grand Commander.

61
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,350
What took you so long?

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,750
I just dealt with the military pay case.

63
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,150
That's why I'm late.

64
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,950
Please forgive me, My Lord.

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,640
Thank you.

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,460
This time, we successfully made Lady Dowager return the power.

67
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,370
But I feel uneasy, My Lord.

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,040
It went too smoothly.

69
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,480
I feel like it's not over yet.

70
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,430
It's okay.

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm not afraid of her anymore.

72
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,909
Thank you for giving me the courage

73
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,630
to believe in myself

74
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,350
and stand up against my mother.

75
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,940
My Lord.

76
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,500
You and Sima Qi...

77
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,950
My Lord!

78
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,680
My Lord, I finally found you...

79
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,050
You...

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,409
You... You...

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,070
Why are you wearing women's clothes?

82
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,950
So, there's really no love between you and Nanfeng?

83
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,390
At this rate,

84
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,590
Nanfeng will have to stay with someone

85
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,110
who will never love her.

86
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,230
No.

87
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,310
I can't let Nanfeng live like a widow forever.

88
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,150
I won't allow it.

89
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,800
So what you want is to free Nanfeng?

90
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,490
What's your relationship with Her Ladyship?

91
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,370
It's been more than ten years,

92
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,460
and Her Ladyship has always been...

93
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,830
Like a sister to him.

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,990
The Yue Family and the Yuan Family have been friends for generations.

95
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,270
So he's treated me as his own younger sister since we were little.

96
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,590
Nanfeng.

97
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,500
I...

98
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,590
Nanfeng.

99
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,390
Nanfeng.

100
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,500
Don't blame His Lordship.

101
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,430
On the first day of our wedding, he told me

102
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,510
he couldn't like women.

103
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,400
Then why did he choose you?

104
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,020
It was because of Lady Dowager.

105
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,710
She didn't want her niece to suffer,

106
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,390
so she chose me, the illegitimate daughter of the Yue Family,

107
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,180
to marry City Lord.

108
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,510
She even controlled my father,

109
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,470
so I had to

110
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,070
do her bidding all these years.

111
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,900
Is this why you chose to help His Lordship

112
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,470
to investigate the military pay deficit case?

113
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,360
Yes.

114
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,510
He's also one of Lady Dowager's pawns,

115
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,260
just like me.

116
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,870
But even a pawn

117
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,550
would want to be free some day.

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,400
You must have had a hard time

119
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,310
these years.

120
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,320
But why didn't you tell me earlier?

121
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,490
What's the use of telling you?

122
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,040
No matter who he loves,

123
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,230
he's the City Lord,

124
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,180
and I'm his wife.

125
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,910
Nanfeng.

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,790
I...

127
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,530
Do you think

128
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,510
there's something going on between

129
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,270
Nanfeng and Yuan Qingheng?

130
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,520
I think the same thing as you.

131
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,960
It's all my fault.

132
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,870
All these years,

133
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,390
she could've lived a better life if it weren't for me.

134
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,270
You had no choice, either.

135
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,790
It's okay.

136
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,390
But

137
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,910
I'm very happy now.

138
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,380
I don't want to be happy alone.

139
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,970
I want everyone I love to be happy.

140
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,240
If there's anything I can do,

141
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,140
I'll definitely help you.

142
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,550
Next month,

143
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,380
Yandan will send the betrothal gifts here.

144
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,420
I've read the list of the betrothal gifts.

145
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,310
There's a suspended animation pill included.

146
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,100
We can let Nanfeng take this suspended animation pill

147
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,260
and have Yuan Qingheng take her out.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,230
Good idea.

149
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,810
As the saying goes,

150
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,490
the affectionate is always hurt by the heartless.

151
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,350
Greetings, Your Majesty.

152
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,570
Rise.

153
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,980
It's been so many years,

154
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,600
yet you

155
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
still can't let go of that guy, Yuan, right?

156
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,960
My relationship with him is like that of a brother and sister.

157
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,820
Do you even believe it yourself?

158
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,550
Although Yuan Qingheng is absurd in his doings,

159
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,130
he does work pretty hard

160
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,420
for you two to be together.

161
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,170
But what about you?

162
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,030
You call yourself affectionate,

163
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,720
but all you've done is waiting.

164
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,260
Can't you

165
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,570
try a little harder for him?

166
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,750
Your Majesty, what exactly do you want to say?

167
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,030
Please specify.

168
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,740
Do one last thing for me.

169
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,150
If you get it done, I'll let you out of the palace,

170
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,530
and I'll let go of your father.
