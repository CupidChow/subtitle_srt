1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,094
STRANGER

3
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,390
It was me.

4
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,644
I met up with Moo-sung Park
the night before he died.

5
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,147
I did it alone.

6
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,068
I was also the one who called
from our Public Service Center.

7
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,698
I met him to ask him for a favor.

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,117
I wanted to ask him to disclose
that my dad was set up

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,620
and that he never accepted any bribes.

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,999
Moo-sung Park supplied the money,
but only the delivery man got caught.

11
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,085
When I found out whose money it was,

12
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,588
he was already in huge debt.

13
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,132
You probably thought
he had nothing to lose

14
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,134
and that he'd say yes to that.

15
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,221
But...

16
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,474
He belittled me.

17
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,391
Gosh.

18
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,143
That worthless scumbag dared

19
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,189
to go on about how I'm a woman
even though I'm a prosecutor.

20
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,527
I had been waiting for that moment.

21
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,238
I'm all my family has,

22
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,782
and that bastard belittled me.

23
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,412
I didn't do it.

24
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,332
I know why you went to see my dad
out of the blue as well as

25
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,460
why you asked about my boyfriend
and told the police officer about me,

26
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,963
but I did not kill him.

27
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,506
Why would I kill him?

28
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,925
I had to make him confess
that my dad is innocent.

29
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,888
Because he was not helpful and killing him
would become headline news.

30
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,889
Like now.

31
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,685
Do you think I'd kill someone
for that reason?

32
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,270
Then why did you eavesdrop?

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,357
Weren't you eavesdropping
when the police officer came by?

34
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,695
I did not kill anyone.

35
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,030
That was discourteous of me.

36
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,366
Mr. Hwang.

37
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,993
What?

38
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,498
Why do you always pretend

39
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,293
you don't know anything
when you know everything?

40
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,253
What do you think I know?

41
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,921
Mr. Lee is the culprit.

42
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,756
You said Moo-sung Park threatened him.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,259
That's a very strong motive.
Why did you try to sound me out?

44
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,094
You were rejected

45
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,220
and belittled.

46
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,639
Would you consider that as a weak motive?

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,976
You were the last person Mr. Park saw
before he got killed.

48
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,271
Had I not figured it out,
you would've kept your mouth shut.

49
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,278
Do you want me to think
that you're coming clean to me

50
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,448
so that you can dump it all on Mr. Lee
since I've figured it out? Is that it?

51
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,659
If I'm the culprit,
how will you explain that girl?

52
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,494
Why would I stab a girl I don't even know?

53
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,622
At the moment, that's only a claim
you're making.

54
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,460
You must've been extremely resentful
after he turned down your plea for help.

55
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,170
What if that's when you found that girl?

56
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,964
Did that young girl say no right away
when you asked her

57
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,883
to expose her relationship with Mr. Lee?

58
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,594
That's probably when you decided
to change your method.

59
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,804
"I should use this girl to punish Mr. Lee.

60
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,598
I should warn him."

61
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,225
In that direction.

62
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,897
I guess I acted all weak
when I'm actually such an evil person.

63
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,858
I carried and even hung
that unconscious girl,

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,237
yet I couldn't even lift that bundle.

65
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,364
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

66
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,658
Yes, she was hung

67
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,201
to be seen by the whole world.

68
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,745
Why would Mr. Lee do such a thing?

69
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,876
-That's...
-He'd want to take care of it quietly.

70
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,298
-Where are you going?
-To a restaurant.

71
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,801
How can you take off now?

72
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,636
They'll close if I don't leave now.

73
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,477
To ensure no one suspects him.

74
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,854
See? You're also questioning
why he'd do such a thing.

75
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,189
That must've been his intention...

76
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,444
Ga-young Kim
Age: 20

77
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,570
Prosecutor.

78
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,781
On the scene...

79
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,200
Let's say that
a police officer's fingerprint was found

80
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,618
on a weapon left on a crime scene.

81
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,829
Will the prosecution wait for us?

82
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,585
Put it down.

83
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,091
Will the prosecution wait for us?
Answer me.

84
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,386
Will you do nothing just because
the suspect is one of us in the police?

85
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,180
-That's nonsense.
-Then tell me.

86
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,933
Why do we have to
bend over backwards for him?

87
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,561
He said he touched the knife
to reenact the case.

88
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,979
Does that make any sense to you?

89
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,231
Who would believe that?
No one even saw it.

90
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,818
All right. Go get him.

91
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,695
I'll report to Chief again.

92
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,613
Let's go.

93
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,825
Come on, everyone.

94
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,038
I saw it.

95
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,376
I saw it.

96
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,796
I saw him trying to reenact
what happened at Moo-sung Park's place.

97
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,840
When?

98
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,718
The day we found out
that Jin-seob Kang isn't the killer.

99
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,470
That's when he did it.

100
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,847
He reenacted the crime

101
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,182
and figured out

102
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,933
that the killer posed as Moo-sung Park

103
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,019
and got captured
in the dash camera on purpose.

104
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,353
Are you serious?

105
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,023
Why would she say that
if she didn't see it?

106
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,567
Go ahead and arrest him
if you can't believe her.

107
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,111
Why didn't he say anything
about it though?

108
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,239
Did you go to see him that day?

109
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,574
Is that why the two of you...

110
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:10,578
I didn't go there to see him.
I was revisiting the scene.

111
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,456
We weren't there together.
I was just re-investigating the case.

112
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,541
Then what about you?

113
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,127
Where were you at that time?

114
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,341
I'm not even surprised.

115
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,261
You all had a witness
right in front of your eyes.

116
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,764
Was this fuss necessary?

117
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,935
Communicate more with your colleagues.

118
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,603
You're right.

119
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,855
You should also communicate more
with your colleagues

120
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,649
to avoid making
unnecessary trips like this.

121
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,824
Captain, about Moo-sung Park
and Ga-young Kim...

122
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,451
It's possible that the bar isn't
where they first met.

123
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,203
What do you mean?

124
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,420
His son, Kyung-wan Park,
who's in the military at the moment,

125
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,632
was a year ahead of Ga-young Kim
at the same high school.

126
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,217
A year?

127
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,512
-Then they must know each other.
-I asked other students about that.

128
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,390
Kyung-wan Park graduated two years ago,

129
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,600
so no one there really remembers him.

130
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,812
But Ga-young Kim used to be quite famous
for being pretty.

131
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,732
She stopped coming to school
at the beginning of 12th grade,

132
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,943
but many students still remember her.

133
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,069
So,

134
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,113
are you saying he took

135
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,657
his son's friend to a bar?

136
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,327
And paid her about five million won
per month?

137
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,582
-Gosh, that's insane.
-No, wait.

138
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,750
I don't know whether
they knew each other or not.

139
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,961
Tomorrow, I'll go to the army division
he belongs to and...

140
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,181
Wait, which division was it?

141
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,894
-Go there first thing tomorrow morning.
-Yes, sir.

142
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,941
His son, Kyung-wan Park,
who's in the military at the moment,

143
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,944
was a year ahead of Ga-young
at the same high school.

144
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,154
So,

145
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,281
are you saying he took

146
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,742
his son's friend to a bar?

147
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,120
This is taking a strange turn.

148
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,178
No way. The police were probably just
taking a wild guess.

149
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,473
-The internal investigation we halted.
-Yes?

150
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,099
Let's resume it.

151
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,355
Well, do you think
that he could actually be the culprit?

152
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,319
Is there something
my department doesn't know yet?

153
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,865
As far as we know, Mr. Hwang didn't have
those kinds of transactions with Mr. Park.

154
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,244
These days, many people act
without motives.

155
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,961
He's good at his job,
but that's not all that matters.

156
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,879
We do need to admit that he's different.

157
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,008
Whether he's exceptional or evil,

158
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,552
let's be the first to find out.

159
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,012
Are you saying he might have
some sort of a personality disorder?

160
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,445
This is the security team
at Hansung Seorak Resort.

Do some digging. It's your specialty.

Okay.

166
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,408
Women's perfume?

167
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,122
A mask.

168
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,005
Sunglasses, night, perfume.

169
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,057
He must've covered his face
to meet a woman.

170
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,687
Is Father asleep?

171
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,523
He went there.

172
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,070
The way the girl's body was placed
is quite unusual.

173
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,823
That is true.

174
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,411
He must've already thought that there's
a connection between me and that girl.

175
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,496
Honey.

176
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,707
Would you still

177
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,460
be with me even if I wasn't

178
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,712
Dad's daughter?

179
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,756
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

180
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,508
Answer my question.

181
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,012
I would've left a long time ago.

182
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,223
I see.

183
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,017
Hadn't you been his daughter,

184
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,019
I would have

185
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,979
left your father a long time ago.

186
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,441
All right.

187
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,862
Just put them in the sink.
The housekeeper will be here tomorrow.

188
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,158
I heard that she's young and pretty.

189
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,328
Who?

190
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,372
The girl in the news.

191
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,915
I bet

192
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,168
you're very upset about it.

193
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,766
She came out 13 minutes
after she went into his room.

194
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,394
I'm not sure now.

195
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,356
Was Mr. Lee telling me the truth?

196
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,824
What was that just now? She smiled.

197
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,621
Have you forgotten her nickname?

198
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,166
I'm asking if you've forgotten
what Mr. Park used to call her.

199
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,628
Bell.

200
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,630
It's because she always showed up.

201
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,674
He said she's like a doorbell
that is answered right away.

202
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,303
Do you think he rang that bell
only for me?

203
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,183
He threatened me saying that he'd kill me
and strangled me,

204
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,768
so I had no choice but to give it to him.

205
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,729
I jotted down his license plate number.

206
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,649
I had no idea it'd turn
into something like this though.

207
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,360
That psycho is the culprit.

208
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,741
Once, he even broke a classmate's finger
right in front of our teacher.

209
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,995
Why do you think everyone called him
a psycho? He really is a psycho.

210
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,484
We shouldn't skip meals.

211
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,422
I guess you couldn't explain properly
because you hadn't eaten.

212
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,260
Sure, it must've been very effective.

213
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,305
Had you said it yourself,
it would've looked like an excuse.

214
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,808
On the other hand, me telling everyone
that I saw you touching the knife

215
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,479
would make every doubt and suspicion
vanish in one blow.

216
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,441
You didn't even care about
how looking like a traitor

217
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,196
in front of my colleagues would make me
feel when I didn't even do anything wrong.

218
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,949
But you know what?

219
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,285
I have no interest in proving it for you.

220
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,164
But I can order you some food
when you're locked up in the holding cell,

221
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,249
Mr. Suspect.

222
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,048
Jin-seob Kang will be livid
if he hears about this in the underworld.

223
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,133
Those with power and money
sure can get out of anything.

224
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,302
I have no money just like him.

225
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,977
Ga-young Kim.

226
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,354
Did you know her too?

227
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,482
Did the two of you

228
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,402
do it?

229
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,683
Did you two really...

230
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,483
Goodness.

231
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,784
Who was in the room?

232
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,620
Mr. Chang-jun Lee.

233
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,630
Goodbye.

234
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,179
-You're the culprit, aren't you?
-Pardon?

235
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,059
You said the culprit is trying to frame me
as he bears grudges against me.

236
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,561
Gosh, I'm speechless.

237
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,980
How can you say such a thing
when I bought you a meal?

238
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,983
Why would I be holding
grudges against you?

239
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,111
That I don't know.

240
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,780
To frame me for it,

241
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,491
the culprit must've known
that I touched the knife.

242
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,493
I thought hard about it,

243
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,496
and you were the only one
who knew about it.

244
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,082
Then could there have been

245
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,042
someone else in that house?

246
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,877
No way.

247
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,131
The culprit wouldn't have gotten
Jin-seob Kang involved

248
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,299
if his goal was to frame me
for the murder.

249
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,678
Then it's probably not about
dumping what he did on you.

250
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,515
He's either trying to tease me or pull me.

251
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,143
Why though? Pull you toward what?

252
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,477
I'm not sure.

253
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,729
Like you said,

254
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,566
let's just catch him and ask him directly.

255
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,901
Now, I have to see what he looks like.

256
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,655
Don't get pulled in so deep.

257
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,116
I'll get you out of there
no matter what, but...

258
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,703
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

259
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,792
Are you a fan or what?

260
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,546
I heard that song when I called her.

261
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,882
It was after she got abducted though.

262
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,467
Back then, I didn't know.

263
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,185
From where?

264
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,604
From the beginning or the chorus?

265
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,231
-Is that important?
-From where did you hear?

266
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,695
I don't know, I don't

267
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,864
What? Are you sure it's the same song?

268
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,703
The man who was in the room at the end
of the hallway at the resort...

269
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,830
Wasn't it the prosecutor in charge
of Ga-young Kim's case?

270
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,249
Dong-jae Seo? No. Why do you ask?

271
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,502
That's his ringtone.

272
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,171
You didn't know
when you see him every day?

273
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,757
We put our phones on vibrate at work.

274
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,342
Now, you know.

275
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,227
You two, again?

276
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,908
-From that part?
-Yes, from there.

277
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,997
Si-mok.

278
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,778
What's up?

279
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,073
What is this about? What are you doing?

280
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,201
-I'm sorry?
-Did you press the wrong number?

281
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,871
I did. My apologies.

282
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,707
Goodness.

283
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,174
That means he has Ga-young's phone.
That suitcase...

284
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,302
What if it's in there?

285
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,637
He'd make sure to keep it with him.

286
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,931
What if he destroys it?

287
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,101
Let's go back to where it started.

288
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,820
Hello, welcome.

289
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,031
My gosh, a couple is here.

290
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,741
Will other people be joining you?

291
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,201
This perfume.

292
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,621
It must've been your perfume that
I smelled from Prosecutor Dong-jae Seo.

293
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,624
It looks like you met him
about two to three hours ago.

294
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,793
Why did he meet up with you again?

295
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,130
To make sure you tell no one
about giving him Min-ah's address?

296
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,301
What are you talking about? Who?

297
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,261
I didn't meet anyone.

298
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,305
This isn't that perfume.

299
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,059
I'm certain it's not.
This is a completely different one.

300
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,562
You have a room, right?

301
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,107
Meet us there.

302
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,612
Would you like to order the basics?

303
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,035
Thank you.

304
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,841
While giving your statement, you said
that you don't know Min-ah's address.

305
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,802
Why did you lie?

306
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,596
Who said it's a lie?

307
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,767
The prosecutor showed up and grilled you,
so you probably had no choice.

308
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,645
Who knows what he'll do to you
if you get on his wrong side?

309
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,606
So? Did you say
that you don't have her address

310
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,108
when you actually gave it to him?

311
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,194
Your girls obviously
won't want to work for a boss

312
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,113
who gives away their addresses.

313
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,282
Even if that's why you lied...

314
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,076
You must be a very discreet person.

315
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,538
You kept it to yourself
even though she got stabbed.

316
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,548
How dare you do this
at my place of business?

317
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,719
She was found brutally harmed.
You're a woman too.

318
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,015
You're both in this tough business.
How could you only think about yourself?

319
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,601
You gave her address to a stranger,

320
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,604
and she was found abandoned in someone's
bathroom with stab wounds all over her.

321
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,607
And you were only concerned
about the losses you might have to face?

322
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,567
That's not true.

323
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,610
I did give him her address.

324
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,240
He caused such a ruckus after she got
away, so I gave it to him secretly.

325
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,201
But he didn't do it.

326
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,621
How do you know that?

327
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,041
I told him where she lives,
but he came back a couple of hours later.

328
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,501
He said she already fled.

329
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,879
Then he even had drinks here.

330
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,048
Gosh, don't be such an amateur. Tell me.

331
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,551
You must've seen all sorts of things.
Did you actually believe that?

332
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,970
He obviously came back here
and told you that he couldn't

333
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,723
find her and that she had already fled
when he got there because he knew

334
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,475
exactly what was going to happen later.
I know you thought about all this.

335
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,855
He's a prosecutor.

336
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,403
Whom can we trust
if we can't trust prosecutors?

337
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,782
You had to trust him.

338
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,995
Only then, you can think that her getting
stabbed like that wasn't your fault.

339
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,917
He can't be the culprit because you're
the one who gave him her address.

340
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,796
-It's not like that.
-What time did you give him her address?

341
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,966
You said he came back and caused a ruckus
after she got away.

342
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,927
Was it immediately after that?

343
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,680
I guess you gave in
only after a few minutes.

344
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,266
Then what did you two
talk about earlier today?

345
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,103
"Let's say you didn't give me her address
and that I never went there."

346
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,481
Is that what you've decided to do
for both of your sakes?

347
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,696
You must think you can walk
all over people like me.

348
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,492
Everyone is just talking about who
stabbed her. No one cares about her.

349
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,994
Of course no one would care.
She's just a bar girl.

350
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,581
Those pricks who beat up girls
in this business don't even get punished.

351
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,376
Why are you making me
look like a complete bitch?

352
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,835
So?

353
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,258
Are you saying you'll join hands
with those who stab and beat up girls?

354
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,270
Is it because you're scared?

355
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,439
Did Prosecutor Seo threaten you?

356
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,530
You can stay if you're going to drink.
Otherwise, you should leave.

357
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,326
I've lost enough business
because the word has already spread.

358
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,461
About Min-ah's address...

359
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,340
Will it make you feel better if I tell you

360
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,883
that someone else gave it away too?

361
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,886
It's the on-call driver.

362
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,392
He gave her address to a guy whom
he called a psycho

363
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,686
and didn't tell her because
he didn't want to lose customers.

364
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,063
That prick...

365
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,733
At least he reported it to the police.

366
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,027
What did you do?

367
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,712
I guess you come here often.

368
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,071
Prosecutor Seo is the one
who found this bar,

369
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,783
and he's been after her.
You must've been suspicious of him.

370
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,826
Why did you hide it from me?

371
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,204
I didn't hide it.

372
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,665
-I guess I'm just like them after all.
-What do you mean?

373
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,334
People at work.

374
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,836
He has no connections through school.

375
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,173
Are you trying to tell me that
he's not a Seoul University graduate?

376
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,883
So what?

377
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,886
Now, he's glued to Mr. Lee
trying to get on his good side,

378
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,264
but he's not considered
one of the best ones in the department.

379
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,644
So you assumed he wouldn't be able
to find her address.

380
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,313
You probably thought,
"I can do it, but he can't."

381
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,690
You must've had
a sense of superiority toward him.

382
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,402
A sense of superiority?

383
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,737
Did I have something like that?

384
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,866
He passed the bar exam too.
You shouldn't have underestimated him.

385
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,660
It's definitely a sense of superiority.

386
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,828
You're right.

387
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,082
I can't believe the only thing I can feel
is a sense of superiority.

388
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,796
The only thing you can feel? You make it
sound like you can't feel other emotions.

389
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,595
Hang on. Give me a minute.

390
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,683
I'll explain it in a way
that's easier to understand.

391
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,601
Have a look.

392
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,985
Why are you dissecting the brain?

393
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,612
What are you talking about?
I'm drawing the internal structure.

394
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,072
The structure of your brain.

395
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,240
Look.

396
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,577
Your determination to solve the case
takes up this part here.

397
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,790
This tiny part here is where
your sense of superiority resides.

398
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,042
Let's say that this small part

399
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,336
is your obsession with the soupy rice dish
we had earlier.

400
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,880
Then what's this part?

401
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,340
Other feelings.

402
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,177
Your other feelings.
You just don't show them.

403
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,554
Whether they're good or not.

404
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,557
I'm not sure.

405
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,185
Do you believe aliens exist?

406
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,603
Yes.

407
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,438
Why?

408
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,442
Otherwise, it'd be a waste of space.

409
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,778
Exactly. The same goes for this.

410
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:45,992
It's a gift for you.

411
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,704
Let's go.

412
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,249
Get in.

413
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,464
Get in! I'll give you a ride.

414
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,013
Hold on.

415
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,433
How will we figure out
what Prosecutor Seo did after this?

416
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
Some people don't need alibis.

417
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,191
Do you think he hired
a contract killer or something?

418
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,151
It's not like
this is a Hong Kong noir film.

419
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,362
He has connections,

420
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,407
from petty criminals he met through cases
to chairmans of big companies.

421
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,287
Who else are you thinking?

422
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,624
-Sorry?
-You said "some people."

423
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,460
"Some people don't need alibis."

424
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,421
Is there another person who can do
something like this without getting

425
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,131
blood on his own hands?

426
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,385
If it's the man you saw in the security
camera footage from the resort...

427
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,639
Chief Kim.

428
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,892
There's another suspect.

429
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,978
Here's one too.

430
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:05,655
It's brewing distrust amongst us.
Crime is such a...

431
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,741
Don't you think it's so sad?

432
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,620
"Amongst us"?

433
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,039
Yes. Why?

434
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,191
Bye.

435
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,613
Goodness.

436
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,675
Chief

437
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,177
Ga-young Kim

438
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,347
Si-mok Hwang

439
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,326
Don't slouch like that!

440
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,705
Why does he always walk like that?
It doesn't suit him.

441
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,666
It makes him look intimidated.

442
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,620
Gosh. Goodness.

443
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,586
Are you really back? For good?

444
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,255
Yes.

445
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,674
I don't need to go back.
I finished my service early.

446
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,592
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

447
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,470
Thank you, everyone in the military.

448
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,308
Grandma. I'll be by your side
from now on, okay?

449
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:40,893
I won't go anywhere.

450
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,562
Gosh.

451
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,713
Here's the next news.

452
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,425
The victim's identity has been confirmed,
but she's still unconscious.

453
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,470
The victim was initially thought to be
a 25-year-old female, Ms. Kwon,

454
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,512
but she turned out to be

455
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,098
a 20-year-old employee
of an adult entertainment establishment.

456
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,102
The police are focusing on figuring out
her relationship to the late Mr. Park.

457
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,814
They are gathering additional statements
from the victim's family and friends,

458
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,024
and around the crime scene...

459
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,027
I'm sorry, but could you please
change the channel?

460
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,820
-...planning to investigate thoroughly.
-Sure.

461
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,447
Meanwhile, the prosecution...

462
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,639
By the way, where's your stuff?

463
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,144
I dropped off everything
at my friend's place just in case.

464
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,272
You at least need a change of clothes.

465
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,859
-I'll take you.
-Well, it's okay.

466
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,947
Let's go together. I'm heading out anyway.
I can drop you off there.

467
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,449
Where are you going this late?
You should get some rest.

468
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,160
I know, right?
We have an emergency though.

469
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,703
Let's go.

470
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,625
But buses won't be running on my way back.

471
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,628
-Where's your friend's place?
-In Yongin.

472
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,215
Getting back is one thing, but I think
it's too late to visit anyone's home.

473
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,385
I'll just go by myself tomorrow morning.

474
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,806
All right, then. Get some rest.

475
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,768
You couldn't even lie down for a moment.

476
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,146
You barely had enough time to get changed.

477
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,446
Wait.

478
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,407
Yes.

479
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,578
I'm sorry, but when do you think
we'll be able to go back to our place?

480
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,787
You want to go back there?

481
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,623
Yes, we don't have anywhere else to go.

482
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,251
And it's my grandmother's house.

483
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,295
That is true.

484
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,340
At least she renounced the succession
quickly and managed to protect the house.

485
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,635
I suggested it to her.

486
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,559
You remember Ga-young Kim, right?

487
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,477
Yes.

488
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,564
Did you know that girl in the news
was Ga-young?

489
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:35,860
Yes.

490
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,445
How?

491
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,408
My friends who saw the photo
on social media

492
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,827
said that she looked like Ga-young.
I wasn't sure at first,

493
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,080
but I became more certain of it later on
due to messages from my friends and so on.

494
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,082
Were the two of you close?

495
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,794
Gosh, no. I've never even talked to her.

496
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,590
She was so popular that kids from other
schools used to come to see her. I was...

497
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,426
But why was she found
in my grandmother's house?

498
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,553
What happened?

499
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,056
We're still investigating the case.

500
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,183
Come to the police station tomorrow.

501
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,560
Why should I...

502
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,854
Just for a simple interview
as a referential witness.

503
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,564
Your grandmother did it too.

504
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,860
Just tell her that you're going out
to pick up your stuff.

505
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,697
Okay.

506
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,118
Anyway, thank you for looking after
my grandmother and everything else.

507
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,329
Don't mention it. Go back inside.

508
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,705
All right.

509
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,681
DELETE PHOTO

510
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,475
DELETE PHOTO

511
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,956
Kyung-wan, didn't you have a crush on her?
Everyone had a crush on her though.

512
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:14,875
PARTICIPANTS

513
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,918
LEAVE THE CHAT ROOM

514
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,566
Is there anything you want to eat?

515
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,485
I'm craving everything.

516
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,613
Actually, no. I don't have much appetite.

517
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,116
Why? Just tell me.
I'll make you whatever you want to eat.

518
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,161
What do you feel like eating?

519
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,163
I'll buy you everything you want to eat.

520
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,628
What's wrong, Grandma?
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

521
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,839
It's okay.

522
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,363
Your other feelings.
You just don't show them.

523
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,450
Why?

524
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,453
Why didn't he finish her?

525
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,873
Or he might've wanted
to mete out a bigger punishment.

526
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,876
So that she can't function
even if she wakes up.

527
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,173
Have you gotten into an alliance
with someone

528
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,674
to stop my promotion?

529
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:47,843
Alliance?

530
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,346
With whom?

531
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,848
I did not kill anyone.

532
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,851
The woman.

533
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,397
I did not kill anyone.

534
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,191
The woman.

535
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,778
A warning. A punishment.

536
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,989
Someone who can punish Mr. Lee.

537
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,549
Yun-beom Lee

538
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,140
Yun-beom Lee, Chang-jun Lee, Dong-jae Seo
Eun-soo Young, Il-jae Young

539
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,059
Chief of Yongsan Police Station

540
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,980
The ones who wanted Moo-sung Park dead.

541
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,734
The ones who want Ga-young Kim
to disappear.

542
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,653
Yun-beom Lee

543
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,156
Chang-jun Lee, Dong-jae Seo, Eun-soo Young

544
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,074
Chief of Yongsan Police Station

545
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,911
The ones who would wish to punish Mr. Lee.

546
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:02,001
Yun-beom Lee, Dong-jae Seo, Eun-soo Young

547
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,090
Il-jae Young

548
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,468
How have you been?

549
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,306
Did you want to see me because you were
curious about how I was doing?

550
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,351
Si-mok.

551
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,062
Eun-soo...

552
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,773
Please keep my daughter safe.

553
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,359
Please do it for me.

554
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,739
She's still young.

555
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,700
She may think that she knows everything,

556
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,370
but I bet she neither has any idea
how insidious this world can be

557
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,415
nor how people can be.

558
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,793
She's still a kid.

559
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:49,006
A spring chicken who's confused because
she's armed with intellect and title.

560
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,051
You're the one

561
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,388
who taught me not to become a prosecutor
who just collects his paycheck.

562
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,098
Right.

563
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,229
What if someone finds out
that she's been snooping around?

564
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,484
Even the girl who got slashed brutally

565
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,320
probably thought that she'd be able
to protect herself.

566
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,198
She's very young,

567
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,118
but I'm sure she was already confident
that she could control men.

568
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:23,082
I couldn't even read the article
about that case.

569
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,168
Who's the culprit?

570
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,423
Why are you asking me?

571
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,634
You're not worried about your daughter

572
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,346
fulfilling her duty and striving
to catch the culprit.

573
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,560
If the person who made you fall hard
three years ago wasn't the culprit,

574
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,231
you wouldn't need to worry about her
ending up like that girl.

575
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,444
I don't think you're asking me
to protect her because you trust me.

576
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,947
Isn't it because you've concluded

577
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,784
that the culprit is always lurking
around the two of us?

578
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,370
Are you referring to Chang-jun?

579
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,414
It's not him.

580
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,166
I trained him.

581
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,545
You only spent six months with me
at the training institute,

582
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,132
but he spent ten long years with me.

583
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,885
He disrespected all those years with you
and betrayed you.

584
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,721
Can you still be certain
that it wasn't him?

585
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:24,143
Everyone is born with a certain set
of personality traits.

586
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,895
The essence never changes.

587
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,898
Ten years with you
and another ten years after that.

588
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,526
Then another ten years have passed,
and there have been so many changes.

589
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,653
Chang-jun would never stab
or kill anyone just to fulfill

590
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,156
his own selfish gain
because he's not wired that way.

591
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,162
It's Yun-beom Lee.

592
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,873
It's all his doing.

593
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,418
All his life,

594
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,087
he's only been interested
in his own gains.

595
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,467
To him, harming Eun-soo

596
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,722
would just be like twisting a kid's neck.

597
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,809
Protect her so that she doesn't jump
into a pit of fire.

598
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,727
Please.

599
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,856
I can't promise you that.

600
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,445
Ms. Young is neither a kid
nor a weak woman.

601
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,947
Being a strong person doesn't mean
she can protect herself in this.

602
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,659
If you tell me to get stabbed
in place of her, I can do it.

603
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,120
But do you think it's possible
to control anyone?

604
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:26,955
It's not.

605
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,792
I should get going.

606
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,462
Don't you know
that I'm desperately worried...

607
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,340
Il-jae Young

608
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,720
Everyone is just after
the one whom they want to slay.

609
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,765
Dong-jae wants me gone.

610
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,393
Il-jae Young is after Yun-beom Lee.

611
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,396
Then why do I keep

612
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,481
circling around Mr. Lee?

613
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,531
-Hello?
-I'll keep it short as we don't have time.

614
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,951
Prosecutor Seo will come to our station
soon to interview Kyung-wan Park.

615
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,536
Kyung-wan Park?

616
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,414
He was discharged early
due to financial difficulty.

617
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,000
He's just a referential witness.
Why is Mr. Seo going there?

618
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,212
He and Ga-young know each other.

619
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,922
They went to the same high school.

620
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:21,969
Anyway, it means there will be
no one in Prosecutor Seo's office.

621
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,513
Shall we trap the rabbit?

622
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,723
Trap the rabbit?

623
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,601
Sure, let's do it.

624
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,197
About Ga-young's phone...

625
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,950
If I were him, I'd make sure
to always keep it within my reach

626
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,869
even if I'm planning
to destroy it later on.

627
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,246
But I wouldn't be able
to carry it around all the time.

628
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,505
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR DONG-JAE SEO

629
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,232
Have you been abusing your brain cells?

630
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,527
It looks like you've forgotten
where your office is.

631
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,657
Mr. Hwang. Something is going on, right?

632
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,038
I may be able to help you.
What's the matter?

633
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,792
Please keep Eun-soo safe.
Please do it for me.

634
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,797
Eun-soo.

635
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,063
-Is he inside?
-He stepped out. What's the matter?

636
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,149
What should we do? I can't find the file
you said you gave me yesterday.

637
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,275
Gosh, which one?

638
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,529
Did you forget that I'm taking care
of the trial and send it in already?

639
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,198
No way. I gave you everything yesterday.

640
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,117
I can't find it anywhere in my office.

641
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,496
The deadline is today. The suspect will be
let go if we can't find it.

642
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,916
Please go to the court and try to find it.
It may be in the pile from this office.

643
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,710
That can't be.
I double-checked everything.

644
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,605
-I'll look through my room again.
-Okay.

645
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,346
What are you looking for?
What is it, Mr. Hwang?

646
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,223
A cell phone.

647
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,267
Whose phone? What's the number?

648
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,935
That won't work. It's off.

649
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:04,376
I got so scared for a second
thinking you were Mr. Seo.

650
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,586
What are you doing here?

651
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,757
I lost a file he gave me.

652
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,843
Which file? Where did you leave it?

653
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,302
Wait. Just a second, please.

654
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,096
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

655
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,893
You found it? I had no idea it'd be there.

656
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,395
Okay.

657
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,521
They found it.

658
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,733
Please don't tell Mr. Seo about it.

659
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,401
He'll scold me.

660
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:31,903
All right.

661
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,866
-I'll buy you coffee instead.
-What? You don't have to.

662
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,159
-Let's go.
-It's really fine.

663
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,827
-Come on.
-You don't have to buy me coffee.

664
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,248
What kind of coffee do you like?

665
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,292
I just drink the ones
from vending machines.

666
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,668
Let's go.

667
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:08,982
Try this.

668
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:12,319
It'll be 100 times better than the ones
from vending machines because I made it.

669
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,445
Thanks.

670
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,953
It is 100 times better
than lattes sold at cafes.

671
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,622
Is it because you made it?

672
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,960
It even smells amazing.

673
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:34,966
Hello.

674
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,308
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

675
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,902
JUNG-BON KIM

676
00:51:58,657 --> 00:51:59,533
JUNG-BON KIM

677
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,836
PROSECUTOR EUN-SOO YOUNG

678
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,344
What are you looking for?
What is it, Mr. Hwang?

679
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,262
A cell phone.

680
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,472
Last October,

681
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,308
Mr. Park sent an underage girl to you.

682
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,813
Last October.
How does he even know the date?

683
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,856
And today,

684
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,024
that underage girl was found.

685
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,610
That girl, whom you've been
so desperately looking for,

686
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,946
was found nearly dead.

687
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,117
Then, Ga-young Kim is Chang-jun Lee's...

688
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,163
What are those? They are
for the special prostitution crackdown.

689
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,624
Chang-jun Lee...

690
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,334
Dong-jae Seo...

691
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,420
Ga-young Kim.

692
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,088
A cell phone.

693
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,137
-You're already here.
-Yes.

694
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,932
What's gotten into you? I never thought
you'd call me first to grab food with me.

695
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:09,185
Thanks to you, I was able to get
to the scene early.

696
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,813
Look at you. You've finally
become a little nicer.

697
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,774
I'd like the set menu.

698
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,984
-Me too.
-Sure.

699
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,570
What's going on with that girl?
Is she still unconscious?

700
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,280
Yes.

701
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,824
How did you hear about it so soon?

702
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,201
I'm jobless right now, you know.

703
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,455
I was on my phone until late at night
and saw something weird popping up.

704
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,333
You know, those trending posts.

705
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,919
I clicked on it out of curiosity
and was so shocked

706
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,087
especially because it was
at that house in Huam-dong.

707
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,133
So you knew the house.

708
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,512
I went there once
for Jin-seob Kang's trial.

709
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,349
The attorney didn't even lift his butt
because it wasn't a profitable case.

710
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,603
The house looked the same.

711
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,649
What are you talking about?
It was a total mess.

712
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,446
There was a big mess inside the house.

713
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,032
That's not what I meant.
How could I have gone into the house?

714
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,034
There was a huge ruckus going on
in the alleyway.

715
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,702
I went there too.

716
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,788
I couldn't fall asleep after calling you.

717
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,790
I saw you there.

718
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,297
I see. How odd.

719
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,216
What do you mean?

720
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,553
Since our encounter
at Jin-seob Kang's trial,

721
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,639
we've been running into each other a lot

722
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,516
even though we didn't keep
in touch for 20 years.

723
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,688
You're right. I guess you never know
whom you'll meet.

724
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,400
Gosh, the portions here are very generous.

725
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,573
A friend?

726
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,368
I didn't know Si-mok had a friend.

727
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,413
I'm sorry. I don't know much about him.

728
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,747
I've never lived with him either.

729
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,084
You must've gotten in trouble
for saying what you said.

730
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,629
You didn't even mention the surgery.
You just said he has fully recovered.

731
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,631
You must've been very upset about it.

732
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,343
Do you know about his surgery?

733
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,430
Is that supposed to be a secret?
I heard about his brain surgery.

734
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,685
Well, I guess it's not a secret
if he told you about it himself.

735
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,021
You and Si-mok must be very close.

736
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,314
Not exactly.

737
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,693
We have to protect
the prosecution's public image.

738
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:26,448
I came to ask you to be careful
with what you say to the media.

739
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,576
Well, it's not like I made it up.

740
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,787
I didn't even mention the surgery.
What's the problem?

741
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:35,040
From where Mr. Hwang and we stand,

742
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,667
it was just a small surgery,
so it shouldn't...

743
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,668
Small?

744
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,796
They opened up his skull
and cut out a part of his brain.

745
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,717
If that's a small surgery,
cancer surgery must be a joke.

746
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:52,932
"Insular cortex

747
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,393
is where sensory
and emotional awareness occurs.

748
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,353
It makes us sense
trust, distrust, empathy, contempt,

749
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,147
-I'll get going.
-guilt, forgiveness, and so on,

750
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,691
which are what make us human.

751
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,070
There was a case where
anterior cingulate cortex was removed

752
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,865
through surgery in order to reduce
untreatable pain.

753
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,868
It showed that damage in insular cortex
can cause various types

754
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:15,955
of emotional issues such as apathy,
carelessness and change in personality."

755
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,750
That is him. It's not good.

756
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,378
It's hard to tell though.
I'm not sure if it's completely gone

757
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,172
or if it's just being suppressed
temporarily.

758
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,465
Either way...

759
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:29,177
There aren't many cases like this.
I want to ask a doctor about it.

760
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,428
All right.

761
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,368
After you.

762
00:56:56,704 --> 00:57:00,041
-Will it be announced today?
-Yes. I owe it all to you, Father.

763
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,835
Don't even mention it.

764
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,503
I have to support you, of course.

765
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,713
Did something happen?

766
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,134
People are saying the prosecution
might get hit by a headwind.

767
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,429
Because the Public Prosecutor General may
give up his investigative jurisdiction?

768
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,224
Those at the supreme office said
nothing has been decided yet.

769
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,310
Even those at the Ministry of Justice move
according to what high-ups want.

770
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,730
The General shouldn't keep butting heads
with the Minister of Justice.

771
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,691
Unless he wants to resign, that is.

772
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,901
It's really too bad.

773
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,946
It would be a waste of talent
if he leaves like that.

774
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,366
Are you sad about letting him go?

775
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,077
You should be sad
that the empty seat can't be yours.

776
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,164
If you reached the top a little sooner,

777
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,125
that vacant position after his resignation

778
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,085
would surely be yours.

779
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,796
Focus on reaching higher
instead of worrying about him.

780
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,506
I didn't realize your big picture.
I'm sorry.

781
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,176
Are you unambitious or thoughtless?

782
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,971
My goal isn't
the next Public Prosecutor General.

783
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,977
Have you made up your mind?

784
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,645
Yes.

785
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,690
Chang-jun.

786
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:06,858
Yes, sir.

787
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,405
Clean up the mess around you.
Before you embark on a long journey,

788
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,699
you must dust off your shoes first.

789
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,618
Yes, sir.

790
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,537
Shall we start making a move?

791
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,045
Goodness.

792
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,843
Please go in.

793
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,859
Yes, honey. I met him.

794
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,071
Okay, I'll come back early today.

795
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,450
Alright, I'll do that. Okay.

796
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,504
Hello, sir.

797
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,789
Was someone in my office?

798
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,083
-Pardon?
-Pardon? No one went in there.

799
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,418
That's right.

800
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,921
Were you away from your desk today?

801
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,174
I stepped out briefly because
Ms. Young asked me for a favor.

802
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,226
Why did you tell him?

803
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,185
What's the problem?

804
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,356
Eun-soo!

805
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,699
Eun-soo.

806
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,178
Mr. Seo.

807
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,513
Mr. Seo.

808
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,683
What are you doing now?

809
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,395
Let go.

810
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,815
You let go first. This is considered
workplace violence.

811
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,902
Violence, my ass. Mind your own business.

812
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,445
Since when did you care about...

813
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:04,869
Hold on. You two...

814
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:07,914
Did you do it together?

815
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,166
Let go of me first. I won't go anywhere.

816
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,200
There you are.

817
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,750
I read the announcement just now.
Congratulations, Mr. Chief Prosecutor.

818
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,801
Congratulations, Mr. Chief Prosecutor.

819
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,220
Where's everyone?

820
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,869
This is the first time in ten years that
the head was appointed from our division.

821
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:32,331
Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor Lee.

822
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,127
-Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor Lee.
-Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor Lee.

823
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,499
STRANGER

824
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,375
I've narrowed down the suspects.

825
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,335
Mr. Park's son.

826
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,086
It could turn into a total war.

827
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,797
We need a powerful spear.

828
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,050
A spear that could pierce any shield...

829
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,552
Is that what you want? This is it.

830
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:30,097
I've been thinking about who could
possibly punish Chief Prosecutor...

831
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,600
Why would you assume
I don't know anything?

832
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,644
I'm sure he could've made him the culprit.

833
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:38,815
But why? Why did he close the case
instead of solving it?

834
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,150
Why? Why can't I see anything?

835
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,239
