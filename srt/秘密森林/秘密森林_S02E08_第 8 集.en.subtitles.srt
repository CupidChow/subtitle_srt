00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,254
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,886
Why did they have to cover up
a common death from an illness?

4
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,220
Why would a police chief do that?

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,682
She moved to the Intelligence Bureau
just after the incident.

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,934
What do you mean?
Are you sure he's missing?

7
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,228
-Why were you going to meet him?
-He begged me to see him.

8
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,481
No, sir. This time,
you reached out to him first.

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,566
Her husband's gone missing.

10
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,277
Maybe she's hardened
because she's a prosecutor's wife.

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,531
The weapon… Was he facing the culprit?

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,660
He showed his back to the culprit,

13
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,121
and the culprit hadn't prepared
the weapon in advance…

14
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,834
But Sergeant Song,
whom he sent there to be bullied,

15
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,586
found out about his nephew

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,590
and then was killed by his nephew
while investigating the bribes.

17
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,969
A prosecutor comes to him two years later
wanting to dig up dirt on the case.

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,518
EPISODE 8

19
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,774
I think we're here.

20
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,410
Mr. Hwang.

21
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,874
You know, things like this
don't happen that often in life.

22
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,876
"Things like this"?

23
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,421
Bad stuff happening
to two of your colleagues.

24
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,470
-So you think he's alive?
-He'd better be.

25
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,765
We'll find out when we find him.

26
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,309
Right. Bye.

27
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,425
Are you out of your mind?

28
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,344
You went to see a former police chief
who committed assault with a prosecutor?

29
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,599
I'm having him tag along so that
I can keep an eye on the prosecution.

30
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,476
I'm just trying to learn more
about the enemy so we can win.

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,604
Not because you want
to spend time with him?

32
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,063
What's going on between you two?

33
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,566
What do you mean? Chief, please!

34
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,444
If this is what I get
after running around until this late,

35
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,446
it's not fair.

36
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,658
You almost handed over the former chief
to the prosecution as a suspect.

37
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,912
I knew that wasn't going to happen
because his alibi is solid.

38
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,207
We've checked the records and confirmed
that he worked until after 11 p.m.

39
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,085
Both Prosecutor Hwang and I concluded
that it's impossible to drive

40
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,130
from Uijeongbu to Yongsan
by the estimated time it took place.

41
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,214
So what did he say?

42
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,301
-He demanded an apology.
-What a lunatic.

43
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,512
I wonder if he apologized to everyone
he ever suspected during an investigation?

44
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,973
By the way, Chief.

45
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,895
I found out that Prosecutor Seo
had been asking around about you.

46
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,654
-What about me?
-It's probably nothing,

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,240
but he asked the families
of Tongyeong case victims

48
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,116
what you had said to them

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,202
during your visit a while back.

50
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,247
So I was thinking of
meeting them tomorrow.

51
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,124
I'll tell you more
after I speak with them.

52
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,335
All right.

53
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,724
Mom.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,768
Yes.

55
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,775
But a prosecutor has gone missing.

56
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,194
Won't the court take that
into consideration?

57
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,614
Let's say a cop went missing
while investigating a prosecutor.

58
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,783
And the police are asking us to get them

59
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,952
a search and seizure warrant
for that prosecutor.

60
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,537
Then will you request the warrant?

61
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,332
We couldn't do anything because
we couldn't get a search warrant issued.

62
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,626
The police sent in numerous requests,

63
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,295
but the prosecution kept rejecting them.

64
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,970
-You're still here.
-Yes.

65
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,514
I was in Yeouido all day,
so I couldn't get much work done.

66
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,267
Then I fell asleep.

67
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,604
You're not going home?

68
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,732
I can focus better here.

69
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,275
Oh, you're at the dormitory.

70
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,236
All right, take it easy.

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,487
Get home safely.

72
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:25,950
You know,

73
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,828
Mr. Lee and I once lived together
a long time ago

74
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,414
in a dormitory like where you're staying.

75
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:32,957
Mr. Lee?

76
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,418
Lee Chang-jun.

77
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,086
I see.

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,132
I think it was when he was
in his fifth or sixth year.

79
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,551
And I was in my first year.

80
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,722
Back then, everyone told me
that I was too much of a pretty boy

81
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,183
to work at the criminal division.

82
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,478
I see.

83
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,191
A public security case broke out

84
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,942
so prosecutors from various offices
had to live together

85
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,612
to be cut off from the outside world
while working on the case.

86
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,572
And Chang-jun was my roommate.

87
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,368
There was nothing special.

88
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,457
We just worked
and did laundry in our spare time.

89
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,417
And ate ramyeon together.

90
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,836
That's what I can remember.

91
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,426
One weekend, I was working at the office,

92
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,053
and people told me…

93
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,057
that Chang-jun died.

94
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,141
That he jumped.

95
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,192
So I got to see him again
for the first time in 13 years.

96
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,657
I heard you and the missing prosecutor
used to work together.

97
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,033
Yes.

98
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,161
You'll be determined to find him
since he's an acquaintance of yours.

99
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,164
If we're concerned with efficacy,
you should be the one investigating it.

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,085
But even though I hadn't seen
or spoken to him for 13 years,

101
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,880
it was still hard for me

102
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,675
to swallow what happened to Chang-jun.

103
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,394
Hiding your emotions
isn't always beneficial to you.

104
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,647
If you took the case
because it was Chief Woo's order,

105
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,482
just tell him it's too hard for you.

106
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,818
No, it's okay.

107
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,535
Do you think Chief Woo would…

108
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,328
What?

109
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,583
Do you think he'd try to dig things up
on Chief Choi Bit?

110
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,752
Maybe not himself,
but would he get someone else to do it?

111
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,090
"Dig things up"? Are you asking me
if he would try to dig up dirt on her?

112
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,259
Yes. But what if it's something

113
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,596
that won't have
a detrimental effect on her?

114
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,849
What if it's just something
that will hurt her reputation a little?

115
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,602
Relentless jabbing can be deadly too.

116
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,854
No one can survive
an endless barrage of punches.

117
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,356
Right.

118
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,026
During the previous debate
over investigative authority in 2011,

119
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,153
the former commissioner general
was arrested.

120
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,864
It's not like he was accused
of something he didn't do.

121
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,073
But even now,

122
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,285
the director of the Intelligence Bureau
was arrested as soon as this debate began.

123
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,121
So he'd definitely try
to find dirt on her.

124
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,125
It doesn't matter if he did or didn't.

125
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,670
They should be the ones concerned with
not leaving anything for us to dig into.

126
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,423
But what if we make things up?

127
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,550
Can anyone survive being framed like that?

128
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,844
They make things up too.

129
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,013
I'm sure Choi Bit is overseeing
the entire bureau

130
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,598
now that the director is gone.

131
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,310
It's quite possible that
they can already see right through us,

132
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,895
so we should be prepared as well.

133
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,231
So, we're preparing?

134
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,358
Yes, we are.

135
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,990
-Something's not right.
-Sorry?

136
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,826
A full day has passed,

137
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,621
so you should be running around
trying to find the missing prosecutor.

138
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,165
But you're asking me this instead?

139
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,214
I'll see you tomorrow.

140
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,029
You should be running around
trying to find the missing prosecutor.

141
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,136
Why…

142
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,115
Yes, please let Ms. Lee know right away.

143
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,909
She needs to take care of the paperwork.

144
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,328
No, not by mail.

145
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,041
Then have someone
in the secretary's office sign it.

146
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,209
I'm on my way there now.

147
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,385
How may I help you?

148
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,012
Which floor is the secretary's office on?

149
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,598
-Are they expecting you?
-Yes.

150
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,059
Just a moment, please.
I'll check with them.

151
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,527
Hello, I think he's from the prosecution.

152
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,862
Okay.

153
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,715
You have some paperwork, right?
Leave it with me. I'll pass it along.

154
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,551
No, it's okay.

155
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,219
We're not okay with this--

156
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,639
This is classified information.
Could you give me some space?

157
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,099
Well, this is our…

158
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,866
Here's a list of the cases
Prosecutor Seo decided to indict.

159
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,535
I'm sorry,
but the details can't be disclosed,

160
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,412
so I'm just sending you a summary.

161
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,707
However, you may visit our office
and view the reports anytime.

162
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,252
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,921
Got it.

164
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,384
DRUG CASE INVOLVING
2ND AND 3RD-GENERATION CONGLOMERATE HEIRS

165
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,677
GAMBLING FRAUD, 11 PRIORS

166
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,224
You can go in now.

167
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,828
I could've had someone
toss you out of the building.

168
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,581
Right, thank you for not doing that.

169
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,292
I'm sure you're busy,
so I'll cut to the chase.

170
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,836
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae has gone missing.

171
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,964
-I'm aware.
-I'm trying to retrace his steps,

172
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,341
and I've found out

173
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,469
that he and Hanjo Group exchanged calls
and texts on the day he went missing.

174
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,054
May I ask you what they were about?

175
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,223
This case…

176
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,642
Are you investigating it?

177
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,810
Yes. What were they about?

178
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,147
Before the shareholders' meeting,

179
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,900
he contacted me to let me know
that he's on my side.

180
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,569
He knows how to build
and use connections, as you know.

181
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,577
CALL HISTORY

182
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,913
This is his call history.

183
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,083
Even a week before he went missing,

184
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,127
someone from your secretary's office
called him first.

185
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:01,549
Five calls were made between
Prosecutor Seo and Hanjo that afternoon.

186
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,010
He spoke with you five times that day
just to root for you?

187
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,187
Did you kidnap him?

188
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,357
If that's not the case,
don't make me waste my time here.

189
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,985
I must go find him when anything turns up
no matter how slight.

190
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,320
It's already been two days.

191
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,201
I had Prosecutor Seo help me

192
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,204
find out about my father's condition.

193
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,082
It was a personal favor.

194
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,251
We had a mutual agreement.

195
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,753
Then what about that evening?

196
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,548
Once again, Hanjo contacted him first.

197
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,013
Ms. Lee Yeon-jae.

198
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,652
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

199
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,739
May I answer that question?

200
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,243
Do you know what I asked her?

201
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,497
I contacted Prosecutor Seo
on the day he went missing.

202
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,709
I apologize for not keeping you
in the loop, ma'am.

203
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,544
That answers

204
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:21,962
your question, right?

205
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,049
Why did you two talk on the phone
without telling me?

206
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,967
I'm sorry, ma'am.

207
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,721
I had asked him a favor a while back.

208
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,099
I asked him to find out
if there's anything we should know

209
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,559
about the eastern district office.

210
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,437
Like what?

211
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,731
We've been butting heads with them
for years

212
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,858
due to a corporate tax lawsuit.

213
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,778
It was my idea.
Ms. Lee has nothing to do with it.

214
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,741
So you asked Prosecutor Seo
to dig up dirt on the eastern office.

215
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,286
Because you wanted to see
if there was something you could use

216
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,664
to attack the eastern office
and win the lawsuit?

217
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:01,001
Not to attack them.
It was just for our reference.

218
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,006
So what did you end up "referencing"?

219
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,344
Prosecutor Seo said he'd look into it,
but I never received any intel from him.

220
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,471
That was what our last phone call
was about.

221
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,226
He said he needed more time and that he
hadn't had a chance to meet the chief yet.

222
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,812
That was our last phone conversation.

223
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,817
Are you sure

224
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,987
you only spoke with him
on the phone that day?

225
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,989
And not in person?

226
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,240
Yes, just on the phone.

227
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,951
I can tell you everything I did
that night.

228
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,913
If you need me to prove my alibi,
I can submit evidence.

229
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,248
Seeing how confident he is,

230
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,667
I'm sure he's already prepared
a solid alibi.

231
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,794
Prosecutor Hwang.

232
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,046
I think you're wasting your time here.

233
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,804
I promised Prosecutor Seo

234
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,100
that we'd go out for a meal
when things die down.

235
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,311
I want to keep that promise,

236
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,229
so please find him.

237
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,286
The chief of the eastern office, the man
who just left, and the missing prosecutor.

238
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,080
The three of them
went through that together.

239
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,332
They were all in the same office.

240
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,209
But you've turned him

241
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,422
into a traitor in the eyes
of his colleagues,

242
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,133
when he can't even
explain himself anymore.

243
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,970
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-But that's a separate issue.

244
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,974
That lie may end up being
completely useless

245
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,769
because it's him
who's in charge of the case.

246
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,813
I think he got the message.

247
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,356
Had that been the case,

248
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,861
he wouldn't have left everything
to him like that.

249
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,829
Prosecutor Seo said he'd look into it,

250
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,207
but I never received any intel from him.

251
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,835
That was what our last phone call
was about.

252
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,128
He said he needed more time

253
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,131
and that he hadn't had a chance
to meet the chief yet.

254
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,300
You haven't visited
the eastern office yet, right?

255
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,802
We should go see the Chief Prosecutor.

256
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,389
Hello?

257
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,809
About the warrant you asked me to request
this morning.

258
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,019
The court denied the request.

259
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,106
Prosecutor Hwang?
Is he at Yongsan Police Station now?

260
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,358
Are you at Yongsan Police Station now?

261
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,110
Hold on.

262
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,278
-He's on his way there now.
-Okay.

263
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,530
He stopped by Hanjo first.

264
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,702
Hanjo? Why did you go there?

265
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,501
We'll talk when you're back.

266
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,254
All right, go there first. Okay.

267
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,383
See you guys later.

268
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,884
See you later, sir.

269
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,182
I guess Seo Dong-jae had
some kind of connection to Hanjo?

270
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,727
Connection? You think so?

271
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,022
-Lee Chang-jun.
-What?

272
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,150
I heard he and Chang-jun were close.

273
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,152
Maybe he contacted Chang-jun's wife
to say hello.

274
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,445
You think that was it?

275
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,739
That might be it.

276
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,285
Si-mok must be under a lot of stress.

277
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,204
None of the places he has to check
is easy to get to.

278
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,999
The National Police Agency
and a corporate conglomerate.

279
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,459
Why is Seo Dong-jae's last stop
the National Police Agency?

280
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,546
He didn't? I thought he was trying
to dig up dirt on Chief Choi.

281
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,924
Who said that?
Why would he dig up dirt on her?

282
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,219
Well, you said he's good at poking around,

283
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,263
so I just assumed he went there.

284
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,605
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE MISSING CASE

285
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,242
VICTIM: SEO DONG-JAE

286
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,203
How tall was your husband?

287
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,915
-He's 181cm tall.
-Okay, 181…

288
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,918
But if you go public
with the investigation,

289
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,297
does it mean information about my kids
could be exposed?

290
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,342
If anyone reveals personal information
about your family

291
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,052
or posts any defamatory content,

292
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,056
we can investigate it
as a defamation and slander case.

293
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,601
He's sort of on the slim side, right?

294
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,560
So you're saying

295
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,106
my family's personal information
is likely to be exposed.

296
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,859
It's been a big shock to my kids as it is.

297
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,820
What if their classmates or teachers
find out?

298
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,782
Do you refuse to give consent?

299
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,077
Then we can't launch
a public investigation.

300
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,788
That's not what I meant.

301
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,123
Well…

302
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,963
I heard about the golden hour principle.

303
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,885
Usually, within 48 hours…

304
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,555
If he's not found within that time frame…

305
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,683
That's just the average.

306
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,230
Anyway, do you consent
to a public investigation?

307
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,441
Yes, I do.

308
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,195
What was he wearing
on the day he went missing?

309
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,161
Well, I'll just check
the CCTV footage later

310
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,955
and record the details.

311
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,082
Excuse me for a moment.

312
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,824
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

313
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,749
I'm Hwang Si-mok,
Prosecutor Seo's colleague.

314
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,625
May I ask you a few questions?

315
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,503
Sure.

316
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,799
How long have you and your husband
been living separately?

317
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,677
Pardon?

318
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,721
Currently, you live in Songdo,

319
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,681
but your husband works in Uijeongbu.

320
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,308
Did he commute to Uijeongbu every day?

321
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,560
Well…

322
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,147
There's a night duty room at the office,

323
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,067
so he slept there

324
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,777
whenever he had to work late.

325
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,078
He told me that
he didn't get to see his kids often.

326
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,084
That's…

327
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,463
You really can't judge

328
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,716
someone's marriage
based on appearances alone.

329
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,384
Don't jump to your own conclusions.

330
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,724
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

331
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,603
Why…

332
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,064
Why are you asking me these things?

333
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:19,981
It's not like…

334
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,484
Do you think I did something--

335
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,277
Because I shouldn't judge
someone's marriage

336
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,529
on appearances alone.

337
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,997
Why do you think the kidnapper
isn't demanding a ransom?

338
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,666
How would I know?

339
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,668
Who were you texting earlier?

340
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,295
My mother.

341
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,298
My youngest kid will be home soon.

342
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,223
Are you having an affair?

343
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,101
Me?

344
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,855
Look. Instead of grilling me like this,

345
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,774
you should look into what he's been up to.

346
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,738
What has he been up to?

347
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,508
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT

348
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,512
This is Prosecutor Seo's
credit card statement.

349
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,264
Team 3 and the Intelligence Unit.

350
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,224
You check where each transaction was made.

351
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,642
Got it.

352
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,565
We should also find out
if anyone around him

353
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,526
is in urgent need of money
or has a hostile relationship with him.

354
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,278
For this… Hang on.

355
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,988
Team 2.

356
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,244
-Sir.
-My gosh.

357
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,454
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

358
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,541
Good day, everyone.

359
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,045
I don't have to explain to you
why this is a special case.

360
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,006
For that reason…
I mean, therefore. It doesn't matter.

361
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,300
Anyway, the HQ will lead
the investigation.

362
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,095
Senior Inspector Han Yeo-jin
will be in charge of the case.

363
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,892
All eyes are on the case
because of the victim's profession.

364
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,604
Let's do a good job
so that we can show everyone

365
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,232
what Yongsan Police Station can do
at this critical time.

366
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,400
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

367
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,360
Have a good day.

368
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,082
It's been a while.
I'm sure you're all very happy to see me.

369
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,505
We already know each other,
so let's skip the formalities.

370
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,592
All right. We'll split up into two teams.

371
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,095
The first team will focus
on retracing his steps,

372
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,306
and the second team will find out
if his work is connected to the case.

373
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,474
Those are the two teams.

374
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:03,645
As for the first team…
May I ask you to lead the team?

375
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,067
Sure.

376
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,030
And the second team will investigate
Segok Police Station with me.

377
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,865
-What's going on?
-A police station?

378
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,243
What? Investigate Segok Police Station?

379
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,788
Detective Jang Geon,
Seo Sang-won, and Won Jin-hun.

380
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,039
You guys are with me.

381
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,124
-Got it.
-Got it.

382
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,171
What's that?

383
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,090
-What? A cop?
-It's a cop.

384
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,925
Looks like it.

385
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,429
Well, this and this…

386
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,807
These two cases are connected… Ma'am?

387
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,475
An officer was murdered by his colleague?

388
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,978
Why did the prosecution dig that case up?

389
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,859
-What's he doing here?
-What?

390
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,069
-Who is he?
-You know, from the western office.

391
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,155
-Hello.
-Hello.

392
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,285
The missing man is a prosecutor
in the criminal division,

393
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,412
so he must've handled
violent crimes on a daily basis.

394
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,789
Someone could've held a grudge
because of another case.

395
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,916
His office is investigating
every criminal case

396
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,668
that he had decided to indict

397
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,671
and could have resulted
in someone holding a grudge against him.

398
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,298
I know we found his blood on the scene,

399
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,883
but we usually give it
at least a week before accepting

400
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,760
a missing persons case for adult males.

401
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,011
And about the blood.

402
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,639
What if he left his own blood there and
went AWOL? That's happened a lot.

403
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,976
People faking their own death
or disappearance to escape debt

404
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,186
or problematic relationships.

405
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,104
But he wanted to transfer
to the Supreme Office.

406
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,069
He wanted to stay in Seoul,
and out of all the offices,

407
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,237
he wanted to work
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

408
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,991
That's why he has tried for a long time
to meet with the assistant chief there.

409
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,787
And he went missing
right before that meeting.

410
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,499
Do you really think he left his own blood
on the scene and went off the grid?

411
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,211
But what if he shows up
and makes a dramatic return?

412
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,255
Then he'll naturally attract
even more attention.

413
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,298
What if it's all a show?

414
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,802
Do you actually believe
that he orchestrated this whole thing?

415
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,138
-Well, he is capable of doing that.
-He's also a prosecutor.

416
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,183
I mean, all of us here have dealt
with him at least once to know.

417
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,268
I was relieved when I heard
about his transfer.

418
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,188
But even there, he's been accusing
an officer of murdering his colleague.

419
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,523
And now he's gone.

420
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,150
Where did he go?

421
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,251
He might still be bleeding somewhere
even as we speak.

422
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,170
This is no time to be evaluating
someone else's life.

423
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,088
Let's find him.

424
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,423
Well…

425
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,051
Since we're having a hard
time finding witnesses…

426
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,553
You know, his wife.

427
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,888
How about we make a video of her

428
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,807
-asking for the public's help?
-How?

429
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,685
We can film it ourselves
and post it on social media.

430
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,771
-A video that shows her face?
-Yes.

431
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,565
Isn't that too much?

432
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,484
When stuff like this happens
to someone who's married,

433
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,528
the spouse is the culprit
nine times out of ten.

434
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,071
That's true.

435
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,364
-Right.
-Yes, he's right.

436
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,491
Everyone watches videos
on social media these days.

437
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,996
I'm sure it'll be hundreds of times
more effective than flyers.

438
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,457
We'll do that if his family agrees.

439
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,041
Okay.

440
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,753
Come on, guys. Let's go.

441
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:15,670
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

442
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,131
I met with the chairwoman of Hanjo.

443
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,758
What did she say?

444
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,636
She said she asked him to help her
find out about Lee Yun-beom's condition.

445
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,974
Why would she need his help
to find out about her father's condition?

446
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,934
It looks like they had a falling out.

447
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,980
-From what I've seen on the news,
-Three days ago.

448
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,607
that does seem to be the case.

449
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,109
-But would that really be all?
-It was before he went missing.

450
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,486
-We'll see.
-Contact them

451
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,196
-and ask for visitation records.
-All right.

452
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,198
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

453
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,659
KIM SU-HANG

454
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,167
Is Detective Jang meeting Officer Kim?

455
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,668
No, I'm meeting him.

456
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,213
I asked Officer Kim to meet me here.

457
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,298
LEE DAE-SEONG, GU JUN-SEONG

458
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,009
I hope it's not a waste of time.

459
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,429
Officer Kim is one of the suspects.
Why are you worried about that?

460
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,224
I feel that we shouldn't be
waiting around like this.

461
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,809
We should go look for him.

462
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,685
He's been missing for 40 hours,

463
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,853
but here I am…

464
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,565
Well, I guess this is important too.

465
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,360
What would you do
if you didn't have to be here?

466
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,529
I'll go search the mountains or something.

467
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,697
I'd feel much better doing that.

468
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,157
OH BYEONG-GEON
KIM JEONG-SEOK, KIM SU-HANG

469
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,745
That sounds like something
detectives would say, don't you think?

470
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,375
Didn't you want to work
in police administration?

471
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,467
If Sergeant Song was indeed murdered,

472
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:49,556
this is no longer a bribery case.
These people are in much deeper trouble.

473
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,016
They'd do anything to cover it up

474
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,893
even if they had to be
up against a prosecutor.

475
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:58,106
But if it was really a suicide…

476
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,942
Let's think that
we're narrowing down the suspects.

477
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,820
Otherwise, how are we going
to make them come to terms with the fact

478
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:08,741
that Prosecutor Seo is
nowhere to be found even after three days?

479
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,828
Who's "them"?

480
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,085
I have to go to the Uijeongbu office.

481
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,754
-Why?
-Captain Baek.

482
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,673
Oh, right. Good luck.

483
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,343
Wait, you drove here, right?

484
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,431
Yes. I won't take a cab
all the way to Uijeongbu.

485
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,606
KIM SU-HANG

486
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,742
KIM SU-HANG

487
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,413
Thank you.

488
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,002
Thank you.

489
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,808
Brother Su-hang usually

490
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,770
volunteers by visiting
the local neighborhoods.

491
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:23,149
He visits the slums
with social workers and…

492
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,987
He's a hard worker.
And the elders like him.

493
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,324
Were you aware of his criminal record
when you were hiring him?

494
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,367
Of course.

495
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,203
Everyone has to submit a résumé.
Everything is by the book.

496
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,414
Do you still have his résumé on file?
Could I take a look at it?

497
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,959
-It'll be somewhere. I'll go and find it.
-Thank you.

498
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,297
On March 26?

499
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,174
From 7 p.m. to midnight.

500
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,972
It's the same every day, so…

501
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,558
Oh, that day…

502
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,520
Did Kim Su-hang work in the evening
two days ago?

503
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,188
Two days ago?

504
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,567
On March 26. Around 7 p.m. to midnight.

505
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,696
Oh, that's the day
we went to the public bath.

506
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,864
We went together.

507
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,742
You went with him?

508
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,953
-A bath?
-Yes!

509
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,246
Together?

510
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,958
It was a group bathing day.

511
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,336
We all go together twice a month.

512
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,213
You go to a public bath

513
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,340
at nine in the evening?
Not in the morning?

514
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,968
They're physically impaired, you know.

515
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,054
So public baths don't accept us
when other customers are there.

516
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,265
So we have to go right before they close.

517
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,599
We're grateful, though.

518
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,602
Many places don't let us in
even if we say we'll pay for it.

519
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,273
Are you sure he worked that day?

520
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,733
Of course.

521
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,360
We don't have many men to help out.

522
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,197
The women can change diapers
for elderly men,

523
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,866
but we can't enter the men's bath.

524
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,619
How long does it usually take?

525
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,247
It's not just the bath.

526
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,666
Going back and forth,
changing their clothes,

527
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,918
and drying them off
takes up most of the time.

528
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,588
It takes at least a couple of hours.

529
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,089
A couple of hours…

530
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,221
My uncle didn't say anything.

531
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,057
It was all my fault.

532
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,393
I must've been out of my mind back then.

533
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,606
If I hadn't done that,
Sergeant Song wouldn't have…

534
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,569
Our Captain even told me
to leave Sergeant Song alone.

535
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,946
Song Gi-hyeon committed suicide.

536
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,407
He killed himself.

537
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,120
Everyone on my team did their best
to take care of him.

538
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,165
We heard he was taking
drugs for his depression,

539
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,584
so we made a lot of effort
to keep him stable.

540
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,962
When was the last time you saw
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae?

541
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,422
There's nothing to say.

542
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,509
I met him for the first and last time
when I was here.

543
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:59,222
Can you tell me where you went
after you got off work on March 26?

544
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,767
I went home right after I got off work.

545
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,269
And I just stayed home.

546
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,188
You went home without going anywhere else?

547
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,439
Yes. I went straight home.

548
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,526
Did you go to work right away
the next morning?

549
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,735
-Did you drop by--
-No.

550
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,364
-Is there anyone who can confirm that?
-My family. My wife and kids.

551
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,742
Your family members are the only ones
who can confirm your alibi.

552
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,369
What do you usually do

553
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,080
if you come across a suspect like that?

554
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,123
A suspect?

555
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,294
Why am I a suspect?

556
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,838
I didn't receive any bribes.

557
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,840
I'm asking about Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

558
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,135
That's what I mean.
Why would I harm that prosecutor?

559
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,721
Your seniors working in this building

560
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,766
decided that I wasn't guilty
of taking bribes.

561
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,726
Sergeant Song never had

562
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,104
anything on me in the first place.

563
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,648
So what reason would I have to harm
a prosecutor?

564
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,278
Are you implying that your seniors
made a mistake?

565
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,864
Are you trying to overturn the decision

566
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,991
that your seniors made years time ago?

567
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,034
With your own hands?

568
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,291
What was his name?

569
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,628
The man who killed the old pawnshop owner

570
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,798
and said that if a young man like him
could study law with the money he took

571
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,842
from a useless, selfish old man like him,

572
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,428
it would be more beneficial to mankind.

573
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,764
I have no idea what you're talking about.

574
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,020
"He's digging up dirt on our team members
when we're supposed to be like brothers.

575
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,607
Getting rid of the selfish Sergeant Song
would be beneficial to the majority.

576
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,902
Let's sacrifice one member
and save the whole team."

577
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,653
Is that what you thought?

578
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,656
I still don't get what you mean.

579
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,202
Did you get what
Prosecutor Seo said to you?

580
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,704
Did he ask how you could
do such a thing to a colleague?

581
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,498
You can look up
what he said back then yourself.

582
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,167
It would've been recorded.

583
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,003
I was here at the time too.

584
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,799
I participated in

585
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,636
religious activities in jail,

586
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,765
and I've learned a lot
and reflected on myself.

587
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,769
What I did to Sergeant Song
was the same as killing him.

588
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,397
I'm really sorry.

589
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,159
Your uncle warned you, didn't he?

590
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,666
I met your uncle and told him

591
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,545
that him and his nephew sent Sergeant Song
to Segok Station to bully him,

592
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,881
then killed him
and even kidnapped a prosecutor.

593
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,801
And you're saying he didn't even
contact you

594
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,136
after hearing such things
from a police officer?

595
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,724
My uncle and I have been
through a lot since then,

596
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,559
so we've been out of touch.

597
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,312
So you say he didn't say anything,
and you're not in touch.

598
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,482
But your colleague got a sentence
of a year and eight months,

599
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,318
and he's still serving in jail now,

600
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,779
while you, the nephew of a police chief,
only got six months.

601
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:06,242
Why? Because Dongducheon Station was
in charge of the Segok case at the time.

602
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,994
You can't deny that, right?

603
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:13,082
But my uncle had already been transferred
to a different station at that time.

604
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,626
So you're saying
he had no influence on it?

605
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,048
Is lying a trait that runs in your family?

606
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,926
Do you think I'm some kind of
an out-of-control child?

607
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,512
Why would I kidnap a prosecutor?

608
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,183
Sometimes people
lose control of themselves.

609
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,353
For example,
when they suddenly meet someone

610
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,564
who's trying to dig up a crime

611
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,985
that they thought they had
gotten away with for the last two years.

612
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,738
How many times do I have to tell you?

613
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,160
I was demoted only because I failed
to manage my team members properly.

614
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,996
It wasn't because I accepted bribes.

615
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,625
So I don't have any motive
in the first place.

616
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,920
Do you feel itchy?
You keep rubbing your hands and nose.

617
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,006
Can't I even feel itchy now?

618
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,218
When blood isn't properly carried
to your vessels,

619
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,389
it causes the tips of your fingers
and the nose to go numb.

620
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,808
Maybe most of your blood is being sent

621
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,227
to your brain and heart right now.

622
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,647
What are you talking about?

623
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,692
I'm telling you that your body
consumes a lot of energy

624
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,486
when you lie.

625
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,032
Your brain's trying to squeeze out lies,

626
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:32,370
so it's taking blood
from the tips of your fingers.

627
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,540
I only met Prosecutor Seo once,
and I told him back then too

628
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,043
that Song Gi-hyeon killed himself.

629
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,717
I don't know what to do anymore
if you refuse to accept my alibi.

630
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,512
Do whatever you want.

631
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,535
You're so ridiculous.

632
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,619
What?

633
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,162
Kim Su-hang!

634
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,664
He looked down on him.

635
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,582
He didn't even treat him
like a human being.

636
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,295
Officer Kim treated
Sergeant Song the worst.

637
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,882
If he locked him up somewhere,
he'd check up on him at least once.

638
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,342
He was even interrogated,

639
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,136
so he'll be anxious about getting caught.

640
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,014
Let's hope so.

641
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,768
Did you take the Philosophy of Law course
in your first year too?

642
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,562
Professor Kim Mun-sik's class.

643
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,023
You quoted Crime and Punishment.

644
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,485
He taught with that book as well
when I took that class.

645
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,279
Right.

646
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,089
Hello!

647
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,139
Can you rewind that?

648
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,816
The time of his payment…

649
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,155
Right there.

650
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,575
Excuse me.

651
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,347
We can film it as much as you like,
so there's no need to be nervous.

652
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,516
You can start when you're ready.

653
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:55,990
I'm the wife of Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae,

654
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,201
who disappeared in Bogwang-dong

655
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,746
in the evening on March 26.

656
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,791
I'm also the mother of two kids.

657
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,669
If anyone saw my husband

658
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,465
on March 26 from 7 p.m. to midnight,

659
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,469
please help us out.

660
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,263
I beg of you.

661
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,473
Please call us.

662
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:27,313
My husband is a hardworking prosecutor,

663
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,274
and a diligent father.

664
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,653
But he's not returning home right now.

665
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,658
If anyone has seen him with someone,

666
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,495
or even heard anything, please help us.

667
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,664
Any small detail is important to us.

668
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,666
Please…

669
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,211
try to remember anything
that you may have seen or heard.

670
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,549
Our children are waiting…

671
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:01,597
Our children are waiting
for their father to come back.

672
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,183
His name is

673
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,185
Seo Dong-jae.

674
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,398
He was wearing a gray suit
and a yellow necktie

675
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,319
decorated with small patterns.

676
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,489
Please help us.

677
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,659
Thank you.

678
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,380
Stay here.

679
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,260
Yes, ma'am.

680
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,192
Where is she going?

681
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,694
I'm not sure.

682
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,655
What was she doing in her office?

683
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,573
She was watching a video.

684
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,285
What kind of video?

685
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,037
You must be upset

686
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,372
that your right-hand man is missing.

687
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,084
You could've just asked me yourself.

688
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,962
You didn't have to waste time
trying to dig up dirt on me.

689
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,759
So what did Prosecutor Seo say about me?

690
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,595
Do you really think I ordered that?

691
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,513
I wouldn't know.

692
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,307
Well, I didn't.

693
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,810
I didn't tell Seo Dong-jae or anyone else

694
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,604
to do a background check on you.

695
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,813
If I did,

696
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,151
I wouldn't have told you
when he brought me the Park Gwang-su case.

697
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,071
And don't take it out on me right now.

698
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,280
Someone at Namyangju Station…

699
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,246
…told Prosecutor Seo

700
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,332
that it was you who ordered the case
of the dead lawyer to be closed quickly.

701
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,917
Shouldn't you find out who that was,

702
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,711
and what else they told him first?

703
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,171
I already did.

704
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,925
The Captain of the
Traffic Investigation Team.

705
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,426
The Traffic Investigation Team?

706
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,974
There were calls made between them
in Prosecutor Seo's call history.

707
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,726
So I gave him a little nudge,
and he eventually told me the truth.

708
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,438
But he didn't really say much
to Prosecutor Seo.

709
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,151
And how much was that?
Give me the details.

710
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:49,408
Prosecutor Seo was bugging him about
someone who died of a heart attack,

711
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,243
so he just used me as an excuse.

712
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,329
"Our Chief told me to stop letting
a case that's already over drag on.

713
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,541
So I just closed the case quickly."
That's all he said.

714
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,753
What officer would honestly confess

715
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,964
that they spilled the beans
to a prosecutor

716
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,174
when being questioned
by their former chief?

717
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,095
He may have told you that,

718
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,223
but we'll never really know

719
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,767
what information was shared
between him and Prosecutor Seo.

720
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,313
And why is that?

721
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,857
If you can't believe
what that officer said,

722
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,193
you can find Prosecutor Seo
and ask him yourself.

723
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,699
Well,

724
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,952
you might not be able to ask him
even if you find him.

725
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,622
Why won't I be able to ask him?

726
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:42,252
You seem to think
Prosecutor Seo is already dead.

727
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,921
An adult male has been missing
for two days.

728
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,342
I doubt he got lost,
and from my experience…

729
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,189
Hello?

730
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,407
What did they say?

731
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,452
I've just visited
the Tongyeong victim's house.

732
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,830
Prosecutor Seo really did
contact the victim's family,

733
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,334
and, as I reported last time,
he asked them what the police said

734
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,710
about the prosecution.

735
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,004
Anything else?

736
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,758
Chief Choi Bit?

737
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,511
Find out what relationship she had
with Park Gwang-su,

738
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,137
the lawyer who died from a heart attack.

739
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,390
Chief Choi Bit…

740
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,434
Oh, you mean…

741
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,769
Do you know her?

742
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:44,147
No, I don't know her personally.

743
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,277
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee, but what do you mean

744
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,613
when you say their "relationship"?

745
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,199
That's what I'm asking you to find out.

746
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,701
Yes, right.

747
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,121
But it'll be easier for me
if you gave me a hint…

748
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,666
Don't you want to stand on your own feet?

749
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,002
Pardon?

750
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,215
A law firm specializing in Hanjo…

751
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,385
I'd rather stay where I am

752
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,596
than go through the trouble
to stand on my own feet.

753
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,433
Why do you think
you'll go through trouble?

754
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,436
Is our conglomerate
not enough of a client for you?

755
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,814
Do you think I'll neglect you

756
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,650
if you start your own law firm?

757
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,862
I could earn tens of billions of won
with that.

758
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,574
That prosecutor must've been
bored to death.

759
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,452
How can I get that info?

760
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,708
Is she out of her mind?
What the hell would she know?

761
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,126
Choi Bit.

762
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,670
I should've made an acquaintance with her.

763
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,535
He even went to Hanjo Group.

764
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,121
Who?

765
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:24,956
Seo Dong-jae.

766
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,418
How much does he know?

767
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,508
Hanjo would never reveal the truth,

768
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,176
so that may be okay, but…

769
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,515
Do you think Hanjo could've done it?

770
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,812
If they're really the ones
who did something to Seo Dong-jae…

771
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,692
I wouldn't be surprised
if his body was found in the South Pole

772
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,986
if they were involved.

773
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,033
If it were me,

774
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,369
it wouldn't have been that flashy, right?

775
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,414
If it was me who kidnapped him.

776
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,251
Is that a confession,
or are you just trying me out?

777
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,002
It's the latter.

778
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,587
What for?

779
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,381
You suspected me, right?

780
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,842
You're still suspecting me.

781
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,852
That means you suspect me as well.

782
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,145
The both of us

783
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,276
believed that the case
was closed for good.

784
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,197
But someone else had been
prying into it again

785
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,032
and he suddenly disappeared.

786
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,411
Then it's one of us, isn't it?

787
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,123
But it wasn't me, so…

788
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,041
I don't know about you, Chief Choi.

789
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,918
But it wasn't me.

790
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,132
It shouldn't be. It wasn't me either.

791
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,094
If any one of us gets involved,
the other will be dragged into it as well.

792
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,763
Then everyone will find out everything,

793
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,934
and we'll be ruined for sure.

794
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,229
People won't find out,
and we won't be ruined.

795
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,188
Never.

796
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,110
We'll keep our mouths shut,
and Hanjo will also keep quiet.

797
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,612
No one will know.

798
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,185
If it really was Hanjo's doing…

799
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:56,566
And if I never tell anyone
about Hanjo and we…

800
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,279
never find Seo Dong-jae…

801
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,703
You just told a cop.

802
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,716
You really haven't changed.

803
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,219
How so?

804
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,099
Shouldering everything.
Shouldering things for others.

805
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,896
And you're shouldering my guilt now.

806
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,817
And back then…

807
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,779
You did the same then.

808
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:02,090
My husband is a hardworking prosecutor,

809
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,385
and a diligent father.

810
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:10,765
But he's not returning home right now.

811
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:16,062
If anyone has seen him with someone,

812
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,901
or even heard anything, please help us.

813
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,530
Any small detail is important to us.

814
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,448
Please…

815
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,199
PEOPLE LIKE YOU
WHO DON'T HAVE A CONSCIENCE…

816
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,410
…try to remember anything
you've seen or heard.

817
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,456
Our children are waiting…

818
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,459
…for their father to come back.

819
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,004
SOUTHERN SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

820
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,431
LAWYER OH JU-SEON

821
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,390
I'm Oh Ju-seon.

822
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,605
I already have a lawyer.

823
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:02,734
A lawyer who couldn't even get
an indictment without detention

824
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:06,529
and made the Intelligence Bureau Director
serve time in a detention center.

825
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:12,077
Why would such a big law firm
reach out to me?

826
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,244
Who told you about me?

827
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,039
You're taking responsibility
for something that happened

828
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,749
while carrying out government affairs.

829
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,420
There are higher-ups who feel upset
about what happened to you.

830
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,005
"Higher-ups"?

831
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,382
They contacted our law firm
and asked us to help you

832
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:30,595
so that you won't have to reveal
what happened in too much detail.

833
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,265
As this is unofficial business,

834
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,268
it'll be best for the both of us
not to mention this

835
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,145
to the higher-ups who are involved
in this case

836
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,191
and refrain from asking our law firm
about changing lawyers.

837
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,985
So, would you like me to represent you?

838
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,448
Yes.

839
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,744
Well, I've heard pretty much
all about the case.

840
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,288
You hired people to write comments
at the time, right?

841
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,457
Is there a colleague
who watched you doing that

842
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,417
and knows a lot about it?

843
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,837
Yes. Of course there is.

844
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,672
Your lawyer?

845
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:06,631
Who is it?

846
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,969
If he already left,
then I guess he'll arrive soon.

847
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,973
All right. I'll meet him.

848
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,349
Director.

849
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,727
Please take good care of yourself. Okay?

850
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,313
Yes, sir.

851
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,484
Why would he do that all of a sudden?

852
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,494
Here's the report of
yesterday's interviews

853
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,538
with the Tongyeong victim's family
and Officer Kim.

854
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,458
Was Officer Kim similar to his uncle?

855
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,625
Was he big like him?

856
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,461
No, he was completely different.

857
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,922
I remember the Chief said
it was unfair back then.

858
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,966
He said he didn't assault the officer,

859
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,885
but just kicked him once
because he was angry.

860
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,097
I recall thinking it was a relief
that the officer's leg wasn't broken,

861
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,224
considering the Chief's build.

862
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,479
And the first person to expose that
was Sergeant Song, unfortunately.

863
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,568
I'm going out to work at Yongsan Station.

864
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,612
-Okay. Do your best.
-Yes, ma'am.

865
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,040
Lawyer Oh Ju-seon, right?

866
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,208
Oh, yes.

867
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,126
Hello, I'm Oh Ju-seon.

868
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,628
Where did I hear that name before?

869
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,755
-I'm Choi Bit.
-Nice to meet you.

870
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,633
I heard about you from the Director.

871
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,551
-Why don't you have a seat?
-Sure.

872
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:40,058
I asked him which colleague knew
about the work he did as well as himself,

873
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,311
and he mentioned you right away.

874
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,230
I didn't even get the chance
to call in advance.

875
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,439
It's all right.

876
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,567
So, what do you need to know?

877
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,654
I heard you've known each other
for quite a while.

878
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,072
That's right.

879
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,741
But I heard

880
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,161
that you worked at Namyangju Station
before you came here.

881
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:01,829
Yes.

882
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,124
Then were you stationed in Namyangju

883
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:09,504
when the Director was supposedly
leaking confidential info?

884
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,382
No, that was when I was working here.

885
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,801
That's why I know a lot about that case.

886
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,387
Oh, that's a relief.

887
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,640
Namyangju, for me,
brings back bad memories.

888
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,393
What kind of memories?

889
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,979
It reminds me of a senior I knew.

890
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,898
I was too busy to call him often,

891
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,443
but he was in a car accident
at the beginning of last year…

892
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,321
I'm sorry.

893
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,865
It's okay. You can take it.

894
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,662
-Yes?
-Chief,

895
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,581
you know who Oh Ju-seon is, right?

896
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,628
Yes, so?

897
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,463
The Oh Ju-seon from the Tongyeong case.

898
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,383
The former presiding judge who received
special treatment as a senior.

899
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,136
Okay.

900
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,973
-He got in an accident in Namyangju--
-What do you need to know?

901
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,350
I have a meeting soon.

902
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,403
So?

903
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,246
Yes, Detective Jang.

904
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,250
You got what?

905
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,881
-That doesn't mean it was
-Yes.

906
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,799
-the police who did it.
-No, that's not it.

907
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,801
-No, nothing is confirmed yet.
-That's not true.

908
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,511
-Nothing's been confirmed.
-No, it isn't.

909
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,221
ACTIVE POLICE OFFICER NAMED
A SUSPECT IN THE KIDNAPPING CASE

910
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,224
-Why are you saying that?
-It hasn't been confirmed.

911
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,393
-Did you check?
-We weren't informed.

912
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,978
Where did you hear that from?

913
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,813
TRENDING KEYWORDS
1. ACTIVE POLICE OFFICER NAMED AS SUSPECT

914
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,399
-I'm telling you…
-Nothing's been confirmed yet.

915
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,526
…the police did not kidnap him.

916
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,403
Nothing's been confirmed.

917
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,238
How did you know
that an officer was interrogated?

918
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,532
-We're not sure yet.
-All right.

919
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,663
You were talking about feeling guilty
and whatnot yesterday,

920
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,414
and you stab me in the back like this?

921
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,832
It wasn't me!

922
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,752
Well, someone must've leaked that info
with certain intentions.

923
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,297
If that was the case, what about Segok?
What's his name…

924
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,548
The captain.

925
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:20,510
Everyone at the Uijeongbu office
knows that he was interrogated.

926
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,595
Shouldn't you look into them?

927
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,223
One of their colleagues went missing,
and a cop was summoned.

928
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,350
You should've asked them
to keep it a secret

929
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,352
that a cop was summoned for interrogation.

930
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,188
Then you would've told everyone
that we asked you to keep it a secret.

931
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:36,025
I'm also trying to find out
how that info was leaked.

932
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,403
But I'm wasting my time
talking to you right now.

933
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,988
Just hang on. I'll call you again later.

934
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,203
Damn it.

935
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,793
Yes, come in.

936
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,674
DEPUTY PROSECUTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE

937
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,343
"He's only a suspect at the moment.

938
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,470
This is malicious propaganda."

939
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,056
It seems like the police wrote this.

940
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,768
All the other comments
are criticizing the police.

941
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,854
They're all saying that this is crazy.

942
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,398
What about here?
Is there anything uploaded on E-pros?

943
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,443
Some are saying we need
clear evidence first,

944
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,195
but most of them seem pretty worked up.

945
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,410
-It's here.
-Oh, let me come with you.

946
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,536
Okay.

947
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,295
Did the Segok Station officers
seem like the culprits?

948
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,798
Well, they all had alibis.

949
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,300
I'm checking them right now.

950
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:47,430
If it turns out
that an active police officer

951
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:51,225
really did assault
and kidnap a prosecutor,

952
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,229
and caused him to be missing
for the past few days,

953
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,275
then their fight
for investigative rights is over.

954
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,863
No one will ever be able to tell us
to hand over those rights.

955
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,740
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

956
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:08,117
-Thank you. Enjoy your food.
-Thank you!

957
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,373
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

958
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,677
SENIOR INSPECTOR HAN YEO-JIN

959
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,805
Senior Inspector Han.

960
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,153
We received a message.

961
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,907
A message from the culprit.

962
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,576
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE MISSING CASE

963
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,330
LOCATION: BOGWANG-DONG, YONGSAN

964
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,255
SCENE PHOTO, LEFT ALLEY
SCENE PHOTO, BACK ALLEY

965
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:09,303
I WASHED THE DISHES
TOO LATE

966
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:17,645
VICTIM: SEO DONG-JAE
UIJEONGBU DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

967
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,001
"You can't catch me."

968
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:43,129
This message shows that the culprit
thinks the police are a joke.

969
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,381
Do people like them get upset
by malicious comments online too?

970
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:48,050
Have you heard anyone say
that Prosecutor Seo had a sponsor?

971
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,093
Just make the announcement.

972
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:52,138
Did you request to have this collected?
All the troubles he's caused?

973
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,224
Should I have taken his reputation
into account?

974
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,935
If Seo Dong-jae is really found dead…

975
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,687
We should do some legwork,
not look for a body.

976
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,024
Prosecutor Seo's been doggedly searching
articles about his death.

977
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,358
How can we really find nothing?

978
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,028
Something usually comes up
when we investigate the surroundings.

979
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,989
It does seem like a detached house.

980
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:15,620
