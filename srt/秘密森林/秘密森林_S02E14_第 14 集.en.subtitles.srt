1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,254
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,718
Why don't they listen?
It clearly says, "Do not enter."

4
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,927
Over there!

5
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,307
This was our first trip
since starting college.

6
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,101
-I was so drunk
-Hey!

7
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,228
I didn't even know
my friends had gone out.

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,648
Tongyeong?

9
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,359
And Prosecutor Seo called the survivor?

10
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,903
According to him,

11
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,572
it wasn't the first time
that Prosecutor Seo called him.

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,908
Mr. Kim Hu-jeong.

13
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,619
You know Prosecutor Seo, right?

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,125
EPISODE 14

15
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,711
Hey, friend!

16
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,506
Open up, will you?

17
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,299
We know you're here.

18
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,233
Jeez, this is so freaking slow.

19
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,360
Hey, turn up the volume!

20
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,654
I'll do it myself.

21
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,156
Hey, let go.

22
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,933
Gosh, it's freezing.

23
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,935
-You said it was close!
-Get off of me!

24
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,482
My friends…

25
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,777
They went to the beach,

26
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,862
but they're gone.

27
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,615
I think they drowned.

28
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,286
They had been drinking.

29
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,497
I can't find them.

30
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,832
Help me.

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,168
Please help me.

32
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,518
Where is he? Tell me where he is!

33
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,567
Hey, you won't tell us?

34
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,947
You bastard…

35
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,035
Tell me right now!

36
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,475
GWANGJIN-GU, GUUI-DONG
SEODAEMUN-GU

37
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,313
The music store, Gangnam Station.

38
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
STRIKE MULTIPAD

39
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,573
GANGDONG-GU, GIL-DONG

40
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,579
The whole room smells of bleach.

41
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,914
That means he cleaned the room
very recently.

42
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,709
So it's possible that
he moved Prosecutor Seo recently.

43
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,714
One of these is the route
he used to move Prosecutor Seo.

44
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,591
Track these in reverse order.

45
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,385
Did you ever notice

46
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:48,014
the color of the soil looking different
on one spot when you got home?

47
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,390
No, never.

48
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,518
Could he have buried him somewhere here
when we weren't home?

49
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,145
Any weird noises?

50
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,482
Or did you ever smell a rotting stench
coming from downstairs?

51
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,108
No.

52
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,945
But I caught a strong whiff of bleach,
and it gave me a headache.

53
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,905
When?

54
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,115
Was it yesterday morning?

55
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,077
I came out,
and the whole place reeked of bleach.

56
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,289
My gosh, does that mean… That is horrible.

57
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,542
Did you not ask the tenant
where the smell was coming from?

58
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,921
He told her that he used bleach
for mold in his room.

59
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,673
If he used bleach yesterday morning,

60
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,594
it means the body was moved
shortly before that.

61
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,890
But with some GPS systems,
the information gets deleted very quickly.

62
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:34,352
Call the GPS company and ask for
the full log. They should have it stored.

63
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,479
That will take too long.

64
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,272
What if he was barely breathing?

65
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,859
It's possible that he tossed him out
because he had already passed that stage.

66
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,320
Right, see you later.

67
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,613
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

68
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,848
The floor pattern doesn't match.

69
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,812
It's not the same floor we saw
in the photo that we received.

70
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,566
And there's no glass table.

71
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,235
That photo…
I don't think it was taken here.

72
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,864
This won't change anything, okay?

73
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,658
You can't get out of this.

74
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,536
We found bloodstains in your room
as well as in your car.

75
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,748
Your car is a new model.

76
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,961
GPS systems these days still send data
to the company even if they're turned off.

77
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,965
Everything from the locations
to when it was used or left idling, even.

78
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,886
What I'm saying is,
we will find out where you've been

79
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,262
even if you stay silent.

80
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,765
If he's found in one of the places
in your GPS log,

81
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,018
then there's really no way out for you.

82
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,604
Tell us before that happens.

83
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,815
Where is Prosecutor Seo?

84
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,746
-Hello?
-Mr. Kim Hu-jeong?

85
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,415
This is the Uijeongbu District
Prosecutors' Office.

86
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,458
I'm not interested.

87
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,419
This isn't voice phishing.
This is Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

88
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,590
You remember me, right? We spoke
on the phone regarding the Tongyeong case.

89
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,849
Then let me ask you this.
You have to answer this question, okay?

90
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,352
Is Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae alive?

91
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,858
Is he dead?

92
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,904
Is that why you moved his body
and removed all the traces?

93
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,201
Hey!

94
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,376
So you don't even know if he's alive?

95
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,170
No, that's why
I can't go back to the office now.

96
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,339
May I take the rest of the day off?

97
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,466
-Where are you now?
-Bogwang-dong, sir.

98
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,426
I'm headed to the suspect's place.

99
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,011
Forget about the day off.

100
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,888
Just get him to confess.

101
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,850
I wish I could threaten to kill him.

102
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,477
Prosecutor Hwang?

103
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,854
Because he ignored your order
and caught the culprit?

104
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,273
No, the culprit.

105
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,694
I never imagined he'd be the culprit.

106
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,362
Right?

107
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,823
Anyway, it's all over now.

108
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,117
We finally caught him.

109
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,550
Yes, it's him.

110
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,178
He lived in the room on the top floor
until recently.

111
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,141
Then do you recall
seeing these students as well?

112
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,560
Do you know
if they used to visit him often?

113
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,477
I'm not sure.

114
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,856
I'm just a tenant here,

115
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,899
so I had no reason to go up to his floor.

116
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,278
He only lived here for a short while

117
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,072
and moved out suddenly,
so I rarely saw him anyway.

118
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,951
-He moved out suddenly?
-Yes.

119
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,121
He only lived here for a month or two.

120
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,416
I remember the landlord telling me one day
that he'd moved out.

121
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,877
I didn't even know before that.

122
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,088
Do you know why he had to move out
all of a sudden?

123
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,926
He signed the lease
on the coldest day of the year.

124
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,220
Apparently, he said his room was too cold.

125
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,223
The landlord complained
that the room was only cold

126
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,642
because it was winter.

127
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,354
He should have done some repairs
if the place was too cold.

128
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,984
Is there a famous restaurant
in the neighborhood that delivers food?

129
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,153
A place that does their own delivery.

130
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,821
Yes, of course.

131
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,367
The fried chicken place
where my kids always order from.

132
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,827
Are you hungry?

133
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,955
KIM HU-JEONG'S ACQUAINTANCES

134
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,959
They were the ones
that drowned in Tongyeong?

135
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,631
Hu-jeong was the quiet type.

136
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,050
He got good grades,
and his family was well-off.

137
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,970
That made him a perfect target.

138
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,723
Have they been close since middle school?

139
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:27,436
I was actually surprised they kept
in touch even after getting into college.

140
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,106
-Hu-jeong!
-In eighth grade, Hu-jeong…

141
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,858
Hu-jeong, where are you?

142
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,825
Are you his guardian?

143
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,912
Why did you arrest my son
without a warrant and in broad daylight.

144
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,625
We arrested him without a warrant because
he tried to run away in broad daylight.

145
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,837
His charges include kidnapping, murder,
and abandoning a corpse.

146
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,340
You obviously have the wrong person.

147
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,301
At least make it sound believable
if you want to pin it on him!

148
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,763
He just turned 20. And what?
"Murder"? "Abandoning a corpse"?

149
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,058
He turned down an admission offer
from Seoul National University

150
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,353
because he got into Yonsei University
with a full scholarship!

151
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,148
I'm sorry, but we're interviewing him now.

152
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,732
Also, the suspect is an adult,

153
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,402
so we're not required
to have his guardian accompany him.

154
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,530
How dare you call him a suspect?
Who approved this?

155
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,033
-Who's in charge?
-I am.

156
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,119
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

157
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,538
I used to work at the Supreme Office too.

158
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,957
Which class were you?

159
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,463
I am his father,
but I'm also here as his attorney.

160
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,867
When you were in middle school,

161
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,870
you've made a confession
to your homeroom teacher.

162
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,459
You told him that you were being bullied
by your classmates. The two of them.

163
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,711
But what was the outcome?

164
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,631
The teacher had the two sit next to you,

165
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,758
so the three of you could become friends.

166
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,012
So the 15-year-old Kim Hu-jeong

167
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,431
had to be seated with his two bullies
all day long

168
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,392
even though they hit him, mocked him,
and ordered him around.

169
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,188
The two of them took turns each week
to bully you.

170
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,440
How dare you… None of it is true.

171
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,983
My son was never bullied.

172
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,657
Come to think of it,
maybe the teacher told them…

173
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,618
I think he tried to warn
those guys who drowned in Tongyeong.

174
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,621
"I know what's going on.
I'm watching you guys."

175
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,333
The entire school had heard that Hu-jeong
told the teacher he was being bullied.

176
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,585
Maybe that was the teacher's strategy.

177
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,547
But what about Hu-jeong?
How were they supposed to become close?

178
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,632
It's impossible.

179
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,302
Whether you go to college or the beach,
you can't become close.

180
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,847
Well, why is this brought up
right now anyway?

181
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,225
Even if there was… Fine.

182
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,813
Let's say he was bullied.
But you mentioned murder and kidnapping.

183
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,232
But those two kids drowned.

184
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,194
Because there's a possibility
that he shoved them into the water.

185
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,530
They were enemies, not friends.

186
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,824
You tell them.

187
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,118
Were they your friends or enemies?

188
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,746
Tell them.

189
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,503
Friends.

190
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,674
We became close.

191
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,262
Middle school was years ago.

192
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,265
It's long ago. It's more than enough
time for them to bond.

193
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,934
Why did you get him a room in Bogwang-dong

194
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,770
when you live in a fancy apartment
in Gwangjin-gu.

195
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,982
More importantly…
Hu-jeong, why did you move out

196
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,483
in less than a month?

197
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,530
Look, Detective. He wanted to live
in that building in Bogwang-dong

198
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,450
but ended up moving out
because he didn't like it at all.

199
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,453
Is that a crime? This is ridiculous.

200
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,915
I can't believe you're interrogating him
about breaking his lease.

201
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,375
I heard you used to order
garlic chicken often.

202
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,627
Seriously?

203
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,463
What does garlic chicken
have to do with this?

204
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,382
Did they live there too?
Did they bring girls over as well?

205
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,426
How dare you…

206
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,061
It was a complete mess.
It looked like they drank every day.

207
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,563
-They ordered from us often.
-The chicken is here.

208
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,231
-Okay.
-Sometimes, I only saw guys.

209
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,569
Usually, it was him who came to the door.

210
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,239
But he wasn't there at times,
and it was just the others girls.

211
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,159
I told them to come over.

212
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,663
-The girls too?
-Yes.

213
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,044
You worked on your music there, right?

214
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,089
After you moved from Bogwang-dong
to Guui-dong,

215
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,384
did you tell them that you had moved?

216
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,554
No, I didn't--

217
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,689
You said they were your friends
and you were close.

218
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,274
If you were close enough
to go on a trip together,

219
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,111
why didn't you tell them
about moving so suddenly?

220
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,154
Whether they were friends or not,

221
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,615
what did he do wrong
and what is he responsible for--

222
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,450
This is about his motive.

223
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,828
We're asking him about his motive.

224
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,579
Hu-jeong.

225
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,833
Where were you on March 26,
between 7 to 11 p.m.?

226
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,167
Hey!

227
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,170
You took Prosecutor Seo there, didn't you?
Where is he now?

228
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,007
Prosecutor Seo?

229
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,969
It's not like you found his corpse there

230
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,595
or the murder weapon.

231
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,891
Because of a missing prosecutor,
you're trying to coerce this innocent boy

232
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:02,187
into confessing what he didn't even do
so that you can close the case!

233
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,942
I'm his father, a former prosecutor,
and an attorney.

234
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,695
Seeing how you treat him with me here

235
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,073
makes me wonder how many people
you've wrongly convicted.

236
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,827
Why did you turn off your dashcam?
Why did you remove it?

237
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,203
This is ridiculous.

238
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,251
Look, detectives.
A dashcam is considered private property.

239
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:28,505
He's not obligated to disclose footage,
and he may refuse to submit it.

240
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,258
We found bloodstains
on the floor and inside the closet.

241
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,886
Even inside the trunk.
We're not wrongfully accusing him.

242
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,304
That's from a dog.

243
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,394
I hit a dog with my car.

244
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,146
It's from that.

245
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,734
Then you should've taken the dog to a vet.

246
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,444
Why shove it in your closet?

247
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,571
Do you think
you're making sense right now?

248
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,448
I did take the dog to a vet

249
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,201
but was told that it wouldn't make it,

250
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,411
so I brought it back.

251
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,746
Where's the dog now?

252
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,790
It died.

253
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,042
-So where is it?
-I buried it.

254
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,710
Where?

255
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,505
Wait, I just remembered
that I'd tossed it.

256
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,924
Which veterinary clinic?

257
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,178
-I don't remember.
-Gosh, this punk…

258
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,389
A DNA analysis will tell us
whether or not it was human blood.

259
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,184
How dare you try to fool us?
This is not the time for this!

260
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,478
Where is Seo Dong-jae?

261
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,732
He must've scrubbed the floor real hard.

262
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,652
And he used all kinds of bleach.

263
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,404
The blood is so contaminated
that they're not sure

264
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,115
if they'll find any DNA.

265
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,285
So the question is not
whether we can find whose blood it is,

266
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,038
but they might not even know
if it's human blood?

267
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,625
And he obviously knows that.
That's why he's so confident.

268
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,714
First, let's separate the suspect
from his father.

269
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,801
If we let his father stay with him,
he won't even say a word.

270
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,221
We've caught the culprit,
but we don't have any evidence.

271
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,766
Darn it. I'm sure we're so close.

272
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,520
Did they tell you why you were arrested?

273
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,565
-Yes.
-Did they say that you have the right

274
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,525
to an attorney and can explain yourself?

275
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,529
-Yes.
-Look at me, Hu-jeong.

276
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,030
Look at me!

277
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,243
Do not say a word.

278
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,162
No matter what they tell you.

279
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,083
I'll take care of everything,
so don't do anything. Got it?

280
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,960
Yes.

281
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,504
Even if the prosecutor
requests an arrest warrant,

282
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,922
you can be released

283
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,425
because they don't have
solid evidence against you.

284
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,345
No, I'll make sure
their warrant request is denied.

285
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,681
They can't arrest you.

286
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,602
So you must not tell them anything.

287
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,978
That is your right.

288
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,522
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

289
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,462
Ignore everything they tell you.

290
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,173
They're just small fries.

291
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,508
Let's go.

292
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,723
Do you believe it's dog blood?

293
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,185
Of course. Why wouldn't I believe
my son's words?

294
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,274
That you were being bullied…

295
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,194
We found bloodstains
on the floor and inside the closet.

296
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,528
Even inside the trunk.

297
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,450
I'm calling you because it's very urgent.

298
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,079
The fact that a prosecutor is missing
isn't important.

299
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,956
We've made an emergency arrest

300
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,625
but we may have to let him go
because of his attorney.

301
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,628
No, he definitely is the culprit.

302
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,505
We'll be screwed if we let him go.

303
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,176
I refuse to be blamed for losing him
because of the ambiguous DNA results.

304
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,513
Please help me out.

305
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,643
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

306
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,774
Sir.

307
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,361
Prosecutor Hwang just told me
about the situation.

308
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,613
This isn't abuse of authority--

309
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,575
Right, but--

310
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,169
Yes.

311
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,463
I'll tell him to be careful.

312
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,257
Yes, sir.

313
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,968
I apologize for causing you concern.
Yes, sir.

314
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,138
Those bastards!

315
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,850
What is it this time?

316
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,312
Do you know Judge Kim Gyu-man
at the Supreme Court?

317
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:54,938
No.

318
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,817
The suspect's father
went to Kim Gyu-man and threw a fit.

319
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,028
So he called the person
in charge of issuing warrants,

320
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,406
then he called
the deputy prosecutor general.

321
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,033
Which suspect?

322
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,868
Seo Dong-jae's case.

323
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,704
He told us not to issue the warrant
because the prosecutor in charge

324
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,582
can't remain subjective
because he's the victim's acquaintance.

325
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,918
He went on about how unfair it is
and that his son is being targeted.

326
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,587
Do you mean Hwang Si-mok?

327
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,591
It sounds like he's the one taking sides.
It's his son, but--

328
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,925
How dare he?

329
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,386
He isn't even my direct supervisor.
He's only my senior.

330
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,763
We still can't deny the warrant.

331
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,390
Did he think this would
make me get on my knees?

332
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,933
What does he take me for?

333
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,644
That's not important now.
What about the warrant?

334
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,605
They won't ask us to let him go.

335
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,107
-They might.
-What?

336
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,027
The judge at the National Assembly…
What was his name?

337
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,739
Doesn't he have seniority
over Kim Gyu-man?

338
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,699
Which class was he in?

339
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,367
I don't know.

340
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,287
I think he got in
just a few years before we did.

341
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,289
In that case…

342
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,375
Shin Jeong-ho must be his senior.

343
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,795
We can't deny the warrant.

344
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,756
-Is Shin Jeong-ho that judge?
-Yes.

345
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,259
Hello, sir. Do you have a moment?

346
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,428
I see. I'll make it quick, then.

347
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,806
Do you happen to know Judge Kim Gyu-man?

348
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,934
You've worked with him in the past?

349
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,395
Then he's your junior.

350
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,731
Right.

351
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,860
It's surrounded
by multiplex apartment buildings.

352
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,365
There are mountains and even a river
nearby.

353
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,952
Gosh, where could he have hidden him?

354
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,038
If we never find his body…

355
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,527
Where could he be?

356
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,663
Hello?

357
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,249
Yes.

358
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,084
The GPS log.

359
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,425
Yes, okay.

360
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,220
He was near Seongsu-dong 1-ga
at 3 a.m. today.

361
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,097
It's the most recent record

362
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,725
except for his visit
to the music store in the afternoon.

363
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,645
It's the perfect time to move the body
without being seen.

364
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,063
That must be it, then.

365
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,567
The place smelled like bleach
because he started cleaning after that.

366
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,195
But even the floor at his parent's place

367
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,530
is different from the one in the photo.

368
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,744
It's right by the Han River.

369
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,830
Darn it. So is it the Han River then?

370
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,290
I see mountains too.

371
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,585
Also, Seoul Forest and a creek.

372
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,171
Gosh, this is nuts.

373
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,884
It won't be easy to
find Prosecutor Seo there.

374
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,848
Jeez, this is ridiculous.

375
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:19,768
Hey.

376
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,478
Over here.

377
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,813
Is this the right spot?

378
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,066
He couldn't have tossed it here
even at 3 a.m.

379
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,109
He stopped here for about two minutes.

380
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,279
Seoul Forest is about
ten minutes away on foot.

381
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,491
But he wouldn't have carried the body
from all the way here.

382
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,701
If he pulled his car over
for just two minutes,

383
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,037
it means he chucked something and ran off.

384
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,707
Let's find out.
Maybe it's under a staircase somewhere.

385
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,336
We've already looked everywhere
but found nothing.

386
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,392
We checked that earlier. It's not there.

387
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,020
CLOTHING DONATIONS

388
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,242
My gosh. Hold on.

389
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,829
Hey, bring whatever tool we have. Hurry.

390
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,455
Gosh, hold on.

391
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,627
Gosh, darn it!

392
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,090
-He's got something.
-Hey, open this up.

393
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,466
Here.

394
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,012
Give me a hand.

395
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,305
One, two, three.

396
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,812
Take them out. All of them.

397
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,652
-Gosh, it stinks.
-It's bleach.

398
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,112
Hey, just rip it open.

399
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,826
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

400
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,123
We won't get any DNA from this.

401
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,250
So he wasn't here to chuck the body.

402
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,585
It was before he came here.

403
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,672
He should have moved the body,
cleaned his place, then threw these out.

404
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,467
He could have cleaned his place naked.

405
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,303
Ask for the GPS log
for before he came here. All of it.

406
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,346
Yes, sir.

407
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,891
It took hours just to get this location.

408
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,726
Tell them it's a matter of life or death!

409
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,107
Did Prosecutor Seo tell you

410
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,529
when and how he started suspecting you?

411
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,197
I have something to ask you.

412
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,533
Do you have some time today?

413
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,577
No, I'm busy today.

414
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,038
And I already told you everything.

415
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,582
It's not about that.
I just need to check something.

416
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,502
What do you need to check?

417
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,338
What about tomorrow? Let's talk in person.

418
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,589
Where would be good?

419
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,716
Shall I come to your place?

420
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,634
No.

421
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,428
That's okay.

422
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,470
Then where?

423
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,724
Are you familiar with Itaewon?

424
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,734
It's rare to see long-term repression
caused by bullying

425
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,529
turn into violent retaliation.

426
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,449
In most cases,
victims resort to self-harm.

427
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,788
Some say that happens because
they've completely surrendered mentally,

428
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,039
but I personally think

429
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,961
they do that while waiting
for their last recourse.

430
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,172
Time.

431
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,091
"This will end when I graduate.

432
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,430
The bullying will end
the day I can cut all ties with them."

433
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,516
They go so far as to hurt themselves

434
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,478
to wait for that day to come.

435
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,650
Hey, friend. You've hurt our feelings.

436
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,028
Seriously.

437
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,906
Did you think
we wouldn't be able to find you?

438
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,618
This place is huge.

439
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,373
Jeez, this place is much bigger.

440
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,604
Sounds like all you know
about bullying is from books.

441
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,694
I've forgotten how it felt,
but I still remember the experience.

442
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,327
You've finally become an adult.

443
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,081
You're attending a university
your father is proud of

444
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,916
with a full scholarship.

445
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,877
A decent adult, shall I say?

446
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,089
But what has changed?

447
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,219
You've not been able to take
a single step forward

448
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:50,223
from being the teenage boy
who used to be bullied.

449
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,685
You had

450
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,979
nothing to wait for,

451
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,649
so you decided not to wait.

452
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,943
Hey, friend.

453
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,822
What took you so long?
You kept us waiting for so long.

454
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,158
The keys.

455
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,543
Did you really sell my computer
and equipment?

456
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,506
Hey, did you just grab my wrist?

457
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,968
I'm sorry, friend.

458
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,762
We sold them for some money.
Are you angry?

459
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,764
Sorry, friend.

460
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,183
You should have lent us the money
when we asked you.

461
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,438
I even bought you those shoes.

462
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,025
You did, but I had no clothes
to wear with these.

463
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,193
Just tell me who you sold them to.

464
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,071
Everything I worked on is on my computer.

465
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,281
I'll buy it back.

466
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,742
Wow, didn't you make any backups?

467
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,744
Unbelievable.

468
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:56,289
What's the point of getting good grades
when you're so stupid and useless?

469
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,042
We sold it online.
I'll find who bought it.

470
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,711
-Bring it back by Thursday.
-I told you we sold it.

471
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,091
No, I mean my car. I need to use it.

472
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,886
For what?

473
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,056
I want to go to the beach.

474
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,600
Hey, let's go with him.

475
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,185
-Should we take the girls?
-No!

476
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:23,107
I mean, I'm not that skilled
at driving yet. So we shouldn't.

477
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,735
Why take them?
There'll be loads of girls at the beach.

478
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,362
-You're ridiculous.
-Right.

479
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,659
Hey, friend. Book a nice hotel.

480
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,494
A hotel?

481
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,580
Pensions are better.
We can have a barbecue. Book a pension.

482
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,248
Are you really going to come?

483
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,292
You don't have come if you don't want to.

484
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,513
All right.

485
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,765
I'll let you come with me.

486
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,525
How did it feel?

487
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,405
Ending it with your own hands.

488
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,200
Don't say a word. Don't do anything.

489
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,118
I…

490
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:16,953
I don't know.

491
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,288
It wasn't me.

492
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,875
What about Prosecutor Seo?

493
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,795
Is he dead?

494
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,007
I don't know.

495
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,223
Kim Hu-jeong.

496
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,601
What did you do to him?

497
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,396
Answer me.

498
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,651
Did you stab him?

499
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,988
Did you choke him?

500
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,657
Cut him into pieces?

501
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,042
There are many cases of the suspect
being charged with murder

502
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:08,212
even when the body wasn't found
and the suspect denied everything.

503
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,174
We found traces of blood in your room,

504
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,009
and you fled when you saw a detective.

505
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,385
We also found your clothes.

506
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,637
The clothes you had to throw away

507
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,390
in a random neighborhood
at three in the morning.

508
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,309
Look.

509
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,520
We found traces of you
trying to remove the blood.

510
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,065
What did you do to him?

511
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,777
Tell me.
What did you do to Prosecutor Seo?

512
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,075
What did you do to him?

513
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,583
You'll be charged and sentenced
to jail for sure.

514
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,168
Whatever your father told you,

515
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,505
and no matter how long you keep quiet,
you can't escape it.

516
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,592
The only thing left is to decide
what you'll be charged with.

517
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,635
That depends on you.

518
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,055
Will it be three murders,
or will one be an attempted murder?

519
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,266
If he was alive last night,
he could still be alive.

520
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,351
Where is he?

521
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:04,811
Did you kill him?

522
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,772
Did he die a long time ago?

523
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,234
Did you abandon him when he was alive?

524
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,446
I don't know anything.

525
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,965
We got his internet history.

526
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,717
He watched the video we uploaded
dozens of times

527
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,011
and even left a comment
on the witness testimony.

528
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,558
Where are you taking him?

529
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,688
Stop lying.

530
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,482
If you really saw something,
why didn't you report it?

531
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,775
Why would you do that?

532
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:57,530
You're just an attention seeker. You wrote
the comment. You wrote it yourself.

533
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,740
-No!
-You're an attention-seeking jerk.

534
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,325
You…

535
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,254
Do this again, and we'll consider it
obstruction of justice.

536
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,256
You're his senior, not mine.

537
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,754
ON PUBLIC DUTY

538
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,381
It's near your studio, right?

539
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,551
You threw away your clothes nearby.
He must be nearby too.

540
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,886
Where is he?

541
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,391
I've wanted to make music

542
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,019
for a really long time.

543
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,980
My dad told me

544
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,361
he'd let me do whatever I wanted
if I make it into a good college.

545
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,989
So I studied really hard.

546
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,418
But it didn't end.

547
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,132
Even when I went to high school

548
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,468
and college, they kept following me.

549
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,403
When I first got my own studio,
I was so happy.

550
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,157
I felt like I was being compensated
for everything I'd gone through.

551
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,370
But

552
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,081
they appeared again

553
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,042
at my studio.

554
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,842
Where could I go next?

555
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,220
I needed a future.

556
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,142
Did you think it'd end if you killed them?

557
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,145
Is that why you went to the beach?

558
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,233
What did you do to Prosecutor Seo?

559
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,903
Was it a river or mountains?

560
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,452
Mountains.

561
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,789
I just…

562
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,335
threw him somewhere in the mountains.

563
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,047
I heard there was a letter

564
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,258
and that there was a witness,

565
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,927
so I got scared.

566
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,889
I've kept him in my closet.

567
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,852
I was too scared to do anything.

568
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,689
But after hearing about the witness,

569
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,984
I thought I had to do something
so I touched him,

570
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,030
but he wasn't moving.

571
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,034
He was already dead.

572
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,331
You kept him like that when he was
bleeding and unconscious?

573
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,750
What about food and water?

574
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,919
Did you give him water?

575
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,772
Where is he?

576
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,945
I don't know.

577
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,448
You dumped him. How could you not know?

578
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,535
It was dark,

579
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,329
and I couldn't tell what's what.

580
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,648
I hadn't decided where to go.

581
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,985
I was just driving to where
there weren't any people.

582
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,737
So I'm not sure…

583
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,399
I think it's around here.

584
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,080
Look carefully. Are you sure this is it?

585
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,878
Look closely!

586
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,890
Hu-jeong…

587
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,644
Why… Why didn't you tell me?

588
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,354
I'm your dad.

589
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,067
We got the location.
It's halfway up Achasan.

590
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,446
Send as many search dogs and officers
as you can. The search area's really wide.

591
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,043
-Search thoroughly.
-Over here!

592
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,294
Over here.

593
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,547
-Look thoroughly.
-Be thorough!

594
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,757
Look everywhere.

595
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,384
-Take a closer look.
-It's nothing.

596
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,679
Let's go.

597
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,721
Move it!

598
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,977
Get a move on.

599
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,563
-Search up the hill.
-So this is the first search area.

600
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,193
The shoe doesn't belong to the victim.
Someone must've thrown it away.

601
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,946
There are a lot of trees.

602
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,656
He could be caught on a branch.

603
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,449
-Are you here?
-Step back.

604
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,534
All right!

605
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,619
Excuse me. Let that car in!

606
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,037
It's our equipment.

607
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,206
-Where did they come from?
-Keep them out.

608
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,041
How many did you bring?

609
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,254
We got two heat detectors
since it's nighttime.

610
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,924
We can use the others
if the search continues tomorrow.

611
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,393
Let it through.

612
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,031
You can't come in here.

613
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,407
Chief Choi.

614
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,284
-Yes.
-Are you coming from somewhere?

615
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,706
We didn't find any traces yet.

616
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,461
Are you even sure it's here?

617
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,505
The culprit isn't that sure of it.

618
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,300
That stupid jerk.

619
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,732
More to the right.

620
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,612
We can't go past that area
because of all the bushes.

621
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,030
-I see.
-So check there.

622
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,449
What?

623
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,078
What is that?

624
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,954
Is that helicam from a TV station?

625
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,999
Gosh. It's so loud!

626
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,543
It's interfering with our
search and rescue.

627
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,594
Did you get everything?

628
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,721
Yes, thank you.

629
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,810
The rescue scene is on the news right now.

630
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,479
Yes, I know. Can you send these over
the computer as well?

631
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,397
Yes, sir.

632
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,899
Are you all right?

633
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,317
Pardon?

634
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,987
I can't believe you already forgot.

635
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,251
You're old enough to do
your homework by yourself.

636
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,880
Okay, finish your homework
after you eat, okay?

637
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,466
I'm going to check later if you did it.

638
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:20,968
All right.

639
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,096
You should go home. I'll keep you updated.

640
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,515
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

641
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,393
You should head home.
You don't have to wait here.

642
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:41,071
Maybe I shouldn't say this
when someone's life is at stake,

643
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,117
but I used to be sick of doing this
back in the day.

644
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,455
You know what they say.

645
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,417
"Cases happen at the scene,
not at your desk."

646
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,713
I shouldn't have let it drag on

647
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,716
until we reached the scene.

648
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,472
One of the Tongyeong victims' father

649
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,516
said he couldn't buy his son
a pair of shoes.

650
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,354
He said his son said it was okay, and
that he could just get a part-time job.

651
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,482
I remember hearing that so clearly.

652
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,859
I should've used my brain.

653
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,695
It implied that he hadn't found a job yet.

654
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:25,657
Then where did he get
those expensive shoes?

655
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,328
If I had only thought of this back then…

656
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,954
I couldn't buy him these shoes.

657
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,584
But he said it was okay
and that he'd just get a part-time job.

658
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,294
Why didn't I think of that?

659
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,055
I think I heard something slipping.

660
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,849
-Is someone hurt?
-Was it over here?

661
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,185
There's something over here!

662
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,728
Over here!

663
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,772
Did you find him?

664
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,109
Did you find him?

665
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,861
-Where is it?
-What's going on?

666
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,947
-Where?
-Is that him?

667
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,324
I am here at the scene.

668
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,702
They are currently searching for
Prosecutor Seo who has been kidnapped…

669
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,037
Gyeong-jun…

670
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,165
Mom…

671
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,545
Gyeong-jun…

672
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,464
Don't let him watch the news.

673
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,177
Make sure he doesn't watch the news.

674
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,637
The news…

675
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,390
…related to the drowning in Tongyeong…

676
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,394
-Jeez. I can't see anything.
-Hey!

677
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,770
Did you find him?

678
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,106
Darn it.

679
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,320
-Bring your lights here.
-Lights!

680
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,738
Lights!

681
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,156
Slowly!

682
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,325
-Over there!
-Where?

683
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,494
-Over there!
-Where?

684
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,704
I can see him!

685
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,247
I think he's over there!

686
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,873
The rescue team is currently

687
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,294
pulling someone up from a slope
who is assumed to be Prosecutor Seo.

688
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,089
It is still unclear
whether he is alive or not.

689
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,634
The police will soon make an
official announcement…

690
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,977
UNCLEAR WHETHER HE IS ALIVE

691
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,694
Bring him up!

692
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,363
Keep your lights on them!

693
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,531
Over here!

694
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,491
Move aside.

695
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,409
Slowly!

696
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,244
Be careful!

697
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,746
Make way!

698
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:37,956
Be careful!

699
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,168
-Careful, now.
-Please, make way!

700
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,921
Clear this area of reporters and cars.

701
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,300
Please move! Let them pass!

702
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,469
Please stand back!

703
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,298
How did it go?

704
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,001
-Oxygen mask.
-Okay.

705
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,758
-Slowly.
-Right.

706
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,306
Wait!

707
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,205
-Let him lie down carefully.
-Okay.

708
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,635
This was tied around his wrists.

709
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,369
Why would you go this far?

710
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,580
Damn it.

711
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,167
What do you mean why?

712
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:45,352
MISSING PROSECUTOR RESCUED FROM ACHASAN

713
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,685
SENIOR INSPECTOR HAN

714
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,437
What is it?

715
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,776
Hang on.

716
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,489
Get that witness right now.

717
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,118
A fake letter and a fake witness report…

718
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,997
They were there for a reason.
This isn't a coincidence.

719
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,459
Could you drop me off…

720
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,295
You want us to stop?

721
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,339
Never mind.

722
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,771
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG WON-CHUL

723
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,650
Yes, sir.

724
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,736
What happened?

725
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,529
Is he alive?

726
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,072
Yes.

727
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,242
How is he?

728
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,369
He's unconscious right now.

729
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,580
He's in hypothermic shock
from the blood loss,

730
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,874
-and he had no water--
-He'll wake up, right?

731
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,419
Even if he does, there was
some impact when he fell.

732
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,046
He's suffered a shock from the fractures.

733
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,839
All right, then.

734
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,050
Okay. Great job.

735
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,051
All right, sir.

736
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,253
Who is it?

737
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,882
I live downstairs.

738
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,342
I think there's a water leak.

739
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,135
It's not my house.

740
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,639
There's a lot of water falling
into my house.

741
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,433
Could I check your laundry machine
or something?

742
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,275
At this hour?

743
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,030
Jeon Gi-hyeok, let's talk.

744
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,616
What's that?

745
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,329
What is it?

746
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,502
I WASHED THE DISHES
TOO LATE

747
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,427
I WASHED THE DISHES
TOO LATE

748
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,895
I threw him somewhere in the mountains.

749
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,731
I heard there was a letter…

750
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,864
He was just unlucky.

751
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,533
I decided not to do it.

752
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:33,038
I asked to see him,
but I tried to changed my mind.

753
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,081
Hey, Kim Hu-jeong!

754
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:48,178
It wouldn't have happened
if he had arrived a little later.

755
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,309
You really didn't send this?

756
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,283
Hey.

757
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,285
Come here, you jerk.

758
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,704
Come on!

759
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,629
I knew you lied for money,

760
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,172
but I didn't expect this.

761
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,258
Why was this at your house?

762
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,679
And the police watch? Did you
throw it away after taking the photo?

763
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,141
And the necktie. Did you buy it yourself?

764
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,518
What necktie?

765
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:43,358
The floor and the table. It's your house.

766
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,443
You took that photo at home.

767
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,988
What is that?

768
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,867
Don't play dumb.

769
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:58,081
You said that you watched the news
out of guilt after witnessing the scene.

770
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,501
There was a huge fuss about the culprit
sending the message.

771
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,545
And you're saying you've never seen this?

772
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,841
You should at least remember what you said

773
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,009
if you want to lie.

774
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,471
Come on. Floors like that
are really common in Korea.

775
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,516
You should've taken it outside
if you didn't want to get caught.

776
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,601
Were you afraid of people seeing you

777
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,270
but not of getting caught later?

778
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,859
All the houses in our building
have that floor.

779
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,194
Maybe someone there is the culprit.

780
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,032
Did everyone in your building
lie about witnessing the culprit?

781
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,410
What's your relationship
with Sergeant Baek?

782
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:38,621
Jeez, I told you I don't even know him.

783
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,873
Then who is it?

784
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,625
Who made you point him out as the culprit?

785
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,252
Nobody put me up to anything.

786
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:49,424
Why do you keep making up weird stories?

787
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,967
You little jerk.

788
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,304
You sent this and then claimed
you were a witness right after.

789
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:57,724
You made sure that the police watch
was shown, guising it as a mistake,

790
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,934
then pointed out a cop as the culprit.

791
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,145
How is this just a coincidence?

792
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,523
Who ordered you to do it?

793
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,775
I told you I did it for the money!

794
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,903
I admit it. Okay?

795
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,072
Why are you making such a fuss
about some floor pattern?

796
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,616
"Such a fuss"?

797
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,659
You must miss being in jail.

798
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,994
You want to go back there?

799
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,168
What…

800
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,045
Can you leave for a moment?

801
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,214
What? Why?

802
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:47,857
What's going on?

803
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,694
That jerk was smirking when you said
you'd send him back to jail.

804
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,240
He spent his whole life
cowering before the cops.

805
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,200
He must be so excited right now.

806
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,167
You remember me, don't you?

807
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,589
Don't you remember me?

808
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,219
You're the one who put on an act

809
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,429
with the license plate.

810
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,600
"An act"?

811
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,940
I've been working at
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

812
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,025
for ten years now.

813
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,112
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

814
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,699
After I put on the so-called "act,"

815
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,410
I received a strange phone call.

816
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,039
What call?

817
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,419
You don't need to know the details
of that call.

818
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,049
You have connections
with the prosecution, right?

819
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,259
Me?

820
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,428
What connections would I have?

821
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,348
I'm asking you

822
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,311
if I'll suffer any consequences

823
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,854
or be harmed

824
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,689
if I dig into this.

825
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:14,110
Let me know right now if you
have any connections with the prosecution.

826
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,613
Which office is it?
The central district office?

827
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,073
Oh, come on.

828
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:23,578
That's ridiculous.
I'm just a petty criminal.

829
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,330
Can't you tell?

830
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,090
All right, then.

831
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,096
If I end up

832
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,599
indicting you

833
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,311
and suffer some kind of a penalty
at the prosecution for that,

834
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,856
I'm coming back for you.

835
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,320
They told you that over the phone?

836
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:01,908
What else, then?

837
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,537
Well, I just meant…

838
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,913
Someone who died after drinking

839
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,749
wired money to three women
two days before his death?

840
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,918
We should find those people.

841
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,838
-You don't need to cover for them--
-I'm not covering for them.

842
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,257
Did she admit it?

843
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,677
The Criminal Legislation Division did this
to keep the investigative rights.

844
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,388
If it really is one of them,
who could it be?

845
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,390
Who was the third man
at the vacation home?

846
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,516
Hey!

847
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,061
Whether it's Woo Tae-ha or Kim Sa-hyun,
it doesn't matter.

848
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,064
I'll show you what it means
to have the authority to indict.

849
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:19,652
I'll indict you. I'll make you
a corrupt cop and a convict.

850
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:26,242
