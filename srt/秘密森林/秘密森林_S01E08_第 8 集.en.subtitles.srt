1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,303
STRANGER

3
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,684
I didn't do it!

4
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,771
It's Mr. Lee. He killed him.

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,274
You have to trust me.

6
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,985
I know.

7
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,788
Are you saying he gave you a dead phone
and told you to throw it in the water?

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,915
"This is the real one.
Put it somewhere at the scene."

9
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,958
Are you saying Mr. Lee did that?

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,674
Hey.

11
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,304
Do you think I wanted to do this?

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,766
Think about how having to do this
must've made me feel.

13
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,393
I was frustrated to death.

14
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,564
What's the evidence that can prove
that Mr. Lee is the culprit?

15
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,066
Can't you tell?

16
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,068
Is such a thing necessary between us?

17
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,404
Hey, Mr. Hwang. Si-mok!

18
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,033
Let's be honest with each other
for once as man to man.

19
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,870
Until when do we have to betray our gut
feelings because of reasons and evidence?

20
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,332
Be honest. I know you've also pegged him
as the culprit. Aren't I right?

21
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,960
You're being beyond ridiculous.

22
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,044
What?

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,339
You're making such a claim
without any evidence. How ridiculous.

24
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,882
This is all your fault.

25
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,344
None of this would've happened had you not
mentioned Kyung-wan Park knowing the girl!

26
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,347
Goodness. Even my ears are ashamed
from what you just said.

27
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,517
Cut it out. I guess you like being manly.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,602
-Be a real man and come with us.
-Let go.

29
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,020
Enough is enough.

30
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,148
Was Jin-seob Kang not enough for you?

31
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,067
What would've happened
had we not caught you here?

32
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,319
Kyung-wan would surely end up
going to jail.

33
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,990
As a psycho who killed his dad
and stabbed a girl, blinded by jealousy.

34
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,243
Stabbing flesh isn't
the only form of killing.

35
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,706
If you hadn't been caught, you would've
ended up killing Kyung-wan's future.

36
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,961
-Prosecutor Seo?
-Is it the room with the light on?

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,426
What the...

38
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,387
Well...

39
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,979
What's going on?

40
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,027
Gosh.

41
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,577
This can't be happening.
We might be screwed.

42
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,245
I'll talk to Chief first.

43
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,290
That girl keeps causing trouble.

44
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,834
Let go!

45
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,895
Will you be okay by yourself?

46
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,815
-Please take care of that.
-I'll go right away.

47
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,250
Please put the seat belt on.

48
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,275
Mr. Lee will figure out the reason

49
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,403
I had to do all this very quickly.

50
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,656
After that, he'll kill me.

51
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,118
Just like what he did to Mr. Park
and to that girl.

52
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,663
With me gone, there will be no one left
that remembers how corrupt he actually is.

53
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,291
He can be reborn as an honorable
prosecutor who's always been noble.

54
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,127
You're right.

55
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,044
You little...

56
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,757
That's why I tried to frame Kyung-wan Park
as the culprit. I wanted to end it.

57
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,051
Mr. Lee would end it
if the culprit has been caught.

58
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,221
I was just trying
to prevent additional murders.

59
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,806
I see.

60
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,226
Hey.

61
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,938
You know that my mother lives alone
in the countryside, right?

62
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,607
I've been her everything her whole life.

63
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,944
She won't want to go on with her life
if something happens to me.

64
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,699
Hey, then let's do this.

65
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,661
You want to catch the culprit, right?
Let's do it together. I'll help you.

66
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,872
After that, I'll gladly accept
any disciplinary action.

67
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,499
Let's please keep it from Mr. Lee, okay?

68
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,920
Will he harm you
if this gets reported to him?

69
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,215
Yes. You need to tell
that female cop about it too so that...

70
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,675
If you get harmed too,

71
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,678
we can be sure that he's the real culprit.

72
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,889
Please become a sacrificial victim
this time.

73
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,267
Sacrifice your life so that
we can catch the culprit.

74
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,353
Your sacrificial lamb was Kyung-wan,

75
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,190
and mine will be yours.

76
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,068
You piece of...

77
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,113
Hey, how dare you. You...

78
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,580
Damn it!

79
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,213
What is this bullshit right now?

80
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,339
APPROVAL REQUIRED

81
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,301
I was going to meet up with her
if I got a call from her.

82
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,303
I was going to report everything to you
after that.

83
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,807
Sir, I wouldn't have brought the phone
with me had I known she got abducted.

84
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,518
The incident broke out, and I thought
people would be suspicious of me.

85
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,645
I just missed the right moment
to tell you about it.

86
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,979
Yes, this is all my fault.

87
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,024
However, I went to that house today
to inspect the scene.

88
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,692
I swear, I didn't have
any ulterior motive.

89
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,861
Guys from Yongsan Police Station came

90
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,989
because Mr. Seo told them
that Kyung-wan Park...

91
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
could've hidden the victim's phone
at the scene.

92
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,410
However, what we witnessed was Mr. Seo

93
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,954
wiping his fingerprints

94
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,665
off the phone and placing it
underneath the bed.

95
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,333
I was just trying to take a photo...

96
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,128
What did you tell me?
You said that you were confident

97
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,754
and that you'd pierce through anything.

98
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,966
I even summoned
the two-star general for you.

99
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,803
You're the one who exposed
the corruption in the military,

100
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,138
yet you got arrested

101
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,891
in front of police officers while trying
to frame someone for murder?

102
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,436
And I have to announce it myself?

103
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,603
Is that it?

104
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,689
Am I

105
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,607
supposed to say that my prosecutors

106
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,235
fabricated evidence again as soon as
I became the chief prosecutor?

107
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,403
Sir.

108
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,202
Who knows about this?

109
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,789
Who else knows about this?

110
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,749
Do you think this is 1988 or what?

111
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,919
Why did you beat up that guy?

112
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,507
You told us to make him confess, so...

113
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,431
How much time do we have?

114
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,019
Well, we have a day
if he doesn't get arrested.

115
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,564
We do have to let him go
by tomorrow night.

116
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,776
How much more time do you need?

117
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,280
It'll be all gone in about two weeks.

118
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,365
He just got some bruises. That's all.

119
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,410
Why do you guys never understand
what I tell you?

120
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,330
Good grief.

121
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,434
Gosh.

122
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,770
He's more screwed than I am.

123
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,614
CHANG-JUN LEE

124
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,079
Hey, do my guys have to keep being
fooled because of your guys' problems?

125
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,830
Yes, I know. I admit it.

126
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,582
So let's put an end to this.

127
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,544
One week?

128
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,797
How will we justify it? Why?

129
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,013
Go ahead and detain him.

130
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,224
We'll suspend his indictment in a week.

131
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,642
Yes, sir!

132
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,894
By the way, that girl's phone
has been sent to NFS.

133
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,730
-You have nothing to worry about, right?
-No.

134
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,198
Right.

135
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,784
Yes.

136
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,054
Gosh, why is there no empty room
beside his office?

137
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,728
All right. You should also make sure
your guys behave themselves.

138
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,271
Okay.

139
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,486
Even if Kyung-wan just followed the order,

140
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,196
fabricating an alibi is subject
to indictment.

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,742
But considering the fact that the military
is a special environment,

142
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,871
we should suspend his indictment
in two weeks. Let Eun-soo handle it.

143
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,666
Kyung-wan Park has an alibi
for the day Ga-young Kim got abducted.

144
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,668
-With the commander's wife...
-Suspend his indictment.

145
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,088
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,717
Dong-jae will face a disciplinary action,
so he has to be suspended from his duties.

147
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,345
All cases assigned to his office
must be redistributed,

148
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,180
but tell him to show up
at his office on time.

149
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,724
Yes, sir.

150
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,228
Had you told me about him
keeping Ga-young Kim's phone,

151
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,605
this wouldn't have happened.

152
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,898
My apologies.

153
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,693
I couldn't be certain of it
with the ringtone alone.

154
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,071
I bet that's not true.

155
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,740
You just couldn't trust me.

156
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,241
About the victim's phone.

157
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,620
How did you know
that the other one was fake?

158
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,747
Because those who have two cell phones

159
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,916
could have additional phones.

160
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,919
We went to the golf course
at around 3 p.m.

161
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,963
Private Park drove as usual.
He was like our golf instructor, you know.

162
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,259
Si-mok.

163
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,888
Because he knew I was suspicious of him
and that I went through his office,

164
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,308
I didn't think he'd expose the phone
easily.

165
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,228
Then does it mean
Dong-jae is not the culprit?

166
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,565
He even used the victim's phone
to escape my radar.

167
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,359
Were you aware

168
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,986
of the fact that he's suspicious of you?

169
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,488
The ones who are suspicious of others

170
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,490
aren't the culprit...

171
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,286
No, it could be a trick.

172
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,791
By showing that he's suspicious of me,

173
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,419
he might be trying to escape
the suspicion surrounding him.

174
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,507
It's just like how you're confused
whether he's the culprit or not.

175
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,429
You're telling yourself
that you're not the culprit.

176
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,015
People say that a wise word
can solve all of your problems,

177
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,728
yet you bring more trouble on yourself
every time you speak.

178
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,231
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,567
Are you really sorry?
From the bottom of your heart?

180
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,283
Did you just say
"from the bottom of your heart"?

181
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,576
Yes. What about it?

182
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,289
Most people would opt for "sincerely."

183
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,334
The assault wasn't caused
by violent tendencies.

184
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,378
Something was wrong with his brain
when he was little.

185
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,133
It looks like the surgery damaged the part
responsible for perceiving human emotions.

186
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,636
Find out if Dong-jae actually found
the phone,

187
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,638
or if he stabbed her and took it from her.

188
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,099
Yes, sir.
And I'll also keep a watchful eye

189
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,852
on whether any mishap happens

190
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,563
to Mr. Seo or not.

191
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,234
Have a good evening.

192
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,546
How can a prosecutor
be such a bad judge of character?

193
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,591
I can't believe he thought
this guy stabbed two people.

194
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,678
You also don't think he did it, right?

195
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,972
-Hey.
-Yes.

196
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,181
You really didn't do it, right?

197
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,308
I didn't. I didn't do anything.

198
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,313
Here. Eat more, okay?

199
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,232
You'll be released soon.

200
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,902
We should just forward him to prosecution,
saying he's been cleared of suspicion.

201
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:25,489
But that prosecutor has a nasty temper.

202
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,032
That's right.

203
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,826
It would've been over in a week,

204
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,622
but you called an attorney
and got on that prosecutor's nerves.

205
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,332
He doesn't even have money.

206
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,127
His family had to get into debt
because of the attorney's fees,

207
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,504
and he got on the wrong side
of that prosecutor.

208
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,923
-You guys are eating.
-Yes.

209
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,302
What did they say?
Can they revive the phone?

210
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,014
All of the deleted files
will be recovered as well.

211
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,360
You got my text, right? We have to pretend

212
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,237
we didn't see what happened today.

213
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,281
-Yes, sir.
-By the way,

214
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,825
I asked you to share information
on what Prosecutor Hwang is up to.

215
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,327
What was that today?

216
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,288
When you knew about Ga-young Kim's phone,
you should've told me about it.

217
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,832
I would've totally reported it to you
if I had known.

218
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,752
I went to the scene because
he just asked me to meet him there.

219
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,545
You didn't know either?

220
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,505
They're asking us to keep it a secret.

221
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,716
They obviously know
that it's something to be ashamed of.

222
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,845
Report everything to me, no matter
how insignificant it seems. Got it?

223
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,514
Yes, Captain. I'll leave for the day now.

224
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,433
Get going.

225
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,811
Don't work too hard.

226
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,151
Eat up.

227
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,827
-I'll take him.
-Sure.

228
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,965
You said you've never even
spoken to Ga-young.

229
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,550
Why were her photos on your phone?
And why did you delete them?

230
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,761
Why did you lie?

231
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,431
I was afraid they might raise suspicion
during the investigation.

232
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,809
I took them secretly.

233
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,644
They're creepshots? Why did you do that?

234
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,437
Did you have a crush on her?

235
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,856
Many of my friends also took
photos of her secretly.

236
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,692
And I took them as I was just
passing by her.

237
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,237
Then you should've told us. Did you think
we wouldn't find out about it?

238
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,823
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,967
Just a moment.

240
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,310
Lieutenant Han.

241
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,396
-Later.
-It's urgent.

242
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,024
-I have to do something now.
-It's about that.

243
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,492
He'll be released in two weeks.

244
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,327
So let's not cause trouble.

245
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,582
Your chief asked us
to keep it to ourselves.

246
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,710
If you cause another trouble, you'll be
excluded from the investigation.

247
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,253
Then things will get complicated.

248
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,216
So...

249
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,722
Am I only allowed to rebel when it's about
things that are helpful for the case?

250
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,557
Do you not want to bother

251
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,477
trying to find another investigator
just because of a guy who's a nobody?

252
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,188
What I'm trying to say
is that no one can replace you.

253
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,190
Whether it's a bother is beside the point.

254
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,829
Do you know what he said?

255
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,084
He asked me not to tell his grandmother.

256
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,296
I can't

257
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,382
understand why he let them do this to him.

258
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,512
But my co-workers whom I see every day,

259
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,599
who are completely normal people,
did something like this,

260
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,769
and that's what I'm struggling with more.
I can't accept it.

261
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,107
Do you think they did such a thing
because they were born evil?

262
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,525
They've become like this

263
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,443
because they can get away with it.

264
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,945
They know people will turn a blind eye.

265
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,906
If one person keeps his or her
eyes wide open and speaks up,

266
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,074
this can change.

267
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,495
Whether he'll be released in two weeks
or detained for a long period of time,

268
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,955
the choice is yours.

269
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,208
What do you mean by that?

270
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,253
If we let him go right away
due to human rights issues,

271
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,964
we'd be proving that we detained him
even though he's innocent.

272
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,759
If you don't turn a blind eye to it
and open your mouth,

273
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,137
they'll keep him locked up for months.

274
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,055
Make your choice.

275
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,607
How many people do you think are told
to make a choice for reasons like this

276
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,486
when they're actually being
forced to be silent?

277
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,907
I can't compromise. I won't.

278
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,619
Kyung-wan isn't a crucial suspect,

279
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,122
but it's true that we have to vet him.

280
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,082
I'll investigate it until the end of it.

281
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,423
Then let's do this.

282
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,385
Let's have an expert
handle the human rights violation.

283
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,893
Hey, it's me. You still have some
business cards from that law firm, right?

284
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,814
Can you go to Southern Seoul
Detention Center tomorrow?

285
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,232
SOUTHERN SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

286
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,651
Yes, early in the morning.
As early as possible.

287
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,783
Here you go.

288
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,295
URGENT TRANSPORT

289
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:26,516
LAW-ABIDING SPIRIT

CORRECTION THAT RESPECTS HUMAN DIGNITY

291
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,659
Please go in.

292
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,539
Go on.

293
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,544
Get changed.

294
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,841
This way, please.

295
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,679
Straighten your back.

296
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,099
Come here. Squat down.

297
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,853
Turn around and bend down.

298
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,940
Pull down your underwear
and spread your legs.

299
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,203
Are you Mr. Kyung-wan Park?

300
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,165
I'm Jung-bon Kim.

301
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,501
How are you holding up?

302
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,963
Did my grandmother send you here?

303
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,633
Yes, sort of.

304
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,885
I don't need an attorney.

305
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,345
Please leave.

306
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,556
As you can see...

307
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,598
OFFICE MANAGER
JUNG-BON KIM

308
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm not an attorney.

309
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,148
Oh, boy. It's quite chilly here, isn't it?

310
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,818
PROSECUTOR DONG-JAE SEO

311
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,613
Gosh, they can't be handled like that.

312
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,575
We're colleagues.
You guys can't do this to us.

313
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,118
This is just our...

314
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,955
Are you guys even taking...

315
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,930
VOICE RECORD

316
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,521
Did you know the victim
before the incident took place?

317
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,901
Did you know her or not?

318
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,197
Can't you ask a better question?

319
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,617
You should be asking if I saw anything.

320
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,286
What did you see?

321
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,290
What did the driver say when he called?

322
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,419
Did he say that he gave her address
to a psycho around 9 p.m.?

323
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,922
So?

324
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,925
If you left Yeoksam-dong around 9 p.m.
to go to Garwol-dong,

325
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,843
it must've taken over 30 minutes.

326
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,971
I beat you by at least 20 minutes.

327
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,643
Had you arrived a little sooner,
you could've witnessed the abduction.

328
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,106
Then how did you get her cell phone?

329
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,275
I told you I found it on the street.
Was I not allowed to pick it up?

330
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,571
I guess you pick up
everything that's fallen on the ground.

331
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,824
Or did you see it on the ground

332
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,784
and know whose phone it was right away

333
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,786
because you two were that close?

334
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,676
It looked like she had already fled,
but I thought she could come back.

335
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,311
I parked nearby and waited.

336
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,404
But...

337
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,079
I could tell how much of a rush
she was in when she left.

338
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,500
I thought, "Waiting here is probably
a waste of time."

339
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,880
I figured she'd look for her phone.
I was going to answer it when she called.

340
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,258
Why were you trying so hard to meet her?

341
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,676
Was it Mr. Lee's order?

342
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,846
I was trying to protect her.

343
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,974
Why do you think I didn't tell Mr. Lee
about finding her address?

344
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,644
Did you cause a ruckus at the bar
because you wanted to protect her?

345
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,108
At first, I thought it was only natural
that he wanted to track her down.

346
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,693
After sending a girl like her,

347
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,322
Mr. Park used to go, "She's actually
a minor. You guys are screwed now."

348
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,948
I knew that was his tactic.

349
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,620
Then he died. What do you think
I thought when that happened?

350
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,789
"Is he asking me
to find his second sacrificial victim?"

351
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,833
So did you decide to hand her to him?

352
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,794
I was trying to warn her.
I wanted to tell her that she should hide.

353
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,464
Was I supposed to do nothing,
fully knowing he was after her?

354
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,800
But she didn't call all night,

355
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,386
and I didn't hear anything from her
even the next day.

356
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,430
Youngsters can't stand a minute
without a phone.

357
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,390
That's when my instinct kicked in.

358
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,227
I thought,
"She didn't just drop her phone.

359
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,603
He got her."

360
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,565
Look at what happened.

361
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,818
What did the phone look like
on the ground?

362
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,487
What kind of question is that?

363
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,489
Would it have been standing up or what?

364
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,907
It was just fallen on the street.

365
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,409
All right.

366
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,412
Did you abduct Ga-young Kim
and inflict injuries on her?

367
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,126
Gosh, you're driving me nuts.

368
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,213
Then do you think I killed Mr. Park too?

369
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,799
Hey.

370
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,094
I'm going to tell you this just once,
so listen up.

371
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,015
There are people who had
some after-hours fun thanks to Mr. Park.

372
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,685
However, he just took care of the bills.

373
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,480
He didn't introduce girls to anyone.
Even not to department chiefs.

374
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,191
I'm sure he entertained people
at other companies too.

375
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,859
However...

376
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,821
That night,

377
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,449
the person to whom I reported
that I found the girl...

378
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,502
Mr. Lee was the only one.

379
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,761
But what I don't understand is

380
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,391
why he chose public execution
over secret burial.

381
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,898
You should be careful too.

382
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,861
Stop attacking him
unless you want to end up like that girl.

383
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,613
Why did you do it?

384
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,073
I said I didn't do it!

385
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,496
Why did you drag Mr. Park into the circle

386
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,790
and spoil your colleagues?

387
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,086
You think I spoiled them?

388
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,006
They did it to themselves.

389
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,221
Please cooperate.

390
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,140
May I please have your car key, Mr. Seo?

391
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,559
What's her problem now?

392
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,940
SEIZURE ORDER

393
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,235
I must collect all physical evidence
that can be damaged.

394
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,780
Both of you are suspects.

395
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,109
At 9:14 p.m., Mr. Seo arrived
at Ga-young Kim's place in Garwol-dong.

396
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,530
He left as soon as he confirmed
that she wasn't home.

397
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,247
That must be when he found the phone.

398
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,334
Everything matches his claim.

399
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,003
However,

400
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,464
the record shows

401
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,842
that he called Mr. Lee at 7:47 p.m.,
which was before the incident took place.

402
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,011
So?

403
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,306
If that's when Mr. Lee received
a report about Mr. Seo finding Ga-young,

404
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,851
he definitely had enough time
to mobilize his accomplice.

405
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,189
Why are you showing me this?

406
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,026
I thought you were supposed to protect
all damageable evidence from me.

407
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,819
Isn't that what Mr. Lee wants you to do?

408
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,280
Who cares about what he wants?

409
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,575
Eun-soo.

410
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,709
Can I

411
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,920
trust you?

412
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,758
I'm asking if you can be my right arm.

413
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,427
Of course, Mr. Hwang.

414
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,434
How dare you even dream
of becoming my right arm?

415
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,645
I'd just cut off that arm.

416
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,023
What... What was that about?

417
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,984
-How do you feel?
-What do you think?

418
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,111
How can you mock someone like this?

419
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,948
You were betrayed in just a minute,

420
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,825
but Dong-jae has invested ten years.

421
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,161
He was Mr. Lee's right arm for a decade
and did everything he was asked to do.

422
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,082
Did you say Mr. Lee had enough time
to mobilize his accomplice?

423
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,835
Do you think he had more time
than Dong-jae?

424
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,754
-So?
-Dong-jae is the culprit.

425
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,506
He instigated his accomplice.

426
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,051
Why are you rushing like this
all of a sudden?

427
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,848
I solved the puzzle that seemed unsolvable
when I thought Mr. Lee was the culprit.

428
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,892
The question of why he didn't
finish the girl

429
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,602
or bury her in the woods somewhere remote?

430
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,189
Dong-jae must've wanted to get back
at him. That's why he got the idea.

431
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,693
He must've thought he should
expose Mr. Lee's deep, dark secret

432
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,112
in a very shocking way.

433
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,450
So you think Mr. Seo is the culprit?
Is that your conclusion?

434
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,369
Yes.

435
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,083
Why? Aren't you happy
that the case is solved now?

436
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,795
Do you know something else?

437
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,506
What did you see on the day you tailed us?

438
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,220
-What are you talking about?
-It was captured in the security camera.

439
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,805
The day we went to find Ga-young.

440
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,403
I just followed you out because
I saw you going somewhere in a rush.

441
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,697
That's really all. I did not tail you.

442
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,244
Is that so? That's not what I saw
in the security camera footage.

443
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,913
You're mistaken.

444
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,042
That's too bad.
You should've followed me more.

445
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,545
Then you would've witnessed the scene.

446
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,174
Or you could've crossed paths
with Mr. Seo's accomplice.

447
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:10,470
Then I would've told you about it already.
Why would I keep it to myself?

448
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,171
-What is going on?
-I don't know.

449
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,426
-Officer.
-Yes.

450
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,137
Would there be anything that can be used
as a weapon in the evidence room?

451
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,180
Pardon?

452
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,848
A weapon?

453
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,194
You really can't use it.
You'll get in huge trouble if you do.

454
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,822
Please only use it to scare him.

455
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,894
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

456
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,771
I know that you were
trying to kill the girl.

457
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,065
Check the lobby security camera footage
from that day.

458
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,029
SECURITY OFFICE

459
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,615
Where are you now? Let's meet up
and talk in person, okay?

460
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,951
You had no idea I was tailing you, right?

461
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,912
But I saw it with my own two eyes.

462
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,124
You came straight here
and got her phone first.

463
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,752
Your accomplice must've told you.

464
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,587
Didn't you come here because of her phone?

465
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,424
You said you saw it lying on the street,
but I know that it's a lie.

466
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,470
Why do you keep spewing total nonsense?
Hey, where are you...

467
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,940
You came straight here
and got her phone first.

468
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,818
"Here"?

469
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,175
You're not even surprised.

470
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,391
Hey, Eun-soo.

471
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,019
I'm not sure what you saw here
that day, but...

472
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,771
I don't care about that.

473
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,565
My target is Mr. Lee.

474
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,735
-What?
-Dump it on him.

475
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,906
Why are you being like this suddenly?

476
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,368
It's not sudden. I've been patiently
waiting for an opportunity like this.

477
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,121
It's your specialty.

478
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,915
Framing others
and turning people into criminals.

479
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,376
Mr. Hwang is suspicious of you too.

480
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,920
If you don't do as I say,
I'll tell him that you're the culprit.

481
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,923
The culprit had to be Mr. Lee.
Why did you get involved...

482
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,551
Have you lost your mind?

483
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,272
Was it you?

484
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,233
Dump it all on Mr. Lee
and his father-in-law.

485
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,570
Make it happen at all costs.

486
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,449
Then what?

487
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,910
What?

488
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,496
No criminal gets executed in this country.

489
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,208
Those scums will figure out a way
to retaliate even if they're behind bars.

490
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,253
The rich don't get punished even when
they hit someone with a metal pipe.

491
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,255
Do you think they'll actually be
sent to jail?

492
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,507
Both you and I will get killed.

493
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,009
I'm not scared of death.

494
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,637
I am.

495
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,598
I have a kid,

496
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,850
and I mean the whole world to my mother.

497
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,978
I'm sure it will be better for your mother
if you just die

498
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,438
rather than become a serial killer.

499
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,609
Then I have no choice.

500
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,736
I'll go report that I saw you
with your accomplice.

501
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,702
Hey!

502
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,415
Let go! I said, let go!

503
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,836
Let go!

504
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,342
Let go!

505
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,996
Hey.

506
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,292
Eun-soo.

507
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,462
Eun-soo.

508
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,216
Eun-soo.

509
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,343
Eun-soo!

510
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,011
Eun-soo!

511
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,846
Gosh.

512
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,434
I thought you were dead.

513
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,568
Why did you have to provoke me
with such nonsense...

514
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,739
Are you all right?

515
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,908
You really didn't do it, right?

516
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,579
You didn't kill him?

517
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,416
What? I did not kill him.

518
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,629
All right, then.

519
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,632
I knew it.

520
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,429
Hey, are you colluding with Si-mok?

521
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,513
No.

522
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,298
Mr. Seo didn't do it.
I confirmed it myself.

523
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,215
He'd never kill anyone.

524
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,888
You'd know what I mean if you saw it.

525
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:13,017
I wouldn't be able to stand before you
like this if he was the culprit.

526
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,186
You were wrong this time.

527
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,480
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

528
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,932
-What is it?
-Can you lend me some clothes?

529
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,434
My mom will bombard me with questions
if I show up like this.

530
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,104
Tell her you got punched
while interrogating a vicious criminal.

531
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,451
God, why is it taking so long?

532
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,049
Thank you.

533
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,448
I'm sorry, but...

534
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,426
I can pull off any clothes, can't I?

535
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,016
I'll give it back tomorrow.

536
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,271
He might have figured out halfway through
that it was a trap.

537
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,107
It's possible he stopped because of it.

538
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,942
No, it's not.

539
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,697
I lied to him and threatened him.

540
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,533
If he was the killer,
he wouldn't have stopped like that

541
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,160
whether he figured it out or not.

542
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,621
You know how he is.

543
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,707
If he was about to be caught
after brutally harming two people,

544
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,877
he would've lost it
and tried to shut me up at all costs.

545
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,128
I'm not sure.

546
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,132
He could be a lot more rational
and methodical than we think.

547
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,720
Then this wouldn't have happened.

548
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,432
He could've just used a stun gun
and dragged me like Ga-young.

549
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,643
What if he thought

550
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,979
I was behind you?

551
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,733
I wish you were behind me there.

552
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,402
You wouldn't be able to say that
if you actually saw it.

553
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,781
I'm certain that Mr. Seo isn't
the culprit.

554
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,499
Be honest with me.
You aren't sure about it either, right?

555
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,044
Your conviction
that Mr. Seo is the culprit

556
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,421
must be fading away because of me.

557
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,680
I'll take that as a yes.

558
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,891
See you tomorrow.

559
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:49,024
By the way, are you always like this?

560
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,778
You don't even listen to any music?

561
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,847
If he was the killer,
he wouldn't have stopped like that

562
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,432
whether he figured it out or not.

563
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,479
He could've just used a stun gun
and dragged me like Ga-young.

564
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,481
Eun-soo. Hey...

565
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,196
Eun-soo emphasized that Dong-jae
isn't the culprit,

566
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,075
but by doing so, she actually ended up
revealing how much she wants

567
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,744
Mr. Lee's family to be the culprit.

568
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,748
If she can throw her own life
out there as bait,

569
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,626
how would she feel
about someone else's life?

570
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,712
Between the probability
that Dong-jae isn't the culprit

571
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,131
and the probability
that Eun-soo is a suspect,

572
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,717
which is higher now?

573
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,143
Thank you for the sweater.

574
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,731
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

575
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,801
They managed to recover
all the data on Ga-young Kim's phone.

576
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,304
It has nothing but thousands
of her selfies.

577
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,431
There's nothing useful.

578
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,226
She should've taken photos
with those men instead.

579
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,311
They're not crazy.

580
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,564
Why would they do something
that might get them into trouble?

581
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,024
What about the call history?
Has it been retrieved too?

582
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,026
I'm getting another call.
I'll call you back in a bit.

583
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,781
Hey, Sun-chang. What's up?

584
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,586
Salute.

585
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,840
It took you quite a while to get here.
I guess you were somewhere far.

586
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,049
Yes. When did she get here?

587
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,468
A while ago.

588
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,386
I couldn't say no.

589
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,680
-I thought you should...
-I'm glad you called me.

590
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,028
You're doing it again!

591
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,947
-Seriously.
-Okay, I won't smoke.

592
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,073
-Gosh.
-All right, I'll quit.

593
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,075
Get off of me. You reek of smoke.

594
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,452
I'll really quit.

595
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,412
Goodness, you stink.

596
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,463
Ma'am.

597
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,845
Did you come here
right after you saw Kyung-wan?

598
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,806
We should live here when he gets released.
They'll let him go soon, right?

599
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,266
Yes, of course.

600
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,769
I was actually working on
verifying his alibi before coming here.

601
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,479
Please wait just a few more days.

602
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,405
Shall I ask the police officer outside
to stay here with you?

603
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,082
Well...

604
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,378
When Kyung-wan gets out...

605
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,133
Never mind.

606
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,052
It's nothing.

607
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,303
Those...

608
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,181
-Do these need to be taken out?
-I'll...

609
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,851
It's okay. If there's anything strenuous,
please ask that police officer for help.

610
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,062
He's my underling, so you can
use him for whatever you need.

611
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,106
I'll see you later at home.

612
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,525
Oh, boy.

613
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,741
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

614
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,453
She'll collapse if she finds out
what happened to him.

615
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,871
You mean how we beat him up?

616
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,057
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop them.

617
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,269
Were you there too?

618
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:20,981
I speculated.

619
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,028
Do you like Astro Boy by any chance?

620
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,946
Astro Boy?

621
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,533
Oh, that cartoon? I've heard of it.

622
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,952
You've heard of it?

623
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,622
You've only heard of that cartoon legend?

624
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:42,169
Anyway, there's something his dad said.

625
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,545
He has a dad?

626
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,505
I thought he was a robot.

627
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,884
I'm talking about the person
who drew it, Osamu Tezuka.

628
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,678
Anyhow, that's not important right now.

629
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,140
He said, "Cartoonists can draw anything,

630
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,184
but there's one exception.

631
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,437
Things that violate basic human rights."

632
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,982
It's just a cartoon, you know.

633
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,820
We must not violate something that should
be protected even for cartoon characters.

634
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,658
We have a thing called pride
as members of the police.

635
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,494
From next time... I mean,

636
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,872
from now on,
I will be sure to protect our pride.

637
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,544
She wants to live here again. Keep up
the great work until she moves back here.

638
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,921
No problem.

639
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,381
Salute.

640
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,684
So, Kyung-wan Park's indictment
will be suspended.

641
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,435
What about Dong-jae?
Has a decision been made?

642
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,189
I think he was just being overly
ambitious. He had no other intentions.

643
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,610
You think it was done
purely out of ambition?

644
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,116
The division commander is the only one
who's in deep shit.

645
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,200
What's going on with him?

646
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,414
I heard the army headquarters will
investigate it, but I have no updates yet.

647
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:05,168
They must be busy
trying to make sure their words match.

648
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,552
I can't criticize them.

649
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,221
We're also keeping what Dong-jae did
to ourselves.

650
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,755
-Hello.
-Hello.

651
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,298
Please read this.

652
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,716
Have a great day.

653
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,718
-Hello.
-Hello, please read this.

654
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,094
Hello.

655
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,597
CRIME PREVENTION CAMPAIGN

656
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,182
We're doing a crime prevention campaign.

657
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,434
-Please spread words about this.
-Have a good day. Hello.

658
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,160
Okay. Get home safely.

659
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,380
Yes.

660
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,845
Is Dad hounding him again?

661
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,600
The line is busy at the moment.
You'll be connected to the voice mail.

662
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,522
Chairman Lee, please.

663
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,774
Yes, I just heard about it.

664
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,909
Yes. Father?

665
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,207
Even if Dad scolds you,
just agree with everything he says.

666
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,917
I'll take care of the rest.

667
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,089
Turn on the radio.

668
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:15,924
Breaking news.

669
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,135
This afternoon, Sungmoon Daily published
an exclusive story on suspicions

670
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,514
surrounding the prosecution accepting
bribes, quoting an anonymous informant.

671
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,724
According to the informant, the victim

672
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,519
of the Huam-dong murder
which took place in January this year

673
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,272
bribed prosecutors
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office

674
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,400
with money and gifts on a regular basis
before his death.

675
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,694
Sungmoon Daily, which reported
the suspicions of bribery,

676
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:39,447
stated that the tip was received
through a regular registered mail

677
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,702
and that it did not include any details
such as names of the prosecutors

678
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,079
who accepted bribes
or the amounts that were received.

679
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,748
So they ate up all the bribes
and killed him.

680
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,792
How can they be that corrupt?

681
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,837
They're in no position
to judge and prosecute us.

682
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,255
That's what I'm saying.

683
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,352
-Anything on the informant?
-Nothing yet.

684
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,563
The newspaper received a typed letter.

685
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:15,066
The informant used an old-fashioned method
in order to avoid IP tracking.

686
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,278
-From which post office was it sent?
-I sent an investigator there.

687
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,036
It's the former chief prosecutor.

688
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,968
I won't remind you
how your staff should be managed.

689
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:47,098
I know that some of you went to places
with or through the late Mr. Kim.

690
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,059
Ask the owners to cooperate.
Don't send your staff.

691
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,727
You'll have to make the requests yourself,

692
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,271
but don't do it via phone
as your calls can be recorded.

693
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,441
Make sure to let them know that they will
not only have to shut down their business,

694
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,902
but will also be doomed for life
if they don't watch their mouths.

695
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,320
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

696
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,031
No more team dinners as of today.

697
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,741
No lunch or dinner
outside the office, either.

698
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,618
Every bar and restaurant in the area

699
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,870
will be filled with reporters
disguised as customers.

700
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,373
If anyone provides them
with any gossip-worthy information,

701
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,626
I will find out who it is,
going through every division.

702
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:18,505
Cleaning staff and security guards
are not allowed in prosecutors' offices.

703
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,342
This will

704
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,261
pass quietly.

705
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,555
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

706
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:39,401
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

707
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,123
It's impossible.

708
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,426
I apologize, sir.

709
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,096
Every time there's a problem,
it's at the western office.

710
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,765
The Prosecutor General
must be sick of hearing it.

711
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,229
I disgraced both of you.

712
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,897
I sincerely apologize.

713
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,692
I apologize too, sir.

714
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,029
My son-in-law dishonored you.

715
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,531
Please don't be like that, Mr. Lee.

716
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,491
Don't go easy on him.

717
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,244
He can't complain even if you decide
to punish him harshly.

718
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,497
Is it true?

719
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,417
Absolutely not.

720
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,919
-What about the man who bribed and died?
-I've never met him.

721
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,759
What's your plan?

722
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,594
We'll take the bull by the horns.

723
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,722
We have nothing to hide or fear.

724
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,018
Yes, show us what you can do.

725
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,936
Public sentiment is like waves.

726
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,648
Getting swept away is dangerous,
but it vanishes if you ride it well.

727
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,275
Yes, sir.

728
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,236
Sir.

729
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,199
He'll run like a faithful dog to make sure
there's no more disgrace to prosecution.

730
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,963
Who's the rat that did it?

731
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,218
And why was it sent to Sungmoon Daily
out of all newspapers?

732
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,886
The content seems strange.

733
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,638
It didn't even say much.

734
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,848
That's right. There are no details.

735
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,851
It just talked about bribery.
The core information is missing.

736
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,688
But, don't you think it's strange

737
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,608
that it was sent to Sungmoon Daily
out of all the newspapers?

738
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:47,362
The person obviously knows the story
but doesn't want to reveal the details.

739
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,030
It could be someone

740
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,866
who wants turmoil
but wishes to protect the organization.

741
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,244
Who would...

742
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,871
It's possible the person didn't
reveal everything on purpose.

743
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,125
It could be a warning.

744
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,169
Or it could be for money too.

745
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,134
Are you still working on dumping
everything on Si-mok

746
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,593
and closing the case?

747
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,387
I apologize.

748
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,223
I even finished digging up
some intel on him, but Mr. Park's son

749
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,766
got involved all of a sudden.

750
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,892
Put it on hold.

751
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:22,147
If we say the culprit took
his own life now, people won't believe us.

752
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,860
But Si-mok is still suspicious of me.

753
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,030
It looks like you picked the one
you wanted to get rid of.

754
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,116
You shouldn't let resentment
hinder your work.

755
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,202
I must say, I can't stop thinking
that he outsmarts you.

756
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,830
Well, there's someone else
who's above you.

757
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,040
How dare she call me

758
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,251
and yell at me,
demanding that I should leave you alone?

759
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,795
I have no idea where she got
that temper from.

760
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,425
Don't ask her about it
or tell her that I told you.

761
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,928
I buttered up
the Public Prosecutor General for you

762
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,139
and made sure he couldn't
say anything to you,

763
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,349
so just go tell her all about it.

764
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,478
I sincerely appreciate it.

765
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,689
Let's please make sure
that this can pass quietly.

766
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,442
I'd love for us to be able
to enjoy some peaceful days.

767
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,194
I apologize again.

768
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,575
Sponsorship Scandal, Just Like
The Busan Prosecutor Sponsorship Case

769
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,704
Sponsorship within Prosecution,
Another Utter Embarrassment

770
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:31,591
Sponsorship Scandal, Just Like
The Busan Prosecutor Sponsorship Case

771
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,183
LIEUTENANT HAN

772
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,148
I'm surprised you had a moment to call me.

773
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,859
I thought everyone there would be
in deep trouble by now.

774
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,861
I know who the culprit is.

775
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,161
Who is it?

776
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,373
Who's the culprit?

777
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,460
"Tortoise, show me your head.

778
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,837
-Otherwise..."
-"I'll eat you up"?

779
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,589
What are you doing now?

780
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,217
The head has finally been revealed.

781
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,429
One bottle of soju
and a bowl of udon, please.

782
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,556
Get ramen.

783
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,141
Actually, I'll get ramen.

784
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,316
-We need water too.
-Sure.

785
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,490
Thank you.

786
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,619
Enjoy.

787
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,124
Even if we develop high blood pressure,

788
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,960
we should see the body
being revealed before we die.

789
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,106
The only head that came out today

790
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,984
was the informant.

791
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,238
The culprit must've been waiting
for this moment from the get-go.

792
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,199
He must've been furious because the fact
that Mr. Park was a financial sponsor

793
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,868
wasn't exposed right after his death.

794
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:26,247
Now, I can understand why he dealt
with Ga-young Kim like that.

795
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,790
Her cell phone too.

796
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,294
Think about it. He didn't even leave
a single strand of hair.

797
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,796
Dropping it there must not have been
a mistake.

798
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,882
If what Mr. Seo said is true...

799
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,759
He said it could be easily seen.

800
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,137
It was as if the culprit was telling us,
"This is where the abduction took place."

801
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,724
Here you go.

802
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,226
Thank you.

803
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,362
Do you know anyone at Sungmoon Daily?

804
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,114
I looked into it
but couldn't find anything.

805
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,909
I don't even think people there know
who the informant is.

806
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,161
I should go there tomorrow.

807
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,415
Right, tomorrow.
Kyung-wan will be released in the morning.

808
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:19,342
I haven't been able to tell Mr. Park's
mother about Kyung-wan's situation.

809
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,261
She'll see it in the news.

810
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,476
What?

811
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,442
By any chance,

812
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,196
did you tip them off?

813
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,491
I said the informant is the culprit.

814
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,035
If you are the informant,
you should tell me now.

815
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,206
I'm not.

816
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,792
Cheers.

817
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,798
By the way, what makes you think
that you can trust what I'm telling you?

818
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,175
Who says I do? I don't trust you.

819
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,603
You smiled.

820
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,189
You smiled just now. You did, right?

821
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,900
-Did I?
-Yes. You have a pretty smile.

822
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,318
Just a second.

823
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,199
-Hang on.
-Well...

824
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,201
Don't give me any gifts.

825
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,174
The more clues get revealed,

826
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:45,970
the more I think the culprit is someone
who suffered because of the sponsorship.

827
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,849
Whether it's toward the prosecution
or Moo-sung Park,

828
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,893
he's holding grudges.

829
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,125
JUNG-BON KIM

830
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,043
I'll get started.

831
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,256
You might be affected.

832
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,716
SOUTHERN SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

833
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,804
There he is.

834
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,695
-It's cold.
-I'm fine.

835
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:52,620
A civil righter submitted
an investigation request to prosecution,

836
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,789
claiming that police officers
harshly treated a suspect

837
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,124
during an interrogation, which has
aroused a huge controversy.

838
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:01,003
Yes, I'm at Yongsan Police Station now.

839
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:03,965
Mr. Park, who was arrested as a suspect
of a murder case,

840
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:07,760
is claiming that he was tortured
during his interrogation here.

841
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,180
I heard photos that prove his claim
have been disclosed as well.

842
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,139
That's right.

843
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:15,560
The photos disclosed
by civil righter Mr. Jung-bon Kim

844
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,396
clearly show traces
of the harsh treatments Mr. Park received

845
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,064
during his interrogation.

846
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:23,150
Mr. Park claimed that the police officers
assaulted him while coercing him

847
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,819
to admit the charges.

848
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,572
The information on the late Mr. Park
bribing prosecutors

849
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:30,700
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
was received less than a day ago.

850
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,619
And now, a suspicion that officers
at Yongsan Police Station coerced

851
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,788
Mr. Park's son to admit the allegations
on committing

852
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,874
parricide and attempted murder
has been raised.

853
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,626
Which prosecutors' office was
in charge of Mr. Park's case?

854
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,212
It was Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

855
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:51,888
Tell everyone who's fourth grade or higher
