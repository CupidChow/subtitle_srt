00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,212
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,882
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,602
Doggedly chasing after the truth

4
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,021
and marching towards what's right

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,733
is a never-ending process.

6
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,986
To stop, even for a moment, is to fail.

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,449
Marching towards change

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,285
is like having two needles as your feet

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,871
with an invisible thread
trailing after you,

10
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,915
never stopping for a breath
as you march on.

11
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,755
In the belief that a handful of hope

12
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,216
is better than immeasurable despair,

13
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,594
we move forward
with unwavering determination

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,471
once again.

15
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,315
EPISODE 1

16
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,174
MARCH, 2019

17
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,099
Mr. Jung, a man in his 40s
who abandoned his car

18
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,393
and fled a DUI checkpoint,
has been arrested.

19
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,229
Nambu Police stated
that his blood alcohol content

20
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,774
was approximately 0.187 percent,
which is enough to suspend his license

21
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,527
according to the Widmark formula

22
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,531
that calculates BAC based
on the amount of time elapsed.

23
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,617
Moving on to the next story.

24
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,911
The news that the Ministry of Justice
may shut down…

25
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,288
-Mr. Hwang, where are you?
-…all cryptocurrency service providers

26
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,917
has resulted in a sudden drop
in the value of all cryptocurrency.

27
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,711
Here are the weather updates
for each region.

28
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,964
Dense fog advisories have been extended.

29
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,300
Beaches will remain closed,

30
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,469
and the nine ferries
that connect Tongyeong

31
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,889
with its surrounding islands
have also been canceled.

32
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,601
Dense fog advisories will likely
continue overnight.

33
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,770
We advise all drivers to use fog lights

34
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,480
and drive slowly.

35
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,858
This information was brought to you
by the Vessel Traffic Service Center.

36
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,805
MR. LEE

37
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,476
-Hello?
-Mr. Hwang, where are you?

38
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,853
The branch chief is almost here.

39
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,522
The man of the hour can't be late.

40
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,900
Mr. Lee, send me the Marine Environment
Management Corporation's number.

41
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,193
The KOEM?

42
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,612
Yes, a part of the restriction line
is damaged.

43
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,906
-They should fix this.
-Where are you now?

44
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,950
Well, I'm…

45
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,785
TONGYEONG-SI YONGNAMHAEAN-RO

46
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,412
I'm on Yongnamhaean-ro.

47
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,371
Yongnam?

48
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,581
The whole thing's been damaged?

49
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,209
-Hello, sir.
-Oh, he's here.

50
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,211
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir.

51
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,838
-Hello, sir.
-You've got to hurry!

52
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,090
Do you still want the number for KOEM?

53
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,718
Don't worry about it.
I can't be there right away.

54
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,745
You have arrived at your destination.

55
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,122
Route guidance will now be terminated.

56
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,542
TONGYEONG TOURIST HOTEL

57
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,234
Aren't you going in?

58
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,237
Aren't you?

59
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,685
-What is it?
-Someone died.

60
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,897
My gosh. I heard it was someone young.

61
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,484
-Come on, let me take a peek.
-No, I can't let you.

62
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,487
-Oh, my goodness.
-It's insane.

63
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,823
-My goodness.
-What's going on?

64
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,908
-Isn't it over there?
-I think it's this way.

65
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,827
-No, it's over there.
-No, it's this way.

66
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,995
-A college student?
-It says, "Do not enter."

67
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,082
My goodness. Someone drowned.

68
00:06:56,165 --> 00:07:00,753
-Swimming in this weather?
-They weren't supposed to go in the water.

69
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,464
What were they thinking?

70
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,842
Go this way!

71
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,718
They've already been that way!

72
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,263
What the heck were they thinking?

73
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,307
The sign says not to enter
so why would they?

74
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,184
What a mess.

75
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,853
They say there's only one boat!

76
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,188
Why don't they ever listen?

77
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,316
It clearly says, "Do not enter."

78
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,414
I guess he was sober enough
to take off these expensive shoes.

79
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,958
These are expensive?

80
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,004
These are the limited-edition shoes
that your son asked you to buy him.

81
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,799
Goodness, look at this. He took them off
as if they're some precious treasure.

82
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,178
Will the owner be found alive

83
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,512
or dead?

84
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,641
Do these belong to your friends?

85
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,896
Does that mean

86
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,942
they left these here and went this way
towards the water…

87
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,277
POLICE

88
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,124
Over there!

89
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,028
911 RESCUE

90
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,503
This was our first trip
since starting college.

91
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,174
I was so drunk

92
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,760
I didn't even know
my friends had gone out.

93
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,377
We're at the ocean!

94
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,341
The ocean!

95
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,385
Here we come!

96
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,929
-Hey, wait.
-What? Why?

97
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,930
Oh, right.

98
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,439
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

99
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,276
We're at the ocean!

100
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,037
Hey, Seung-jun!

101
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,834
Seung-jun!

102
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,079
911 RESCUE

103
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,541
Goodness, they were only 20 years old.
I can't believe they died like this.

104
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,626
All they've done is study.

105
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,920
They were just spreading their wings.

106
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,090
Why do people always go into the water
when they're drunk?

107
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,301
Gosh, I feel so bad for their parents.

108
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,304
-Why did they go into the ocean?
-Oh, dear.

109
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,098
Mr. Hwang, where are you?

110
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,184
I told you, the branch chief is here.

111
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,895
Don't you know he's throwing
this going-away party for you?

112
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,230
He's saying you don't care
because you're leaving.

113
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,442
He's fuming mad that you're making
all these people wait!

114
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,945
Hello?

115
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,197
Mr. Hwang.

116
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,490
You're still there, right?

117
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,500
Car emissions
account for approximately 25 percent

118
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,586
of the fine dust generated in the country.

119
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,756
So when it comes to fine dust,
cars can be seen as the perpetrators,

120
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,634
and all citizens are the victims.

121
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,385
The double-shift vehicle system

122
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,347
mentioned earlier
has proven to be very effective.

123
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,141
The government is considering
implementing the system

124
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,143
but is hesitant at the moment.

125
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,230
Let's find out what their concerns are.
Kim Ju-na has the story.

DRAGONTIGER_973
#MARVEL FESTIVAL

127
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,567
-They went there to see this?
-People are still driving freely

128
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,278
even with the emergency fine dust
reduction measures put in place.

129
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,988
Everyone's having a blast.

130
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,367
Only government workers are expected
to follow the double-shift system.

131
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,744
Since this is used for freight…

132
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,456
Even civil servants are not abiding by it.

133
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,709
Public officials
who are not abiding by the new system

134
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,795
the government has implemented

135
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,630
should be reprimanded.

136
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,383
Some say we should implement
a total double-shift system

137
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,802
-that everyone must follow.
-What's this?

138
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,554
Are my fingers getting fat?

139
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,431
#TONGYEONG BEACH #FOG

140
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,267
-When the system was implemented...
-Tongyeong.

141
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,768
...for the 2002 FIFA World Cup,

142
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,105
the fine dust levels in the
metropolitan areas dropped by 21 percent.

143
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,191
And research shows that
the ultrafine dust levels in Beijing

144
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,319
also went down by 25 percent
four years ago.

145
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,947
-It's an urgent issue indeed.
-Where did it go?

146
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,742
Next up, a high-ranking officer
at the National Police Agency

147
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,871
has been accused of interfering in a case
the prosecution was investigating.

148
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,499
The prosecution plans to summon
the officer for interrogation soon.

149
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,043
-Kim Ho-geun has the story.
-Who could this be?

150
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,422
A high-ranking officer at the National
Police Agency has been accused of leaking

151
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,757
information about a case
the prosecution was investigating.

152
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,342
In June of 2018,

153
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,803
Mr. Kim, a high-ranking officer
at the National Police Agency,

154
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,681
was approached
by his high school friend, Mr. Park.

155
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,934
At the time, Mr. Park was being
investigated by the prosecution.

156
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,061
He contacted Mr. Kim,
the high-ranking officer,

157
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,522
to ask whether or not
he would be arrested.

158
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,067
Mr. Kim then gave him information
about an ongoing case,

159
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,445
-according to the prosecution.
-Who is this?

160
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,864
The identity of the man who fled
a DUI checkpoint last night

161
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,825
is a deputy chief prosecutor
at the High Prosecutors' Office.

162
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,329
The prosecution finds itself under fire
once again for moral laxity.

163
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,706
Internal Affairs at
the Prosecutors' Office

164
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,000
-has stated that disciplinary action...
-Hurry up!

165
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,170
...will be taken as soon as
the police complete their investigation.

166
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,631
-Jeez!
-Last night in Tongyeong,

167
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,550
all beaches were closed due to dense fog.

168
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,345
But two tourists under the influence
went into the ocean

169
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,263
and drowned.

170
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,808
Both deceased were university freshmen.

171
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,395
It's speculated they met their deaths
after entering a prohibited area

172
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,272
while heavily intoxicated.

173
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,735
However, some have pointed out that
the accident could have been prevented

174
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,529
had the area been properly
sectioned off in the first place.

175
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,532
The beach had already been known
as an accident-prone area,

176
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,409
and the restriction line
installed in the area

177
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,329
had been damaged two years ago
due to faulty installation.

Good morning.

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

-Okay.

#TONGYEONG BEACH #FOG

186
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,695
Last night in Tongyeong,

187
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,781
all beaches were closed due to dense fog.

188
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,451
But two tourists under the influence
went into the ocean

189
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
and drowned.

190
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,221
TONGYEONG DROWNING ACCIDENT

191
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,766
Hey, how could you not show up?

192
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,477
What about everyone who gathered
for your going-away party?

193
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,646
I know there was an accident,
but why would you go there?

194
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,981
Are you one of their dads?

195
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,569
How could you be so disrespectful
to not even show up to your own party?

196
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,614
Do you even care that people were waiting?

197
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,534
My goodness.

198
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,288
-What's going on? Is he getting an earful?
-Yes, obviously.

199
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,584
Mr. Hwang is so consistent.
Even on his last day.

200
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,713
You're here.

201
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,843
Mr. Hwang, your stuff is in here.
Don't forget to take it.

202
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,761
Thank you.

203
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,143
SENIOR INSPECTOR HAN YEO-JIN

204
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,397
-Yes?
-Hello.

205
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,149
Yes.

206
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,527
How about a hello?

207
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,612
Oh, right. Hello.

208
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,076
Yesterday, the beaches…

209
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,080
I went on KOEM's website
and saw that all the beaches were closed.

210
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,543
Was there an area that was partially open?
On the surrounding islands, perhaps?

211
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,460
Why do you ask?

212
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,046
What time
did the drowning incident take place?

213
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,549
They didn't give out any details
on the news.

214
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,135
They won't cover it in detail.
It was just an accident.

215
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,056
The estimated time of death
is between 7:00 and 8:30 p.m.

216
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,938
The shorelines were closed
all the way down to Hansando

217
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,940
starting at 5:40 p.m.

218
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,441
I see.

219
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,986
They were three students
on a trip from Seoul.

220
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,821
They've been friends since middle school.

221
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,657
One of them got a car from his parents
as a college acceptance gift.

222
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
TONGYEONG-SI NAMHAEAN-DAERO

223
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,703
So they decided to take
an impromptu road trip.

224
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,413
Turn right.

225
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,873
-They're brave.
-Let's cut in.

226
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,792
They must've been rookie drivers.
But they drove that far?

227
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,628
-To the left. No, right.
-They must've wanted to go somewhere.

228
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,173
-He survived because of that.
-Crap. Wait.

229
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,382
Pardon me?

230
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,135
-Only the driver survived.
-Now. Cut in.

231
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,762
-Go for it.
-He must've been so nervous while driving.

232
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,472
He drank a couple of glasses

233
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,184
-and passed out right away.
-You're a good driver.

234
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,394
-He didn't know they were out.
-Shouldn't we thank him?

235
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,898
He must have been alone when he woke up.

236
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,568
He tried calling them and waited
for a while, but they didn't come back.

237
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:58,238
So he also stepped out,
and that's when he found…

238
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,740
What did he find?

239
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,580
Seung-jun! Won-il!

240
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,587
Seung-jun! Won-il!

241
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,756
Oh, boy.

242
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,510
How come you're not asking
why I'm asking you all these questions?

243
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,931
Right, why are you asking
all these questions?

244
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,937
What if the restriction line
was set up properly

245
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,439
and wasn't removed by those kids
who drowned?

246
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,652
I saw a photo taken around that time
on the beach.

247
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,280
I saw the photo on an account I follow,

248
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,034
and I think it was posted
just after 8:00 p.m.

249
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,162
Although I don't know
what time it was actually taken.

250
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,083
Look at them trying to lock the barn
after the horse has bolted.

251
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,753
Look how flimsy it is.
No wonder it was swept away.

252
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,256
They do this maybe once a year.

253
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,132
They haven't got the funds to fix that.

254
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,887
Was there a sign with a red text
hanging from an orange rope?

255
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,227
All shorelines in the area were closed.

256
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:16,149
How did that couple I follow
find a beach that wasn't closed off?

257
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,735
And why delete the photos?

258
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,321
What they choose to leave up
is up to them,

259
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,366
but why delete three photos at once
an hour after posting them?

260
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,078
But it's possible
that the two students who drowned

261
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,831
entered the beach after cutting the line
like the police said.

262
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,208
I heard that even when they were drinking
at the guesthouse,

263
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,794
those two kept saying they had
to see the ocean no matter what

264
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,046
because they drove all the way there.

265
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,299
Right, maybe.

266
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,342
Being young,

267
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,178
they could've thought,
"This restriction line can't stop us."

268
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,222
But if that's the case,

269
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,850
would they have jumped over the line

270
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,685
or cut the line?

271
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,524
Even if the couple in the photo
had to cut the line for some reason,

272
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,986
the question is whether
the two students went into the water first

273
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,739
or if the couple cut the line
before that happened.

274
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,576
All right, I'll look into it.

275
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,618
Okay.

276
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,538
-Wait, Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

277
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,374
Is this your case? Are you taking this on?

278
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,960
No. I'll be transferring soon,
so I'm not taking on any new cases.

279
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:21,131
And drowning incidents associated
with alcohol use happen every year here.

280
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,176
So even if we receive the police report,
it'll be processed quickly.

281
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,846
But you know so much already.

282
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,598
Is it because it's a small town?

283
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,893
Yes, I guess so.

284
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,271
All right, then. Take it easy.

285
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,065
Bye.

286
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,905
-You know…
-Mr. Hwang.

287
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,449
The branch chief wants
to have lunch with all of us

288
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,203
to make up for your going-away party
being canceled yesterday.

289
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,042
It looks like he really doesn't want
to let you go.

290
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,210
Right?

291
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,342
When will they reopen access
to the shorelines?

292
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,928
They said the restrictions
will be lifted at noon,

293
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,262
so it will be very soon.

294
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,224
-I'll be back before lunch.
-Mr. Hwang.

295
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,768
Mr. Hwang.

296
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,617
Last night in Tongyeong…

297
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,961
I sell retro figures.

298
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,712
Let me know if you're interested.

299
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,632
READ

300
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,307
TYPING

301
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,767
Model name and photos, please.

302
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,024
I'm at work now. I'll take pictures
when I get home and send them to you.

303
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,779
READ

304
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,868
What's he doing?

305
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,996
Come on.

306
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,589
Detective Jang!

307
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:29,092
What? What now? Why are you
acting all excited to talk to me?

308
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,803
Don't you have important tasks to do
since you're promoted?

309
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,936
That's going to take some time.

310
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,521
Even if you put in the request,

311
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,524
it takes a while until they give you
information on the account holder.

312
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,736
Even if I contact their HQ directly?

313
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,571
What's the handle?

314
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,031
Yes.

315
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,538
My goodness.

316
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,790
Jeez, are you still into stuff like this?

317
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,043
"My goodness."

318
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,217
This is…

319
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,595
This looks like an expensive gym.

320
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,555
The photo on the third row.

321
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,848
You're right.

322
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,481
Doesn't it look like a fitness center
at a hotel?

323
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,149
-Jeez! You scared me.
-What is it?

324
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,777
You startled me.
Put that ugly face away, will you?

325
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,987
-What are you doing?
-Chief!

326
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,114
-Is that Han Yeo-jin?
-Yes.

327
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,075
What are you guys doing?

328
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,953
Oh, right. What's this about?

329
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,204
What are we looking for?

330
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,249
Oh, boy. Dear me.

331
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,505
Captain, the two boys
who drowned in Tongyeong…

332
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,840
She's saying it might not
have been an accident.

333
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,883
What?

334
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,826
This guy has a girlfriend.

335
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,619
Have you been stalking him?

336
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,580
You know who his girlfriend is?

337
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,332
You do when you're a longtime follower.

338
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,336
Yes. It's "myk8576"
in the comment section.

339
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,754
That's his girlfriend.

340
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,675
NO MAKEUP AND PUFFY FACE
BECAUSE WE DROVE ALL NIGHT

341
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,093
They're back already?

342
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,470
And they drove all night.

343
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,891
Seeing how this car appears
in multiple photos,

344
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,144
it must be his.

345
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,438
Looks like an import.

346
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,899
Seven.

347
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,984
FITNESS CENTER,
MYK8576, 7

348
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,112
This number here.
Do you think it's three or eight?

349
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,407
Three?

350
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,661
Hey, it looks like this woman
lives in Cheongdam-dong.

351
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,623
She wrote that this cafe
is near her place, so I looked it up,

352
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,832
and it's in Cheongdam-dong.

353
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,418
Then chances are
she probably doesn't live there.

354
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,961
What are you talking about?

355
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,840
Look over here.
She says it's right outside her place.

356
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,636
People who don't live in Gangnam
go there and act like they do.

357
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,804
All that matters is that they look rich.

358
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,140
This fitness center
is at the Winters Hotel.

359
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,642
The Winters Hotel?

360
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,479
The place where the membership
costs over 100 million won?

361
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,272
There it is.

362
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,441
Zero, four.

363
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,693
A member of the fitness center
at Winters Hotel.

364
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,279
The last four digits
on his license plate are "0437."

365
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,873
Even if the couple in the photo

366
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,417
had to cut the line for some reason,

367
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,295
the question is whether
the two students went into the water first

368
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,256
or if the couple cut the line
before that happened.

369
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,774
I know you keep the license plate
numbers of members on file.

370
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,402
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Can you please cooperate?

371
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,612
Let's help each other out, okay?

372
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,573
We can't disclose any information
about our members.

373
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,492
-Let me just take a quick look.
-Hold on.

374
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,743
I'll be quick. Wait.

375
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,287
-I just need to check the plate number.
-Hold on, sir.

376
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,582
-Are you here to visit our fitness club?
-Hello.

377
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,961
I'm from the police HQ's
Special Investigation Bureau.

378
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,591
I guess you're not willing to cooperate.

379
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,927
Would you prefer a full search, then?

380
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,930
We need to bring a search warrant to
access the members directory, right?

381
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,557
-Well--
-Hold on.

382
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,392
Don't tell me…

383
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,602
I can't believe this.

384
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,273
Is HQ also keeping an eye on this case?

385
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,109
Gosh, the Special Investigation Bureau?
Then we're out.

386
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,238
-This could've turned into a headache.
-"Special Investigation Bureau"?

387
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,698
We understand the hotel's position.

388
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,908
We'll go through
the proper channels, then.

389
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,410
Wait.

390
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,829
You can let your members know
that their personal information

391
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,999
will only be used
in this specific investigation.

392
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,419
Just a moment, please.

393
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,504
Please give me a moment.

394
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,604
It's great to work for HQ, isn't it?

395
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,689
I should have transferred there too.

396
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,774
Cut it out.

397
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
Gosh, that hurt.

398
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,603
Don't touch that!

399
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,188
My goodness.

400
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,160
TONGYEONG MARINE MANAGEMENT

401
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,663
What's he doing?

402
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,337
What do you think you're doing?

403
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,923
Didn't I tell you not to touch anything?

404
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,092
Leave that alone!

405
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,595
Don't touch that!

406
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,398
What? What is it?

407
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,861
What…

408
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,032
Could I borrow a light?

409
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:22,982
Mr. Lee.

410
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,944
Can you check which office is in charge
of the drowning case?

411
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,599
When do you think he'll be back?

412
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,226
I'm not sure.

413
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,609
You've been at that office
for a while now.

414
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,447
Well, they could suddenly tell me

415
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,992
to pack my stuff and go back
all of a sudden.

416
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,869
I was just dispatched there, so…

417
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,998
Standing here with you like this

418
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,416
reminds me of the old days.

419
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,921
Right. Time really flies.

420
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,633
-Time flies
-Time flies

421
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,179
Time flies by so fast

422
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,145
So, when do you think
you'll get to pack your stuff?

423
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:50,319
Well, they always say, "Any time now."

424
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,780
But we've been at it for two years now.

425
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,242
The team was made to reform
investigative procedures.

426
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,954
That's what they're paying me for, right?
All I want is to do my job.

427
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,039
You've done your part.

428
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,291
Your team came up with so many
reform proposals.

429
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,752
What's the use, though?

430
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,504
They won't talk to us.
The prosecution just ignores us.

431
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,675
Just make it so that the police
have the sole investigative authority.

432
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,887
Even if you wrack your brains
and fight with the prosecution,

433
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,222
the National Assembly
could just reject it.

434
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,267
-Is it the Captain?
-Yes.

435
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,518
Is he asking for you?

436
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,730
He's always asking for me,
yelling, "Jang Geon!"

437
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,567
Can we even prove it was him?

438
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,653
Even if he
got rid of the restriction line,

439
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,781
it could have nothing to do
with those deaths.

440
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,908
He'll just be charged
with destroying public property.

441
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,910
I'm sure he'll know what he did wrong.

442
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,580
That could be all he did,
but he might see us and think,

443
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,249
"They're finally here to arrest me."

444
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,585
Even if he deleted the photos,

445
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,129
he should still have those photos
on his phone.

446
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,717
-Sorry for bothering you when you're busy.
-No, it's fine.

447
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,010
Hang on.

448
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,347
Hello?

449
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,724
Chief Choi?

450
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,351
Okay, I'll be there.

451
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,229
He'll probably be back in the evening.

452
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,272
No, it's fine. Don't worry about this.

453
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,651
You always say that
after getting me involved.

454
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,735
Jeez.

455
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,559
What a lousy driver. My gosh.

456
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,270
Wait!

457
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,899
Hello. Are you Lee Yong-ho?

458
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,569
-Who are you?
-I'm with the Yongsan Police.

459
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,487
What?

460
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,790
You were in Tongyeong last night, right?

461
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,257
What's this about? Is there a problem?

462
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,343
Why are you asking if there's a problem?

463
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,560
Why did you go to Tongyeong?

464
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,731
-I was on a trip.
-Why would you go so far for a day trip?

465
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,024
You drove all night.

466
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,109
What are you playing at?

467
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,695
You ran a background check on me?

468
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,656
It's nothing fancy like that.

469
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,873
They were pretty good photos.

470
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,209
I especially liked

471
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,628
the photo with all the fog.

472
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,425
Damn it…

473
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,261
-Why did you pull it out?
-I didn't pull it out!

474
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,519
I'm from the Violent Crimes Unit
at Yongsan Police Station.

475
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,689
We have a few questions regarding
the drowning in Tongyeong.

476
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,192
-Please come with me to the station.
-Why would I?

477
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,571
If you refuse, I'm going to have to
arrest you and request a warrant later

478
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,574
since you've attempted
to destroy evidence.

479
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,912
If you go voluntarily, you can't be kept
in the station longer than six hours,

480
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,914
and you are free to return home
whenever you want.

481
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,000
You can either be arrested
or come with us voluntarily.

482
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,419
Which would you prefer?

483
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,302
Detective Jang took him,
so contact him about it.

484
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,263
I have to go. I'll talk to you later!

485
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,066
You entered a beach
that was off-limits, right?

486
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:57,984
No, I didn't.

487
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,236
You took photos there.

488
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,406
The water was off-limits, not the beach.

489
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,325
You knew that two people
drowned there, right?

490
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,618
No.

491
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,331
-The car with the plate 0437. It's yours?
-Yes.

492
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,460
How much did you edit those photos?
You look completely different.

493
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,421
People don't do that these days.

494
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,672
They just use camera apps.

495
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,008
I guess he used about 100 apps.

496
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,636
What?

497
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,391
All right. You cut the restriction line,
didn't you?

498
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,853
Did it never occur to you
that other people could get hurt?

499
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,858
I didn't cut it. It was already cut
when we got there.

500
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,610
I guess someone else cut it.

501
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,957
So you burned the rope with your lighter.

502
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,857
Hey, Dad. It's me.

503
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,277
I need a lawyer.

504
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,408
These are the articles on the main page
today regarding the police--

505
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,538
I'm sorry.

506
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,376
I'm sorry I'm late.

507
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,926
Do tell me how important and how urgent
whatever you've been doing was.

508
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,181
I'm sorry. It was work
for the Violent Crimes Unit.

509
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,184
Should I send you back?

510
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,602
No, Chief.

511
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,729
You must miss the old days.

512
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,023
No. I'm sorry, Chief.

513
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,987
There were three articles
shown on the main page today

514
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,532
regarding the police.

515
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,950
The first article was

516
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,828
"Police Indecisive About Disclosing
Personal Information of Felons."

517
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,413
"People are starting to question

518
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,124
the criteria for
personal information disclosure.

519
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:23,462
It's been decided to base the criteria on
the assailant's situation, not the case.

520
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,881
And people are asking
who the decision has been made for."

521
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,222
"Gangnam Police Station
Colluded with Illegal Brothels,

522
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,391
Only 11 Cases of Discipline."
This was uploaded an hour later.

523
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,101
And the last one…

524
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,479
"Officer in Charge of Long-term
Missing Cases...

525
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,982
Is Professionalism Missing As Well?"

526
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,235
There have been a lot of articles
criticizing the police

527
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,530
ever since we started fighting over
investigative rights with the prosecution.

528
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,492
And there are specific details that only
the prosecution would know about.

529
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,079
The one about the missing cases
is almost a special report. Those jerks…

530
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,708
So what about the prosecution?

531
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,085
A prosecutor got into a fight
at a karaoke bar yesterday

532
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,504
when he entered the wrong room
because he was intoxicated.

533
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,131
And this one is from two years ago,

534
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,301
but one prosecutor who was investigating
a land development case in Daegu

535
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,927
bought land under a relative's name,

536
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,556
and the land price jumped over tenfold
following redevelopment.

537
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,016
How severe was the fight?

538
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,518
They threw a few punches
and they went to the station,

539
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,978
but the prosecutor was let go.

540
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,776
Dig into the prosecutor in Daegu
who bought land

541
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,236
and give me a detailed report.

542
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,031
And make it seem like the article
was copied

543
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,241
from a regional newspaper in Daegu.

544
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,577
And boost the ratings and views
once it's published,

545
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,953
and get it on the main page.

546
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,873
And talk to the reporter who wrote
the report on the missing cases.

547
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,918
Find out who and what made this reporter
write this article

548
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,337
after keeping quiet all this time.

549
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,881
And tell this person we have
a lot of scoops to offer too.

550
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,425
Ask him if he wants dirt
on the prosecution as well,

551
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,135
or if he's going to keep taking sides.

552
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,887
-Get an answer from him.
-Okay.

553
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,973
And Sungmoon Daily is releasing
a series of special reports.

554
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,768
The first report doesn't have much
to do with us.

555
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,354
It says that chairwoman Lee Yeon-jae
of Hanjo

556
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,398
couldn't have known
what her late husband was up to.

557
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,443
And that she used him to get rid
of her father and half-brother

558
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,986
to run the company for herself.

559
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,530
That's it for the first one.

560
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,907
But there will be a second article.

561
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,824
What did they say?

562
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,411
"What Hwang Si-mok,
the prosecutor in charge of the case,

563
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,872
said about the late
Prosecutor Lee Chang-jun on TV

564
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,500
was just an act to protect
the image of his colleague,

565
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,377
and it's because a deal was made

566
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,046
before Prosecutor Lee Chang-jun's death."

567
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,549
This is what they'll publish
for their second article.

568
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,300
Change it to "glorified death."

569
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,846
"He was cornered so he decided
to end his own life,

570
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,974
asking Prosecutor Hwang
to protect his wife

571
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,851
and make him seem like a hero in return.

572
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,604
So Prosecutor Hwang received info on Hanjo

573
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:50,109
and turned a murderer
into a patriotic hero."

574
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,528
You heard that, right?
We have nothing to lose.

575
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,613
But it's not the truth, Chief.

576
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,826
That's for the concerned parties to
care about. We can just enjoy the results.

577
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,369
I'm one of the concerned parties.

578
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,079
That's why I gave this job to you.

579
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,956
Don't get your emotions involved.

580
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,585
Have all the articles about
the prosecution we had published

581
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,544
been lies?

582
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,672
Did we ever falsely accuse them
of driving under the influence?

583
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,717
That article might seem like
a good idea now, but it's still fake.

584
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,930
Then which article did you like, Ms. Han?

585
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,185
A police officer quickly brought a child
who injured his eye to the hospital.

586
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,022
The officer was quick
even when there was a traffic jam,

587
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,523
so the kid didn't lose his sight.

588
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,027
The story's nice, but it lacks impact.

589
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,322
And yesterday, an officer in Ulsan

590
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,324
found a mother's lost son after 14 years.

591
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,743
Wouldn't articles like that
be the best way to deal

592
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,203
with the article
about long-term missing cases?

593
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,081
It's better than fighting back
by criticizing the prosecution.

594
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,709
Do you have the right to decide that?

595
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,628
I'm sorry.

596
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,716
I'll be working
at the Intelligence Bureau for a while.

597
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,635
-Take care of things here.
-Yes, Chief.

598
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,855
I'll be careful not to be late again.

599
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,774
All right.

600
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,997
What?

601
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,792
You let him go already?

602
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,005
Who's the lawyer?

603
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,925
His name was Oh… What was it?

604
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:38,842
Hang on.

605
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,600
It's Oh Ju-seon.
He was a presiding judge until recently.

606
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,645
It's all over now.

607
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,065
Even violent crime cases end quickly
if there's a senior involved.

608
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:56,443
But now a former judge is involved
for someone who just cut a rope.

609
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,823
Tell Songpa Station to look into it, then.
He doesn't even live in our district.

610
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,327
Oh, right. I sent the photos to Tongyeong.
The ones taken at the beach.

611
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,330
I put in so much work
just to get those photos.

612
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,178
-What happened to them?
-I heard it was two boys.

613
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,613
Mr. Hwang.

614
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,215
Ms. Choi.

615
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,679
Office 303 is in charge of this case,
but I think they should look into this.

616
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,097
Can you deliver this to them?

617
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,015
All right.

618
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,144
They should check
whether the victims smoke,

619
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,106
and if not, whether they had a lighter
or something to burn the rope with.

620
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,860
And whether the couple in these photos
booked a room here,

621
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,112
and how many days
they were planning to stay.

622
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,740
Also whether they canceled and left
after the incident,

623
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,075
or if they were just booked for one night.

624
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,161
-Okay.
-Everyone involved lives in Seoul,

625
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,788
so the case will be sent to Seoul.

626
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,748
And they won't know much about Tongyeong,

627
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,292
so tell them the report needs to be
very detailed.

628
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,129
And the man in the photo
said he doesn't remember much

629
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,881
since he was drunk that day,

630
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,509
so tell them to add drinking and driving
to his charges.

631
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,094
-Since he drove back to Seoul that night.
-All right.

632
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,848
Yongsan Station will find out
the exact time

633
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,518
the photo was taken
without the restriction line.

634
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,729
So tell them to compare that with
the estimated time of death.

635
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,105
Yongsan Police Station?

636
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,192
Yes, they started investigating the case,

637
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,362
but it'll be sent to Songpa Station
since the suspect lives there.

638
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:07,199
And Mr. Lee, please talk to Office 303
and get a copy of the files.

639
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,077
And please keep me updated on the case
after I leave.

640
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,246
Okay. I'll send it to your office
in Wonju.

641
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,666
Should I tell them to keep
the motive blank for now?

642
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,376
You don't know yet, right?

643
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,548
He said he was trying

644
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,133
to get a great photo.

645
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,428
Unbelievable.

646
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,974
Have you lost your mind?
How could you give them those photos?

647
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,352
Hey. The police already saw them
and even knew how many I uploaded.

648
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,396
I would have looked
suspicious if I refused.

649
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,815
And we didn't do anything wrong.

650
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,692
You weren't the only one in the photos.

651
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,986
I was in them too.
You should have edited me out.

652
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,281
And how would I do that?

653
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,449
You were the one who said
the restriction line ruined the photo.

654
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,828
Are you crazy? You're the one who
got rid of it. Don't take it out on me.

655
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,415
Wait. That's not the problem right now.

656
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,417
You shouldn't hide anything from me.

657
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,545
Did you see those students at the beach?

658
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,173
No. There was nobody there, right?

659
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,758
Who knows?

660
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,387
Even if there was someone,
we couldn't see because of the fog.

661
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,515
You know one of the students
is alive, right?

662
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,310
If he tells the police
that he saw you there,

663
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,979
and that he saw you get rid
of the restriction line,

664
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,731
things will get pretty complicated.

665
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,358
It's completely different from
taking photos

666
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,652
after someone has already
got rid of the line.

667
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,238
Damn it.

668
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,741
-Do you think he saw us?
-Jeez…

669
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,993
You should find him and reach a settlement

670
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,953
before the police start asking questions.

671
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,331
But would he agree?

672
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,124
Two of his friends died.

673
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:43,045
Even parents whose children were in
traffic accidents agree to settlements.

674
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,504
What are lawyers for?

675
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,175
Right. I don't see why he wouldn't.

676
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,555
Wow. Did you hear what he just said?

677
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,809
You said you were totally drunk.

678
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,146
Do you think they'd have stayed out
if they saw the sign?

679
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,440
Stop acting like you're the victim.

680
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,108
You're not the only one in shock.

681
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,278
Strictly speaking, I'm the victim here!

682
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,947
Can you lower your voice?

683
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,410
If you hadn't gotten drunk
and drowned in there,

684
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,579
I would've never had to go
to a police station.

685
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,997
Do you think you're innocent?

686
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,084
You could've stayed awake
and protected your friends.

687
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,378
If you had stopped them,
they wouldn't have died.

688
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,631
If you saw them, you could've stopped them
from going in.

689
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,801
Is this jerk trying to blame us--

690
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,927
Wait.

691
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:37,391
Then that means you didn't see
these two yesterday, right?

692
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,643
You said that because you didn't see them.

693
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,563
You stayed in your room
for quite a long time, didn't you?

694
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,608
If I had seen these guys,

695
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,318
they would've seen me too.

696
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,405
Then you should just ask them.
Why are you asking me?

697
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,074
Who are you calling "these guys"?
You're so rude!

698
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,617
Lower your voice.

699
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,203
Let me do the talking.

700
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,250
Mr. Kim Hu-jeong.

701
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:08,046
Let me give you some sincere advice,
not as a lawyer, but as your elder.

702
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,382
If the police investigate further,

703
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,509
you could get charged
for aiding and abetting.

704
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,678
-Me?
-Didn't you see the online comments?

705
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,888
People are pointing fingers at you

706
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,599
and saying that you should have
kept your friends in line.

707
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,482
You didn't see these two people

708
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,861
in Tongyeong, right?

709
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,036
Can you answer with a yes or a no?

710
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:44,958
I didn't see them.

711
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,182
Jeez.

712
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,107
I didn't even have to show him this.

713
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,234
It's his loss.

714
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,862
He'd better not go back on his word later.

715
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:17,908
Shall we go home now?

716
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,876
If I had met them when I was a judge…
My goodness.

717
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,757
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

718
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,056
DIRECTOR SHIN JAE-YONG

719
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,766
Come in.

720
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,686
Did you ask for me, sir?

721
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,066
The prosecution…

722
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,902
wants to summon
the Intelligence Bureau Director.

723
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,240
It's obvious what they're after,

724
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,952
but since word got out that
the Director of the Intelligence Bureau

725
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,080
leaked confidential information
related to an ongoing investigation,

726
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,958
we can't keep playing tug-of-war.

727
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,961
Can the Criminal Investigation Bureau

728
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,797
take our Director?

729
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:19,177
What do you mean?
Are you asking me to arrest your Director?

730
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,179
You can say
the Criminal Investigation Bureau

731
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,973
found something else on the Director.

732
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,017
So the police are conducting
an internal investigation on him.

733
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,566
He's already in deep enough trouble,
but you want to add another charge on him?

734
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,777
You can say that you were mistaken,
and he turned out to be clean.

735
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,529
We should stop the prosecution first

736
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,865
and plan our next move
while we still have him.

737
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,079
But would they let us?

738
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,290
Whatever the crime is,

739
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,001
they're doing this to retain
their investigative authority.

740
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,795
About that…

741
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,923
Let me ask you one more favor.

742
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,592
What is it?

743
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,513
Can you talk to the Commissioner General?

744
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,391
The police and the prosecution,

745
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,144
we should meet in-person to settle
the issue of investigative rights.

746
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,938
The Commissioner General can ask
the Minister of Justice himself--

747
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:12,981
No.

748
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:17,319
The police and the prosecution are
the subjects of reform, not proponents.

749
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,946
We are the ones that actively participate
in the reform.

750
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,575
The prosecution is attacking us,
saying we're too incompetent and corrupt

751
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,828
to monopolize investigative authority.

752
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,622
If we don't resolve this issue now,

753
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,376
the prosecution will go after
the Commissioner General as well.

754
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,176
Even if they do meet, do you think
they'll come to an agreement?

755
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,385
And if they don't?

756
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,308
I'll make sure it happens.
I'll come up with the proposals.

757
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,645
Please.

758
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,698
My goodness.

759
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,393
-Yes, Mr. Lee.
-Mr. Hwang.

760
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,645
You're leaving next week, right?

761
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,398
I wanted to ask if I can
help you with anything.

762
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,275
-No, it's fine.
-Okay.

763
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,652
I feel like I first met you
only a few days ago,

764
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,780
but it's been two years already.
Time really flies.

765
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,657
-Right.
-But Mr. Hwang,

766
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,368
about that drowning case…

767
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,661
It's been closed already.

768
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,415
-Already?
-Yes. Non-prosecution.

769
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,377
Didn't you say it was sent
to Seoul yesterday?

770
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,923
Yes. It does feel like they closed
the case really quickly.

771
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:20,317
TONGYEONG PROSECUTORS' BRANCH OFFICE

00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,003
NON-PROSECUTION DISPOSITION

CLEARED OF SUSPICION

779
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,117
Not guilty."

782
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,799
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
KANG WON-CHUL

783
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,299
The case was closed only a few days
after a lawyer who used to be a judge

784
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,592
took the case.

785
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,969
This is the reality of the prosecution's
service to this country.

786
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,221
She's putting on an act.

787
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,138
Nice to meet you.

788
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,891
I'm Seo Dong-jae from
Uijeongbu District Prosecutors' Office.

789
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:43,061
Mr. Hwang, it looks like
you should kill some time.

790
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,521
So I'm staying in Tongyeong?

791
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,606
Hello, sir. I'm Hwang Si-mok.

792
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,775
A Police-Prosecution Council
will be formed soon.

793
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,694
I guess Hwang Si-mok works
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office now.

794
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:55,698
Why did they have to cover up
a common death from an illness?

795
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,535
If you want Si-mok and me
to work on this together…

796
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,578
What kind of work
were you thinking of giving him?

797
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,163
We need someone

798
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,208
who will protect our rights at all costs.

799
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,460
Are you joining
the Police-Prosecution Council?
