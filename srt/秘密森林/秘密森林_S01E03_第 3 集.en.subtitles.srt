1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,261
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,265
I'll follow your path, sir.

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,267
Please lead the way.

5
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,394
Then what?

6
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,148
Please guide me.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,279
Don't you know that you should be
thankful if you don't get demoted?

8
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,784
You got my back.
Why should I even be worried?

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,411
Si-mok.

10
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,872
Since when were you this shy?

11
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,458
You want the internal investigation itself
to be canceled.

12
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,170
You're asking me to ignore seniority
and promote a mere prosecutor.

13
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,798
Why are you beating around the bush?
Put it simply.

14
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,716
Once the internal investigation begins,

15
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,677
I'll need to find a way to survive
as well.

16
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,638
This is me putting it simply.

17
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,098
If you stab me,

18
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,518
you'll get covered in the blood too.

19
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,102
You've already been through it.

20
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,772
You've seen what happens
to whistleblowers.

21
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,275
Whether it's whistleblowing
or the internal investigation,

22
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,986
I'll be pushed out of the case.

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,573
Until the killer is caught,

24
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,119
I will not become an outsider.

25
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,125
You started it.

26
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,293
It should be your job to get it canceled.

27
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,589
I'll give you the support you need.

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,512
What are you waiting for?

29
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,849
Go figure out a way to survive.

30
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,912
Why are you being like this now?
Why would Dad die?

31
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,788
I'll be there shortly, okay?

32
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,051
Excuse me. Could I get another glass?

33
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,682
MAPO POLICE STATION

34
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,629
Why did you do that to me?

35
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,551
The Moo-sung Park case.

36
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,428
Why did you let me handle it?

37
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,974
Did Mr. Lee ask you to do it?

38
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,685
Did he make you show me the footage

39
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,645
since he'd put all the blame on me anyway?

40
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,067
I thought you'd be different.

41
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,779
Did you offer to get rid of the one
who bothers him,

42
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,115
and did he praise you for it?

43
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,327
Shall I tell you the truth?

44
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,541
You'd be transferred to outside
the city after your probation anyway.

45
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,711
Do you actually think he'd be
bothered by a mere trainee?

46
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,923
It sounds like you're
seriously paranoid and delusional.

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,635
Are you saying my speculation
is unreasonable?

48
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,555
Are you trying to say
I brought this upon myself?

49
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,434
You're thinking he used me
to trap you, right?

50
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,144
You're wrong.

51
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,479
Then was it your mistake?

52
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,107
You never make mistakes.

53
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,778
I still haven't fully grasped the case.

54
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,539
My dad...

55
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,210
He still hasn't gotten over the shock
from that time.

56
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,422
He didn't step out of his room
for three years.

57
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,923
He didn't let anyone in either.

58
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,053
I went into his room
for the very first time

59
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,763
when I passed the bar exam.

60
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,226
That's why

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,522
I couldn't tell him I'd be
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

62
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,901
To him,
Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office is...

63
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,529
Chang-jun Lee will be all he can think of.

64
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,532
Just hearing that name is enough

65
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,451
to make his blood boil.

66
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,290
Now, he must know
where his daughter works.

67
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,923
My friends envied me
for being a minister's daughter,

68
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,343
but I couldn't even ask my mom
for bus fare.

69
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,677
Mr. Hwang.

70
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,388
I can't be kicked out like this.

71
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,516
Not because I think it's extremely unfair.

72
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,769
I have to support my family.

73
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,397
So?

74
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,483
What more do you want from me?

75
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,819
What more?

76
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,738
When have I ever asked you for help?

77
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,782
Never mind.

78
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,539
The killer must be caught
for me to get out of this.

79
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,093
I wish it was a perfect crime.

80
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,178
Why did he have to kill the dog?

81
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,371
You started it.

82
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,499
It should be your job to get it canceled.

83
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,923
I wish it was a perfect crime.

84
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,345
Even with this, that wouldn't have been
captured if the angle was a bit off.

85
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,893
Someone else must have left
the bloodstain there.

86
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,437
The culprit is someone else.

87
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,483
Why would someone do such a thing?

88
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,494
Wait. The director is here, right?

89
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,828
-Yes, he's inside.
-Great.

90
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,092
We'll begin the rehearsal now.

91
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,594
All right. Let's bring him on stage.

92
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,970
Please come on out.

93
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,931
THE HUAM-DONG CASE,
Q&A WITH A PROSECUTOR

94
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,480
The audience will applaud
for a few seconds first.

95
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,525
You can have a seat over there
after introducing yourself.

96
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,738
THE HUAM-DONG CASE,
Q&A WITH A PROSECUTOR

97
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,873
If you don't wear any makeup,
your skin will look too shiny on camera.

98
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,166
I see.

99
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,296
When I start talking about the case,

100
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,174
a video clip that shows
a summary of the case will play.

101
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,927
We'll watch the clip together.
Then I'll ask you this question,

102
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,887
and you can start talking.

103
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,846
Okay.

104
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,516
Mr. Jin-seob Kang,
who was wrongfully convicted,

105
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,268
pleaded his innocence like this in prison.

106
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,354
"I was turned into a murderer.

107
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,898
I shouted to the point
that my throat bled,

108
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,484
but no one even listened to me."

109
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,404
Mr. Si-mok Hwang.

110
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,532
Are you the prosecutor
who refused to listen

111
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,786
to the late Mr. Kang's claim of innocence
as stated in his letter of appeal?

112
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,288
Yes, it was me.

113
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,125
I'm the prosecutor he was
referring to in his letter of appeal.

114
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,136
We were under the impression
that it was someone else.

115
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,431
A colleague of mine
presented the case in the trial.

116
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,808
Just a second, please.
Does this happen commonly?

117
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,228
Can a different prosecutor
handle the case at a trial?

118
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,439
-Cut.
-Oftentimes, it's one prosecutor.

119
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,358
But in some cases, another prosecutor
is brought on for trials to ensure

120
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,361
-that the investigation isn't affected.
-Camera 11, cut.

121
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,614
The prosecutor
who investigated the case...

122
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,284
In other words, the one who investigated
and arrested Mr. Kang, was me.

123
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,455
His letter of appeal was targeted at me,
not the prosecutor who handled the trial.

124
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,375
Mr. Hwang, you volunteered
to be interviewed.

125
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,586
-That's correct.
-Thanks to you,

126
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,920
our team has been running around

127
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,756
since early morning
to make this interview happen.

128
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,343
For you as well as for your family,

129
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,720
this must not have been an easy decision.

130
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,349
Why did you volunteer to be interviewed?
To let everyone know that you're the one

131
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,601
to whom he was referring
in his letter of appeal?

132
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:48,731
I don't think that's the essence
of this case.

133
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,733
-Why do you say that?
-What do you think

134
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,277
investigation authorities are
responsible for in murder cases?

135
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,904
Catching the killers.

136
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,781
-The real culprits.
-Right.

137
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,491
-That's why...
-Even though

138
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,745
who the culprit is might be more important
to those who execute the law,

139
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,872
-what's more infuriating
-Camera One, cut.

140
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,957
to people like us who must follow the law

141
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,502
is the fact that an innocent civilian
was wrongly imprisoned

142
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,712
and ended up taking his own life.

143
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,798
There's no guarantee
that something like that

144
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,716
will never happen to us or our families.

145
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,928
It showed us that we never know what can
happen even if we don't commit bad deeds.

146
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,348
-Cut.
-This is what Mr. Kang said.

147
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,974
The murder had already taken place

148
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,435
when he arrived at the scene.

149
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,312
However, that statement itself

150
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,899
ended up being the clincher
that got him convicted.

151
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,443
Are you saying that he lied?

152
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,071
All right. If you see on the screen...

153
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,119
The victim was the only person
inside the house.

154
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,913
He was wearing a white T-shirt
and blue sweat pants.

155
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,791
-Cut.
-That's a very crucial scene.

156
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,584
How did you get this footage?

157
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,964
This is from a dashboard camera
from a vehicle that was parked nearby.

158
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,924
I struggled with Mr. Kang's claim

159
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,594
that he did not kill the victim
but stole the jewelry

160
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,265
because it sounded implausible,
and that's when I obtained this footage.

161
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,058
If you see it again...

162
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,728
The victim was right here.

163
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,522
He was obviously alive.

164
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,940
Also,

165
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,067
the suspect, Mr. Jin-seob Kang,

166
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,362
was here. He was still outside the house.

167
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,905
So he did lie.

168
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,198
No.

169
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,536
The victim's blood was found on a spot
completely unrelated to Mr. Kang.

170
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,288
He did tell the truth.

171
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,540
Then what do you think happened?

172
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,833
There can be only one conclusion.

173
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,419
That man you're seeing.

174
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,337
He must be the killer.

175
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,131
-Goodness.
-That man?

176
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,884
-What's he saying?
-That guy is the killer.

177
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,760
-Isn't that right?
-Is that possible?

178
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,220
-I don't understand.
-Goodness.

179
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,894
Are you saying the victim is the culprit?

180
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,936
He's not the victim.

181
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,063
That must be after he killed the victim.

182
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,982
He put on a show.

183
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,819
He stood there facing the dashboard
camera, pretending he was the victim.

184
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,822
Since Mr. Kang watched this clip
during his trial,

185
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,533
he was convinced
that the evidence itself was fabricated.

186
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,453
So the evidence itself
wasn't tempered in any way?

187
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,122
That's correct. The investigation
wasn't carried out properly.

188
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,957
Has he lost his mind?

189
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,418
Are you admitting it?

190
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,464
We blindly trusted the footage
and did not believe Mr. Kang's claim.

191
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,715
It resulted

192
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,425
in the unfortunate loss.

193
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,220
Our initial investigation failed,
and it was my fault.

194
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,139
Why are you disclosing this information
on television?

195
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,391
Because tampering with evidence
is a crime,

196
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,436
you'd rather take the blame
for improperly investigating the case.

197
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,854
Is that it?

198
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,022
We must catch the culprit.

199
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,566
That man crafted a scenario
and killed a person.

200
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,944
Then he intentionally stood
before the camera.

201
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,988
Only those with deep malice
or animosity can do such a thing.

202
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,033
To the culprit, this may be just a game.

203
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,454
Also, we don't know when he'll press
the play button again.

204
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,249
Are you launching a manhunt?

205
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,376
No. Now, I don't even know

206
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,878
whom I should include
on the list of suspects.

207
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,046
However,

208
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,048
I'll be sure to catch him
within two months.

209
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,467
How? You don't even know
whom to name as suspects.

210
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,554
If I fail, I'll leave the prosecution.

211
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,180
I'll gladly get fired.

212
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,184
I'll put my everything on the line
and make sure to arrest the culprit

213
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,644
within that time frame.

214
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,524
Mr. Hwang.

215
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,109
Yes.

216
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,444
Please catch the killer.

217
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,614
Also, please come back on the show
after you do.

218
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,491
I will.

219
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,159
That piece of...

220
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,289
"I support Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang.

221
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,790
-Good luck!"
-"Good luck!"

222
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,044
"He came on the show because he was
worried about getting fired."

223
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,713
-Next one.
-"Please catch him. You have my support."

224
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,591
Goodness, most of the comments
are in support of him.

225
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,594
He also looked amazing on TV.
He now has nothing to worry about.

226
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,262
Totally. He can put his worries to rest.

227
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,849
You two seem jolly today.

228
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,726
He's not here yet.

229
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,479
Does he realize what time it is now?

230
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,441
He must have too much time on his hands.

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,943
All right.

232
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
You just keep acting up like that.

233
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,992
What is he talking about?

234
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,120
What if we get fired too
because of the interview?

235
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,665
All we did was watch that interview.

236
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,874
Exactly.

237
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,126
"I'm rooting for you. Best of luck."

238
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,253
Salute.

239
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,547
I, Officer Sun-chang Park,
have been assigned to a post here

240
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,509
at Yongsan Police Station as of today.
I'm reporting for duty, sir.

241
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,010
Salute!

242
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,720
Welcome.

243
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,559
Salute.

244
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,478
Do a good job.

245
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,897
I'll do my best.

246
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,316
Let's have our morning meeting. Come on.

247
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,193
-Let's do this.
-What's your name again?

248
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,528
It's Sun-chang Park.

249
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,029
SUNCHANG RED CHILI PASTE

250
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,783
He's just an officer, so he's probably
not here to replace anyone.

251
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,869
It looks like suspension
is all you're getting.

252
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,247
Wait, I have a gift for you.

253
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,792
Goodness, every single time...

254
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,753
Doodle on a tissue
so I can blow my nose on it.

255
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,464
I'm going to use this graphite pencil
so that your nose turns black.

256
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,099
INVESTIGATION TEAM
FOR DETECTIVE CRIME THREE

257
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,190
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

258
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,360
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

259
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,949
INVESTIGATION TEAM FOR DETECTIVE CRIME TWO

260
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,826
Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang
on the Huam-dong Murder

261
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,120
Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang
Promises to Catch the Real Killer

262
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,502
Goodness.

263
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,924
Well, to what do I owe the pleasure
of the most-searched person visiting me?

264
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,261
Where's Mr. Park's mother at the moment?

265
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,183
Today is the first day
of the two months you promised, right?

266
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,770
-She's at a sauna.
-No need to come. Just tell me the name.

267
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,106
It's all right. It's close by,
but it's kind of hard to find.

268
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,358
There's a thing called navigation
these days.

269
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,985
She'll be in the women's changing room.

270
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,904
Goodness. Come on.

271
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,282
Let's go, okay? I'll take you there.

272
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,203
You were even on TV. You shouldn't let
people think that you're a pervert.

273
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,583
Should I drive? Come on.

274
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,462
You wouldn't even need
to use the navigation if I...

275
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,800
"There can be only one conclusion.

276
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,095
That man you're seeing
must be the killer."

277
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,222
I thought...

278
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,016
I thought you were on the show,
Real Men, or something like that.

279
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,896
You don't know what Real Men is?

280
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,566
-Isn't it one of the army songs...
-Goodness.

281
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,444
Are you from the '80s or something?

282
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,614
You talk like an old man.

283
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,119
Do I talk in a particular way?

284
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,544
Judging from how you did the TV interview,

285
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,713
I bet you're being harassed
by your higher-ups too.

286
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,299
Be it the media or public sentiment.

287
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,219
I should use anything I can get in order
to continue investigating the case.

288
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,100
Just disclose the truth. Tell everyone
who Moo-sung Park really was.

289
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,351
That will be faster.

290
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,522
Why didn't the police disclose
Sergeant Kim trying to conceal evidence?

291
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,315
Sergeant Kim.

292
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,028
He lives alone because his wife
and child are abroad.

293
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,322
So?

294
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,535
I think his kid had a hard time
adjusting to school here.

295
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,913
He wouldn't have wanted
to send them off like that, you know.

296
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,296
A few years ago, one whistleblower
exposed wrong deeds

297
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,341
of the Inspector General and Chief Judge
at Cheongju Prosecutors' Office.

298
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,302
Then?

299
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,679
The allegations were confirmed to be true,
so they got fired.

300
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,182
Goodness, justice was served for a change.

301
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,852
After things quieted down a bit,
they both filed administrative complaints

302
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,812
and got the dismissal decision revoked.

303
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,982
-So, what happened after that?
-The former Inspector General retired

304
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,817
as the director of the judicial institute.

305
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,528
The former Chief Judge opened
his own law firm,

306
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,947
and he's still living
a very comfortable life.

307
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,909
Goodness.

308
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,577
Right.

309
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,789
In the traffic division, a senior officer
got fired for hiring a prostitute

310
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,918
but appealed against his dismissal
and got his job back.

311
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,630
He said the money was given
with no strings attached. What a joke.

312
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,761
I'm sure many people aren't like that.

313
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,348
There must be some, right?

314
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,185
Mr. Park told me this.

315
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,188
He entertained and bribed so many people

316
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,941
from all kinds of industries
for seven years,

317
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,694
and there were only two people
who rejected his offer

318
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,071
in the seven years.

319
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,866
Is one of the two...

320
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,426
Let's catch that prick no matter what.

321
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,179
So that we can make sure
one of those two people can keep his job.

322
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:38,380
-Isn't he the guy in the morning show?
-Yes, he's the prosecutor.

323
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:43,593
FAR-INFRARED SAUNA

324
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,234
Ma'am.

325
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,778
Hello.

326
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,918
Don't worry.

327
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,797
It's not like someone's making me work.
I'm just doing it to keep myself busy.

328
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,467
Why didn't you answer my calls?
Did you cancel your service?

329
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,720
No, it's just because I keep
getting spam calls.

330
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,804
ASSISTANT CHIEF PROSECUTOR

331
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,681
I just want to answer my grandson's calls.

332
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,142
In your statement,

333
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,270
you said that you went
to your brother's party on January 16th.

334
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,439
Did you plan to attend it?

335
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,149
Yes.

336
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,360
Then would anyone else have known
that you'd be going out that day?

337
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,450
Moo-sung

338
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,620
and people at the party...

339
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,622
I think that's about it.

340
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,543
Did Mr. Park always wear
the same clothes at home?

341
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,129
The T-shirt and his blue sweat pants?

342
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,299
Actually, those are his son's clothes.

343
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,385
He didn't have anywhere to go,

344
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,721
and he couldn't bring anything
from his place

345
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,266
as he practically had
to leave the house empty-handed.

346
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,355
Did you notice anything out of ordinary
the day before the incident?

347
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,405
He had an argument with someone.

348
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,368
With whom?

349
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,635
Aren't you hungry?

350
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,387
Shall I make you a whole-grain smoothie?

351
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,180
It's too late to eat anything.

352
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,723
No, it's not.

353
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,519
I want a lot of ice cubes in it.

354
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,757
Goodness.

355
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,350
Who's this?

356
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,269
What?

357
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,689
How would I know?

358
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,285
His blood must be boiling.

359
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,412
Hey!

360
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,497
You little... What?

361
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,042
How dare you threaten me?

362
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,045
Threaten? Did you just say "threaten"?

363
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,755
I tuned out.

364
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,549
I should've paid attention to it.

365
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,718
I really should have.

366
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,681
All the arguing and swearing...

367
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,066
So you don't know with whom
he was arguing?

368
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,112
I don't think it was a creditor though.

369
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,865
What makes you think so?

370
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,284
He went out to meet up with that person.

371
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,994
That night?

372
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,205
As soon as he took the call?

373
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,007
Here.

374
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,093
Don't wait for me and just go to bed.

375
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,011
It's dark out. Get back soon.

376
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,232
He got back shortly.

377
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,651
It didn't take long.

378
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,614
He seemed to be in a bad mood
when he got back.

379
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,158
He went straight into his room.

380
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,998
I didn't see him the next day
as I had to leave early.

381
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,583
I just put some food on the table for him.

382
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,461
That's everything that happened.

383
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,131
The soup must've been cold.

384
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,760
By any chance,

385
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,974
do you remember roughly what time
he got the call?

386
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,103
You said you were watching TV, right?

387
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:49,107
What were you watching?
A drama or night show...

388
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,569
It was after the drama ended.

389
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,446
I see.

390
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,157
Excuse me for a second.

391
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,703
Hey, Officer Kim. How have you been?

392
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,788
Can you look up
someone's call history for me?

393
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,335
Then did anyone else come into the house
prior to the 16th?

394
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,670
Any courier or gas man?
Even for a few seconds.

395
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,090
No.

396
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,220
We were always anxious
about creditors barging in.

397
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,514
Ma'am.

398
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,683
Ma'am?

399
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,021
Mr. Park left you with nothing
but a mountain of debt.

400
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,607
Are you really that sad?

401
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,987
Is that why you renounced
the succession on the day he died?

402
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,616
Mr. Hwang, what are you talking about?

403
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,744
Wasn't your priority getting rid
of the debt and protecting your house?

404
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,329
For goodness' sake.

405
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:48,708
I checked with your brother,
and he said there was no party that day.

406
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,045
Where were you at the time of the murder?

407
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,464
You were with her.

408
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,466
You said you ran into her
on your way to his place.

409
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,551
It wasn't at my brother's place.

410
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,972
I was actually working
at someone else's party.

411
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,228
I need that person's contact information.

412
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,313
-Mr. Hwang.
-The phone number,

413
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,731
please.

414
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,693
Are you out of your mind?

415
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,197
There are some things
that you just shouldn't say.

416
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,700
These days, we often hear about parents
killing their children and vice versa.

417
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,285
That old lady can't even walk well.

418
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,497
Do you actually think she put on
his clothes and climbed over the wall?

419
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,082
What are you trying to do
with the culprit?

420
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,792
The culprit must be caught.

421
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,919
I'm not trying to do anything else.

422
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,799
The murdered one isn't the only victim.

423
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,386
Everyone who's been wounded
by the crime is a victim.

424
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,723
Suppose she had a hit-and-run incident
on the street, and you just hit her again

425
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,767
with a car saying that you're
doing it to catch the culprit. Get it?

426
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,394
Family murders have gone up by 43 percent,

427
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,438
and family assault has gone up
by 1,300 percent

428
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,273
in the last 20 years.

429
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,277
Not everyone is hurt
by a family member's death.

430
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,252
Goodness, how can someone turn out
to be like that?

431
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:22,051
NO FLAMMABLES ALLOWED

432
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,265
Ma'am.

433
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,350
Goodness, you startled me.

434
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,573
I'll help you.

435
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,259
I can't eat out like this all the time.

436
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,594
I'm sick of eating out.

437
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,264
I'm sorry to hear that.

438
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,724
Ma'am.

439
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,229
I'd love to eat a home-cooked meal.

440
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,900
Here?

441
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,237
Goodness.

442
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,990
I'll help you.

443
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,576
Goodness. This is how I live.

444
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,746
I'm being a huge nuisance. I'm sorry.

445
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,081
Goodness.

446
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,667
We're almost there. Keep going.

447
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,044
Gosh, we're here.

448
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,312
Please come in.

449
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,276
This is where I live.

450
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,488
It's not nice, but...

451
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,531
I'll help you with it.

452
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,618
This way, please.

453
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,495
Oh, no. Goodness.

454
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,581
Goodness, what a mess.

455
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,668
Please have a seat.

456
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,762
-It looks like you have a kid.
-Pardon me?

457
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,682
Yes, how did you know?

458
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,851
These are my babies.

459
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,937
Also...

460
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,732
You'll find groceries for dinner here.

461
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,735
Have a seat. Please have a seat here.

462
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,197
Also, I'll leave the extra key
for you here.

463
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,783
I'll be home late,
so don't make food for me.

464
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,160
I'll see you later.

465
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,581
-Yes, sir.
-Get yourself here right now!

466
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,671
How dare you blab on a TV show
about a case we're still investigating?

467
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,965
Have you lost your mind or what?

468
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,883
My apologies.

469
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,926
You little...

470
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,844
Do you actually think
you look apologetic right now?

471
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,264
You think all of your colleagues
are big jokes, don't you?

472
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,725
How do you feel to have made
all of us look like morons?

473
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,728
Do you want to become an outcast?

474
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,147
-I'm really sorry.
-You piece of...

475
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,483
Saying sorry certainly isn't enough.

476
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,110
Submit a written apology.

477
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,277
Yes, sir.

478
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,199
Where do you think you're going?
Write it here.

479
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,815
Mr. Hwang.

480
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,236
-It's about Mr. Lee, isn't it?
-Pardon? Yes.

481
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,864
What are you going to do?
He sounded furious.

482
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,033
I'll have to do as he says.

483
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,912
PROSECUTOR CHANG-JUN LEE

484
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,424
Come in.

485
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,534
Come in.

486
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,163
-You ordered these, right?
-Yes.

487
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,289
-Two boxes?
-Right.

488
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,264
Yes, this is the deputy chief prosecutor's
secretary.

489
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,225
I see.

490
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,979
He wants you to come back
in the afternoon.

491
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,151
SI-MOK HWANG, WE SUPPORT YOU.

492
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,740
How many did he get?

493
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,245
You can open a flower shop,
don't you think?

494
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,663
Look at all this.

495
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,957
You got so many...

496
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,962
Everyone in the next office
is on vacation.

497
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,797
They said they split the workload,

498
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,049
but I'm not sure if they actually did.

499
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,346
Aren't you going for lunch?

500
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,892
I haven't gotten any message about it.
You should go ahead.

501
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,728
Okay. Have a good lunch.

502
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,134
Hello.

503
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,969
You can sit here.

504
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,731
-Pollack stew, please.
-Sure.

505
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,531
Hello.

506
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,618
You can take those seats.

507
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,496
I apologize. I hope you're okay
with sharing the table.

508
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,255
Hey, I think I'm more uncomfortable
than he is.

509
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,091
I know, right?
I'd just leave if I were him.

510
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,303
I heard it'll air again later
on a different channel.

511
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:06,182
Yes, Cases and Accidents is doing
a special on the Huam-dong case.

512
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,975
They'll criticize us
like there's no tomorrow.

513
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,436
He basically poured gasoline on the fire.

514
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,648
Here's your stew.

515
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,150
The soup really hit the spot.

516
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,947
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you for the food.

517
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,829
-Thank you. See you again.
-Yes, have a good day.

518
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,957
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

519
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,175
-Could I have some water, please?
-Sure.

520
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,462
I'm sorry. I was in charge of messaging
everyone but didn't get around to do it.

521
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,342
You shouldn't talk to me.

522
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,471
I don't care. It's driving me nuts
because I think it's so childish.

523
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,143
People must have no idea
that things like this go on here.

524
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,147
Thank you.

525
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,317
I didn't do it for you.

526
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,445
Still, I'd like to thank you.

527
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,908
I heard my dad interviewed you.

528
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,995
He said he didn't know whether he should
give you ten out of ten or a zero.

529
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,497
He remembers you as a trainee
who greatly confused him.

530
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,832
It was ten out of ten.

531
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,208
How do you know?

532
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,502
That's the score I gave the interviewer.

533
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,257
Why do you always talk
like everything is about you?

534
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,426
That's why people are
trying to exclude you.

535
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,763
Continue to exclude me.
I want to relax at lunch at least.

536
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,640
I'll give you a heads-up so that
you can avoid where we're going.

537
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,684
Do as you wish.

538
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,728
Yes.

539
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,230
Does 0275-4270 ring a bell?

540
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,066
-Doesn't it sound familiar?
-Pardon?

541
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,902
The call Moo-sung Park received
the night before he died.

542
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,113
It was made from your
Public Service Center at 11:07 p.m.

543
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,575
Hold on. Someone from the Public Service
Center here called Mr. Park?

544
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,621
Check up on people at your work first
before you suspect his family.

545
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,378
What was it about?
What about Moo-sung Park?

546
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,922
He received a threatening phone call
the day before he died.

547
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,007
Was the call made
from our Public Service Center?

548
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,345
This one has the number ending with 4270.

549
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,310
Mr. Hwang.

550
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,903
We only store footage up to 60 days.
It's been discarded already.

551
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,448
It's only a few days past
the 60 days mark.

552
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,908
I'm sure there's something left.

553
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,827
The rule is 60 days,

554
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,913
but it's not like accidents or mishaps
happen here.

555
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,541
The rule is 60 days, but what?

556
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,252
We've never had any problems, so...

557
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,503
So?

558
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,381
We usually discard them every 15 days.

559
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,925
But it has really never been a problem.

560
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,845
Accidents aren't something

561
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,681
that happens every second.
If you ignore such rules

562
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,600
because there have been
no problems, one day,

563
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,311
you'll have to deal with a sinking ship
or a collapsing building.

564
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,823
It's been over 60 days anyway.
Why is he making a big deal about it now?

565
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,450
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

566
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,160
Had we come here immediately...

567
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,455
Well, I'm not blaming you.

568
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,041
He must have left a trace.

569
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,628
He must have been caught
on security cameras in the hallway.

570
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,796
I'll look into it.

571
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,174
Mr. Hwang.

572
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,887
Do you think that person is the killer?

573
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,930
The person Moo-sung last met on that day?

574
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,434
No, he's just a suspect for now.

575
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,228
He used an office phone
not to expose his phone number.

576
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,482
He's a suspect and the last person
who saw Mr. Park alive.

577
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,151
Bunny?

578
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,827
Coffee, bunny.

579
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,121
Yongsan-gu.

580
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,665
COFFEE, BUNNY, YONGSAN-GU

581
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,920
COFFEE, BUNNY AND ELLIS

582
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,841
He left home at 11:16 p.m.
and came back at 11:48 p.m.

583
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,052
It took him 32 minutes.

584
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,222
It took him 32 minutes at that hour?

585
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,747
It must mean he went somewhere
that takes 16 minutes one way.

586
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,749
FOOD MART

587
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,061
This is the farthest
Mr. Park could have come

588
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,688
in 16 minutes with his walking pace.

589
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,639
Excuse me. By any chance,
do your takeout cups have a bunny logo...

590
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,099
What?

591
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,062
My apologies.

592
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,954
I'm sorry to bother you.

593
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,875
Do you happen to know of a cafe that
uses a bunny logo on things like this?

594
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,627
No, I'm not sure.

595
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,255
Okay, thank you.

596
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,260
Bye.

597
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,187
January 15th?

598
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,689
It was 64 days ago.

599
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,732
Goodness, it's been too long.

600
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,819
Then how long do you keep
your security camera footage?

601
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,946
Two weeks. It won't help at all, right?

602
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,865
If it was around midnight...

603
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,033
Which part-timer had a shift that day?

604
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,538
Did Min-sung work that day?

605
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,124
Would you be able to give me
his contact information?

606
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,168
Just a moment, please.

607
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,345
-Hey, look at this.
-It's him, right?

608
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,477
I'll ask him first

609
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,895
and give you a call.

610
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,813
Well, it's about an urgent matter.

611
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,357
I can tell that it's the case,

612
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,402
but I don't feel comfortable
giving out someone's number.

613
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,529
I sent him a message,
so he'll call me right away.

614
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,989
I'll call you right away.

615
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,115
Well...

616
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,368
I'd like an iced Americano, please.

617
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,332
-Sure.
-Isn't he that prosecutor?

618
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,501
Right? Am I right?

619
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,213
-Yes, it's him.
-Look at him.

620
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,756
Is he the guy on the morning show?

621
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,634
It's definitely him.

622
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,763
But I'm not sure if he'll remember
a customer from two months ago.

623
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,432
I think it's him. Am I not right?

624
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,270
Yes, he is the prosecutor.

625
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,010
There's a thing called decency.
How can you do this?

626
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,019
Whom did he meet?

627
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,250
This is from a dashboard camera
from a vehicle that was parked nearby.

628
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,876
From his face to height,

629
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,671
he certainly does not

630
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,299
measure up to you at all.

631
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,634
-It sounded implausible,
-But one thing better than you...

632
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,052
so I obtained this footage.

633
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,346
-Let's watch it again.
-It's his brain.

634
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,184
You let that young prosecutor
beat you, but what can you do?

635
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,938
Some bosses are just not as bright
as their subordinates.

636
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,025
I apologize, Father.

637
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,611
You should be sorry for yourself.

638
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,197
You basically kicked away an opportunity
that could have made you a star.

639
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,618
When things are shaky at Western
Seoul Prosecutors' Office like this,

640
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,287
you should've gotten yourself
on national television first.

641
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,831
"I'll take responsibility for everything

642
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,083
and make sure to track down the suspect.

643
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,878
Please place your trust in me,
the next Inspector General."

644
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,005
I'll gladly get fired.
I'll put my everything...

645
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,466
Then you would've been summoned
to the Blue House already.

646
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,510
And make sure to arrest the culprit.

647
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,055
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes.

648
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,057
-Please catch the killer.
-I apologize.

649
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,434
I'll take care of everything
as soon as possible.

650
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,727
Take care of what?

651
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,479
Do you have a plan?

652
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,815
An internal investigation
has been ordered,

653
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,776
so he deserves
a severe disciplinary action.

654
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,236
-Chang-jun.
-Yes, Father.

655
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,656
Are you the one

656
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,533
who killed Mr. Park?

657
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,703
-Father.
-Was it you?

658
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,413
No, not at all.

659
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,338
War has been declared,
so let's see whom he catches.

660
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,800
Somebody has to be caught
for this game to end.

661
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,219
-Just leave him be.
-But Father...

662
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,847
Attacking him first in this situation
would be like digging your own grave.

663
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,893
He struck first because he knows that.

664
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,021
Will you act like he's above you
now that he has beaten you once?

665
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,816
There's only one way
you can turn the tables.

666
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,734
Look for a scapegoat for this.

667
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,029
Make him look like the culprit
and leak evidence.

668
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,073
Then make sure Si-mok can smell it.

669
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:57,869
Feeling completely cornered,
the culprit will end up jumping to death.

670
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,121
It'll put an end to everything.

671
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,873
No matter who the culprit is,

672
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,085
he absolutely must not be caught alive
if he's someone in this field.

673
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,796
If he's captured alive,

674
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:12,300
he'll give away names of everyone
who had any connection with Mr. Park.

675
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,678
If I have to go through anything

676
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,265
disgraceful because of you,
even though you're my son-in-law,

677
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,645
then I'll bring you down first.

678
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,981
That will never happen.

679
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,024
Please trust me, Father.

680
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,402
Even if

681
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,197
people find out that the guy we frame
isn't the real culprit,

682
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,367
make it look like it was done
by that eager prosecutor

683
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,578
who gave a big talk
and made a promise on TV.

684
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,455
If he catches a wrong person again,

685
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,208
he won't be able to get out of it twice.

686
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,627
He may be a star now,

687
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,089
but the public can turn on him overnight.

688
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,223
I'll find someone.

689
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,642
Do not make any mistakes this time.

690
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,521
"This time"?

691
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,442
Do you know that Il-jae Young
is bedridden now?

692
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,820
Someone posted a photo of him.

693
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,782
I almost couldn't recognize him.

694
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:22,287
How can he age that much
in just three years?

695
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,625
I mean, he's not the only one
who was dragged down from ministry.

696
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,835
Everyone else has overcome it.

697
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,963
He's the only one
who's acting all pathetic.

698
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,216
It shows the scope of his caliber.

699
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,428
He's small-minded.

700
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,642
He indeed is a man of low caliber.

701
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,179
Let me see.

702
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,391
I'm just bored.

703
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,768
It's just a petty criminal.

704
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,729
There's no such thing as a petty crime.

705
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,441
You must be tired.
I think you should get some rest.

706
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,037
I guess this is what reports
look like these days.

707
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,747
Did it look different back in the days?

708
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,833
Well, it was the same.

709
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,441
Yes, I find things like this hard.

710
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,873
PROFESSOR IL-JAE YOUNG
APPOINTED AS MINISTER OF JUSTICE

711
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,454
Goodness. I haven't been here in ages.

712
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,544
Did your father-in-law scold you?

713
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,509
You should've just married a woman
from your hometown like I did.

714
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,220
Technically, she's from my hometown.

715
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,304
Goodness.

716
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,890
Do you even lie about your hometown now
because of your in-laws?

717
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,018
People lie about worse things.
Lying about my hometown is nothing.

718
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,313
Was it because of the guy who was on TV?

719
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,984
So what's the conclusion?

720
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,737
If you can't avoid it, just enjoy it.

721
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,448
If you can't stop it, get on it.

722
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,950
Get on him, then what?

723
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,994
Will you eat him up alive?

724
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,870
Yes.

725
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,581
How will I get on him though?

726
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,917
What's the problem?
You'll get a pile of dust

727
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,752
if you shake off
the cushion he's been sitting on.

728
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,171
That jerk isn't even sitting on a cushion.

729
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,382
I've never seen anyone like that.

730
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,885
There must be something. Keep digging.

731
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,347
You'll find something to take him down
in one blow unless he's a ghost.

732
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,060
I haven't found a thing even with the guy
I planted right under his nose.

733
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,732
I think the female detective
at my station has met up with him.

734
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,316
-A female detective?
-Yes, her.

735
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,736
The police academy graduate.

736
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,446
The one who made the situation worse.

737
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,448
They seem to be doing
a cooperative investigation.

738
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,949
He's doing a cooperative investigation?

739
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,410
He's never done that before.

740
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,377
OWNER OF THE CAFE

741
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,382
Hello? Have you heard from the part-timer?

742
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,385
Yes. He said he was sleeping.

743
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,888
He'll be at the cafe by 5 p.m. tomorrow.

744
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:53,308
Is that right? Then I'll stop by tomorrow.

745
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,434
I'll see you then.

746
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,484
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

747
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,074
What is it?

748
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,409
-Mr. Hwang, are you home now?
-Yes.

749
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:15,413
I went through the CCTV footage earlier
in the day but couldn't find anything.

750
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,248
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

751
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,335
Wait, a special show
on the Huam-dong case is on right now.

752
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,253
-Aren't you going to watch it?
-No.

753
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,089
I think you should.

754
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,890
The prosecutor in charge of the case
apologized on national television.

755
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,558
However,

756
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,936
our production team stumbled
upon a very interesting post

757
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:41,189
on our website
after the show was broadcast.

758
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,024
It was posted by someone who claims

759
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,736
to have gone to the same middle school
as Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang.

760
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,154
In his post, he stated

761
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,240
that Prosecutor Hwang
used to be very violent in school

762
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,617
and that he used to attack
his classmates for no reason.

763
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,912
He ended up getting expelled from school
as a result, which we found shocking.

764
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,039
He used to be a total psycho.

765
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,583
He used to beat up classmates
for no reason.

766
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:05,046
I still remember this. A bird or something
like that came into our classroom,

767
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,507
and I think a girl screamed
because she was startled.

768
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,300
Then he started hitting her
all of a sudden.

769
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,218
FELLOW ALUMNUS

770
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,136
He hit a girl.

771
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,222
Good for him that he's become successful,

772
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:17,809
but I can't believe that someone like him
has become a prosecutor.

773
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,644
Once, he even broke a classmate's finger

774
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,313
right in front of our teacher.

775
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,025
Why do you think everyone called him
a psycho? He really is a psycho.

776
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,570
In order to verify his claim,

777
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,905
we visited the school
Prosecutor Hwang attended.

778
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,700
The school denied our interview request,

779
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,119
-Hello.
-but we were able to confirm

780
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,455
-that he did drop out in eighth grade.
-We have nothing to say.

781
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:42,459
However, he wasn't expelled. We confirmed
that he left by his own choice.

782
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,128
From the records we've checked,
we also found out

783
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,214
that he switched schools multiple times
since elementary school.

784
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,091
Wouldn't this serve as evidence that shows

785
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,136
he had to keep switching schools
due to his violent behaviors?

786
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,681
Of course, people can change
if they're willing to make an effort.

787
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:01,102
Nevertheless, even though someone who
seemed to have anger management issues

788
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,063
became a prosecutor
and drove an innocent civilian to death,

789
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,150
he rose to stardom as a fighter
for justice

790
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:10,528
with just one TV appearance alone.
How should we interpret this?

791
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,948
In order to verify everything,

792
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,367
we tried to interview his family.

793
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,620
Is anyone inside?
We'd like to interview you.

794
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,913
I told you to leave.

795
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,582
He has fully recovered.

796
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,833
Did you hear that?

797
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,169
Why do you think he used
the word "recovered"?

798
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,338
We weren't able to meet his family,

799
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,757
but we couldn't help but focus on it.

800
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,217
Did he have a condition in the past...

801
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,212
You should've just come up.

802
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,674
Why didn't you tell me
about those people showing up here?

803
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,635
I didn't want to make a fuss about it.

804
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,347
It must've been annoying. I'm sorry.

805
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,600
They came when I wasn't home.

806
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,894
That's why I couldn't stop him
from saying that...

807
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,402
I think they purposely made you look bad.
Will you be okay?

808
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,404
It's not false information.

809
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,655
How can you say such a thing?

810
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,575
What if you get fired?
It's not like you work at some company.

811
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:44,539
What kind of mean bastard is talking
about something from over 20 years ago?

812
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:46,958
Any idea on who he might be?

813
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,377
Goodness.

814
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,671
Why did you go on that TV show
to begin with?

815
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,966
I told you to live a quiet life, didn't I?

816
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,394
If they come again, tell them that
you don't know me and call the police.

817
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,229
I don't care.

818
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,360
How are your ears?

819
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,947
Do they still hurt?

820
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,490
They're fine now.

821
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,039
Your dad...

822
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,376
What did your dad say about all this?

823
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,380
When did he come back?

824
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,258
You don't know either?

825
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,429
He's been dumping everything
on me all his life.

826
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,307
He has no sense of responsibility
whatsoever.

827
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:47,894
You should go in.

828
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,979
He's been waiting for you.

829
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,651
Goodness, that man...

830
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,572
Come by on your birthday.

831
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,494
Why are you waiting out here?

832
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,537
I couldn't let you talk with him
on your own.

833
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,831
He must be here because he's livid
from watching that show.

834
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,376
Why are you being like this now?

835
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,752
People call him a psycho.

836
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,422
People like him don't even care
about their families or mothers.

837
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,716
It's not like that.

838
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,135
-Goodness.
-What's the matter with her?

839
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,293
Gosh.

840
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,548
People are just jealous of him
because he's gotten famous.

841
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,468
Psycho, my ass.

842
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,400
-Why are you out here?
-Ma'am.

843
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,945
Are you sleeping here because of me?

844
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,489
No. Why would I sleep here?

845
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,282
My face will get paralyzed
from the cold wind.

846
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,076
Right. Ma'am.

847
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,831
Ta-da! Would you like a glass?

848
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,582
Just a second.

849
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,182
No way.

850
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,687
I made some seasoned vegetables.

851
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,816
Nice, seasoned veggies! My gosh.

852
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,776
I'll try it.

853
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,661
We should open a restaurant together.

854
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,581
How about eight to two?
I'll give you 20 percent of the profit.

855
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,336
Let me pour you a glass.

856
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,090
I'm Yeo-jin Han.

857
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,384
It's very nice to meet you.

858
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,011
Thank you.

859
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,480
Are you okay?

860
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,316
Goodness, you downed the whole thing.

861
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,777
Are you all right? Doesn't it feel
like your stomach is on fire?

862
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,324
These look like tadpoles.

863
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:35,616
Send us fun clips
or information on any incidents!

ANONYMOUS POST

865
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:38,869
I was assaulted by Si-mok.

866
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:01,183
-What's wrong, Mom?
-I just realized I forgot something.

867
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:02,977
Just a second.

868
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,502
This isn't just a slap in the face.

869
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,212
It really pushed him off a cliff.

870
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,674
I'll push this through and put an end
to the mess as soon as possible.

871
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:34,925
I can't even imagine it.

872
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,720
Si-mok assaulted classmates
and dropped out of school?

873
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,890
I should've dug it up first. Then...

874
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:42,767
Then what?

875
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,144
Would you have threatened him
with the fights he had as a boy?

876
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,563
It's not the kind of fights
normal boys have growing up.

877
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,231
I've told you a hundred times.

878
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,275
He irks me in a very strange way.

879
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,902
And who knows with his violent tendencies?

880
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:56,530
He might hide it during the day
and do something crazy at night.

881
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,658
How can he hide something like that
so perfectly?

882
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:03,579
How can someone change 180 degrees?

883
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,375
He was practically reborn
if the rumor about his past is true.

884
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,173
What's important

885
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,133
is the fact that everyone
is criticizing him.

886
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,470
Now, all you have to do is
reprimand him, sir.

887
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,848
I cannot let that young prosecutor
beat me twice.

888
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,227
-Pardon me?
-Depending on how it's used,

889
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,312
it could actually work to his advantage.

890
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:31,565
A hoodlum turned prosecutor.
A troublemaker turned judicial officer.

891
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,150
People love stories like that.

892
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,069
It's actually great marketing.

893
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,072
He has now become someone
with enticing content behind him.

894
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,658
He was pushed off a cliff,

895
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,993
but he landed right on a gold mine.

896
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:48,249
There is a huge difference
between a hoodlum and a psychopath.

897
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:51,627
Hoodlums can repent and turn over
a new leaf, but psychos simply can't.

898
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,004
-The more messed up, the better.
-Why are you...

899
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,008
So what will you do now, sir?

900
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,058
Is the prostitution crackdown
not going as well as you expected?

901
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,395
You promoted it as if you would uproot
prostitution right away.

902
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,108
I should work on it myself starting today.

903
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,404
It's okay, sir. I can certainly
take care of it on my own.

904
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,738
Send me the file.

905
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,912
Sir, why are you suddenly...

906
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,172
Tell Mr. Kang to come to my office
after 15 minutes.

907
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,757
Yes, sir.

908
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,606
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR
CHANG-JUN LEE

909
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,379
MEETING ROOM

910
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,925
How do you feel to have gone
from heaven to hell overnight?

911
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:23,344
It's like going between home and work.

912
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,433
-Is all of it true?
-Yes.

913
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:33,062
Then what did you do with Hyde
to become Jekyll? Did you kill him?

914
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,776
Your case must have been a dramatic one.

915
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,694
If you want to keep it to yourself...

916
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,029
I got a surgery.

917
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:43,906
-Surgery?
-Yes.

918
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,991
Can surgery treat something like that?

919
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,077
It depends on what that something is.

920
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,125
The two months you're giving yourself.
Why two months?

921
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,711
We've wasted two months
because of my fault.

922
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:02,132
"I won't need more than two months."
I bet it's something like that.

923
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,843
All right. Let's do it.
Let's catch the culprit.

924
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:08,347
What do you need? Shall I tell everyone
to stop excluding you?

925
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,849
I've already told you what I need.

926
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,560
Please let me become your successor.

927
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,982
I didn't know you'd be so obsessed
with titles.

928
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,110
During the internal investigation,
do I just have to do what you told me?

929
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,654
You said I should push
Mr. Seo out instead.

930
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,408
There will be no internal investigation.
I'll make sure it gets canceled.

931
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,160
Why did you try to cut off your right arm?

932
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:34,373
Only then, a fresh arm
will grow in its place.

933
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,252
Unless Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
gets emptied out,

934
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,629
I'll always have a right arm.

935
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:44,258
Is it because Mr. Seo knows
something about you,

936
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:47,720
and you think things will get complicated
if you deal with him yourself?

937
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,472
Enough is enough.

938
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:53,767
You must know that I'm not doing this
because I'm fond of you.

939
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,354
Didn't you say we should try
and catch the culprit?

940
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,110
Two months, 60 days.
You're just wasting your time.

941
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,696
You're poking around
in all the wrong places.

942
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,199
Go poke around properly.

943
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,843
Yes.

944
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:29,928
Really?

945
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:31,555
Okay.

946
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,432
I'll be there shortly.

947
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,311
MEETING ROOM

948
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,324
PROSECUTION SERVICE

949
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,708
Yes, Chang-jun Lee speaking.

950
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,127
Are you here?

951
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,506
Yes, please come up to my office.

952
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,466
All right.

953
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,887
During the internal investigation,
do I just have to do what you told me?

954
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,264
You said I should push
Mr. Seo out instead.

955
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,142
Only then, a fresh arm
will grow in its place.

956
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,854
Dong-jae heard everything.

957
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,176
It's this man.

958
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,097
Yes, I remember him.

959
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,392
He argued with someone. He left quickly,

960
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,894
but I remember him
because he got so worked up.

961
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,233
Then, was he with...

962
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:09,945
This man?

963
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,321
No.

964
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,705
Was it this guy?

965
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,209
No, it wasn't.

966
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,546
It's this person.

967
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,008
This person here.

968
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:26,063
STRANGER

969
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:28,690
It has to be someone who has the authority

970
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,401
to look up criminal records freely.

971
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,529
Someone here or in the police.

972
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,281
There's no way that person
in the dash camera footage is a woman.

973
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,367
Where did they find the accomplice?

974
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:42,287
-Did they carry it out together?
-Did you find her?

975
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,791
Ms. Young has a direct connection
to the suspect.

976
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,210
Eun-soo has a connection to the suspect?

977
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:49,586
Wake up, Lieutenant Han!

978
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,046
Lieutenant Han!

979
