00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,303
STRANGER

3
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,061
-Congratulations, Mr. Chief Secretary.
-Thank you.

4
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,104
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

5
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,524
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

6
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,443
Congratulations.

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,032
Congratulations.

8
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,202
Thank you.

9
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,037
Thank you.

10
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,376
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,366
I'll do it.

12
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,126
I can't drink much
as I have to get back to work.

13
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,587
The one who's been working the hardest
among you should have a glass with me.

14
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,061
I watched your briefing.

15
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,438
I see that you've been
prancing around other domains too.

16
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,899
If you keep that up,
you might end up here.

17
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,694
All of you should watch out.

18
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,947
Si-mok might barge
into your office unexpectedly.

19
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,158
Aren't I right?

20
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,954
Those who have committed crimes
should watch out no matter who they are.

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,376
My apologies. I only have two hands.

22
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,635
We've been congratulating you often
on your promotions.

23
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,180
For a better future.

24
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,142
For a better future.

25
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,155
I brought my car.

26
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,577
Let's sit down.

27
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,754
The Chief of Division One couldn't make it
due to a family emergency. I apologize.

28
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,673
Let's have a quick talk after this.

29
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,780
The nurse remembered you exactly.

30
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,033
She said she saw a gorgeous woman
in the ward that day.

31
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,662
A woman?

32
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,497
Why did you go to see Ga-young Kim?

33
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,831
Who is that?

34
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,625
Did you touch her ventilator?

35
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,086
What did you do with her pillow?

36
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,005
Sorry?

37
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,851
Doesn't she look very different
from how she looked in the ward?

38
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,479
She's so young and pretty, isn't she?

39
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,235
I guess people these days
think girls like her are pretty.

40
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,444
I must say,

41
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,197
this is too childish for someone
who criticized the saying,

42
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,700
"Women are their own worst enemies."

43
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,328
I brought it because I thought
you might be curious.

44
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:48,997
Did it come across as rude?

45
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,584
The police of this country
really amaze me.

46
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,380
Did you not even check
the hospital's security camera footage?

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,803
I checked it.

48
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,807
I bet you couldn't check it.

49
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,063
There's no way he would've
just left it there.

50
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,815
It's not like he's an amateur.

51
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,867
I thought you'd be away for a while
since you went to see your daughter,

52
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,327
but you got back quickly.

53
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,622
You must know that any good wife
would want to be there for her husband

54
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,292
if he receives a letter of appointment
from the President.

55
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,628
Well, I'll be leaving again soon.

56
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,048
Congratulations on his promotion.

57
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,632
But, what if

58
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,344
it wasn't because of the letter
of appointment from the President?

59
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,722
Could it have been
because you didn't want him

60
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,766
to return here alone
knowing that Ga-young is alive?

61
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,311
What if you followed him
anxiously because you were worried

62
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,979
that he might pity the girl
who almost died?

63
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,984
My husband isn't a philanthropist.

64
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,235
He wouldn't pity

65
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,780
a woman whom he doesn't even know.

66
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,910
You don't need to thank me
as I had a lot of time on my hands.

67
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,122
You won't be able
to leave the country for a while.

68
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,919
You've been banned from leaving
the country due to the criminal case.

69
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:25,968
Bring it on.

70
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,946
Is there anyone specific you have in mind

71
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,073
as the chief prosecutor for our office?

72
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,742
I don't have the authority
to appoint my successor.

73
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,246
-The President will decide.
-I see.

74
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,791
The next meeting will begin
in ten minutes, sir.

75
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,334
My goodness.

76
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,711
You're already so busy.

77
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,838
Indeed.

78
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,298
We should get going, then.

79
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,801
Let's arrange a get-together soon.

80
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,010
Sure.

81
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,564
Don't go overboard.

82
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,441
You'll get back to the office, right?

83
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,984
You can go with me.

84
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,652
Pardon?

85
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,863
Sure.

86
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,008
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

87
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,556
CHIEF WOO-GYUN KIM,
UNBLOCK THE NUMBER

88
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,060
INCOMING CALL,
CHIEF WOO-GYUN KIM

89
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,732
You finally picked up.

90
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,359
Gifts are surely very effective.

91
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,737
What do you think you're doing?

92
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,156
You should have picked up your phone.

93
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,576
I'm at the underground parking lot now.
Shall I go up?

94
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,704
-You can't come here.
-Then you should come down.

95
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,374
No one will know about that gift
only if you come and see me.

96
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,796
Wait there.

97
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,773
Shall I disclose records proving you were
in the room she walked out of?

98
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,324
-The Director of NTS...
-Tell him to wait.

99
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,839
Why is it Chief Kim?

100
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,676
You said Mr. Lee was Ga-young Kim's man.

101
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,302
Why is it Chief Kim now?

102
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,845
That's what the evidence says.

103
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,722
What about Mr. Lee, then?

104
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,144
You must've moved her because
she has regained her consciousness.

105
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,354
Did you go to the hospital?

106
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,940
How can I not go?
With her statement, we can...

107
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,858
I'll call you.

108
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,331
MR. YOON

109
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,013
The next meeting will begin
in ten minutes, sir.

110
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,602
Do I have a contagious disease?

111
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,437
How can you ignore me like that?

112
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,522
We've been friends for 40 years.

113
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,275
How can you bring up our friendship
after doing something like that?

114
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,068
I'm desperate right now.

115
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,194
How can you do this to me?

116
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,864
-I met that girl through you.
-Did I force you to do

117
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,700
-what you didn't want to do?
-How...

118
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,911
Help me.

119
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,080
You're the only person
who can help me now.

120
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,373
You brought it upon yourself.

121
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,425
Hey. I'm at my office, of course.

122
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,386
What is that?

123
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,475
Yes, okay.

124
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,146
-Was that your wife?
-Do not bring her up.

125
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,064
Hey!

126
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,403
Is there a problem?

127
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,406
Keep your mouth shut
and resign from the force.

128
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,327
I'll sort it out
when things quiet down a little.

129
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,957
Thank you, Chang-jun.

130
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,960
I didn't want to do this to you, you know.

131
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,797
Make sure she keeps her mouth shut.

132
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,801
If she talks, I won't be able to help you.
No one will be able to.

133
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,762
All right.

134
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,305
I'll make sure of it.

135
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,487
Yes, Lieutenant Han. Where are you now?

136
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,863
I have to go to the station.

137
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,617
I'll probably be reprimanded
because of what happened with Chief.

138
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,910
I'll call you if I survive it.

139
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,329
There's something you have to do there.

140
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,915
Chief Kim will get away
if we don't catch him now.

141
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,527
What?

142
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,113
You know?

143
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,993
Let me know right away
if you see him hovering around her.

144
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,873
She can't leave the country?

145
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,295
Are you sure this is about my daughter?

146
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,255
The special investigation team
requested it.

147
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,257
The Ministry of Justice
wanted to check with you...

148
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,633
Check what?

149
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,510
Tell them that's not going to happen.

150
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:50,389
They said that they thought
you should know.

151
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,142
That prick, Si-mok Hwang.

152
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,311
He really needs a lesson.

153
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,608
-Get in touch with Dong-jae.
-Yes, sir.

154
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,413
How dare he.

155
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,499
How dare he.

156
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,253
Don't you think it's out of line?

157
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,714
You should've given us
a heads-up at least.

158
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,091
Did you think that we'd help Chief flee
or something?

159
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,552
No, sir.

160
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,138
Hey, we've been through thick and thin
together like a family.

161
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,265
Did you enjoy making
a complete fool out of us?

162
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,727
-We're sorry, sir.
-I've been in the force for 30 years,

163
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,104
yet I've never been this baffled
and humiliated before.

164
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,190
How could you do that to Chief?

165
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,484
Who are you to interrogate him?

166
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,027
What do you think people will say?

167
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,196
They'll say we have no such thing
as loyalty.

168
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,074
Even dogs know not to bite their owners,
you backstabbers!

169
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,123
I'm sorry, but I have to go now, sir.

170
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,626
What?

171
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,503
-What is the matter with you?
-I apologize.

172
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,466
Fine, go.

173
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,886
Go and think about which one
of us you'll arrest next.

174
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
Spare me a second.

175
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,399
Sure thing. Gosh, I'm so scared.

176
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,281
Lieutenant, why are you being like this?

177
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,825
Get the security camera footage.

178
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,868
-Don't let him go till he gives it to you.
-Lieutenant!

179
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,371
-What the hell are you two doing?
-Just a second, please.

180
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,832
Wait, Lieutenant.

181
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,084
Why are you being like this?
Talk to him yourself.

182
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,377
I have to go to the hospital.

183
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,045
Ga-young has been hurt.

184
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,797
Pardon?

185
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,049
Gosh, seriously.

186
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,592
Sergeant, the security camera footage...

187
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,803
It's in my desk drawer.
Go ahead and take it.

188
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,180
Chief, Yeo-jin is going
to the hospital now.

189
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,099
Because of Ga-young Kim.

190
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,356
Hello?

191
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,693
Hey, Si-mok. Did you congratulate
Mr. Lee in person?

192
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,279
-I'm busy. I have to go.
-Hey!

193
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,489
Hey.

194
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,410
Well, about Mr. Lee's wife...

195
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,746
Why is she not allowed
to leave the country?

196
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,041
Is that your first mission
from Hanjo Group?

197
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,378
They'll totally trust me
if I give them this information.

198
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,966
She's a murder suspect.

199
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,927
-Murder?
-I have to go.

200
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,311
Murder...

201
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,692
Who knew he'd help me like this?

202
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,824
Murder?

203
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,081
He's a bit of a psycho, sir.

204
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,376
Psychos are unpredictable, you know.

205
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,421
It's no joke.

206
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,092
I thought, "This is why crazy people
are scary." It gave me goosebumps.

207
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,721
I think

208
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,432
I should keep trying
to dig out information from him.

209
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,811
I'll find out why he has pegged
Ms. Lee as a suspect...

210
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,326
Hello, Mr. Chief Secretary.

211
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
I asked him to meet me here.

212
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,498
You seem excited
to see your old subordinate.

213
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,541
Yes.

214
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,000
Of course.

215
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,169
I served him for many years
at the western office.

216
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,922
It's very nice to see you, sir.

217
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,926
Thank you for your work.
I'll see you again soon.

218
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,636
Please summon me anytime, sir.

219
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,850
Wait for me downstairs.

220
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,356
How did your meeting
with the Director of NTS go?

221
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,609
The tax investigation will not happen.

222
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,777
That's great.

223
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,989
Now that you're in that position,
everything is so easy.

224
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,408
-He wants to treat you to dinner.
-Thank you.

225
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,079
Do you have several wives or what?

226
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,665
You don't even know

227
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,376
what your one and only wife
is going through right now

228
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,254
and you want to look after this country?

229
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,217
DEPARTURE PROHIBITION ORDER

230
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,345
Departure prohibition order?
Why are they doing this to her?

231
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,018
What is the reason?

232
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,314
Murder.

233
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,362
That young man, Si-mok Hwang, is driven.

234
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,283
"Driven" isn't the right word.

235
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,744
He doesn't know his place.

236
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,917
There are many things I have prepared
to celebrate your promotion.

237
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,336
Even just the meeting scheduled in a bit

238
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,755
is about one trillion won.

239
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,257
Make sure that guy doesn't smell anything.

240
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,470
I'll make a quick call.

241
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,608
I told him that his wife
is being accused of murder,

242
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,904
yet he didn't ask who the victim is

243
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,032
or why she's being accused.

244
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,765
-Come and work for me.
-Thank you, sir.

245
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,393
On the condition that I'd never have
to see you again here at Hanjo

246
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,936
or around my father-in-law.

247
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,896
Thank you.

248
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,439
Now leave.

249
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,109
-Yes, sir!
-Go on.

250
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,106
Are they going somewhere important?

251
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,502
Yes, on the second floor.
I'll take her to you right now.

252
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,843
Ga-young, I need to move you
to a different hospital again.

253
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,053
You'll be okay, right?

254
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,598
This is where
you've been hiding her, isn't it?

255
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,766
How did you know...

256
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,601
-No.
-Let me borrow her for a minute.

257
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,186
-You can't!
-Gosh, come on.

258
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,354
-Let go!
-Goodness!

259
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,155
Damn it.

260
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,581
-Let go!
-Hey, do you own her or what?

261
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,916
-Get off of her!
-Gosh!

262
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,376
I'll talk to her for a minute.
Both of you, out.

263
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,711
Chief.

264
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,796
Please leave Ga-young alone.

265
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,089
Take her, sir. Hurry!

266
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,590
Hey, stay still.

267
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,467
-Chief, get her out of here!
-Hey!

268
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,760
For goodness' sake.

269
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,764
I knew

270
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,100
that we'd end up
having a fight like this one day.

271
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,877
Hey.

272
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,928
Yes, to the rooftop.

273
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,180
Hey, wait.

274
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,723
Hey!

275
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,908
I'm not trying to harm you, okay?

276
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,119
I'll give you all the money you want.

277
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,204
Just tell them that you don't know me.

278
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,875
Min-ah, think about all the times
that we spent together.

279
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,711
All you need to do is tell them
that you don't know me.

280
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,421
You...

281
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,031
Hey, are you out of your mind?

282
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,991
Shall I teach you a lesson?

283
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,244
Chief!

284
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,209
Hey, I found the victim
whom you guys had lost.

285
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,420
You guys should've taken care of it.
Why did you make me get involved?

286
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,429
I called them.

287
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,475
They need to know the truth too.

288
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,519
What is the truth?

289
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,189
He violated the Youth Protection Act,

290
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,857
and he's suspected of abducting
the victim.

291
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,525
Please arrest him immediately.

292
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,326
Yes.

293
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,703
Captain.

294
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,081
What should we do?

295
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,001
Sir?

296
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,215
Take Chief.

297
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,050
Take the witness too.

298
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,512
No one

299
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,390
can leave.

300
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,859
You can get up now.

301
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,782
Gosh.

302
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,951
That was pretty uncomfortable.

303
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,794
Ms. Kim, you can hear me, right?

304
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,549
You used to spend time with a certain man
every Monday, right?

305
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,223
It's okay, Ga-young.

306
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,060
All of these people are here
to protect you.

307
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,772
They're all good people,

308
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,692
so you can tell us the truth.

309
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,364
Is that man here now?

310
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,161
Can you please tell us if he is?

311
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,421
Hey, what are you guys doing now?

312
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,466
Why are you all standing around?
Take her and catch that killer!

313
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,345
Who is he?

314
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,021
For violating
the Youth Protection Act and abducting,

315
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,481
-Yun-soo.
-you're under arrest.

316
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,569
You have the right to remain silent,

317
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,904
and the right to an attorney.

318
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,242
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

319
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,286
-Hey!
-Chief, please.

320
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,878
Well, Lieutenant Han

321
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,464
asked us to avoid detaining you

322
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,550
in the holding cell
at Yongsan Police Station.

323
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,095
You'll be sent
to Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

324
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,013
Are you okay with that?

325
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,982
-My gosh, you're early.
-Sir.

326
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,318
Let's go in.

327
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,331
The best flower is the sakura.

328
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,166
The best man is the warrior.

329
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,098
The Director of the Defense Administration
must be very busy.

330
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,518
He'll be here soon.
He said the traffic is bad.

331
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,937
That's a big problem in Seoul.

332
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,939
There are too many cars.

333
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,317
Isn't it because you've been selling
too many cars, sir?

334
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,319
Is that right?

335
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,738
You think so?

336
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,125
Dad.

337
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:24,382
Dad, I put in a request
for a retrial today.

338
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,637
From objectives to reason,
I wrote everything concisely in detail.

339
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,889
I submitted the evidence too.

340
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,351
I'll prove that what the judiciary
of this country did to you three years ago

341
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,895
was wrong.

342
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,397
Winning a retrial isn't easy.

343
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,524
The Department of Justice

344
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,944
might say that the evidence is
insufficient to rule me not guilty

345
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,530
and it'll end right there.

346
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,616
It would mean the end of them if I win.

347
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,035
Will they admit that their initial verdict
was wrong that easily?

348
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,081
Nine out of ten retrial applications
get rejected.

349
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,334
Your case is different though.

350
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,919
The public opinion is in favor of you.

351
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,921
We have Tae-gyun Kim's statement as well.

352
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,007
The special investigation team practically
acquitted you during their briefing.

353
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,218
Dad, don't worry.

354
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,012
We have to take this chance
and push it through.

355
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,639
You trust me, right?

356
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,645
Sweet dreams, Dad.

357
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,863
I trust you, of course.

358
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,240
I have so much faith in you

359
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,787
that I'm worried you might end up
getting hurt because of this.

360
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,477
Gosh, where is it?

361
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,152
CHIEF OF YONGSAN POLICE STATION
WOO-GYUN KIM

362
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,534
Are you from the inspection team or what?

363
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,872
Don't you think you're out of line?

364
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,875
Hey.

365
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,461
Just get your job done properly, please.

366
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,176
Do you have nothing to do?

367
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,975
What are you looking for?

368
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,561
An external hard drive that has
the security camera footage.

369
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,564
Is it not there? That's odd.

370
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,359
You're probably captured in it.
There wouldn't really be anything else.

371
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,822
I'm sorry.

372
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,368
I had no idea Chief would do such a thing.

373
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,204
None of us could have known.

374
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,003
Did he throw it out already?

375
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,180
He's a chief of a police station.
Did you really have to do this?

376
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,766
If I hadn't, he would've gotten away.

377
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,436
He has a connection whose power
can even put a stop on his prosecution.

378
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,064
But still...

379
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,858
How can you steal the witness
and hide her from the police?

380
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,111
The police also have
the investigation authority.

381
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,946
If you keep that up,
they'll turn against us.

382
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,074
Then let's say

383
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,910
that you had an inappropriate relationship
with the victim.

384
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,120
If the police had evidence to prove it,

385
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,956
do you think they would let us
take the victim?

386
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,667
-They'd do the same thing.
-What did you say?

387
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,380
You little... How can you use that
as an example? How dare you.

388
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,759
You should have at least
reported it to me.

389
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,676
Do I really have to...

390
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,722
Gosh, you drive me nuts. Great timing.

391
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,850
Why are you staring at me? Answer it.

392
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,561
Yes, Lieutenant Han.

393
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,438
Right.

394
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,650
Okay, then I'll see you
at the hospital. All right.

395
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,569
My apologies.

396
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,155
I'll handle Chief Kim myself.

397
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,325
Also, don't try to take everyone down
through this.

398
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,953
Did you request an arrest warrant
for Chief of Division One?

399
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,789
Do I really have to hear about it
from the judge?

400
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,707
You're friends with him.

401
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,880
Is arresting him the only way?

402
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,715
He received bribes

403
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,926
from many people.

404
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,847
Take it easy.

405
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,181
Yes, sir.

406
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,110
Why did he have to bring Chief Kim here
and make me uncomfortable?

407
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,675
Excuse me. May I please use your phone?

408
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,151
Chang-jun, it's me.

409
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,736
I know where you are now.

410
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,321
Listen to me carefully.

411
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,239
You're already doomed.

412
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,700
Keep your mouth shut and fall alone.

413
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,287
If not, your family will be hurt.

414
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,855
Mom?

415
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,817
She's talking with your doctor
at the moment.

416
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,949
Do you want water?
No problem. Just a second.

417
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,877
What did the doctor say?

418
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,088
He keeps saying the same thing.

419
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,423
What happened with Chief Kim?

420
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,259
He's been arrested.

421
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,891
Gosh, it must've been a lot of work.

422
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,227
Had I known about it,
I would've helped you.

423
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,812
It's okay.

424
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,274
Someone will be here soon to take over,
so please just hold out tonight.

425
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,400
No problem.

426
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,986
We should get going.

427
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,530
Both Ga-young and her mom had a long day.

428
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,706
Today must've been stressful for you.

429
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,541
It must've been terrifying too.

430
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,503
You need to regain your memory
as soon as possible

431
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,214
to avoid having to go
through things like that again.

432
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,885
By any chance,

433
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,180
do you know this man?

434
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,315
You recognized Chief Kim.

435
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,067
You should be able to remember
this man too.

436
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,160
Try to remember him.

437
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,620
Only then can we ensure your safety.

438
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,543
Try to conjure up
whatever you can remember.

439
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,009
Anything would be helpful.

440
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,387
Please stop.

441
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,350
She had a severe convulsion
around here earlier.

442
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,561
She had a convulsion?

443
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,563
When she was hiding
in the underground parking lot.

444
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,899
I guess it was because she had never
left the ward before.

445
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,734
She did convulse.

446
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,283
Get some rest.
Thank you for everything today.

447
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,126
Zero.

448
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,801
What did you just say?

449
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,892
Zero.

450
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,812
Seven.

451
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,152
Zero and seven? As in numbers?

452
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:07,822
Ga-young.

453
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,201
I'm sorry to bother you,
but can you write them out here?

454
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,984
I'll stay here anyway,

455
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,111
so I'll ask her about it carefully
when she wakes up.

456
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,863
Let's do that.

457
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,949
Grilling her about it won't do any good.

458
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,087
-Bye.
-I'm cold.

459
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,339
You're cold?

460
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,926
Then, let me cover you.

461
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,402
Zero and seven. What do they mean?

462
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,863
Would it be a phone number or an address?

463
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,036
Zero and seven. Why did she see numbers?

464
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,371
What could they mean?

465
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,259
Something good must've happened.

466
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,719
Something good?

467
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,140
Don't you know that men usually drink
to forget their problems and worries?

468
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,976
Did something bad happen?
What's the matter?

469
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,104
Listen, Yeon-jae.

470
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,235
If you did something that I don't know
about, you'd better tell me now.

471
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,654
I can only sort it out if I know about it.

472
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,992
Well, you don't need to put on such
a serious face over something like that.

473
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,370
So you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

474
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,498
It must've been bothering you.

475
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,001
Did you tell Chang-jun
why I'm not allowed to leave the country?

476
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,921
There's no way you wouldn't know about it.

477
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,340
I heard you tried to kill that girl
because you were

478
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,175
blinded by jealousy.

479
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,346
I learned my lesson when I was growing up.
Why would I get jealous?

480
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,813
If people heard that, they'd assume
that I actually did something.

481
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,566
Dad, you're okay, aren't you?

482
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,735
-Me?
-I know that you're also

483
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,738
very concerned about that girl.

484
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,157
Of course I am.

485
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,286
If your husband's reputation gets ruined
because of that girl,

486
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,162
our loss will be immeasurable.

487
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,624
He has a long way to go to repay me
for that position.

488
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,505
It's what he wants too.

489
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,592
Do you think your husband has no ambition?

490
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,845
Good night.

491
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,729
She doesn't know anything
about her husband.

492
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,523
That's why he's been messing around...

493
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,278
Gosh.

494
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,427
Doesn't she look very different
from how she looked in the ward?

495
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,305
She's so young and pretty, isn't she?

496
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,692
Yeon-jae.

497
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,279
Yeon-jae...

498
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,740
Yeon-jae...

499
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,159
I'm sorry.

500
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,953
Sorry...

501
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,211
Tell me.

502
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,130
Why are you sorry?

503
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,301
How did you wrong me?

504
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:47,976
Don't say it.

505
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:05,160
The nurse kept it to herself because
she didn't want to get blamed for it,

506
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,870
but she felt that she had to bring it up.

507
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,457
Think about it. The ventilator
wouldn't get disconnected on its own.

508
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,044
It also matches Yeon-jae Lee's statement.

509
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,923
Are you saying
that someone tried to kill Ga-young?

510
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:23,137
Who could it be? Who was at the hospital
besides that gorgeous woman?

511
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,518
I'm certain that Yeon-jae Lee
saw someone at the ICU.

512
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,604
You should've just asked her
whom she saw there.

513
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,484
Well, I was asking her, "You took Ga-young
off the ventilator, didn't you?"

514
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,611
Then she started talking
about the security camera,

515
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,989
so I couldn't ask her
if she saw somebody there.

516
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,199
Right. She probably wanted
to tell you this.

517
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,868
"I didn't do it. It was someone else."

518
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,369
She wanted you to think that.

519
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,912
Exactly. It would've made me

520
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,957
look like I was thinking of her
as a witness, not a suspect.

521
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,834
She could have completely made it up.

522
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,545
You said that it looked like she knew
we couldn't check the footage.

523
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,137
Is something bothering you?

524
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,521
I bet you couldn't check it.

525
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,400
She said it because she knew who
got rid of the security camera footage.

526
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:22,404
There's no way he would've just left it
there. It's not like he's an amateur.

527
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,073
He's not an amateur?

528
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:28,160
I thought Sergeant Kim took
the entire external hard drive

529
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,954
in order to find Ga-young.

530
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:31,997
What are you saying?

531
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,292
Do you think Ms. Lee saw Sergeant Kim?

532
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,502
No.

533
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,089
As things stand now,
it must've been Chief Kim.

534
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,510
Gosh, I get that he's done
some crazy things,

535
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,554
-but there's no way he tried to kill...
-He sure isn't an amateur

536
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,348
and in his position,
he could get rid of her.

537
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,100
So they took the entire hard drive

538
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,978
not because they wanted to see
who took Ga-young,

539
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,023
but because he had to get rid of
the footage that shows him.

540
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,192
Exactly. There's no security camera
inside the ICU.

541
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,987
The footage wouldn't show what he did
in there, but it must show him entering.

542
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,656
He obviously had to get rid of it.

543
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,201
Had it been because of Ga-young
being gone,

544
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,994
even a copy of the footage
would've been enough.

545
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,539
The same goes for Ms. Lee though.

546
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,875
Had it been the case, would Sergeant Kim
have taken the original footage?

547
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,343
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

548
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,513
Why are you so out to get the police?

549
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,599
We should have investigated
Dong-jae Seo first to be fair.

550
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,893
The fact that he hid Ga-young's phone
is even more suspicious.

551
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,145
You prosecutors are the ones
who were bribed.

552
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,189
Why are you only after us?

553
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,899
Well, even just today, your chief...

554
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,985
That doesn't mean he tried to kill her.

555
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,280
You two also came up with the idea
of telling the media that Kyung-wan

556
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,990
was physically abused at our station.

557
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,241
That was me.

558
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,910
I'm the one who tipped them off.

559
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,122
Gosh, unbelievable.

560
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,125
Lieutenant Han, you're really out of line.

561
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,004
Go ahead and gather intel on me too.
See what you find out.

562
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,673
Wait, Detective Jang.

563
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,554
It's only logical to be suspicious
of the person who needed to shut her up.

564
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,014
Why is he getting so worked up?

565
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,773
I need to ask you for a favor.

566
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,152
I'm not asking you to steal it
or to delete the file for me.

567
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,487
Please. Just get me a copy.

568
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,158
YOUR E-MAIL HAS BEEN SENT SUCCESSFULLY.

569
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:32,993
Yes, sir.

570
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,287
I just e-mailed it to you.

571
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,749
Great. No one will be affected by this.

572
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,876
Thank you, Geon.

573
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,463
I honestly have no idea what's going on.

574
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,643
Zero, seven.

575
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,649
Zero, seven.

576
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,696
Zero, seven.

577
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,952
Zero, seven, zero, seven...

578
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,761
Zero, seven.

579
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,850
Ga-young

580
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,853
Did she say anything else after we left?

581
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,272
She fell asleep right after you all left.

582
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,485
I think she said something about
feeling damp because she sweated a lot.

583
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,362
She didn't say anything else.

584
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,323
All right. Thank you for staying with her.

585
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,416
Damp? She also said she was cold.

586
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,626
Damp?

587
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,254
I'm cold.

588
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,923
You're cold?

589
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,133
Then, let me cover you.

590
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,219
Why didn't she want to be covered
with the blanket if she was cold?

591
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:29,025
Did she really feel cold
at that temperature?

592
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,737
PROSECUTOR DONG-JAE SEO

593
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,075
Hello?

594
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,332
Okay, I'll see you at work tomorrow.

595
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,139
I'm cold.

596
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,432
Cold.

597
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,517
She said something about feeling damp...

598
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,186
Damp.

599
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,230
Damp?

600
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:25,081
AUTHORIZATION FOR VEHICLE EXCHANGE

601
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,462
Thank you for participating
in our vehicle exchange program.

602
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,340
This is a used car. Are you sure
I can get it exchanged with a new one?

603
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,134
Of course. We'll exchange it for you.
Please take this.

604
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,720
There isn't any problem with it.

605
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,180
I just got a new job.

606
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,349
Oh, really? Congratulations, sir.

607
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,059
-I should get going.
-Okay.

608
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,352
Goodbye.

609
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,162
I heard you scored big time yesterday.

610
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,122
How's the girl?
Is she fully conscious now?

611
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,332
Who's the culprit?

612
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,291
Word travels fast.

613
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,211
I'm a prosecutor
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

614
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,714
Of course I'd know
about what's going on at our office.

615
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,925
Well, today is my last day though.

616
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,386
Are you going somewhere?

617
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,222
-You can't go far away.
-I'm sorry.

618
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,808
I'm going to a faraway place
in the high ground.

619
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,768
I'm going to the Blue House.

620
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,896
Mr. Lee hired me himself.

621
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,024
Why did you want to meet up today?

622
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,613
Chairman Lee is up to something.

623
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,909
A four-way meeting at a palace.

624
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,037
Mr. Lee and Yun-beom Lee.

625
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,539
My gosh, you're early.

626
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,999
Who were the other two?

627
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,251
One was Chairman Cho of The Bahn Group.

628
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,335
The other one was...

629
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,922
Gosh, I never even thought about it.

630
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,591
First off,

631
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,968
withdraw the warrant against me.

632
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,345
You have nothing to lose here.

633
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,808
Don't you think Hanjo would be suspicious
of you if it gets withdrawn suddenly?

634
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,394
-If you keep that up...
-Well,

635
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,981
I guess they won't let you
get arrested if they really need you.

636
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,404
Are you just leaving now?

637
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,031
You'll regret it.

638
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,663
The Minister of National Defense?

639
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,128
Who's that jerk?

640
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,966
Hanjo Group and the Minister
of National Defense have joined hands.

641
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,301
Chairman Cho of The Bahn Group too.

642
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,388
Isn't it refreshing?

643
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,769
Hanjo and The Bahn?

644
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,938
Then, it must've been about that.

645
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,402
LOOTED CULTURAL ASSETS FINALLY TO BE
RETURNED AFTER MARATHON NEGOTIATIONS

646
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,742
Matsuyama is part of it too.
Was it a five-way meeting, then?

647
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,125
MATSUYAMA TO RETURN ASSETS
THROUGH CHIEF SECRETARY'S MEDIATION

648
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,881
Gosh, I'm realizing that I witnessed
all of the key points.

649
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,925
Please find out other key points as well.

650
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,302
Things about Mr. Lee and Moo-sung Park
would be great.

651
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,722
Hey, you know that I can't really
bring up Moo-sung Park to him.

652
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,058
Are you no longer suspicious of him?

653
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,270
You thought that your ex-boss
was the killer.

654
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,272
Now, you have to serve him again.

655
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,650
Don't you want to know?

656
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,637
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

657
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,264
It's an honor to serve you again, sir.

658
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,146
You thought that your ex-boss
was the killer.

659
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,898
Now, you have to serve him again.

660
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,445
Sir, by the way...

661
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,198
Ga-young Kim has regained
her consciousness.

662
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,203
I apologize. I should've been the first
to find out and let you know about it.

663
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,956
What should I do?

664
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,209
-Will this be okay?
-Pardon me?

665
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,379
You said that you tried to protect her
because you thought I might harm her.

666
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,925
Aren't you putting her in danger
by telling me that she woke up?

667
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,639
Sir, Si-mok made that up.

668
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,477
However, it was my fault
that I let him tell you such a lie.

669
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,728
I sincerely apologize.

670
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,453
That was pointless.

671
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,081
Prosecutor Eun-soo Young is
at the main gate.

672
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,999
She said she's supposed to meet with you.

673
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,751
Eun-soo Young?

674
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,045
Tell her to wait for me in the lobby.

675
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,340
You can let her in.
Please tell her to go to the lobby.

676
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,343
-Sorry?
-What brings her here?

677
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,097
Hey! Wait.

678
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,932
Hey, Eun-soo!

679
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,063
Come with me. You can't come in here!

680
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,065
It was your doing, wasn't it?

681
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,193
Be respectful.

682
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,156
You rejected our request for a retrial,

683
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,700
didn't you?

684
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,163
The retrial request
for my father's bribery case

685
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,749
has been denied.

686
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,675
Why are you complaining here?
You should go to the judicial branch.

687
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,892
I didn't even know about it.

688
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,355
I think that the judiciary of this country

689
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,482
has given up the opportunity to apologize

690
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,402
for what it did three years ago
to a former Minister of Justice

691
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,863
who was also
a highly respected judicial officer,

692
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,490
because of someone in power.

693
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,082
Having the power

694
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,544
to ruin someone's life
with just a few words must be feeding you

695
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,338
with delusional thoughts
that you've become almighty,

696
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:49,966
but you won't win.

697
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,096
You think so?

698
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,819
Eun-soo, get out.

699
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:11,798
Yes, sir.

700
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,887
He said you're being too loud.

701
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,589
Chairman Lee is here.

702
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:36,924
I'll do it.

703
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,392
It looks pretty good.

704
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,686
You've been here before.

705
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,105
It feels different
now that it has become ours.

706
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:55,193
You know how much work I had to do
to make this office ours.

707
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,071
-It's like your house now.
-Yes, sir.

708
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,532
Why is he here?

709
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,785
Oh, it's...

710
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,589
My apologies, sir. I haven't been
acquainted with my new job yet.

711
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,071
-You checked the office thoroughly, right?
-Yes.

712
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,658
I've been hearing about rats
that plant bugs and wiretaps.

713
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,369
-Get your office checked regularly too.
-Okay.

714
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,287
Father.

715
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,499
Please don't be like that,
Mr. Chief Secretary.

716
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,543
Have a seat.

717
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,548
All right.

718
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,468
Now that we've achieved
an advancement in weaponry,

719
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,888
I think that we should seek
advancement in finance.

720
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,269
I guess you've already taken care
of everything with Ukraine.

721
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,897
You know that I'm a man of my word.
Now, we just need to import it.

722
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:19,026
After that, we'll swap the document
with the one from Ukraine.

723
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:22,572
The Ministry of National Defense knows
to choose that company.

724
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,284
It's a blessing that importing weapons
is considered a military secret.

725
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,077
It's automatically kept confidential.

726
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,747
A real blessing is this.

727
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,332
The fact that Korea is a divided country.

728
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,127
For weapons and everything else,
people in this country

729
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,629
only want the most advanced
and expensive products.

730
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,507
They say no
to well-priced, sturdy products.

731
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,136
Look at Matsuyama.

732
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:48,389
They know our defense industry
like their back of their hand.

733
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:52,143
We couldn't import weapons from Japan
until the current administration.

734
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,188
Since when did they
start preparing for it?

735
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,857
Gosh, Japanese people...

736
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,817
They're so impressive.

737
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,738
The fact that a company like that

738
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,157
approached you before anyone else

739
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,617
proves how influential you are.

740
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,287
That doesn't mean anything.

741
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,665
Take the Director
of Defense Administration for example.

742
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,752
No one is even against the offer
to make Japanese weapons

743
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,545
look like European-made ones.

744
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:24,383
The weapons they bought
for trillions of won don't even work.

745
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,385
No wonder why.

746
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,932
In that regard,
you've made a great accomplishment.

747
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,060
I did nothing but just sit there.

748
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,020
Just your presence there must have been

749
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,482
a big pressure on the Ministry of National
Defense and Defense Administration.

750
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,945
Matsuyama is the best even in Japan.

751
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,781
No one can stop the corruption
in the defense industry.

752
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,825
If that's the case,

753
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,702
ensuring the best possible results
is what we can do

754
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,162
for our nation.

755
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,707
You and I have enabled

756
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,252
this country's defense system

757
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,671
to take a major step forward.

758
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,424
Thank you for the opportunity, Father.

759
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,719
You did everything.

760
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,390
I didn't really do anything.

761
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,735
Your face has gotten chubby
from being at the hospital all the time.

762
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,362
What? I think she's lost weight.

763
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:27,530
Really? Do I look chubby?

764
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,240
-Jung-bon.
-Yes?

765
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,617
The looted cultural assets
which were on the morning news...

766
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,537
Find out if there are any NGOs
that know how they got returned.

767
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,664
Do they have anything to do
with our investigation?

768
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,458
Also, collect whatever information

769
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,044
you can find on Matsuyama Group.

770
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:45,339
-Ms. Choi, please translate the documents.
-Sure.

771
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,092
Oh, you must be good
at Japanese, Ms. Choi.

772
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,720
Moo-sung Park acted as a broker

773
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,139
to these companies and connected them
with public officials.

774
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,808
I'll visit every company
on this list today.

775
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,226
-Sure, go ahead.
-Great.

776
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,312
I'll execute the warrant today.

777
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,023
-Good. Please take good care of it.
-See you all later.

778
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,149
-See you.
-See you.

779
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,400
-Bye.
-Have a good day.

780
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:10,698
I'll stop by Huam-dong first,
then head over to Hannam-dong.

781
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,118
Huam-dong? Are you going
to Moo-sung Park's house? What for?

782
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,289
As we were leaving the hospital yesterday,
Ga-young said

783
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,083
that she was cold.
Do you remember that by any chance?

784
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:25,880
I'm cold.

785
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,298
You're cold?

786
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:30,635
But when Ms. Choi tried to pull up
the blanket for her,

787
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:31,969
she pushed it back down.

788
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,389
It's possible that she wasn't talking
about feeling cold at that moment.

789
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,308
Do you think so?

790
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,021
Then how about when she was talking
about feeling damp,

791
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,774
which I mentioned to you.
Could it also have been...

792
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,276
Were her bed sheets actually wet?

793
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,738
I checked her sheets to see
if I should change them for her,

794
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,366
but they weren't wet.

795
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:57,620
Cold and damp.

796
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:05,002
She was hiding in the underground
parking lot at the hospital, right?

797
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:08,839
-Yes.
-Right, that's where she convulsed.

798
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,257
See you later.

799
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,354
So where are we going now?

800
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,856
To a cold and damp place.

801
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,089
STRANGER

802
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,216
Why didn't he do it
the day he abducted her?

803
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,303
-Because Ga-young would've died if he did.
-So, did he want her alive?

804
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,181
You must be here to ask her
if Chang-jun Lee is the culprit.

805
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,850
You must be here to confirm that
he is not. You work for him after all.

806
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:43,934
Have you seen this man?

807
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,645
Did you and the person you met
at the ICU make a promise

808
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:47,938
to pretend you two never met?

809
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,483
I don't need any deals.

810
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,359
I'll have to summon you as a suspect.

811
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,487
Young people these days are fearless.

812
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,406
I will never stand before you
as a defendant.

813
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,284
That must mean I'm headed in
the right direction.

814
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,121
