1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,344
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,308
This is the first time in ten years that
the head was appointed from our division.

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,895
Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor Lee.

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,690
-Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor Lee.
-Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor Lee.

6
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,323
You know that I'm aiming
for the Chief Prosecutor badge, right?

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,910
That vacant post will be mine.

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,455
It's 99 percent confirmed.

9
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,052
Thanks, all of you!

10
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,975
From this moment,
many people will congratulate me.

11
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,435
However, this very moment

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,355
I'm standing before all of you
in Criminal Division Three,

13
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,690
where I embarked on my path
as an officer of the law,

14
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,777
will be remembered for the longest time.

15
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,031
Nothing will change,
for both myself and all of you.

16
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,825
We just need to remember this.

17
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,452
Equality before the law.

18
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,914
The law does not flatter the privileged.

19
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,874
Be unbending in your morals

20
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,711
like a straight line of ink
that never gets bent.

21
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,756
Equality before the law! Be unbending!

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,550
We won't forget it!

23
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,398
Justice.

24
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,984
Ambition.

25
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,027
Greed.

26
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,613
Sin.

27
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,919
What kind of hand would this be?

28
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,968
If I could see

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,804
what this hand has done...

30
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,520
-Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor Lee.
-Thank you.

31
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,231
This is Mr. Yoon from Case Management.

32
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,692
I introduced him to you the other day
as my fellow alumnus.

33
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,860
Right.

34
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,528
Hello.

35
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,823
Speaking of which, we should
organize an alumni reunion.

36
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,284
Eun-soo, you should let everyone know.

37
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,911
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,623
Are you skipping again?

39
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,751
I'll be there, sir.

40
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,546
All right. We should get back to work.

41
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,094
-You guys.
-My apologies.

42
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,306
I will advise them well so that
they don't ruin this special day.

43
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,103
-I apologize.
-I apologize.

44
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,150
I apologize, Mr...
I mean, Chief Prosecutor Lee.

45
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,529
I got a bit worked up as they handled
something in an inexperienced manner.

46
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,530
I'll be careful.

47
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,157
Behave yourselves.

48
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,751
Do you guys have that much time
on your hands? Shall I give you more work?

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,711
-My apologies, sir.
-I apologize, sir.

50
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,088
Get back to work!

51
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,828
Chief Prosecutor...

52
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,997
Why did you try to cut off your right arm?

53
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,084
Only then, a fresh arm
will grow in its place.

54
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,379
Unless Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
gets emptied out,

55
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,965
I'll always have a right arm.

56
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,746
POWER OFF

57
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,656
Call all golf courses across the country

58
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,160
and see if there was a reservation made
two days ago under Nam-jin Kim

59
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,912
whether it's a fake name or not.

60
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,205
-All golf courses?
-That's right.

61
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,748
You know how things have been lately.

62
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,751
None of them would want to share
the list with us. How can we justify...

63
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,754
I need the information,
and that's more than enough reason.

64
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,422
Sure, I got it.

65
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,418
ON OFFICIAL DUTY

66
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,928
He left.

67
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,145
Oh gosh! He came down so fast.

68
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,860
Okay, I got it.

69
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,904
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR
CHANG-JUN LEE

70
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,616
I'd like to start packing
if you're okay with it, sir.

71
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,992
Sure.

72
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,705
Do you have a pair of scissors?

73
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,728
Everything started from that meal.

74
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,318
-Are you expecting someone?
-A friend of mine.

75
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,445
He's in the area.
He wants to stop by and say hi.

76
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,239
We'll leave soon though.

77
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,908
-Oh, there he is. Hey, I'm here.
-My gosh.

78
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,452
-It's so nice to see you.
-Likewise.

79
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,623
-It's nice to meet you.
-Same here.

80
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,051
An ordinary meal that happens every day.

81
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,304
He wasn't bribing us.
He treated us with good intentions.

82
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,515
We could've taken turns too.

83
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,686
I just didn't happen
to pay for the meal that day.

84
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,064
But that one meal

85
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,233
and a glass of drink he treated me to

86
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,654
prohibited me from saying no right away
when he asked to meet again.

87
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,785
DEPARTMENT CHIEF, DIVISION THREE
PROSECUTOR CHANG-JUN LEE

88
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,795
CASE REPORT

89
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,805
VICTIM SERIOUSLY INJURED

90
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:03,477
MOO-SUNG PARK,
SUSPECT OF A DUI HIT-AND-RUN

91
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,021
LACK OF EVIDENCE

92
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,818
When you meet someone new,
that person gets added into your network.

93
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,322
When you're a low man on the ladder,
having connections means power.

94
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,990
But at one point, they become
your weakness.

95
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,659
And when you move further up...

96
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,785
DONG-JAE SEO

97
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,245
You'd want to hide them.

98
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,689
You have to make sure you never get
your foot in there from the get-go.

99
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,484
If you want to pull yourself out
in the end,

100
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,028
you must pay a price.

101
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,697
Then...

102
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,742
Even if that's the case...

103
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,285
Let's wrap up.

104
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,248
I'll gladly...

105
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,751
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR
CHANG-JUN LEE

106
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,671
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
CHANG-JUN LEE

107
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,028
I want stockholding details of those
who are division chiefs or higher.

108
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,241
Not the ones they reported to
the ethics committee. Do a full search.

109
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,953
Especially for those who are in charge
of tax crime in Criminal Division Four,

110
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,747
include all prosecutors
as well as investigators.

111
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,582
Yes, sir.

112
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,886
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
CHANG-JUN LEE

113
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,316
Other chief prosecutors
would probably be fond of him.

114
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,072
He graduated the institution five years
after everyone else did. How refreshing.

115
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,825
It might not be a bad thing for you.

116
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,412
He wouldn't want someone
who's more senior as his deputy.

117
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,205
He'd definitely prefer someone
who's his junior.

118
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,499
He doesn't have to make me his deputy.

119
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,418
I just hope he can stay
in the position long enough.

120
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,339
Well, I know that he's a very capable man.

121
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,925
Frankly, his connections have put him
at a disadvantage so far.

122
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,636
Higher offices didn't take him
because they didn't want

123
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,180
to be linked with business tycoons.

124
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,935
I just hope he doesn't change
to please the ruling party.

125
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,481
He'd never do that.
I mean, it's not like he lacks anything.

126
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,566
What's going on with Si-mok?

127
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,070
-I haven't found much.
-Nothing out of ordinary?

128
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,616
His mother is a teacher.
Everything looks pretty normal.

129
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,734
Why is he back in Huam-dong?

130
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,884
He's searching here and there.

131
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,804
Now, he's in the master bedroom.
He must be looking for something.

132
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,766
He's not looking thoroughly at all.

133
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,351
Is he looking for something big?

134
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,520
Something big?

135
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,259
What? I don't see anything in his hands.

136
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,053
I guess he didn't find it?

137
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,130
Did I see it wrong?

138
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,425
What? Did you see someone?

139
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,010
No.

140
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,099
Were you at the scene?

141
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,959
Freeze!

142
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,879
Don't move.

143
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,637
Put that down.

144
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,474
I said, put it down.

145
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,310
Are you going to shoot me?

146
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,103
Put it down and step back.

147
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,981
I'll count to three.

148
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,150
One.

149
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,361
Two.

150
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,698
Three.

151
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,738
Gosh, I'm trying to quit smoking.

152
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,873
What were you doing?

153
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,545
Did you tail me?

154
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,588
Who put you up to this?

155
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,884
What is it? Do I look like a joke to you
because I don't have a gun?

156
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,886
Answer me!

157
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,182
Is everything okay there?

158
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,520
Don't worry. Just go on your way, okay?

159
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,277
Who told you to do this?

160
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,282
No one. I'm sorry.

161
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,449
I apologize.

162
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,662
Spending time with Si-mok
must've made you fearless.

163
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,711
What are you looking at? What will you do?

164
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,507
How dare a police officer

165
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,428
threaten a prosecutor with a gun?

166
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,097
Are you dying to get fired or what?

167
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,433
Shall I talk to your chief
and get you fired?

168
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,351
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,312
I sincerely apologize.

170
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,108
This will never happen again.
Please forgive me, sir.

171
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,960
Pick them up.

172
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,802
I'm so scared of cops that
I don't think I can try to quit smoking.

173
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,309
Gosh, I didn't know Han River has
the ebb tide.

174
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,648
Goodness, the wind here is so strong.

175
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,026
I feel so bad for myself
that I have to be doing this.

176
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,446
Because it's so pointless?

177
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,830
No, it's not.

178
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,791
It must be somewhere here.
I'm sure it hasn't drifted away yet.

179
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,671
I asked you to capture him red-handed
when he tried to destroy the evidence.

180
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,382
Had I only needed the phone,

181
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,427
I wouldn't have needed to ask
Detective Jang to tail him as well.

182
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,429
We were going to catch him red-handed.

183
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,348
I let him get away.
Lieutenant Han didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,391
That son of a...

185
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,102
Gosh, damn it.

186
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,901
I would've punched him
if I wasn't undercover.

187
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,653
Why that...

188
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,782
Damn it.

189
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,629
What?

190
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,007
What's he...

191
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,741
He prodded her and hit her with it
in broad daylight.

192
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,868
He was so harsh on her
even though people were watching.

193
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,996
Had you seen it,
your blood must have boiled too.

194
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,208
My blood was obviously boiling.

195
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:42,003
I had to hold back my anger
and try so hard to look intimidated.

196
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,715
But that man over there
doesn't even care about those things.

197
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,972
Where can I buy one of those?

198
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,227
It stinks here. You should stay away.

199
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:02,149
Oh, right. Ga-young's phone was turned on
briefly earlier in the day.

200
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,317
Where was it?

201
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,113
It was only on for a few seconds,
so I couldn't track its location.

202
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,199
But the signal was detected
around 1:30 p.m.

203
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,326
Did you say 1:30 p.m.?

204
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,370
Did you do it together?

205
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,998
It was right after he figured out
we went through his office.

206
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,126
The fact that he turned the phone on
knowing you went through his room...

207
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,711
-What?
-Gosh!

208
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,758
Gosh, what is this?

209
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,303
Goodness.

210
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,263
It means he must have

211
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,724
had to delete something on her phone.

212
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,392
Something that would work against him.

213
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,603
He must've kept it because he didn't know
the password.

214
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,938
I bet he threw it out
only because we were after him.

215
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,691
What do you think he was trying to delete?

216
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,821
Even Forensics won't be able to do
anything if it's underwater for too long.

217
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,115
My goodness.

218
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,952
Did you get it?

219
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,498
Hang on a second.

220
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,673
Hurry.

221
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,675
Here. Here it is.

222
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,845
He must've destroyed it
before throwing it into the water.

223
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,222
Gosh, it's freezing.

224
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,515
-Let's go eat something warm.
-Okay.

225
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,729
What are you trying to do?

226
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,524
That could be just garbage

227
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,984
that someone else discarded here.

228
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,490
The water is still cold.

229
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,283
I know.

230
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,371
-For goodness' sake.
-Gosh, let's just go.

231
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,705
Gosh, seriously.

232
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,710
Tell them that this is very urgent.
Goodness. What is wrong with him?

233
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,629
-You two are really...
-Gosh.

234
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,297
Are you guys seriously...

235
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,093
See you guys
at the barbecue restaurant later.

236
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,099
Goodness, don't hunch down like that.

237
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,767
It doesn't suit you.

238
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,356
Are you mad at me? You seem angry.

239
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,233
Are you angry?

240
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,027
-No, I'm not.
-Really? You look angry.

241
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,571
I think you're mad at me.
I can tell from your face.

242
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,449
You're mad at me, right?
Look. This is the face you made.

243
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,744
Gosh. You did this, then this.

244
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,707
Look. You looked like this.

245
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,002
Doesn't it look exactly like you?

246
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,462
Take it. It's a gift.

247
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,868
Yes, Sergeant.

248
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,163
Hello, I just got a call
from the wireless service provider.

249
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,874
They said Ga-young Kim's phone
was turned on for a few seconds.

250
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,958
Where was it?

251
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,005
It was only on for about ten seconds,
but the culprit must've turned it on.

252
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,674
I don't know where he's hiding,
but if he turns it on once again,

253
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,468
I'll be sure to catch him.

254
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,429
All right. Have a good day.

255
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:27,145
Mr. Seo, I found out where Mr. Nam-jin Kim
is playing golf.

256
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,900
Mr. Hwang.

257
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,072
Where are you coming from?

258
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,369
-There's something I want to ask you.
-Ask me tomorrow.

259
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,539
I have to do it tonight.

260
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,589
Teach me.

261
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,508
Please?

262
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,953
So what is it?

263
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,540
Thank you for today.

264
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,793
What is it that you have to finish today?

265
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,254
Why did you do it?

266
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,507
When Mr. Seo was dragging me
like that earlier,

267
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,301
why did you stop him?

268
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:23,928
See you tomorrow.

269
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,101
Because you were worried about me?

270
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,896
-No.
-Because it bothered you?

271
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,400
No.

272
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,822
See? You hate it
even when I just touch you.

273
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,367
Why did you get involved?
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

274
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,704
Didn't you get involved intentionally
to let him know that it was

275
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,122
your idea to go through his office?

276
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,707
Yes.

277
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,129
Whose phone is it?

278
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,550
He threw it into the river, didn't he?
That must be why you got soaked.

279
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,719
Whose is it?

280
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,471
You must know the answer.

281
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,932
Is it the girl's? Ga-young Kim?

282
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,855
What you said must apply to him too.

283
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,398
What did I say?

284
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,901
You said the culprit hung the girl
like that as a warning.

285
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,861
To punish Mr. Lee.

286
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,989
After hearing what you said,

287
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,493
I've been thinking about who could
possibly punish Chief Prosecutor...

288
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,537
Someone must've come to your mind.

289
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,540
Somebody who fits the bill perfectly.

290
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,792
Yun-beom Lee would be perfect.

291
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,842
Everyone told me
that Mr. Seo is Mr. Lee's person,

292
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,635
but I didn't think it was the case.

293
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,721
Hence, I didn't think such a warning would
be necessary between the two of them.

294
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:54,477
When you first met them, they were
already starting to grow apart.

295
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,730
Mr. Seo isn't the type
to let people ostracize him

296
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,275
especially after having
that kind of fun together.

297
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,902
And you're not the type to give up.

298
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,197
Are you still suspicious of me?

299
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,783
When there's someone who hid
the victim's belonging?

300
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,661
What if she dropped her phone
while she was getting abducted

301
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,454
and he just happened to find it?

302
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,164
If I were the culprit,

303
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,792
the possibility that he might have
seen something

304
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,294
would drive me crazy.

305
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,214
And I'd try to find out about it
at all costs.

306
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,095
Coming to a guy's house at this hour

307
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,096
must be nothing.

308
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,895
What are you talking about? It's you.

309
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,273
Even things that would hurt my pride
if I'm with other guys

310
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,318
and that would make me worry
about having to see them again

311
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,820
aren't a problem with you.

312
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,033
No matter what I do here,

313
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,035
you wouldn't be interested at all.

314
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,208
Leave if you have no more questions.

315
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,714
Aren't I right?

316
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,057
Why do you think
that I wouldn't know anything?

317
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,809
Pardon me?

318
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:21,773
Leave now.

319
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,539
If I tell you that knowing
you can perceive such things

320
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,252
made me a bit happy,
would I sound too selfish?

321
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,715
Don't work too late.

322
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,854
How can the phone at ICU
stay busy this long?

323
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,241
NEW MESSAGE

324
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,818
She's been getting
severe convulsions today.

325
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,126
Excuse me. Are you her guardian?

326
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,676
Yes.

327
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,596
It's nothing serious.

328
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,807
The patient has been moving a lot today.

329
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,572
Over there, it's...

330
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,117
Catch him!

331
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,535
Hey!

332
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,037
Hey!

333
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,539
-Stop!
-Hey!

334
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:36,999
-Hey!
-Stop!

335
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,527
You prick.

336
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,635
Let's go.

337
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,225
Stay still.

338
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,025
Shall I go?

339
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,863
No, I'll go.

340
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,481
You're from a small town
in the middle of nowhere.

341
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,358
My hometown, Gimcheon, is a city.
City of Gimcheon.

342
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,235
Gimcheon, my foot.

343
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,489
Hey, there wasn't even a direct bus route
from your place to Gimcheon.

344
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,282
What? What are you talking about?

345
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,534
My dad used to drive me there
all the time.

346
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,994
God, this prick.

347
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,749
DONG-JAE SEO

348
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,753
What is it? It's getting late.

349
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,965
Now?

350
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,928
Tell him to come in.

351
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,263
All right, come in.

352
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,352
Shall we go to my study?

353
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,290
You're here too, Mr. Kim.

354
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,875
That's actually great.

355
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,877
Why are you talking
about a two-star commander?

356
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,630
I told you

357
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,550
that I'd make sure you wouldn't
have anything to worry about.

358
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,592
Mr. Lee.

359
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,844
Now, we have nothing to worry about.

360
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,431
It'll be done soon.
I'll put an end to it at one blow.

361
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,644
I have nailed down a suspect.

362
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,021
It's Mr. Park's son.

363
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,482
What are you talking about?

364
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,735
He was at the army post.
We already confirmed it.

365
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,030
No, Kyung-wan Park did go out
and slept elsewhere that night.

366
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,615
The most important thing is that

367
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,618
there's no one who can prove his alibi

368
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,288
from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. that night.

369
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,751
Are you saying that the military division

370
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,920
altered the records for a mere soldier?

371
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,881
Not really for him. The division commander
must've told them to do it.

372
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,134
Mr. Lee, do you remember?

373
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,803
Mr. Park used to tell us all the time

374
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,430
that his son doesn't have to study

375
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,057
and that he can go to
whichever university he wants

376
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,767
as he's been playing golf
since he was a kid.

377
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,021
He got into university with golf.

378
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,231
Do you think military high-ups
would've left him alone?

379
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,983
Hold on a second.

380
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,152
The report said he was
in charge of driving trucks.

381
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,572
Who would assign a driver with less than
two years' experience with such a task?

382
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,241
His main duty was teaching them golf.

383
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,162
They basically used him
as their personal golf instructor.

384
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,791
They must've picked him as a driver
to take him to golf courses.

385
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,420
I checked the house in Huam-dong,
and there were no golf clubs.

386
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,671
He's a golf major though.

387
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,423
It means he took them to the army.

388
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,801
Right, those in the military wouldn't have
bought golf clubs for him.

389
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,680
The most important thing is
the fact that he was alone

390
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,475
and not at the barracks
from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. two days ago.

391
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,602
-At the time of the incident?
-Alone?

392
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,854
Then why does the report say otherwise?

393
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,189
In the afternoon that day,

394
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,817
the division commander,
Nam-jin Kim, played golf.

395
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,569
It was at 4:30 p.m.

396
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,238
It was during his work hours.

397
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,407
I checked with the people
at the golf course.

398
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,534
The tee-off time was 4:30 p.m.

399
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,204
Then they went to a blowfish restaurant
around 9:00 p.m.

400
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,331
They drank there until 1:00 a.m.

401
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,750
This is the restaurant's parking lot.

402
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,254
SONGIL RESTAURANT

403
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,300
Kyung-wan Park just had dinner
with them and waited

404
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,135
-in the division commander's car.
-Come often.

405
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,389
-I really enjoyed the food.
-I hope to see you again.

406
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,015
-Of course. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

407
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,642
Did anyone see him waiting inside the car?

408
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,562
She said it was probably
just before or after 10 p.m.

409
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,024
Even if he came back right away
to pick him up when they were done,

410
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,026
nobody saw him

411
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,362
for about three and a half hours
until then.

412
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,030
Where is this place?

413
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,657
Near Gonjiam.

414
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,119
If it's near Gonjiam...
Do you think he used that car

415
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,453
to go to Huam-dong?

416
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,247
What about its dashboard camera?

417
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,290
He must've deleted all the footage.

418
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:16,171
He should've been discharged
a long time ago for financial difficulty.

419
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,549
The division commander must've kept him
because of golf

420
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,260
and let him go after the second case
broke out.

421
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,055
I bet he couldn't hang back
when the police were asking for an alibi.

422
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,473
He must've deleted the footage first.

423
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,892
How can a division commander do that?

424
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,397
They're all circumstantial evidence
though.

425
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,608
She was abducted the day before
the incident. Any alibi for that time?

426
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:41,905
That time... The report does say
that he was at the barracks.

427
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,407
But who would believe it now?

428
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,325
My records show the same thing,

429
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,870
but I actually tutored high-ups' kids
every night at their homes.

430
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,955
We should also see
if there was an accomplice.

431
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,002
We cannot touch a two-star commander

432
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,129
based on our speculation alone.
It's too risky.

433
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,839
No.

434
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,966
We'll have a story.

435
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,926
That girl has a pretty face, you know.

436
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,221
That's what I heard.

437
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,724
It's possible that Kyung-wan Park
had a crush on her.

438
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,435
But his dad got her into prostitution.

439
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,562
The media would be all over
a story like that.

440
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,523
It'll become the target
of public criticism.

441
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,360
For us to do this, we'd have to summon
a military general.

442
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,112
Please give me your permission.

443
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,287
It could turn into a full-out war
with the military.

444
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,414
We can't do it without a powerful spear.

445
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,586
A spear that can pierce any shield.

446
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,963
Is that what you want?

447
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,091
I have it here.

448
00:46:56,188 --> 00:47:00,317
PROSECUTOR
DONG-JAE SEO

449
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,989
My gosh, look who's here.

450
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,076
You obviously barked up the wrong tree.

451
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,956
Being suspicious of anyone
and everyone is an illness.

452
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,874
You need to cure it.

453
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,253
I also happen to know how to cure it.

454
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,786
-There he is!
-He's coming out.

455
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,998
-Move out of the way.
-Please step aside!

456
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,583
-Please move aside.
-Move.

457
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,836
-Please step back.
-Please say a few words.

458
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,170
Please say a few words.

459
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,464
Please tell us how you feel
to be summoned by the prosecution.

460
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,383
I will tell them the truth

461
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,510
and earnestly cooperate
with their investigation.

462
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,679
Do you admit it happened
during your work hours?

463
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,389
Did you help the suspect
fabricate his alibi?

464
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,141
I will tell the prosecution the truth

465
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,769
and earnestly cooperate
with their investigation.

466
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,396
What is the truth?

467
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,400
This is the truth.

468
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,694
THE PROSECUTION EXPOSES
MILITARY OFFICIALS' NEGLECT OF DUTY.

469
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,321
We went to the golf course
at around 3 p.m.

470
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,532
Private Park drove as usual.
He was like our golf instructor, you know.

471
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,951
I wasn't the only one who was there.

472
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,872
It was already planned.
I had no choice but to be there.

473
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:41,126
To tell you the truth,
I didn't see Private Park at dinner.

474
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,298
What you just heard is the naked truth
of this country's military.

475
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,301
Some people might say

476
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,845
that soldiers can be assigned
to teach sports within the military.

477
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,221
But please think about it.

478
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,599
This is utterly pathetic.

479
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,351
These young men sacrifice and dedicate

480
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,478
two years of their youth
to serving this country.

481
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,522
Who has the right to use them

482
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,276
for personal affairs
and treat them as errand runners?

483
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,070
Do young men of this country

484
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,946
get enlisted to serve the nation?

485
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,115
Or are they there
to serve military generals?

486
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,534
-Just a second, General.
-Please look at the camera.

487
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,375
Even though we found out first that
Moo-sung Park's killer is someone else,

488
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,876
those guys got all the spotlight.

489
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,631
We were also the first to find out
that Kyung-wan Park knows the girl.

490
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,300
Do you enjoy it when people take
all the credit for your work?

491
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,551
I apologize.

492
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,807
Do you know how I felt when I heard
that his alibi was fabricated?

493
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,558
I couldn't show it
because I was with Mr. Lee.

494
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,354
Why on earth do I have to hear it
from those in the prosecution? Why?

495
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,482
Why didn't you guys know about it?

496
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,527
Why do you think that jerk
is after the division commander?

497
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,779
It's because he has nothing in his hands.

498
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,699
He's trying to divert the public's
attention because there's no evidence.

499
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,909
What should we do now?

500
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,331
We'll have to make him confess.
That will be most effective.

501
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,332
How?

502
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,085
I'll make it happen no matter what.

503
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,587
We, the police, must be the ones

504
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,298
who close this case.

505
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,593
Then please go solve the case
and close it.

506
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,097
Yes, sir. I will.

507
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,730
Had I caught him red-handed,

508
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,565
we wouldn't have had to see that.

509
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,358
Shall I go ahead and disclose it?

510
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,611
"He hid her phone."
That will be more than enough.

511
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,448
You know whom we're dealing with here.
We must do it properly

512
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,533
so that he can't even say a word
when we disclose it.

513
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,493
What did the cyber team say?

514
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,456
Well... They can't do anything with it
because it was underwater for too long.

515
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,040
It has to be sent to NFS.

516
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,168
You haven't sent it yet, right?

517
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,212
Will you take it there yourself?

518
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,590
Good luck!

519
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,551
-Why are you so chipper?
-Pardon me?

520
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,764
Goodness, what are you talking about?
I'm so stressed out.

521
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,227
Gosh, I'm so stressed out too.

522
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,360
Hey, where are you? Let's meet up.

523
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,739
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

524
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,576
You tried to unlock a missing person's
cell phone in the past, right?

525
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,577
How did you do it?

526
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,703
That was...

527
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:25,248
I asked technicians at a service center
to do it through remote controlling.

528
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,003
-Is that all you had to do?
-At first, they said they couldn't do it.

529
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,172
So I told them I was with the prosecution.

530
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,466
Anyway, it did work.

531
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,134
It's so simple.

532
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,929
Ga-young's phone was turned on
briefly earlier in the day.

533
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,515
It means he must have had
to delete something on her phone.

534
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,058
Something that would work against him.

535
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,602
Even if he had to delete something,

536
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,230
he wouldn't have turned it on
because he knew I went through his room.

537
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,275
And there's no way he wouldn't know
deleting it is pointless.

538
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,156
I honestly can't figure Mr. Hwang out.

539
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,125
-The division commander...
-Wait for me there.

540
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,003
-Don't give him anything or talk to him.
-But still...

541
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:14,881
Yes, sir.

542
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,906
Look for a scapegoat for this.

543
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,492
Make him look like the culprit
and leak evidence.

544
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,619
Then make sure Si-mok can smell it.

545
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,872
No matter who the culprit is,

546
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,041
he absolutely must not be caught alive
if he's someone in this field.

547
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,877
If he's captured alive,

548
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,672
he'll give away names of everyone
who had any connection with Mr. Park.

549
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,640
Sir, the Minister of National Defense
is on the line.

550
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,058
Okay.

551
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,401
This is Chang-jun Lee
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

552
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,535
They summoned me.
What on earth are they doing right now?

553
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,496
Tell Chief Prosecutor to come here.

554
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,626
Where is the Chief Prosecutor?

555
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,753
I'm here, sir.

556
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,681
Yes, Lieutenant Han.

557
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,225
May I ask a favor of you?

558
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,603
Mr. Kyung-wan Park.

559
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,855
Did you like Ga-young Kim?

560
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,565
Did you have a crush on her?

561
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,610
No, I've never even talked to her.

562
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,073
She didn't even let you talk to her?
That's very mean.

563
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,741
You should've seduced her with money.

564
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,035
No, wait. Your family went bankrupt.

565
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,872
-Please call my attorney.
-You do it yourself.

566
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,126
Why are you telling me
to call your attorney for you?

567
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,253
Have you not grasped the situation yet?

568
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,589
You're being interrogated
as a murder suspect, Mr. Park.

569
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,717
We think you're the killer.

570
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,762
What are you talking about?
Why would I kill anyone?

571
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,098
Your dad cheated on your mom
and separated you from her

572
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,474
when you were in your adolescence.

573
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,144
The only thing he had was money,
but his business went bust,

574
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,562
so you had to join the army.

575
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,189
You probably won't graduate because
your major is expensive to pursue.

576
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,776
If your dad were still alive,
you would have no future.

577
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,572
Creditors would take however much money
you make for the rest of your life.

578
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,909
-Then...
-The taxi that's always parked there

579
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,536
and the broken security camera next door.

580
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,580
You knew because you lived there.

581
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,542
And you obviously picked something
you're very familiar with as your weapon.

582
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,213
Are you... Are you trying to say

583
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,215
that I killed my dad?

584
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,342
Feeling angry and resentful,

585
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,428
you stabbed him brutally.

586
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,638
Not once or twice.

587
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,604
Was it gratifying for you?

588
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,190
No, you still have an unfinished business.

589
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,901
Punishing those who betrayed you.

590
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,614
This is complete nonsense.
All of this is a big lie!

591
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,704
I was at the army post at that time, okay?

592
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,791
It was only shortly after
I was assigned there.

593
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,427
Even your two-star general
has been summoned.

594
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,098
No one will believe you now.

595
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,850
What we're trying to find out is

596
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,102
whether we can confirm

597
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,520
that Private Park was seen

598
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,731
somewhere near you even just once
during those four hours.

599
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,526
-That's...
-What you say

600
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,487
will change a 21-year-old man's future.

601
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,491
Prosecutor Seo is even talking
about a possibility of parricide.

602
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,451
Parricide?

603
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,203
You know that this is wrong.

604
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,039
Things are no longer like
how they used to be back in the day.

605
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,792
You can't threaten me
to put me behind bars.

606
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,918
I'm threatening you?

607
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,838
Why did you delete the photos
from the phone?

608
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,676
Did you think we wouldn't know?

609
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,844
That was...

610
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,763
I was just...

611
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,683
Gosh, this punk.
You lie every time you open your mouth.

612
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,062
Is it for your subordinate?

613
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,440
Or is it an excuse for yourself?

614
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,986
Why would I need to give an excuse?

615
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,737
I've already admitted everything.

616
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,531
If that's the case,

617
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,200
why did you throw out
the entire dashboard camera?

618
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,748
Your dad

619
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,251
took Ga-young Kim to one of those bars.

620
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,629
You were completely
head over heels for her.

621
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,131
Then you found out

622
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,468
what your dad did to your first love,

623
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,262
and you became gravely resentful.

624
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,223
"All of you should die,

625
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,309
or I'll go insane."

626
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,936
You chose the former.

627
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,231
You got rid of both of them.

628
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,358
-No.
-You and your dad fought over a girl!

629
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,694
And the girl was a minor.

630
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,572
How heinous. From motive to method,
all the pieces fit together perfectly.

631
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,369
What did you say earlier?

632
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,124
Don't trust the system too much.
There are many ways to get around it.

633
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,671
You should think about your grandmother.

634
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,759
Why are you talking about my grandma?

635
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,012
Am I the only one
who tampered with things?

636
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,972
It looks like you guys
have an expert here.

637
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:42,852
I'm not saying what I did was right,
but I'm a victim of this too.

638
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,899
Did Prosecutor Seo threaten you?

639
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,150
He didn't threaten, but...

640
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,990
What is this about?

641
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:03,957
I think I heard him calling
the young man "Private Park."

642
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,209
The caddies also said that
one person in your group

643
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:09,504
called someone and told that person
to come to Songil Restaurant.

644
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,298
I recorded this statement
at Songil Restaurant.

645
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,759
The younger guys left after dinner.

646
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,095
Our restaurant closes at 1 a.m.,
so the high-ups stayed

647
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,055
and drank until then.

648
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,432
From 4 p.m. two days ago

649
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,227
to about 2 a.m. the next day,

650
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,937
Private Park wasn't at the army post.

651
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,483
But when we requested his work log,

652
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:34,529
we were told that he never left
the barracks on the day of the incident.

653
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,491
You deliberately and systematically
deceived us.

654
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,995
In order to conceal your violation
of the rules and lack of discipline,

655
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,997
you made those under you
fake the work log.

656
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,292
As a result, you ended up interfering
in our investigation of a murder case

657
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,668
where we now have a second victim.

658
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,378
I interfered in your investigation?

659
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,631
Are you saying Private Park is the killer?

660
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,634
You gave us the reason to think that
but covered it up.

661
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,677
Stop spewing nonsense.

662
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,971
I also don't want this to get out of hand.

663
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,307
You should've given me a heads-up.

664
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,143
I would've kept it
under the table for you.

665
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,313
The incident itself didn't take place
during work hours anyway.

666
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,403
Okay, here's the deal.

667
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:20,116
This will be just between you and me.
I won't tell anyone who my source is.

668
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,286
It'll only be used internally
to figure out his route that night.

669
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,090
It was planned in advance.

670
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,010
We went to the golf course
at around 3 p.m.

671
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,056
Private Park drove as usual.
He was like our golf instructor, you know.

672
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,184
He came to meet me
with another phone hidden.

673
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,519
He deliberately fooled me.

674
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:52,857
I'm not saying what I did was right.
I'm just warning you.

675
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,151
You never know when a guy like him
will backstab you.

676
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,528
I'm a good judge of character.

677
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,535
We should get up now.

678
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,542
The Minister of National Defense
is greatly concerned.

679
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,922
Dealing with generals leaving duty without
permission falls under his jurisdiction.

680
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,097
Are you done humiliating me now?

681
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,267
Ma'am, not saying anything
will only work to your disadvantage.

682
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,646
Where were you the day before
the golf gathering?

683
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,190
Your husband is holding his tongue

684
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,984
because it has something
to do with you, right?

685
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,167
Oh, boy.

686
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,171
Ma'am.

687
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,049
Whom were you with the night before?

688
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,636
I'll keep doing this right here all night!

689
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,304
Ma'am!

690
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,938
How did you do that?

691
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,567
She didn't even answer my calls,
let alone show me her face.

692
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,318
Prosecutor Seo must've scared her.

693
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,863
Seeing any prosecutor probably
makes her convulse because of it.

694
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,157
The night Ga-young was abducted,

695
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,743
she went to a driving range
with Kyung-wan.

696
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,911
She said they were done after 9 p.m.

697
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,205
That can't be enough time
to go to Garwol-dong.

698
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:36,377
If people find out that even his wife
used a private as her golf instructor,

699
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,380
he'll be harshly criticized
and might even face dismissal.

700
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,048
That must be why they kept
their mouths shut

701
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,050
regardless of what happens to Kyung-wan.

702
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,927
By any chance, do you know what time

703
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,389
Kyung-wan's interview
as a referential witness ended yesterday?

704
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,393
Yesterday? Around 1 p.m. Why do you ask?

705
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,812
I need to ask you for one more favor.

706
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,648
Hold on.

707
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,992
My gosh, what was that about?

708
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,660
You said you needed another favor.

709
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,039
I won't do it for you.

710
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,215
Why did you text me?

711
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,133
In a little bit...

712
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,227
-What's wrong?
-Pardon me?

713
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:35,812
What do you mean?

714
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,776
Did you do something wrong again?

715
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,070
"Again"?

716
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,699
Why did you want to see me?

717
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,538
I got a call
from the Minister of National Defense.

718
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,164
The division commander.

719
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,625
You need to let him go.

720
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,714
But in order to prove
that Kyung-wan Park is the culprit,

721
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,633
we can't avoid mentioning him.

722
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,971
What about the Moo-sung Park case?

723
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:11,639
Pardon me?

724
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,185
I know that your intention is
to combine the two as a serial case.

725
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,981
Did Kyung-wan Park leave the barracks
that time as well?

726
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,281
It's not just an intention.

727
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,241
I will be sure to prove it.

728
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,451
Please believe in me.

729
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,291
There are too many holes.
It'll be too risky.

730
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,335
Have I told you?

731
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,088
Even about the day the girl was abducted,

732
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,507
the division commander
keeps changing his words.

733
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,301
I'm sure he could've made him the culprit.

734
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,429
-If the alibi for the day can't be proven,
-But why?

735
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,597
we won't need to look further.

736
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,224
Why has he chosen to close the case
instead of solving it?

737
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,519
Why is he so anxious to end it?

738
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,897
All right. You should get back to work.

739
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,190
Yes, sir.

740
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,472
What? Are you going to hide
behind Si-mok again?

741
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,724
And wait for Mr. Lee to rescue you
once again?

742
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,768
He's our chief prosecutor now.

743
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,603
Do you think I've forgiven you?

744
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,356
What kind of ruse are you two cooking up?

745
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,947
You'd better follow me.

746
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,490
Stop bothering me like this.

747
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,867
You should ask Mr. Hwang directly.

748
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,827
Ask him why we went through your office

749
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,455
and why he had to go
into that stinky pool of water.

750
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,091
He went into the water?

751
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,302
Si-mok did?

752
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,346
Where?

753
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,558
I thought you knew.

754
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:43,624
You said Ga-young Kim's phone was
turned on yesterday. What time was it?

755
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,793
Around 1:30 p.m.

756
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,673
What time did Kyung-wan Park's interview
end at your station?

757
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,967
It ended around 1 p.m.

758
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,012
Does that mean he turned the phone on
as soon as he got out of the interview?

759
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,891
But we have all of his stuff.

760
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,685
We didn't find her phone.

761
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:06,605
He obviously wouldn't carry it around.
He must've hidden it somewhere.

762
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,275
At home, for example.

763
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,277
The house in Huam-dong?

764
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,112
The on-site inspection is over, you know.

765
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,407
Right, he must know we won't be
searching that house again.

766
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,451
You should head there right away.
I'll go too.

767
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,871
Now? Right now, I'm...

768
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,292
Okay. I'll leave now.

769
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,262
You prick.

770
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:41,182
-No! Please...
-You punk.

771
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:22,116
Mr. Dong-jae Seo,
you have the right to remain silent

772
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,993
and the right to an attorney.

773
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:27,997
We believe that you might try
to destroy evidence or flee.

774
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,957
-Hence, we must arrest you.
-No.

775
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,918
You may refuse to answer questions.

776
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:35,838
I didn't do it!

777
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,468
It's Mr. Lee. He killed him.

It was all Mr. Lee's doing.

782

I'm sure.

783
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,992
STRANGER

784
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,745
When I found the girl, I reported it to...

785
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,706
Why I had to go this far...

786
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,583
I'm sure Mr. Lee will find out soon.

787
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,211
Your sacrificial lamb was Kyung-wan,

788
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,505
and mine will be yours.

789
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,882
-Damn it!
-I'll also keep a watchful eye

790
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,009
on whether any mishap happens
to Mr. Seo or not.

791
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,637
Dump it all on Mr. Lee
and his father-in-law.

792
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,596
Was it you?

793
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,015
Can I trust you?

794
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,016
Of course, Mr. Hwang.

795
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,395
The head has finally been revealed.

796
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,151
