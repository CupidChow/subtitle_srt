1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:02,836
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,261
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,724
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACE NAMES
AND CASES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,647
-Let's take a selfie together.
-Selfie? My gosh.

5
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,024
-A group photo.
-Yes.

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,317
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,069
-Si-mok.
-Mr. Hwang, let's take it together.

8
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,198
-It's all right. Count me out.
-Come on. Don't be so difficult.

9
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,365
Come, get in.

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,285
-Come on. We should have everyone in it.
-I can't see.

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,496
One, two, three!

12
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,082
One more time. One, two, three.

13
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,085
-One more time.
-Once more. One, two!

14
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,963
-One, two.
-I'm trying to look cute.

15
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,300
Let me see. Show me again.

16
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,427
My head looks huge.

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,932
-This is a great photo.
-My gosh, we have booze left.

18
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,811
My grandfather taught me
to never leave any drinks unfinished.

19
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,562
Here.

20
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,272
I'm a lightweight.

21
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,900
How can you be a lightweight
when you served in the Marine Corps?

22
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,028
Didn't you say you served
in the Special Forces?

23
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,447
-No, I didn't.
-Forget about it, then.

24
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,034
We should drink together since we both
served in the Civil Defense Corps.

25
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,744
I served as a public service worker.

26
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,954
Exactly.

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,665
There's a huge difference between the two.

28
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,339
Well, I actually watched the footage.

29
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,510
The one from the hotel's security camera

30
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,428
where Chief and Ga-young are captured.

31
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,433
I made a copy of it and gave it to Chief.

32
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,273
What did you just say?

33
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,816
How did you get the file?

34
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,945
I got it from your laptop. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,284
Are you saying that you went through
my laptop? Is that it?

36
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,036
Do you actually think
an apology is enough...

37
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,205
Goodness!

38
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,457
It's not like he asked me
to delete the original file.

39
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,002
He said no one would be affected by it.

40
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,839
To be honest, this is what I thought.

41
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,383
It's not like he killed someone.

42
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,387
I thought it was too cruel that he lost
everything due to an affair he had.

43
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,722
An affair?

44
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,808
Is that what you thought too?
"Men can make a mistake like that."

45
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,393
I'm sure he didn't think like that.

46
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,812
Detective Jang is tender-hearted.

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,648
That's probably why he did it.

48
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,159
Did he use it?

49
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,537
What?

50
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,045
Even if the two of you decide to take
disciplinary action against me,

51
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,046
I have nothing to say.

52
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,049
There's something I must know though.

53
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,301
Could Chief be the culprit?

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,511
Did I help a murderer?

55
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,139
He must be the one
whom Ga-young threatened

56
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,808
using the affair they had.

57
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,519
When he was dragging me
thinking that I was her,

58
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,190
he said something like,
"I'll give you all the money you want."

59
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,944
But judging from the way he talked,
he didn't seem capable of killing someone.

60
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,198
You said he was shaking

61
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,991
and that he begged you for help.

62
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,036
That must mean he's not the killer.

63
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,206
Chief has nothing to do
with zero and seven, right?

64
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,876
Zero and seven?

65
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,586
What is that?

66
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,172
Ga-young said those words.

67
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,424
It might be what she saw
during the abduction

68
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,009
or something related to the culprit.

69
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,055
She saw those two numbers? Zero and seven?

70
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,683
I wonder what they mean.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,687
She'll probably be able to tell us
if we wait a little longer.

72
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,899
She remembered that, so I'm sure
she'll remember the culprit soon too.

73
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,068
It's a matter of time.

74
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,365
It is a matter of time indeed.

75
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,598
That was such a good meal.

76
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,101
I'm so full.

77
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,316
Get home safely.

78
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,233
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,193
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food.

80
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,155
-Jung-bon, you can take a taxi with me.
-Yes.

81
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,032
What about you, Ms. Young?

82
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,244
Mr. Hwang, you should drive her home
since you didn't drink at all.

83
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,539
Sure, I will.

84
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,915
Thank you.

85
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,922
All right, then. We should get going.

86
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,923
-Bye.
-Bye.

87
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,009
-Good night.
-Drive safely.

88
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,260
-Bye.
-Get home safely.

89
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,262
-I'll get going too.
-Yes, bye.

90
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,847
-Good night.
-See you all tomorrow.

91
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,017
How about a second round?

92
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,895
Let's go. I'll buy you a drink.

93
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,616
By the way,

94
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,453
did you go straight to her place
from the central district office?

95
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,537
Yes.

96
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,874
Did I mishear it?

97
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,586
There were a lot of reports
and documents piled up on your desk,

98
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,881
so I stopped by your place
to drop them off for you.

99
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,469
But I thought I heard someone
opening the door.

100
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,098
Are you saying someone was at my place?

101
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,475
I can't say it for certain.

102
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,853
I'm not sure because I heard it
when I was inside the elevator.

103
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,108
But when I got out of the building,
I saw a man

104
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,318
holding an umbrella
even though it wasn't raining.

105
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,904
I thought that was strange too.

106
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,948
What did that man do?

107
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,118
He didn't really do anything.

108
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,745
He just walked away.

109
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,124
Did I mishear it?

110
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,965
You can take the subway, right?

111
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,135
From here?

112
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,181
Then please drop me off over there.

113
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,115
Bye.

114
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,833
My gosh.

115
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,129
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

116
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,257
Is it this way?

117
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,145
It's a lot worse than how you
described it over the phone.

118
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,938
It's so creepy.

119
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,482
Whoever did it put in a lot of work.

120
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,278
What about the other rooms?

121
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,155
I didn't find anything else.

122
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,533
We should do a thorough check though.
There are so many perverts these days.

123
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,495
-I'll see if there are any bugs.
-All right.

124
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,926
-Hello?
-I got the security camera footage.

125
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,344
I'll be right there.

126
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,679
-Detective Jang.
-Yes.

127
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,066
He covered his face, but other than that,
he walked around freely.

128
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,652
Gosh, what a psycho.

129
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,280
I saw a man holding an umbrella
even though it wasn't raining.

130
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,991
He didn't actually harm you.

131
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,036
What is this about? Is it like a warning?

132
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,665
It reminds me of something I saw
in a movie a long time ago.

133
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,167
What movie?

134
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,130
Was it a general?

135
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,049
There was a king who wanted him dead.
When the king was asleep,

136
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,260
he sneaked in
and cut off a lock of his hair.

137
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,139
That made the king
become afraid of the general.

138
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,474
The answer must be one of these two.

139
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,354
Someone who was convicted and locked up
because of Mr. Hwang in the past

140
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,689
or someone who's against us.

141
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,775
An ex-convict wouldn't be
this bold though.

142
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,735
If it's about our team,

143
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,572
other people might be in danger too.

144
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,910
Excuse me.

145
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,706
We'll have to make copies of the footage
from all security cameras here.

146
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,249
Sure, that's not a problem at all.

147
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,257
We were laughing and chatting away
until a little while ago.

148
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,176
I guess you never know
what life will throw at you.

149
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,386
Unless he vanished into thin air,

150
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,639
he must've been caught on one
of the cameras. I'll track him down.

151
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,099
Yes, please find him.

152
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,435
Thank you both for all of your help today.

153
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,855
Wait, are you going to be okay
by yourself?

154
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,857
He won't come back.

155
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,568
-Bye.
-Have a good night.

156
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,072
I'd be too creeped out to sleep there.

157
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,285
Gosh. Lieutenant, get in.
I'll give you a ride.

158
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,247
I won't stab you in the back
like that ever again.

159
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,374
Seriously. Come on!

160
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,656
Why did you only cut off my hair?

161
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,908
You should've slit my throat.

162
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,286
Is that not your modus operandi?

163
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,760
I heard chamomile can help you
relax and sleep better.

164
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,973
Try not to think about anything
and get a good sleep.

165
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,600
Come in for a few minutes.

166
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,402
Thank you for inviting me in.

167
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,097
To think that it was the killer's doing...

168
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,766
The method is too different, right?

169
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,646
If it wasn't the killer,

170
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,399
there's only one plausible suspect,
Hanjo Group.

171
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,735
I guess there's The Bahn Group too.

172
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,239
Whoever it was,
I think he wanted to scare me.

173
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,336
Be honest with me.
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

174
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,880
Had I known about it, I would've skipped
the dinner and stayed home.

175
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,132
I'm not talking about that.

176
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,595
Our team getting disbanded.

177
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,352
Chang-jun Lee must've used
all possible means

178
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,104
and found out that you were the one
who tipped Sungmoon off.

179
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,732
You and I both know
who would get in trouble for that.

180
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,862
I couldn't turn a blind eye to it though.

181
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,532
Ten trillion won of tax money
went into it, so I had to stop their scam.

182
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,951
Also, if I was doing it,

183
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,078
I wanted us to get something
out of it too.

184
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,998
So what did you get in return
from Sungmoon?

185
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,252
I swapped it with intel on the informant.

186
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,297
Did you find out who it is?
Who's the informant?

187
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,216
A high school girl

188
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,052
sent in the information
because a man asked her to do it.

189
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,096
I just sent you her information.

190
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,058
Then,

191
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,851
I'll meet this girl

192
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,937
and get that man's composite sketch made.

193
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,523
You'll have
the composite sketch software, right?

194
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,942
-I can draw it like the software does.
-What?

195
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,111
Goodness.

196
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,863
Please make sure
you take the software with you.

197
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,330
Well, is there anything else?

198
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,627
The informant must be someone
who knows about all of these three things.

199
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,547
The relationship between
Chang-jun Lee and Moo-sung Park.

200
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,426
The fact that there could've been
a marriage between Sungmoon and Hanjo.

201
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,345
Lastly, the person must also know
that the CEO of Sungmoon is

202
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,807
still holding grudges due to the marriage
talks falling through over a decade ago.

203
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,268
How petty.

204
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,563
He's still resentful about something
that happened over ten years ago?

205
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,609
I don't think he let people see it
because of his pride.

206
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,196
But somebody caught onto it.

207
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,367
So far, I've identified three people
who meet

208
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,202
all of the three requirements.

209
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,537
Three requirements

210
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,496
and three people?

211
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,042
Who are those three people?

212
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,668
Yun-beom Lee,

213
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,961
Chang-jun Lee

214
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,588
and Yeon-jae Lee.

215
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,757
Come again?

216
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,345
Why would they send in such information?

217
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,181
It's like digging their own graves.

218
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,478
You said that the informant
must be the culprit.

219
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,899
All three of them do have a motive.

220
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,694
For Yun-beom Lee, it's about his daughter
and her husband, you know.

221
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,282
But they wouldn't do all of the work
just to make sure Ga-young could live.

222
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,259
My gosh, it's getting late.

223
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,764
Call me if you have a nightmare.

224
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,682
I rarely have dreams.

225
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,186
That sure comes in handy
at times like this.

226
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,688
I'll be off.

227
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,200
-Get home safely.
-Will do. Have a good night.

228
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,974
He's still resentful about something
that happened over ten years ago?

229
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,894
Someone close to Chang-jun Lee who was
directly involved in the marriage talks.

230
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,857
So far, there are only three on the list.

231
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,194
Why would they send in such information?

232
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,113
It's like digging their own graves.

233
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,804
Zero and seven?

234
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,681
Ga-young said those words.

235
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,349
It might be what she saw
during the abduction

236
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,976
or something related to the culprit.

237
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,021
That doesn't make any sense though.

238
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,113
Moving on to the next news,

239
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,075
the government released
an official statement

240
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,745
on the weapon import scandal
between Hanjo Group and Matsuyama,

241
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,248
which caused a big stir last night.

242
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,211
The government has decided
to withdraw its decision to import

243
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,921
the radar defense system from L Defense.

244
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,848
What are you doing?
Did someone die or what?

245
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,600
Go have some breakfast.

246
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,104
What will you do now?

247
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,776
I'll just have to bow once.
It's not even a big deal.

248
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,160
Yes, Mr. Public Prosecutor General.
It's me.

249
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,871
How many times do I have to call you?

250
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,124
Because of an assistant chief?
Is that even an excuse?

251
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,294
If blocking the stream doesn't work,
you'll need to widen the path.

252
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,004
Extricate it.

253
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,422
Let it flow.

254
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,342
Summon and tell him right away.

255
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,804
There's a limit to my patience.

256
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,475
Father, let's eat.

257
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,064
Let's go. You need to feel energized
to start the day.

258
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,695
The Army Headquarters and Central Seoul
Prosecutors' Office promised

259
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,656
that they will work together
to bring the truth to light.

260
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,241
Great. That's the way it should be done.

261
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,452
My gosh, that's surprising.

262
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,746
I guess it is possible to stop
such schemes.

263
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,461
-Breaking news.
-Isn't that about us?

264
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,130
The special investigation team,
which arrested Police Chief Kim,

265
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,425
-for violating the Youth Protection Act,
-Ended successfully?

266
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,802
additionally charged
Prosecutor Joon-sik Gong with bribery

267
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,929
and ended
their investigation successfully.

268
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,535
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE

269
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,090
For effective investigation, Chief Kim
will be moved to the inspection office.

270
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,717
Prosecutor Gong will be sent
to the central investigation department

271
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,053
where he will continue to be investigated.

272
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,431
The special investigation team, which
judged the police and the prosecution,

273
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,392
will always be remembered
for the fair, transparent way

274
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,520
they carried out their investigation.

275
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,108
Well, how can they end
our investigation like this?

276
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,984
Those jerks.

277
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,362
That was a big slap in the face.

278
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,253
Right, Si-mok will come back.

279
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,381
Will they close the case like this
or deal with everything that has been...

280
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,967
Yes, I'm asking you to find out!

281
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,599
What if they want to arrest me as well?

282
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,133
HANJO GROUP

283
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,445
First of all,

284
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,823
I deeply regret

285
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,326
having to stand before all of you

286
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,537
because of such a dishonorable scandal.

287
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,373
Before I am a businessman,

288
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,169
I am a citizen of Korea.
I can assure all of you

289
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,047
that I was not aware of the fact

290
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,426
that the Ukraine company, L Defense,
is owned by Matsuyama Group.

291
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,511
My company, Hanjo Group,

292
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,349
was asked by the Ministry of National
Defense to act as L Defense's broker.

293
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,100
We wanted to make sure

294
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,229
that the deal goes through
for the sake of national defense,

295
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,774
but as soon as we found out that they're
affiliated with a Japanese company,

296
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:31,238
we started working
on annulling the contract.

297
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,364
Nonetheless,

298
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:38,703
our lack of thorough research
ended up greatly concerning you all.

299
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,455
It is

300
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,333
all my fault.

301
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,921
On behalf of Hanjo Group,

302
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,131
I would like to

303
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,385
apologize to all citizens of Korea.

304
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,804
I sincerely apologize.

305
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,447
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
SI-MOK HWANG

306
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:21,746
BRIBERY CASE INVOLVING PROSECUTORS,
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

307
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,835
Yes?

308
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,927
Who was that?

309
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,762
They told me to hurry up
so that they can tidy up.

310
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,266
How heartless.
Were they waiting for the announcement?

311
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,103
-Did they know about it?
-Now, we really have to part ways.

312
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,998
My gosh.

313
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,459
What's that?

314
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,005
HANJO GROUP

315
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,759
Involved in Il-jae Young's case?

316
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,725
Tae-gyun Kim delivered
the cash to Il-jae Young.

317
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,691
Who would've been afraid
of Ga-young's testimony?

318
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:59,302
It was for a short period of time,
but I know all of you did your best.

319
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,678
I sincerely appreciate it.

320
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,807
We were able to come this far
thanks to your hard work.

321
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,144
Good work, everyone.

322
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,580
Great work.

323
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,207
Thank you for everything.

324
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,960
Thank you for your hard work.

325
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,753
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

326
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,596
You all did a great job.

327
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,808
Thank you, Sun-chang.
You seem to be doing great.

328
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,230
What happened? Is he gone?

329
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,576
SERGEANT SU-CHAN KIM IS TERMINATED
DUE TO HARSHLY TREATING A SUSPECT.

330
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,661
How did this happen?

331
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,412
This hasn't been concluded yet.

332
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,499
Captain posted an apology on our intranet,

333
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,001
saying he should have stopped
Sergeant Kim but couldn't do so.

334
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,588
He also said he apologized to the victim
but felt that he made it worse.

335
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,674
He came clean about everything.

336
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,177
I don't know whether he did it to clear
his conscience or to pass the bomb along.

337
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,181
How can they dismiss him right away?
It's not like we're being inspected.

338
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,392
Our situation is bad now, you know.

339
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,853
I bet the high-ups
wanted him gone quickly.

340
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,521
Well, Kyung-wan.

341
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,317
Dong-jae Seo and Sergeant Kim are the ones
who are making you look like a liar.

342
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,445
I should've stopped Sergeant Kim that day.

343
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,366
This is probably why he did that.

344
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,955
His family will have to come back
to Korea now.

345
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,417
Goodness. That's what I'm worried about.

346
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,170
I think he had to send
his son abroad for a reason.

347
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,173
Was it ADHD?

348
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,344
Anyway, it sounded like
his son has some sort of problem.

349
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,931
What happened to Captain?

350
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,350
He's getting a pay cut for three months.

351
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,316
Did you receive everything?

352
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,276
I'll leave right now.

353
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,945
Where are you going?

354
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,452
Is it ready?

355
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,538
Go to 9:38 p.m. on April 25.

356
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,290
-Show me the footage from the complex.
-Sure.

357
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:07,926
That's it.

358
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,678
TRAFFIC DIVISION

359
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,708
The parking lot.

360
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,013
The playground.

361
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,896
The main entrance.

362
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,657
-Is it connected to the control system?
-Yes, ma'am.

363
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,465
Where did he go?

364
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,278
Ms. Young.

365
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,238
A penny for your thoughts?

366
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,323
You're back.

367
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,376
What's the matter with her?

368
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,774
-I have to meet with Mr. Kang briefly.
-Okay.

369
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,907
-I'm going that way.
-See you.

370
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,200
Have a good day.

371
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,516
You're back.

372
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,560
I'm sorry.

373
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,146
I failed to push through it
even with your support.

374
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,859
You don't owe me an apology,
and I don't really deserve one either.

375
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,241
Chief Woo-gyun Kim will be re-investigated

376
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,785
at the inspection office.
You know that, right?

377
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,955
Yes. What do you think will happen?

378
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,706
I'm not sure.

379
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,126
They're like a family, you know.

380
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,963
The fact that he received sexual favors
can't be refuted. The point is

381
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,466
if he hired someone to stab the girl

382
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,761
and killed Moo-sung Park the same way.
That's what needs to be investigated.

383
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,516
Will those at the inspection office
push things that far?

384
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,271
But I must say, even your
assisting officer's statement alone shows

385
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,148
that he wouldn't have the guts
to kill anyone.

386
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,026
He may not be a murderer, but he could be
guilty of attempted murder.

387
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,029
What does that mean?

388
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,907
-There's witness.
-Who?

389
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,830
Yeon-jae Lee, Chief Secretary Lee's wife.

390
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,248
What?

391
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,049
Hey, let's not go that far.

392
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,803
Did Chief Kim mention he saw
Ms. Yeon-jae Lee in the footage at all?

393
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,888
Not at all.

394
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,476
It's probably because he has to make it
look like nothing happened that day.

395
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,563
I'll submit a revised report soon.

396
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,817
Hey, we already have enough.
We can lock him up.

397
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,945
No, I'll send you a revised one.

398
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,994
Gosh, seriously.

399
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,666
DEPARTMENT CHIEF, DIVISION THREE
PROSECUTOR WON-CHUL KANG

400
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,186
The third one.

401
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,944
MAPO-DAERO 16-GIL

402
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,660
Let's check the one from that main road.

403
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,294
It's too far. Is there any camera
closer to where he is?

404
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,595
Try zooming in on the one we saw earlier.

405
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,021
Just print the original image for me.

406
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,356
No problem.

407
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,745
Shall I not bother?

408
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,375
Goodness!

409
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,966
No. The special investigation is over.
This will only make him feel uneasy.

410
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,011
What is that?

411
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,847
What should I do with this?

412
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,308
It's a list of companies for which
Moo-sung Park acted as a broker.

413
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,892
Are there that many companies?

414
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,311
Don't even get me started.

415
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,979
One bus company

416
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,315
was saved by him even though
the owner should've been cuffed.

417
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,234
They bumped up the number of buses
and changed their routes illegally.

418
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,320
The owner also got
his family members on the board

419
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,281
and split hundreds of millions of won
of subsidy among themselves.

420
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,116
How did Moo-sung Park save the company?

421
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,993
He got money from the owner of the company

422
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,955
and connected him with a public official
so that the company could operate.

423
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,832
He basically made money
through all possible means.

424
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,500
But you know what?

425
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,669
Even though we only dug up dirt
on Moo-sung Park,

426
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,755
we're realizing how corrupt everyone is
as we dig deeper.

427
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,757
I don't think Moo-sung Park is to blame.

428
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,885
I wonder if this shows where
the entire system of this country is at.

429
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,804
-You're back.
-Hello.

430
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,722
Yes.

431
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,808
-He wasn't in his office?
-No.

432
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,021
Oh, well.

433
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,106
He did tell me to check each case.

434
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,818
-Are you heading out?
-Yes.

435
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,111
See you later.

436
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,237
Well...

437
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,117
What should I do?

438
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,786
Gosh, seriously.

439
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,042
Why do you think the special investigation
was closed?

440
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,919
Nothing good will come out
of digging deeper

441
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,713
for both Mr. Hwang and us all.

442
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,256
Yes, you're right.

443
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,718
Please go through this. Here.

444
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,220
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

445
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,438
Why are you standing like that?
Come in and have a seat.

446
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,944
My wife isn't home at the moment.

447
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,279
I'll see if I can get you
something to drink.

448
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,031
Please don't worry. It's okay, sir.

449
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,617
It won't take long. Please have a seat.

450
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,997
Chang-jun must be

451
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,917
pretty upset at the moment.

452
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,880
The one he had his eye on
stabbed him in the back.

453
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,634
What does that mean, sir?

454
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,804
In the past, Chang-jun told me

455
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,557
that he discovered someone
who seems promising

456
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,726
but that he'd need to see whether
that person would be demoralized or not.

457
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,396
I believe it was
the ruling party's list of members.

458
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,982
It leaked in Suwon
and became a big problem.

459
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,404
The high-ups wanted to bury it,
but a complete newbie rebelled,

460
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,533
saying that they clearly
violated the election laws.

461
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,119
It totally stressed out your chief,
of course.

462
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,664
Yes, I'm talking about you.

463
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,668
It was immediately after you completed
your probationary period, right?

464
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,213
Yes, it was at Suwon Prosecutors' Office
where I was first stationed.

465
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,509
When Chang-jun heard about the argument
you had with the chief of your division

466
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,430
immediately after completing
your probationary period under him,

467
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,223
he said this.

468
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,687
"If Si-mok doesn't change over the course
of his career, we should be able

469
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,856
to look forward to his achievements."

470
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,488
But you bogged him down.

471
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,867
You're the one who stopped
the weapon import, right?

472
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,078
You knew about it?

473
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,001
I guess the CEO of Sungmoon Daily
hasn't changed at all.

474
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,503
He bit the bait right away.

475
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,089
It sounds like you already knew
about what happened

476
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,175
between Sungmoon and Hanjo in the past.

477
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,766
That jerk used to bother
Chang-jun so much.

478
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,357
Well, why did you come to see me?

479
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,902
Did you come all the way here
expecting me to thank you?

480
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,030
Please tell me

481
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,115
what you know.

482
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,080
Yun-beom Lee struck against you
because he was afraid.

483
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,249
What was he afraid of?

484
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,585
I don't know what you're talking about.

485
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,755
I'll do it. Please give it to me now.

486
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,636
Because of my job
which I thought was my calling,

487
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,806
my family had to suffer.

488
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,978
I've done nothing for my family.

489
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,983
Even to this day when I no longer
have to worry about my job or calling.

490
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,819
"To judicial officers,

491
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,572
justice will always be a one-sided love.

492
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,699
It's an ultimate ideal."

493
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,534
Sir, it's...

494
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,123
It's what you told us in our first class
at the training institute, Professor.

495
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,294
Please help me so that
I can follow your teaching.

496
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,007
What do you think justice is?

497
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,344
To me, justice is

498
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,306
the safety of my family and myself.

499
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,351
I've lived long enough

500
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,563
to realize that nothing
should come before that.

501
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,944
I have a doctor's appointment.

502
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,324
Well, I'll be back.

503
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,993
You should leave.

504
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,456
I will be back, sir.

505
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,776
To what do I owe the pleasure
of your call, Mr. Chief Secretary?

506
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,403
Are you all right, Father?

507
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,531
In business, you have to deal
with bigger losses at times.

508
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,203
When you do business, you need
to be able to transcend embarrassment.

509
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,539
Those in politics are unpredictable
and fickle-minded.

510
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,333
I'm used to dealing with them.

511
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,462
I'm fine, so don't worry about me
and just focus on state affairs.

512
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,047
Yes.

513
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,863
Let Mr. Song of W Savings Bank know
that I'd like to meet with him.

514
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,407
Hansung Daily too.

515
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,368
-I understand, sir.
-Also, find someone we need for the plan.

516
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,036
Not someone like Moo-sung Park though.

517
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,123
Understood, sir. By the way...

518
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:10,541
What is it?

519
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,086
I think Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang
met with Il-jae Young.

520
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,592
I'm surprised the warning
you gave him didn't work.

521
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,635
I apologize, sir.

522
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,179
-I can give him another...
-No, don't.

523
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:29,643
Even if Il-jae made a pledge
that he'd never say or do anything,

524
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,147
if someone like Si-mok
keeps egging him on,

525
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,567
he'd end up making a reckless decision.

526
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,987
We shouldn't put it off any longer.

527
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,365
It must be somewhere in his house.

528
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,033
Go bring it.

529
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,577
Yes, sir.

530
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,669
Letting the stream flow obviously
didn't teach that prick any lesson.

531
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,443
Hello.

532
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,376
Hello, may I take a look
at your security camera footage?

533
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,446
HIRING TAXI DRIVERS

534
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,081
Oh, yes. I remember him.

535
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,502
He was holding an umbrella when it wasn't
even raining, so I thought he was crazy.

536
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,133
I think I dropped him off at the alley
right after Sinchang Station.

537
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,618
PRE-CONSTRUCTION PREMIUM APARTMENTS
AVAILABLE FOR SALE, FIFTH FLOOR

538
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,721
-I'll be back in a bit.
-See you later.

539
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,933
-Come in.
-Hello.

540
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,603
-Lieutenant Han!
-My gosh!

541
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,481
People will think you haven't seen me
in years. You saw me this morning.

542
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,482
I know, right?

543
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,319
Seeing you here makes me feel
as if I haven't seen you in ages.

544
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,696
We used to see each other every day.

545
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,616
-I'm sad I no longer get to see you often.
-Totally. Me too.

546
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,493
On my way here, I almost went
to the central district office.

547
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,913
-You're here.
-Yes, hi.

548
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,791
You should go in.

549
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,084
I have to head out.

550
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,604
Hey, Eun-soo.
Can you come to my office now?

551
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,570
I don't think I know this man.

552
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,908
Then, what about this man?

553
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,203
Did you meet the high school girl?

554
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,956
The only thing she remembers
is that his face was covered.

555
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,127
Showing her photos of Yun-beom Lee
or Chang-jun Lee wouldn't do much.

556
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,255
Yeon-jae Lee is a woman, so the girl
would've known if it was her.

557
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,217
We should add another person
to the list of potential informants.

558
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:31,885
Who is it?

559
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,596
Mr. Il-jae Young.

560
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,308
From the relationship
between Sungmoon and Hanjo

561
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,602
to how insecure the CEO of Sungmoon is,

562
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,354
he knows everything.

563
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,358
Considering everything,

564
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,861
he does fit the bill the most.

565
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,865
It goes with our hypothesis that
the culprit made sure Ga-young could live.

566
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,702
Mr. Young doesn't hold
any grudge against her, you know.

567
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,245
The method was perfect too.

568
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,748
Directly attacking Yun-beom Lee might make
what happened three years ago a repeat.

569
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,334
So he must've killed Moo-sung Park first
to attract public attention.

570
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,169
If he tips the media off after that...

571
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,340
He's also the one who benefited the most
from the special investigation.

572
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,594
A doer

573
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,180
who's determined.

574
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,182
I beg your pardon?

575
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,184
He fits the bill in terms
of everything else,

576
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,270
but he's far off in that regard.

577
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,733
In order to kill someone,
you must be very determined.

578
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,154
He's more of a theorist, not a doer.

579
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,700
I know that he has something
that can greatly threaten Yun-beom Lee.

580
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,870
But he's just been sitting on it
for three years.

581
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,831
What does Mr. Young have?

582
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,629
-Hello.
-Hello.

583
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,884
Have a seat.

584
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,348
The man you saw at my place yesterday.

585
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,228
Do you remember?

586
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,321
His clothes look similar.
I couldn't see his face,

587
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,697
but I think it was this umbrella.

588
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,948
Yes, it was this umbrella.

589
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,160
Why do you ask?

590
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,371
Did he really come out of your place?

591
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,706
Did something happen?

592
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,042
No, nothing happened.

593
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,670
Can you send me soft copies
of these photos?

594
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,975
That's all. Thank you for your help.

595
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,146
You must've found these images
because something happened.

596
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,481
Aren't they from a security camera?

597
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,107
It's really nothing.

598
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,276
We just looked into it
because he looked suspicious.

599
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,612
You should get back to work.

600
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,077
Why aren't you telling me anything?

601
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,329
Because I have nothing to tell you.

602
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,623
Go on.

603
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,130
-See you around.
-Yes, see you.

604
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,934
You should be nicer to Ms. Young.

605
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,104
I was nice to her.

606
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,952
I know that he has something
that can greatly threaten Yun-beom Lee.

607
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,122
But he's just been sitting on it
for three years.

608
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,999
What does Mr. Young have?

609
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,468
Hello? This is
Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang's office.

610
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,721
Pardon?

611
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,181
Oh, sure.

612
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,522
If he's someone from Hanjo,
Dong-jae must've seen him.

613
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,233
I've sent him these photos,
so I'll hear from him soon.

614
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,153
I'm sorry to interrupt.

615
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,071
You'll need to go upstairs now, Mr. Hwang.

616
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,489
Why? Where, exactly?

617
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,743
They've just announced the appointment
of our new chief prosecutor.

618
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,537
You should go. Here, I'll take that.

619
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,799
There's been a lot of changeovers.

620
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,638
Right, Jung-bon told me about
what happened to your captain.

621
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,057
Yes.

622
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,105
I'm going.

623
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,410
Yes, did you get the photos?

624
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,706
Hey, how can you send me
things like these?

625
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,917
Have you forgotten where I work now?

626
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,377
Do you know him?

627
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,295
No, I don't.
There's something more important.

628
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,465
-I think Mr. Lee has figured it out.
-Figured out what?

629
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,385
The fact that you and I
have been talking secretly.

630
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,053
I think he tested me.

631
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,180
Looks like he told me
and Ms. Yang different things

632
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,974
in order to see
which information leaks out.

633
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,476
You were too obvious
about tipping them off on Matsuyama...

634
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,397
It was your doing, wasn't it?

635
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,608
By the way, what are these photos about?
Who's this man?

636
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,610
He sneaked into my place.

637
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,570
When you were home? Did you see him?

638
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,240
No, I wasn't home at the time.
Eun-soo saw him.

639
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,118
-She saw him from behind...
-All right. Talk to you later.

640
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,455
-Headed to the Chief Prosecutor's office?
-Yes.

641
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,899
Who is this man?

642
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,876
You must be so excited.

643
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,963
Please help me out too.

644
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,381
Congratulations, Mr. Kang.

645
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,467
Thank you.

646
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,927
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

647
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,516
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
WON-CHUL KANG

648
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,352
Isn't it really cool?

649
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,689
There's been a series of surprising news
since this morning.

650
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,150
It doesn't mean they're hasty decisions.

651
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,695
Your name plaque is on its way too.

652
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,530
Mine?

653
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,075
You, division chiefs,
should meet each other.

654
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,452
This is the new chief
of Criminal Division Three,

655
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,245
Si-mok Hwang.

656
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,252
Congratulations, Mr. Hwang.

657
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,008
Congratulations, Mr. Hwang.

658
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,516
Congratulations.

659
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,688
Congratulations.

660
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,570
All right. I think that's enough.

661
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,696
Let's get back to work.

662
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,366
-You two, stay.
-Yes, sir.

663
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,498
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

664
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,128
One skipped a level
and became a chief prosecutor.

665
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,380
The same thing with the other one.
He's now a division chief.

666
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,965
Is everyone getting promoted like that?

667
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,884
You should've brought it up earlier.
The hierarchy is becoming messed up.

668
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,011
Why should hierarchy matter anyway?

669
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,888
We should just focus on our own work.

670
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,518
This means that one of us three will be
promoted to deputy chief prosecutor.

671
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,894
One of us three?

672
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,939
We have years on you.

673
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:30,989
Thank you two for the hard work.

674
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,742
Just think of it as you finally coming
back to your home.

675
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,244
I will, sir.

676
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,621
Were you surprised to see
someone else at your desk?

677
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,039
Yes, a little.

678
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,542
You'll move to the investigation division.

679
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,336
That way, you'll work more directly
with me than in Case Management.

680
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,213
-Sure.
-You're happy with that, right?

681
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:49,924
Are we good now?

682
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,552
Excuse me, sir.

683
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,345
Yes, Lieutenant.

684
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,932
What? What happened at the hospital?

685
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,185
A reporter sneaked into the ward.

686
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,936
Ga-young's mom asked me
what she should do,

687
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,689
but I have to go to the inspection office
now because of Chief Kim.

688
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:05,940
So does Detective Jang.

689
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,650
Are you busy now?

690
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,820
-I'm tied up now too.
-What's the matter?

691
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,115
With reporters, even one finding
can lead to everything being disclosed.

692
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,743
-All right. I'll figure something out.
-Is it about Ga-young?

693
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,245
-Want me to go there?
-Hold on.

694
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,372
Mr. Yoon says he can go.

695
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,333
All right. I'll call you later.

696
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,547
A reporter sneaked into the ward
Ga-young is in.

697
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,718
I'll go see if we should move her.
I'll call you.

698
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,390
I'm surprised that
it didn't happen sooner.

699
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:44,437
We're living in a world where we can know
what complete strangers ate all day.

700
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:46,648
Come sit with me.

701
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:00,828
Ten months.

702
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,292
Starting with the Travis County
District Attorney's Office in Texas,

703
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,419
you'll visit one state per month
for ten months.

704
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,506
You'll visit the US attorney's offices,
the FBI

705
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,049
and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

706
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,803
You can send me monthly reports via email.

707
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,097
Isn't it amazing?

708
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,808
Why do I have to think that it's amazing?

709
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,685
Let everything go.

710
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,396
Just leave for now
and become more qualified.

711
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,106
More qualified for what?

712
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,985
You have to question everything,
don't you?

713
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,826
When the Public Prosecutor General
offered me this position,

714
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,578
what do you think I thought?

715
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,997
"He must be scared shitless."

716
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,793
I butted heads with him last night,
and you ended up getting disbanded.

717
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,211
Then he summoned me,

718
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,840
so I thought he'd fire me for sure.

719
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,843
But he offered me this.

720
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,345
You've accepted a chalice with poison.

721
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,640
I refuse to drink from that chalice.

722
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:06,060
What do you mean? Are you saying
you won't accept the promotion?

723
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,439
It makes no sense in this situation.

724
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,523
I'm sorry.

725
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,943
Saying no to the promotion doesn't mean
you can keep your current position.

726
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,320
You'll have to leave no matter what.

727
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,699
Please give me some time.

728
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,242
I need ten days.

729
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,369
Why ten days?

730
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:24,954
Because I made a promise.

731
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,164
What promise?

732
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,666
I promised that I'd catch
the culprit in two months

733
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,293
and there are only ten days left now.

734
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,794
You're still hung up on that?

735
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,631
-Only you remember it.
-Because I remember it,

736
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,966
the culprit must remember it too.

737
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,264
Will you be able to keep the promise?

738
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,475
I have to.

739
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,483
I'll leave after ten days.

740
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,740
Go and keep your promise.

741
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:51,999
CHIEF PROSECUTOR
WON-CHUL KANG

742
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,295
Thank you.

743
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,174
Ms. Choi, the ward Ga-young is in...

744
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,718
My gosh, Mr. Division Chief is here.

745
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,011
Congratulations, Mr. Hwang.

746
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,264
-We won't move to a different office.
-What?

747
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,765
You have to move to your new office.

748
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,684
I'm not getting promoted.
Unpack everything.

749
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,686
Well, it's been posted on our intranet.

750
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,148
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

751
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,608
I'm on my way there now
and I just called the hospital.

752
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,318
They said Ga-young isn't there.

753
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,903
What? She's not there?

754
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,282
Did she get discharged?

755
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,910
No. Her mom didn't pick up, so I asked
the hospital staff to check for me.

756
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:31,956
The nurse said she saw Ga-young's mom
leaving with a man.

757
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,042
-Who's the man?
-She doesn't know.

758
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,586
What should I do?

759
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,672
Do you happen to know Ga-young's
mom's address? Shall I go there?

760
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,882
No, don't.

761
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,176
Go to the hospital first.

762
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:46,763
Where's Ga-young's file?

763
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,222
Oh, it's...

764
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,558
-Where did it go?
-It should be somewhere here.

765
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,977
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

766
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,355
-What's up?
-Mr. Hwang, do you have some time now?

767
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,857
Is it urgent?

768
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,275
I want to talk to you briefly.

769
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,735
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT

770
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,904
Well, I'll call you back in a bit.

771
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,491
-I have to go.
-Okay.

772
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,826
What's happening?

773
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,338
She's not around the hospital.
I'll find out where she could be.

774
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,229
Ga-young.

775
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,524
Is Ga-young's mother there?

776
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,360
Ga-young.

777
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,625
Lieutenant, I heard that
a man took Ga-young...

778
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:01,003
Mr. Hwang, I'm headed to Garwol-dong now.

779
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,214
Garwol-dong?

780
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,716
We got a call about a dead body.

781
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,928
It's Daejun Villa,
the place where Ga-young used to live.

782
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,806
A young woman's body was found there.

783
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,128
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

784
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,551
ALL EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

785
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,522
STRANGER

786
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,275
You have to track down where Ga-young is.

787
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,403
How can he be like that?

788
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,946
Even I feel sick to my stomach.

789
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:34,532
You said she was your colleague.
Will you be all right?

790
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:35,741
Please begin.

791
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:40,705
Even catching the killer won't erase
their wound from this, will it?

792
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,540
How's your head by the way?

793
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,794
Not now.

794
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,463
No...

795
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,048
Please...

796
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,471
