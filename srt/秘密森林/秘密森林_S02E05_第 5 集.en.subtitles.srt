1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,129
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,719
I'm sure everyone here
has never been a victim of a rental scam.

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,055
We caught the scammer.
We stayed up all night and caught him.

5
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,141
But the warrant still hasn't been issued.

6
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,435
Is there someone ill in that house though?

7
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,979
These really seem like labels
from a medicine bottle.

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,401
I want to know why a district
prosecutors' office is looking for him.

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,569
You take care of this.

10
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,780
But I want you to tag along
wherever he goes.

11
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,740
You brought it to our office,

12
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,949
so we should take care of it.

13
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,577
Do you know anything about
the Segok Police Station?

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,496
-In the shower there…
-"In the shower there…"

15
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,333
He died surrounded by colleagues
who had been bullying him.

16
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,087
-Damn it!
-It was suicide,

17
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,255
but it's homicide.

18
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,303
EPISODE 5

19
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,473
SEGOK POLICE STATION

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,228
The possibility
that it may not have been a suicide

21
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,396
must've been brought up
internally back then.

22
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,733
The people who found the victim

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,610
were the ones who bullied him.

24
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,570
You saw what they put him through.

25
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,532
You knew all about it,
so how could you not suspect it?

26
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,951
Everyone knew about his severe depression,

27
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,702
so we all assumed that was what caused it.

28
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,371
No one questioned it being a suicide.

29
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,455
I've never heard of it.

30
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,334
Even though he suddenly died
in the middle of investigating

31
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,419
-his corrupt teammates?
-Listen.

32
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,798
As for the bribery case,
we only found out about it

33
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,134
when the allegations surfaced
a few months after his death,

34
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,220
so how could we have made
the connection between the two back then?

35
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:25,395
Also, Sergeant Song was very stressed
by the transfer itself.

36
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,901
There were rumors going around
saying he was a nuisance

37
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,362
because he'd reported
the Chief of Dongducheon Police Station.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,865
Everyone knew about that.

39
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,658
That's not it.

40
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,077
Focus on the location, and not the reason.

41
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,248
Why did it have to be
Segok Police Station of all places?

42
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,920
Did everyone at Segok Police Station
know why?

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,508
Are you saying it wasn't a coincidence
that Sergeant Song was transferred there?

44
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,970
He's the rude junior officer
that told him off,

45
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,972
isn't he?

46
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,601
Correct, Officer Kim Su-hang.

47
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,687
He's the one whom Prosecutor Seo
is trying to track down.

48
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,065
His uncle is
the Chief of Dongducheon Police Station.

49
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:17,363
I went through the reports from 2017 and
found out that he's the Chief's nephew.

50
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,909
Which reports?
The ones about Sergeant Song?

51
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,037
Or the ones written
after the bribery allegations surfaced?

52
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,831
Are you hoping for the former?

53
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,375
No, ma'am.

54
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,880
If the Chief of Dongducheon Police Station
and his nephew were mentioned

55
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,590
in a report on Sergeant Song's case,

56
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:39,260
that means the one who wrote it suspected
it might have been a homicide, but no.

57
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,390
There are no reports
on Sergeant Song's death.

58
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,725
I guess the Intelligence Bureau

59
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,144
never got wind of Sergeant Song's death
to begin with.

60
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,312
Even the Intelligence Bureau

61
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,606
can't know these things
unless someone reports it.

62
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,901
It's not like every precinct
has an officer from the bureau.

63
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,530
Then what happened to
the Chief of Dongducheon Police Station?

64
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,074
After he was accused of the assault.

65
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,870
I think he was demoted to superintendent.

66
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,414
And he was transferred
to a neighboring precinct.

67
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,587
If that's why he intentionally transferred
Sergeant Song to where his nephew was…

68
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,592
Then the Chief is also…

69
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,887
Exactly. What a headache.

70
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,809
What's that?

71
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,979
The court records
from those officers' bribery trial.

72
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,941
I'm sure Sergeant Song wasn't brought up
during their trial.

73
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,150
No, he wasn't.

74
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,695
I didn't want to meet them
without any background information.

75
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,155
I figured I should know the details
about what went down

76
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,448
to be able to make a case,

77
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,158
so I visited the court first.

78
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,288
And Chief,

79
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,582
may I stop by the Anyang
Correctional Institution tomorrow?

80
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,084
Who are you going to see?

81
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,128
Sergeant Lee Dae-seong.

82
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,839
He was the highest-ranking officer
on the team after the Captain.

83
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,924
He's still serving time.

84
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,051
We don't know
Officer Kim's whereabouts at the moment,

85
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,594
so I'd like to meet him first.

86
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,264
Okay, go.
I'll track down Officer Kim for you.

87
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,849
Thank you, ma'am.

88
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,644
-Maybe it's not a bad thing.
-Pardon me?

89
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,313
If it was indeed suicide,

90
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,690
we must use it to our advantage.

91
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,109
We'll throw a hard punch.

92
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,487
"In the middle of the heated debate
over investigative authority,

93
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,531
the prosecution was targeting the police

94
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,035
by deliberately digging up a case
that was closed two years ago,

95
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,954
claiming that an officer
was murdered by his colleagues."

96
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,833
But it turns out they were wrong.

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,962
We'll say that the prosecution has
wasted their resources

98
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,630
in an attempt to frame the police.

99
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,633
"The messy war between
the top two investigative agencies."

100
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,470
There's a lot we can use against them.

101
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,057
That is all the more reason
why this can't be a homicide.

102
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,100
Understood, ma'am.

103
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,187
I'd like a copy of the court records.

104
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,067
Visiting the court first was a good call.

105
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,777
Oh, thank you.

106
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,240
LEE DAE-SEONG, ARRESTED
KIM SU-HANG

107
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,995
Later, we found out

108
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,832
that the chief's driver
was also from a powerful family.

109
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,126
You need some serious connections
to be assigned

110
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,836
as the official driver
of a police station.

111
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,046
The chief had forgotten about that
because he was angry.

112
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,133
I heard the main reason
he received punishment

113
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,594
was because that driver was
from a powerful family.

114
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,600
The Chief had it out for Sergeant Song
because he couldn't touch the driver.

115
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,272
Now I can see how
he could have been depressed.

116
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,608
No, that wasn't the reason.

117
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,779
This is what Sergeant Song told me.

118
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,325
"The higher-ups can't even speak up
against those with power,

119
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,828
yet they can't stand it
when their subordinates speak out.

120
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,329
They labeled me as a rebel

121
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,291
and transferred me because
they were afraid I'd cause trouble."

122
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,212
This was Sergeant Song's concern.

123
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,259
That we, the police,
shouldn't be like this.

124
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,223
I thought he was just a troublemaker,

125
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,059
but he was the one riddled with troubles.

126
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,218
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

127
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,806
I was on my way out
but I came back because of you.

128
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,849
I'm sorry, sir.

129
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,270
Nam In-tae in Criminal Division 3.

130
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,774
Is he the one at the western office

131
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,609
who refused to issue the warrant
for the rental scam case?

132
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,613
Yes. The suspect will be released
in six hours.

133
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,532
Right.

134
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,784
Yes, Nam In-tae. I remember him.

135
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,619
What do you want me to do though?

136
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,247
-Could you--
-Then why did you come here?

137
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,916
You need to take it up
with the western office.

138
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,710
They have their own chief prosecutor
who takes care of things there.

139
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,754
"You shouldn't handle it like this.
This is wrong."

140
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,881
You want me to pressure another office?

141
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,133
This man is charged with forgery
of legal documents and seals,

142
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,886
and violated the Resident Registration
Act. How can we let him walk?

143
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,183
Si-mok, I used to work there.

144
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,354
You're asking me
to exercise my influence on them.

145
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,107
Let's say someone calls us out of the blue

146
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,984
and tells us that he used
to be the chief here,

147
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,944
and orders us around. Is that fair?

148
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:35,491
Of course, I understand that Nam In-tae
is being a total jerk to the police.

149
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,909
But that's…

150
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,453
What the hell?

151
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,622
You're not even listening to me

152
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,541
when you made me come back to the office?

153
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,545
-You're right.
-So, you really weren't listening?

154
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,047
It's not that. Knowing that you worked

155
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,092
at the western office
before transferring here,

156
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,929
I thought to come here
for an immediate solution.

157
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,142
Right. I do have the power to provide you
with such a solution, but--

158
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,852
I guess I, too,
tried to use my connections

159
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,023
and reach out to someone
who had an influential position there.

160
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,359
Why are you beating yourself up
all of a sudden?

161
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,738
It's not like you were doing this
for your personal gain.

162
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,365
But I'm sure others
thought the same thing.

163
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,118
When they hired
a former judge as their lawyer

164
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,287
after removing the restriction line,

165
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,832
I'm sure they didn't think
they were doing something wrong.

166
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,878
I bet they just wanted to hire a lawyer
who could help them win the case.

167
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,422
Just like how I came here.

168
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:36,010
Did you believe
that you'd never do such a thing?

169
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,391
The thought itself
had never occurred to me.

170
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,645
I've never considered a situation
where I'd try to change the outcome

171
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,647
by pulling strings.

172
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,444
For this to turn into a custom
that is truly detrimental…

173
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,447
Let's say I did what you asked me to do.

174
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,076
Say I gave Nam In-tae an earful
and got the warrant issued.

175
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,703
But soon after that,
I find myself in a bind.

176
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,457
So I call you up and say,
"Hey, can you sort this out for me?

177
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,459
Help me out here."

178
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,418
Then what will you do?

179
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,129
Will you help me out?

180
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,593
"Come on. I helped you out last time.

181
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,970
Do you know what I went through
to sort that out for you?"

182
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,392
What if I keep asking for you
to scratch my back like I did yours?

183
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,021
I can't do that, sir.

184
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,483
See? Don't worry about it then.

185
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,485
It's not even a big deal.

186
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,245
When you look at special treatments
from a bureaucratic standpoint,

187
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,996
it's rather heinous.

188
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,958
But, in reality, it's natural.

189
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,056
If the prosecutorial process
begins with a warrant,

190
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,435
the power should be exercised by the one
that can prevent such misuse of authority.

191
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,605
Si-mok, I used to work there.

192
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,357
With the power to request warrants,

193
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,985
you will face pressure to prosecute
or not prosecute certain cases.

194
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,903
How do the police plan to tackle it?

195
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,781
You're asking me
to exercise my influence on them.

196
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,535
Do you have anything you want to say
to Sungmoon Daily?

197
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,246
Is there anything you'd like to add?

198
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,331
I'll tell them on your behalf.

199
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,667
You've already attacked them.

200
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,336
I read your rebuttal article.
Are you going at them again?

201
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,839
They published
a series of insulting articles,

202
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,340
so once is certainly not enough.

203
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,179
Those bastards…
Sungmoon, Hanjo, and Lee Sung-jae.

204
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,640
I'll be sure to take them down.
You'd like that, right?

205
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,643
Hanjo HQ would be thrilled to hear that.

206
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,230
The second article will come out tomorrow.

207
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,690
Post a comment on it.

208
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,869
-Sir, my car's over there…
-Go ahead.

209
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,245
-Goodbye, sir.
-Bye.

210
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,759
CHIEF OF WESTERN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

211
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,702
Ma'am, it's Dr. Cho Su-yeong.

212
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,579
Okay.

213
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,250
Hello, Doctor.

214
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,710
Sure.

215
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,885
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

216
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,012
I'm so sorry it took me a while
to get back to you.

217
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,140
It took me some time to find the drug
you had asked me to look into.

218
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,601
Was it hard to find?

219
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,312
Technically, the drug doesn't exist.

220
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,398
Can we meet?

221
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,963
It's a newly developed drug
that hasn't been approved yet.

222
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,174
Its development was first announced
back in 2014,

223
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,968
but it's still in its R&D phase,

224
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,345
so it was probably smuggled from the US.

225
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,849
It's used to treat
post-traumatic stress disorder.

226
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,895
My guess is that Chairman Lee Yun-beom
has developed PTSD

227
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,646
after being imprisoned for eight months.

228
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,691
But symptoms of PTSD can vary widely,

229
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,278
so I can't tell exactly what he's
suffering from based on the drug alone.

230
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,876
If he had to smuggle a drug
that hasn't even been named yet,

231
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,295
does this mean that he's in a lot of pain?

232
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,839
Yes, probably.

233
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,341
Knowing that,

234
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,385
how could he use his own father

235
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,262
and make it look as if he could
return anytime?

236
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,106
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,442
Do you think he'd even let Father
go to the hospital?

238
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,695
What if he doesn't let him leave the house
so that he won't be seen?

239
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,948
Even if they have a good doctor
visiting him,

240
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,742
it will be no better
than being treated at a hospital.

241
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,953
What kind of a son would do that?

242
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,372
Why take the fall for him
and even serve a sentence?

243
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,667
We need to find out
if it's just a minor condition

244
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,002
or if it's actually affecting
his mental capacity.

245
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,755
I believe that's our priority now.

246
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,384
He doesn't even want to see me,

247
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,470
so I can't ask him to tell me
how serious his condition is.

248
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,056
We've verified what kinds of risks
Mr. Lee is taking,

249
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,601
but whether we can use it
at the general shareholders' meeting

250
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,979
depends on how serious
the former chairman's condition is.

251
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,947
-The company intranet.
-Yes, ma'am.

252
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,241
Post a notice
about Lee Sung-jae's proposal there.

253
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,828
Write that he wishes to change the bylaw
so that the CEO can't serve

254
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,413
as the chairperson of the board.

255
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,166
That Hanjo Motors wants to oust
the head of Hanjo HQ

256
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,213
who makes the final call
for the entire group.

257
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,881
Make it sound as if we are under attack.

258
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,760
Make sure it pops up
the moment you connect to the intranet,

259
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,471
so that everyone who works for us
can see it, even the factory staff.

260
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,057
It'll no longer be some family feud
that doesn't affect the employees.

261
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,101
"A subsidiary is revolting against HQ.

262
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,271
Outside forces are interfering
in our company's business."

263
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,397
Give it some impact.

264
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,774
But don't try to appeal to emotion.

265
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,943
-Describe the proposal
-The new structure will

266
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,279
-and encourage employees
-turn Hanjo

267
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,781
-to participate by voting online
-into a subcontractor…

268
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,868
since the meeting will take place
during regular work hours.

269
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,912
And at the bottom, create another section

270
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,414
where all employees can vote

271
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,916
either for or against
the reappointment of the current CEO.

272
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,589
Hello, staff and workers of Hanjo.

273
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,176
If the proposal put forward
by Hanjo Motors passes

274
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,762
the governance between Hanjo Motors
and Hanjo HQ will change

275
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,846
and the new structure

276
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,058
will turn Hanjo into a subcontractor
that manufactures motor vehicles.

277
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,350
NOTICE REGARDING HANJO MOTORS' PROPOSAL

278
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,770
So, we would like the opinions
of our shareholding employees.

279
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,314
Since the meeting will take place

280
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,901
during regular work hours
and most staff won't be able to vote,

281
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,652
we advise that you participate

282
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,239
and exercise your rights by voting online.

283
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,952
SHOULD CEO LEE YEON-JAE
REMAIN AS THE CHAIRPERSON?

284
00:17:59,036 --> 00:17:59,995
THANK YOU
YOUR VOTE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED

285
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,082
Make the vote anonymous.

286
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,834
Since they'll be logged in
on the intranet,

287
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,545
they'll know what to do.

288
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,172
LEE YEON-JAE SHOULD REMAIN AS CEO

289
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,261
What are the owning shares at?

290
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,971
It's 3.14 percent.

291
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,976
That plus the shareholders on your side
is still just around 38.

292
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,520
We don't have enough.

293
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,898
If you want to win, you'll need 67 percent
of the shareholders at the meeting.

294
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,443
Sung-jae is the one
who needs that 67 percent, not me.

295
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,612
He needs two-thirds
of our shareholders to oust me.

296
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,365
If he manages to unite
all the shareholders who support him,

297
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,574
then he'll have 41 percent.

298
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,745
So, the seven percent that
the CEO of Sungmoon has will be crucial.

299
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,414
The decision will depend
on who gets his vote.

300
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,541
The CEO of Sungmoon again?

301
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,210
I think…

302
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,464
Also, make the announcement
that I'll recruit

303
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,633
former Direct Tax
and National Tax Service employees.

304
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,718
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,958
THURSDAY MARCH 21

306
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,132
…have invited Won Tae-hun
and Won Tae-jin to italy…

307
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,302
…despite being the vernal equinox…

308
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,471
…one lawyer was quoted as saying,

309
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,057
"The prosecution and police's debate
over investigative authority

310
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,644
will never be resolved if they fail
to reach an agreement this time."

311
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,897
The prosecution and the police

312
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,024
met earlier today
to discuss this very issue.

313
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,151
On the phone,
we have Prosecutor Woo Tae-ha

314
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,278
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
who attended

315
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,988
the meeting that took place earlier today.

316
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,531
Hello, Prosecutor Woo.

317
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,534
Hello, I'm Woo Tae-ha
from the Criminal Legislation Division.

318
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,038
The Council met for the first time today.
How did the meeting go?

319
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,624
I think we're off to a very good start.

320
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,376
The fact that the prosecution
and the police met is progress in itself.

321
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,962
Yes, absolutely.
As they say, "Well begun is half done."

322
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,172
It's a good start indeed.

323
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,133
However, this is a sensitive issue
for both organizations.

324
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,843
Were there any conflicts
during the meeting?

325
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,179
It was our first meeting,
and I believe conflicts

326
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,973
are unavoidable
during the negotiation process,

327
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:30,145
so we at the prosecution did our best
to listen to the police's requests first.

328
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,774
I see. Who attended the meeting today?

329
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,652
To tell you people representing
the prosecution, aside from myself,

330
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,529
there's the expert member,
Prosecutor Kim Sa-hyun.

331
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,449
And some of you may have heard
of this prosecutor before.

332
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,203
Prosecutor Hwang Si-mok
is also a member of this council.

333
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,248
The one who led the special investigation
two years ago, right?

334
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,500
I remember hearing his name
on the news again

335
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,670
when he recently filed a complaint
regarding the Tongyeong drowning case.

336
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:59,299
Right. He also participated in the special
investigation of the Prime Minister.

337
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,219
When it comes to impartiality
and objectivity,

338
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,554
I don't think anyone's more suited
for the job than he is.

339
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,682
So the star players of the prosecution

340
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,768
-have teamed up.
-He's a star player? Good for him.

341
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,230
-Lucky you.
-What did you talk about in the meeting?

342
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:11,056
ANYANG CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE

343
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,225
KNPA
REQUEST FOR VISITATION INFORMATION

344
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,769
Okay, all good.

345
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,854
Here you go.

346
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,107
-Oh, thank you.
-No problem.

347
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,609
INMATE VISITATION RECORDS

348
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:30,909
Do you know if anyone from the prosecution
tried to contact Lee Dae-seong recently?

349
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,869
Do you see anything there?

350
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,704
That report contains all the records

351
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,748
from the day he arrived here
up to yesterday,

352
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,375
so it should have everything.

353
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,630
Other than regular visits, did anyone
from the prosecution come by personally?

354
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,507
Not that I know of.

355
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,468
I see. All right.

356
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,511
Oh, there he is.

357
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,267
That must be Lee Dae-seong.

358
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,726
Let's go.

359
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,407
MAIN HALLWAY EXIT

360
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,908
Where's that?

361
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,326
Why do you ask?

362
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,955
The inmate is with a visitor
at the moment.

363
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,875
Only one visitor is allowed per day,
so you won't be able to see him today

364
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,293
even after that visitor leaves.

365
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,587
Who's visiting him
this early in the morning?

366
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,423
When he's done with that visitor,

367
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,091
let us in for a one-hour special visit.

368
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,844
He's a suspect in an unsolved case, okay?

369
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,221
All right. Please give me a moment.
Let me ask.

370
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,517
We should have booked in advance.

371
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,897
But the morning slots
are usually reserved for families.

372
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,150
Also, we were booked
for a visit yesterday.

373
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,535
-Excuse me.
-Step back, please.

374
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,038
Who are you?

375
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,708
Eyes forward. Forward!

376
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,376
I'm from the National Police Agency.

377
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,962
-Jeez.
-Damn it.

378
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,840
What's going on?
Are you here to investigate something?

379
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,990
All right, let's go. Move!

380
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,831
Let's go. You'll be late.

381
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,420
Wait!

382
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,718
Well…

383
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,905
Do you know an inmate
by the name of Lee Dae-seong?

384
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,407
He used to be a cop.

385
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,785
I did hear that there's an inmate
who used to be a police officer.

386
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,204
What's he like?

387
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,374
Do you know if he bullies
any of his cellmates?

388
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,918
Have you heard such rumors by any chance?

389
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,962
Well, I'm not his cellmate,

390
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,715
and we don't address each other
by our names.

391
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,925
I'm sorry.

392
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,597
I'm sorry, but do you mind giving us
some privacy?

393
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,932
-Not at all.
-Thank you.

394
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,898
Why are you sorry?
I'm the one who asked out of the blue.

395
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,489
I showed up out of the blue
and asked you a random question.

396
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,076
It's been a while

397
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,495
since I last saw someone from the outside.

398
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,796
When was the last time I saw you?

399
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,049
Three years ago?

400
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,467
Yes.

401
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,095
Have you been well?

402
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,597
Yes, you know.

403
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,390
Mr. Yoon, how have you…

404
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,487
So, are you doing alright?

405
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,158
Oh, I already asked you.

406
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,994
Yes, you did.

407
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,335
SENIOR INSPECTOR HAN YEO-JIN

408
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,837
You're a senior inspector now.

409
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,758
Oh, yes. Back then…

410
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,552
Never mind.

411
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,722
Congratulations.

412
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,560
I'm sorry.

413
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,571
Was it you, Lieutenant Han…
I mean, Senior Inspector Han,

414
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,658
that sent me the package a while ago?

415
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,451
What package?

416
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,121
The long johns and stuff like that.
Earlier this year.

417
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,207
No, it wasn't me.
You don't know who sent it?

418
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,710
No, the sender's name
wasn't on the package.

419
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,589
Maybe it's her.

420
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,092
You know, your ex-wife.

421
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,760
No, it's not her.

422
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,720
I see.

423
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,434
Hang in there, okay?

424
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,562
And look after your health.

425
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,314
You too.

426
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,900
Of course, you know me.

427
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,945
I'm sorry to interrupt.

428
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,406
Shall I cancel
your visitation appointment?

429
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,824
What? No.

430
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,785
That appointment is supposed
to be ending by now.

431
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,372
-I'll see you again.
-Hold on.

432
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,290
-Wait…
-Let's go.

433
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,002
You know where the room is, right?
It's right by the complaints office.

434
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,226
Why didn't I think to ask
if he needs anything? I'm such an idiot.

435
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,400
We're back, sir.

436
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,471
Ouch, it's hot!

437
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,349
I didn't know you were there.
I didn't see you.

438
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,892
What do you mean?

439
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,519
You should've been more careful.

440
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,229
Are you blaming me for this?

441
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,691
Are you blind? How could you pour
boiling water on someone?

442
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,152
-Sorry.
-Look at all the water.

443
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,030
You're flooding the floor.

444
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,246
Come on, wipe it up.

445
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,416
It'll be your fault if someone slips.

446
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,805
LEE DAE-SEONG

447
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,807
2 HA 9

448
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,311
You already know everything.

449
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,980
Several officers were bullying
a colleague.

450
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,941
It's not that hard to notice.

451
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,193
It's not like we tried to hide it.

452
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,488
So you did it openly?

453
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,116
Yes, we did that so Sergeant Song would
become stronger and survive in this field.

454
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,701
You know what our work is like.

455
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,877
Did you try to share the bribes
you received with Sergeant Song?

456
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,462
Were you pissed off because he refused

457
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,464
and tried to dig up dirt on you?

458
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,718
I guess you don't know what he was like.

459
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,303
I'd like to, but I can't

460
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,305
since he's not with us anymore.

461
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,267
Why are you

462
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,354
asking about someone
who's "not with us anymore"?

463
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,691
Because the only member
who didn't accept the bribes is dead.

464
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,818
He's not the only one.

465
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,486
Our captain didn't, either.

466
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,364
You're saying only the captain didn't know

467
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,324
what you guys were doing
for several years.

468
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,368
Are you protecting your captain,

469
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,287
or are you implying
that he's a clueless idiot?

470
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,040
Well, I admitted everything anyway.

471
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,877
We took five million won each month
from 16 bars and clubs.

472
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,007
So the five of us, except the captain,
could get one million each.

473
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,759
We received the money secretly

474
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,554
on days when we
and the business owners were off.

475
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,389
So our captain couldn't have known.

476
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,349
If he found out,
he would've stopped us for sure.

477
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,982
I came to talk to you first

478
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,775
before meeting anyone else.

479
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,028
I wanted to hear your story first.

480
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,490
You can tell me everything
you didn't get to say then.

481
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,783
That's what I'm doing now.

482
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,786
You and Officer Kim Su-hang
committed the same crime

483
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,122
and you both gave
exactly the same statement.

484
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,208
But he got six months,
and you got one year and eight months.

485
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,837
So why did you get over three times
his sentence?

486
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,007
It was Dongducheon Police Station
that led the investigation, right?

487
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,468
Officer Kim's uncle was the Chief there.

488
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,137
Doesn't that upset you?

489
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,268
You know, our station…

490
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,937
Okay, go on.

491
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,066
Our station's in Dongducheon.

492
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,610
That's why Dongducheon Station
took the case.

493
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,705
Why are you protecting Captain Baek?

494
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,083
Did he threaten you?

495
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,546
Senior Inspector, I feel so bad for you.

496
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,423
How bad were your colleagues

497
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,051
for you to think that I was
threatened by my own?

498
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,012
Did Captain Baek order you
to bully Sergeant Song?

499
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,889
What else did he order you to do?

500
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,809
Well, I'm sure you would've witnessed
a lot of terrible things

501
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,393
climbing to that position.

502
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,897
What else did he order besides
keeping your mouth shut about him?

503
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,858
Our work is pretty tough
and there are many temptations.

504
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,278
I understand, Senior Inspector.

505
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,531
The first one to find
Sergeant Song's body…

506
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,123
You keep talking about "our work."

507
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,500
What do you mean?

508
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,085
You know what it's like.

509
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,380
Everyone only cares about the results
when there are so many dos and don'ts.

510
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,633
We're told to offer good public service
but our own work environment is crap.

511
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,969
And there are temptations everywhere.

512
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,680
To be honest, let's say we receive

513
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,974
a million won each month.

514
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,351
Then when we retire in 20 or 30 years,

515
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,520
we'd have hundreds of millions saved up.

516
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,314
But does anyone applaud us
for refusing to accept it?

517
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,191
Do we get an award or what?

518
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,819
Police officers are people too.

519
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,697
They should offer us plenty of welfare
so we won't get tempted.

520
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,781
Hey.

521
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,578
I wanted to go easy on you
because you were a cop too,

522
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,122
but how dare you talk like that!

523
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,165
Hey!

524
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,793
You should at least be ashamed
to be in jail.

525
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,296
Do you think this is a picnic?
Is your brain full of crap?

526
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,714
Is this something to be proud of?

527
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,884
Stop trying to bring
your hardworking colleagues into this

528
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,844
by blaming everything on the government.

529
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,637
Save your crap for someone else

530
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,639
and just keep rotting in here.

531
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,058
And stop giving other hardworking
police officers a bad name.

532
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,646
That's just too bad.

533
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,025
Even if I want to rot in here,
I'm getting out in two months.

534
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,529
You should've visited me earlier,
when I had a long time left.

535
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,239
Don't be so sure of it.

536
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,158
If we find out you've done anything else,

537
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,076
I'll make sure you end up
rotting in here again.

538
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,953
I'll be the first one to visit you then.

539
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,622
Come on.

540
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,463
This isn't right.

541
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,758
It shouldn't be a homicide.

542
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,400
You like red beans, right?

543
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,597
I should've eaten breakfast before coming.

544
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,772
MALE VISITING ROOM

545
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,984
Hey, sitting here with you like this

546
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,819
reminds me of the old days.

547
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,488
But we've never done this before.

548
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,867
What do you mean?
You must be getting forgetful.

549
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,712
What will happen to you
when the council's over?

550
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,298
I guess I'll return to my original post.

551
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,216
Who'll fill your present post?

552
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,218
Someone will come, I guess.

553
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,973
I heard rumors about the Supreme
Prosecutors' Office hiring researchers.

554
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,017
Is that so?

555
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,893
You must've heard something.

556
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,480
I heard they're planning
on hiring researchers

557
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,649
specializing in criminal investigation.

558
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,651
So you heard it too?

559
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,362
The Prosecutor General said it himself,
so they'll hire a lot, right?

560
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,032
I heard they're even selecting candidates
who trained overseas too.

561
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,908
But I don't know much
about the requirements.

562
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,496
How did you get your position?

563
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,582
How?

564
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,376
I'm sure you didn't get here
by sucking up to people.

565
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,170
How did you climb up that high?

566
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,547
Why don't you ask Chief Woo?

567
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,427
What does Chief Woo like?

568
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,387
Any hobbies? Golf?

569
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,222
Where does he usually play?

570
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,140
I don't know.

571
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:15,102
How come? You're in his team.
Can't you be more sincere?

572
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,564
Oh, he seemed to like beef intestines.

573
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,734
What?

574
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,158
Is that good?

575
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,452
It's salty.

576
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,998
So where will you go after the council?

577
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,416
Wonju, I guess.

578
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,795
They send us all over the place.

579
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,340
They say prosecutors
from the criminal division

580
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,634
will be picked
to specialize in public safety,

581
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,762
but you can't keep working in the capital.

582
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,891
Right.

583
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,435
Why do you want to come to
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

584
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,444
I worked in the western office,
and now I'm working in Uijeongbu.

585
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,196
Where would I go next?

586
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,032
You'll be sent to a rural area

587
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,743
since they've banned us from working
at the capital for too long.

588
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,374
You don't feel a tad bit sad
even if you're sent far away,

589
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,375
do you?

590
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,876
No.

591
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,672
We get relocated every two years,

592
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,216
and it's not like I can take
my kids with me every time.

593
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,302
So my wife and I…

594
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,054
I haven't even heard from her lately.

595
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,722
If I keep getting relocated like this,

596
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,974
I'll be away for at least
seven or eight years.

597
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,851
Then how old would my kids be?

598
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,895
I'll be seeing them once in middle school
and once in high school.

599
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,022
And I won't have enough time
to visit them often.

600
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,275
And if I become
an Assistant Chief, it'll be worse.

601
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,776
They relocate every year.

602
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,612
I studied my ass off, but I'm always
packing and unpacking.

603
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,864
It's ridiculous.

604
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,324
Other people might think
we're all that, but--

605
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,453
It's necessary to stop us
from colluding with people in the region.

606
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,080
Do you think relocations
can stop everything?

607
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,040
People can do that anywhere.

608
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,042
Why do I want to go there?

609
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,170
Why do people want good positions?

610
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,671
I think this system

611
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,632
is making even those who are
not interested forcibly climb the ladder.

612
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,759
The fact that they're prosecutors

613
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,720
only means that they wanted
to have good careers.

614
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,680
When people like that
are constantly relocated,

615
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,057
how can they not want to climb
to a higher position.

616
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,267
Jeez.

617
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,819
Why is it taking so long?

618
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,780
I'm guessing
it's another special visitation.

619
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,367
You don't think Captain Baek
is here, do you?

620
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,871
What if he's here to warn him
about us visiting?

621
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,834
It must be over.

622
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,382
What? He refused our visitation.

623
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,968
Was it really Captain Baek?

624
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,988
Is it a coincidence? Yongsan Station
has nothing to do with this.

625
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,907
She's not working there anymore.

626
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,331
How was the visit?

627
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,959
You must be satisfied.

628
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,919
I came here for nothing, though.

629
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,548
You see, a certain police officer
came earlier today

630
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,342
and visited the prisoner
I was planning to see.

631
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,803
I see.

632
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,014
You told him to refuse
visitation from the prosecution, right?

633
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,936
Lee Dae-seong just refused our visitation.

634
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,981
What could have happened?

635
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,317
What could have he been told
for him to refuse our visit?

636
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,282
Seeing as you're here,

637
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,577
you probably already heard
why I summoned Captain Baek.

638
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,454
This was obviously my next stop,
so you beat us to it.

639
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,581
Right?

640
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,958
I heard about the Uijeongbu office,

641
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,711
but I didn't know the Supreme
Prosecutors' Office was involved.

642
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,504
No, you're mistaken.

643
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,632
Him?

644
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,344
He's just my assistant.

645
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,225
You can't summon him officially, right?

646
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,811
Why else would you two

647
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:29,231
come all the way here yourselves
when you can just summon him?

648
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,691
It's not that far.

649
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,026
Summoning an officer

650
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,403
who's working within your jurisdiction
isn't a big deal,

651
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,448
but summoning a prisoner currently
serving a sentence is something else.

652
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,743
So the prosecution

653
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,579
only has assumptions

654
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,664
and nothing concrete yet.

655
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,499
Do you really think so?

656
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,628
We might want different results,

657
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,838
but it's our duty to get to the truth.

658
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,299
Why don't we share what we know?

659
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,094
What do you know? You go first.

660
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,679
Do you even know anything?

661
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,056
-Bye, then.
-Wait!

662
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,352
Captain Baek accepted the bribes too.

663
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,980
-How are you sure of that?
-I checked with a business owner myself.

664
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,901
But all six members of the team have said
that their captain was innocent

665
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,194
and that he wasn't involved.

666
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,571
Do you think
they're doing this out of loyalty?

667
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,739
They were scared.

668
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,408
Just what could their captain have done?

669
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:23,994
How was the visit?

670
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,080
What did Lee Dae-seong say?

671
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,166
He was quite talkative.

672
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,211
But all he did was try to justify himself
and blame others.

673
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:37,841
Hang on.

674
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,928
Hello? Oh, I'm still in Anyang.

675
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,098
Oh, really?

676
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,850
Hey, stop her! She's getting away!

677
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,644
Hey!

678
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,482
That's not fair. I gave her something!

679
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,735
Was that even a real phone call?
Maybe she just set an alarm.

680
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,695
I think that was the Chief.

681
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,280
What Chief?

682
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,366
Are you heading out now?

683
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,994
Go to Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial
Police Agency immediately.

684
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,331
The senior assisting officer
in Intelligence Division One

685
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,125
will give you a file
if you tell him I sent you.

686
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,420
Grab that file and bring it
to the address I send you.

687
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,132
And don't open it.

688
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,300
Just bring it, all right?

689
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,347
We should save that for emergencies.

690
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,516
No, it's time we used it.

691
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,226
That idiot.

692
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,603
How dare he sue me?

693
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,696
And don't open it.

694
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,990
Just bring it, all right?

695
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,367
Han Yeo-jin is with
the Intelligence Bureau?

696
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,412
Well, I guess we could say that.

697
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,122
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

698
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,915
I should have gotten more out of her.

699
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,379
Hey, what are you going to do?

700
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,006
What do you mean?

701
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,425
Chief Woo told you not to get caught.

702
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,427
But we ran right into
the Intelligence Bureau.

703
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,972
Do you really think Chief Woo
wouldn't have known

704
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,599
that the police would find out?

705
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,523
You really are his star player,
aren't you?

706
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,734
At first I thought

707
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,695
he wanted us to compete
against each other.

708
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,906
Well, he did sound like that.

709
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,328
Yes, Senior Inspector.

710
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,538
What?

711
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:33,916
Alright.

712
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,835
Was that her? What did she say?

713
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,964
She asked why you chose this place
as your next stop.

714
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,675
-What does that mean?
-That's it.

715
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,010
And that she didn't run away.

716
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,516
Hey.

717
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,352
Well…

718
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,439
You should put in a word about me
to Chief Woo.

719
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,565
I already do.

720
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,235
-Really?
-I'll report what we did today too.

721
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,737
Jeez.

722
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,375
You haven't been to the eastern office
since you've arrived here, right?

723
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,043
We should go see the Chief Prosecutor.

724
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,628
We should get together sometime.

725
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,588
Yes, Chief.

726
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,716
-Are you in Anyang?
-Yes.

727
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,552
Come to the National Assembly building.

728
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,762
You mean Yeouido?

729
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:30,847
It'll take some time, though.

730
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,350
Me too. I'll see you
at the Members' Office Building.

731
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,268
Yes, sir.

732
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,188
…the prosecution has cleared him

733
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,607
of the hiring scandal.

734
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,443
The assemblyman Nam Jae-ik

735
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,488
was accused of pressuring
financial companies to hire his son.

736
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,656
But the prosecution…

737
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,200
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JAE-IK
CLEARED OF SUSPICION IN THE HIRING SCANDAL

738
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,178
Yes, Assistant Chief Kim.

739
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,306
You said you have a meeting all day.

740
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,225
I'll do it. Yes, I'm with
Prosecutor Hwang now.

741
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,019
All right.

742
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,316
There's an assemblyman
named Nam Jae-ik in there.

743
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,777
I just read the article about him.

744
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,738
He was cleared of suspicion.

745
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,325
He just sued the director of the
Police Investigation Bureau.

746
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,744
The Director from the council?

747
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:34,786
Yes.

748
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,207
There were rumors that his son
was illegally hired at a bank.

749
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,460
The Director investigated it himself

750
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,129
and concluded that he was guilty,
so he forwarded the case.

751
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,797
That was a year and a half ago.

752
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,550
And he was cleared of suspicion today.

753
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,179
And why did Assemblyman Nam
sue the director?

754
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,264
He says the director
targeted him specifically

755
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,059
when there wasn't any evidence,
and that it was political slander.

756
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,853
Isn't Assemblyman Nam

757
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,938
the chairman of the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee?

758
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,815
That's why he says he was targeted.

759
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,027
Even if the new bill gives the police
more investigative rights,

760
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,030
the Legislation and Judiciary Committee
could just reject it.

761
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,699
And since he's a former prosecutor,

762
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,993
the police don't want him as the chairman.

763
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,371
He claims that the director targeted him
to remove him from his position.

764
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,497
You get the idea, right?

765
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,588
So, the Investigation Bureau investigated
whether an assemblyman's son

766
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,090
was illegally hired,

767
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,841
and he was cleared of suspicion today.

768
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,761
And the assemblyman sued the director,

769
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,179
saying he was targeted on purpose.

770
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,097
Yes, that's it.

771
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,015
But why am I here?

772
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,435
We're going to go to Assemblyman Nam,

773
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,437
and I'm going to humor him.

774
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,941
I'll try to calm him down and convince him
to drop the charges.

775
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,318
And if he doesn't listen to me,

776
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,279
you'll wait until I signal you,
and then recite

777
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,948
the Criminal Code Article 123.

778
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,866
Abuse of Authority?

779
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,412
Shouldn't we tell him the opposite?

780
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,497
That's what I mean. We're going to say,
"Hey…"

781
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,833
We should be a bit more formal. Tell him,

782
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,794
"You want to sue the director
for abusing his authority,

783
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,213
but even if he was targeting you…"

784
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,884
"But even if you say he was targeting you,

785
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,722
you're still the chairman of
the Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

786
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,098
You of all people should know

787
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,101
how hard it is to prove
if someone has abused their authority.

788
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,812
Suing him won't get you anything."

789
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,689
Tell that to him clearly.

790
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,859
And also remind him that his term
isn't a long one,

791
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,237
so suing the Investigation Bureau director
could just make him lose his post.

792
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,367
Suing the Director would make the police
investigate even more thoroughly

793
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,494
to prove it wasn't just a scheme.

794
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:43,540
Shouldn't I ask if he'll be okay
with them revealing the truth?

795
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,875
Just do as I say.

796
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:46,960
Yes, sir.

797
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:17,032
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JAE-IK

798
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,716
Assemblyman Nam's here, right?

799
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,844
I'm sorry, sir,
but you can't meet him right now.

800
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,012
I'll tell him you were here.

801
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:40,138
It'll only take a minute.

802
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,395
Yes. Yes, sir.

803
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,899
You may go in now.

804
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,404
-We'll join her…
-Sir.

805
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,244
It's Woo Tae-ha, sir!

806
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,453
Don't let him in!

807
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,178
You know Ms. Han, right?
You've worked with her before.

808
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,555
You know her well, right?

809
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,723
-Yes.
-I'm certain she's not here on her own.

810
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,768
Whether it's for the director
or Choi Bit, she brought something.

811
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,771
That envelope she was holding.
Find out what it is.

812
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,357
You have to find out what it is. Got that?

813
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,239
It all began with the rumors
within the Bundang bank

814
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,408
about new employees who were hired

815
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,660
when they didn't even pass the screening.

816
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,162
The Gyeonggi Nambu police
initiated the investigation,

817
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:50,458
and the ones who bribed the bank
and the staff who received them

818
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,044
were forwarded to the Seongnam Branch
where Prosecutor Ryu was.

819
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,297
Yes, they were indicted
and are on appeal now.

820
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,924
One of the new employees
was Assemblyman Nam's son.

821
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,094
And rumors spread
that he was the key figure

822
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,054
and that the others were just small fish.

823
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,765
So they started investigating
Assemblyman Nam as well.

824
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,436
The problem is that people were saying
the Nambu police couldn't be trusted.

825
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,064
They would've found out about Assemblyman
Nam's son during the investigation

826
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,901
but they left out that part on purpose.

827
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,611
So the Investigation Bureau

828
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,405
investigated the case instead
of the Nambu police.

829
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,824
And Prosecutor Ryu
was put in charge again.

830
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,451
So what was the police's conclusion?

831
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:25,911
Guilty.

832
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,582
But according to Prosecutor Ryu,

833
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:35,795
their investigation was a bit lacking
to prove that he was guilty.

834
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,839
That sounds like something
we'd tell the reporters.

835
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,549
Is that an announcement or what?

836
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,135
Back then, Assemblyman Nam

837
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,804
was a secretary of the
Budget and Account Committee.

838
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,849
The son of the Budget and Account
Committee's secretary

839
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:52,646
is hired at a bank even though
he didn't even pass the screening.

840
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,982
And this is supposed to be
a groundless rumor?

841
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,779
Prosecutor Ryu received phone calls
from a lot of people.

842
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,739
Even from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

843
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,408
-Damn it.
-They just expressed concerns at first,

844
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,911
but in the end,
they all told him to keep quiet.

845
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,207
When was that?

846
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,416
Last July.

847
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,460
Anyway, Prosecutor Ryu's point is

848
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,214
that he was transferred to our office
while investigating Assemblyman Nam,

849
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:23,843
and that it was his replacement
who cleared him of suspicion,

850
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,137
so however the assemblyman
and the police react to it,

851
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,472
he can guarantee

852
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,851
that it won't cause any trouble
for our office.

853
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,605
And I've already told Prosecutor Ryu
not to talk about

854
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,733
receiving calls
from anyone regarding the case.

855
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,861
What would the kids learn
from seniors like that?

856
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:47,409
Those who made those calls?
Or me who told him to keep his mouth shut?

857
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,665
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office,
last July…

858
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,418
It was Woo Tae-ha.

859
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,132
Assemblyman Nam was in the 17th class
at the institute. Could it have been Woo?

860
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,634
That's too many years apart.

861
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,595
Why would they have told him
to keep quiet?

862
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,974
They had to cover it up,
so his son could get the job

863
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,101
and the father could become
the committee chairman.

864
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,603
He's more useful
to the Supreme Office that way.

865
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,524
It has nothing to do with our office.
Period.

866
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,736
DOCUMENTS FOR APPROVAL

867
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,325
Put this over there.

868
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,590
She's coming!

869
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:20,311
There are 3,400 intelligence police
officers in this small country.

870
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,897
And intel they gather every day

871
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,066
all goes to Choi Bit.

872
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,068
Even the intel regarding surveillance

873
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,319
and national security.

874
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,324
I'm pretty sure it's not the
director in that room right now.

875
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,786
If it were me, I wouldn't come here
to meet a man who is suing me.

876
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,498
Choi Bit must've ordered Han Yeo-jin
to bring something for her.

877
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,667
It must be dirt on Nam Jae-ik.

878
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,961
Something they could use as leverage.

879
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:46,921
Whatever it is,

880
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,466
find out.

881
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,969
The committee chairman
can't fall into the hands of the police.

882
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,804
Even if we let the police
have their way at the council

883
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,097
because of public opinion,

884
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,726
the committee can stop the proposal
from reaching the National Assembly.

885
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,438
There are various ways a bill
can be submitted to the Assembly.

886
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,149
But the only way it can be passed

887
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,692
is to vote yes or no.

888
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:11,279
Here, there are 48 assembly members
who passed the bar exam.

889
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,780
And 7 who used to be the police.

890
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,409
Why else would Kim Sa-hyun
have lunch here every day?

891
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,497
How much did you cover up?

892
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,625
You should go out and meet reporters.

893
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,878
You should be telling everyone

894
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:30,632
that a police representative
who joined the council,

895
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,967
a director of a bureau,
got sued for unjust investigation.

896
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,138
Shouldn't you encourage the assemblyman
to sue him, not stop him?

897
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,182
Be quiet.

898
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,852
You said the investigative rights
is our territory,

899
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,479
and that we have full control over it.

900
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,107
If the director is sued,
the council will be postponed.

901
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,568
Then this turf war
will die down, won't it?

902
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,366
Or it could be stopped altogether.

903
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,953
A new investigation could be launched
with the lawsuit,

904
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,205
revealing that the chief
of the prosecution at the council

905
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,748
covered for a corrupt assemblyman.

906
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,750
As dishonorable as it may be,

907
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,418
it will put an end to the council.

908
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,336
Hey!

909
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,174
You were directly involved in covering up
Assemblyman Nam's corruption.

910
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,135
That's why you had to run here yourself,

911
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,429
while the director who was sued didn't.

912
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,394
No, it's not.

913
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,526
The police have chosen to threaten

914
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,653
the committee chairman to use him.

915
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:37,740
I guess the prosecution already chose
to gain his favor a long time ago.

916
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,997
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE

917
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,039
Damn it.

918
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,050
She's empty-handed.

919
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,637
Connections are a part of your skill.

920
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,389
Use it.

921
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,186
You peeked inside the envelope, right?

922
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,229
No.

923
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,275
But why aren't you asking any questions?

924
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,361
I'll tell you later.

925
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,504
Using him like that could cause trouble.

926
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,130
You have to use him wisely.

927
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,840
We demand that Hanjo…

928
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,843
Let's welcome my father with them.

929
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,805
I may even have to view some reports
that predate these.

930
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,473
What is it that you're looking for?

931
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,309
Why do you have to keep being so stubborn
and bother those around you?

932
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,977
Han Yeo-jin can't beat us to it again.

933
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,729
Just wait and see who finds him first.

934
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:35,024
She would be betraying her boss
and leaking police intel.

935
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,443
What intel could someone like him
get from the police?

936
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,570
Are you going to blow the whistle?
What then?

937
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,407
Is that why you left
the Violent Crimes Division?

938
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:48,162
