1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,004
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,094
What do you think will happen if you drive
after drinking this much alcohol?

4
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,180
His name is Park Gwang-su.
He died last April

5
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,016
while driving on a highway in Namyangju.

6
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,435
His blood-alcohol level was 0.018 percent.

7
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,978
Could it be that again?

8
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,814
My boss used to be the chief there.

9
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,693
Things would have been different
if the culprit really was a cop.

10
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,697
From his perspective, you ruined
everything that was going well.

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,115
And from my perspective too.

12
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,993
That's right. We need insurance too.

13
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,703
I'll take care of it now.

14
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,039
Let's meet him together.

15
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:25,001
Are you worried I might use you
as a scapegoat and escape by myself?

16
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,504
What's going on?

17
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,924
Why did Mr. Park die?

18
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,967
I'm the one who wants to ask…

19
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,434
I'm the one who wants to ask

20
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,394
what you did

21
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,356
to Mr. Park.

22
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,945
He seemed very desperate.

23
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,491
-As if he'd die if it fell through.
-Thanks for coming. Let's go in.

24
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,576
He even drank that day.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,247
Just as I was wondering
why he'd asked me to join him there,

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,416
he brought up Hanjo's lawsuit,

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,918
so I got up to leave.

28
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,838
Then he broke out in a sweat
and asked me to stay.

29
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,714
But you refused and left despite that,

30
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,758
so he must have collapsed from the shock.

31
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,013
I suppose that's how desperate
Mr. Park was.

32
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:23,309
He had a heart attack while driving
to chase someone who had already left.

33
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,688
He didn't look too well
even at the vacation home,

34
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,107
but who knew that would happen?

35
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,945
Did you not receive any update regarding

36
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,029
what had happened?

37
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,701
I could tell that it fell through
and that the lawyer had failed.

38
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,245
Considering the time of his death,

39
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,039
I knew he didn't have enough time
to pull it through.

40
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,627
But I didn't want to draw attention to it,
so I just let it go.

41
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,838
Then that thing happened
to Prosecutor Seo.

42
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,677
Why did you let Prosecutor Hwang
take the case?

43
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,305
Because that would put me in control

44
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,349
and keep me in the loop
with everything he finds out.

45
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,314
Because I knew what he was up to,

46
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,109
I was able to make sure Mr. Park's wife
would keep her lips sealed.

47
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:17,655
That means he's already investigating
Mr. Park's case.

48
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,077
Strictly speaking, I just had him join
the disappearance investigation.

49
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,455
I never asked him
to look into Mr. Park's case.

50
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,415
And he'll take his hands off it.

51
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,334
I've removed him from the investigation.

52
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,546
A big fight broke out apparently.
They're all there now.

53
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,092
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE MISSING CASE

54
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,428
We need the meeting room.

55
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,369
What are they going to do?

56
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,332
About this.

57
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,919
This…

58
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,382
May I stop by your office now?

59
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,889
-Where did you get this?
-It's accounting fraud, isn't it?

60
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,229
It looks like they purchased
66,000 treasury shares.

61
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,939
And during the same period,

62
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,276
they moved their liquid assets
of the same value.

63
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,279
I knew it.
I heard you're well-versed in finance.

64
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,781
I'd say this is far worse
than an accounting fraud.

65
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,826
This isn't something
you can obtain easily.

66
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,077
Where did you get it?

67
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,415
Your office is auditing
Hanjo Engineering at the moment, right?

68
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,169
Did your client give you this?
Ms. Lee Yeon-jae?

69
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,797
-Jeez.
-Mr. Oh.

70
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,925
Do you work for her?

71
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,679
Come on. They have a huge legal team.
Why would they hire me?

72
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,848
One of Hanjo's subsidiaries
is being audited

73
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,725
for violating the accounting standards,

74
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,061
and I'm looking at
the chairwoman's financial statement.

75
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,479
You call this a coincidence?

76
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,818
Mr. Kang.
You don't like Lee Sung-jae, right?

77
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,654
You haven't

78
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,906
answered one of my questions.

79
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,831
We simply contacted Chief Choi later on
to ask her how everything had gone.

80
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,542
She was the chief there,
so we were following the protocol.

81
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,087
The following day,
I got his call while at work.

82
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,091
He asked me what was going on
with the lawyer who died

83
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,094
from a heart attack the night before
in Namyangju,

84
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,265
so I told the officers who were
overseeing the case to handle it quietly.

85
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,517
But that wasn't even necessary

86
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,271
because it's not uncommon
to get a heart attack while driving.

87
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,402
May we assume that it's now our turn
to ask you questions?

88
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,996
Who told you my name?

89
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,957
You just said

90
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,461
that you don't understand
how I got involved in this.

91
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,381
I wasn't the one who Hanjo

92
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,343
secretly tried to get in touch with
to gain the upper hand in the lawsuit.

93
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,137
Had the organizer of the meeting
not died like that,

94
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,474
I wouldn't even have known
that such a thing happened in Namyangju.

95
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,517
So why

96
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,187
did you order Mr. Oh Ju-seon
to approach me?

97
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,773
Why not Chief Woo?

98
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,696
Because someone told me about you,
Chief Choi.

99
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,739
Seo Dong-jae?

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,163
Then he must've told you everything.

101
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,834
So why would you ask us--

102
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,960
You're right.

103
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,088
"The chief of Namyangju Station
wanted it buried."

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,215
That much I heard.

105
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,262
So I assumed Chief Choi
was at the vacation home too.

106
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,265
But she's saying she didn't.

107
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,898
And he didn't give me any details.

108
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,360
But then, Prosecutor Seo went missing.

109
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,780
I would have much rather dealt
with Prosecutor Seo.

110
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,782
He'd at least have understood things.

111
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,245
If he was around, you could be
in a very difficult position now.

112
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,040
He has quite a big mouth.

113
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,750
Prosecutor Hwang isn't like that.

114
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,712
Right.

115
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,630
He is discreet indeed.

116
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,318
That day…

117
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,531
Was someone from Hanjo
around the vacation home?

118
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,785
I'm sure you wanted to know
how everything was going.

119
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,288
And security was important.

120
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,543
Are you asking if I sent someone there
to monitor the situation?

121
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,086
Yes.

122
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,964
That's odd.

123
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,675
Why are you fixated on
whether someone was watching?

124
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,846
I'm sure there was nothing
others shouldn't see.

125
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,767
Even if things had gone south,

126
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,395
you would have been able to completely
separate Hanjo from Mr. Park.

127
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,524
But for us,
just having been there that day

128
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,192
could get us in trouble,

129
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,194
so we shouldn't have been seen.

130
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,655
I see. Chief Choi.

131
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,908
Did you ask me that
out of concern for Chief Woo?

132
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,288
Hanjo had nothing to do
with that meeting in Namyangju.

133
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,625
It was something
Mr. Park had arranged personally.

134
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,252
I know nothing about it.

135
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,172
Are you saying no one from Hanjo
was around the scene that day?

136
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,591
Goodness, am I being interrogated?

137
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,637
-Of course not.
-Well, I should make it clear.

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,222
Correct, not a single person.

139
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,812
Thank you for your answer.

140
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,107
Then let me make it clear too.

141
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,985
Prosecutor Seo was overseeing
Namyangju Station's cases.

142
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,822
After taking notice of the case,
he started bugging the officer in charge.

143
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,408
That's why the officer said to him,

144
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:40,121
"My boss told me to just take care of it.
That's why I closed the case quickly."

145
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,331
That's all.

146
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,250
But he mentioned alcohol.

147
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,710
That's been sorted out too.

148
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,130
That was also something
that Mr. Park's family had told him.

149
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,593
And as for this case,
Prosecutor Hwang won't dig deeper.

150
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,180
He said that Park Gwang-su and
Prosecutor Seo's case has no connection.

151
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,146
It looks like the two of you already
took great care of everything,

152
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,858
from Mr. Park's family
to keeping Prosecutor Hwang under control.

153
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,818
Well done.

154
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,453
Do you think

155
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,873
she arranged this because she wasn't sure?

156
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,876
Or was she fishing for information?

157
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,920
Maybe both.

158
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,214
But you know…

159
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,258
"I would have much rather dealt
with Prosecutor Seo."

160
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,885
Odd wording, right?

161
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,515
He said the wording was odd
and that maybe you were fishing for info.

162
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,602
To me, his wording was even odder.

163
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,857
"If he was around, you could be
in a very difficult position now."

164
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,989
Are you tired?

165
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,284
What about the other side?

166
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,626
Lee Sung-jae has a lot of enemies.

167
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,546
Right, but who are his enemies?

168
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,757
And why would they give you this?

169
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,177
To find the right person for the job.
This is like a divine intervention.

170
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,805
It was meant to end up in your hands.

171
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,014
Unlike me,

172
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,435
you don't have to worry about being
found dead somewhere

173
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,270
even if you look into this.

174
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,485
Will you let this opportunity go
because of Lee Yeon-jae?

175
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,531
Have you forgotten about how Lee Sung-jae
and Sungmoon insulted our colleague?

176
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,615
Why did that happen?

177
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,453
Because you couldn't even lay a finger
on Lee Sung-jae despite all the evidence.

178
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,538
How was the evidence obtained?

179
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,749
Mr. Lee Chang-jun gave up his life for it.

180
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,002
Mr. Kang. This is our chance.

181
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,131
What if Mr. Lee Chang-jun gave you this.
Then what would you do?

182
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,386
Then all this persuasion
wouldn't have been necessary.

183
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,141
Also, Chang-jun would not have brought
just one page of the document.

184
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,519
I can't give it to you
unless you make up your mind.

185
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,563
Make your decision.

186
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,534
Okay.

187
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,999
To be honest, I'm not sure

188
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,252
whose head will be on the chopping block,

189
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,339
between Lee Sung-jae and you.

190
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,238
He'll take the bait. Otherwise,
he would've left as soon as he heard it.

191
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,176
I'm sure we'll get a call

192
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,804
from the eastern office.

193
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,230
I'm exhausted.

194
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,733
You've been under a lot of stress.

195
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,610
It's exhausting.

196
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,821
I wonder how

197
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,117
he took care of everything alone.

198
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,836
Yeon-jae.

199
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,163
Then why did you make the call?

200
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,165
So that he'd be found soon

201
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,251
and not be left on the road for too long.

202
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,680
Hey, you're still here?

203
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,557
I thought you already left.

204
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,518
-How's your stomach?
-Pardon?

205
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
You already forgot?
Then you must be okay now.

206
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,941
Oh, yes. I'm fine now.

207
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,068
I'm glad. I'll see you tomorrow.

208
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,904
-Wait, sir.
-Yes.

209
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,241
Do you know what the central office
is planning to do with Jeon Gi-hyeok?

210
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,577
Jeon, what? Who is that?

211
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,621
The fake witness.

212
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,081
Oh, that punk.

213
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,833
We don't need to arrest him, you know.

214
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,418
By the way, why did he do that?

215
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,881
Apparently, he just wanted the money.
He had nothing to lose anyway.

216
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,675
Jeez, what a nutjob.

217
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,136
Right, what about the culprit's number?

218
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,472
Weren't you able to track
the number or location?

219
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,432
Looks like he used a burner phone

220
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,394
and sent it from somewhere
along Subway Line 2.

221
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,146
Oh, boy. Then it'll be hard
to track them down.

222
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:26,276
But the police watch was in the photo.
That's a fact.

223
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,905
That means we can still suspect
that the culprit is a cop.

224
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,615
Right, maybe.

225
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,350
That means we can still suspect
that the culprit is a cop.

226
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,859
About the witness, Jeon Gi-hyeok…

227
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,487
I heard he had criminal records. I want
to know which offices were in charge.

228
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,449
And Seongnam in 2017.
Both for speculative acts.

229
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,951
Which division in Seongnam?

230
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,245
Criminal Division Two.

231
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,457
Assistant Chief Prosecutor Kim Sa-hyun.

232
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,085
Dispatched from
the Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

233
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,505
SEONGNAM BRANCH OFFICE

234
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,237
But the police watch was in the photo.
That's a fact.

235
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,616
That means we can still suspect
that the culprit is a cop.

236
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,994
But if we can't keep
our investigative rights,

237
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,579
we'll be the first to lose our positions.

238
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,999
Things would have been different
if the culprit really was a cop.

239
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,085
It would have been a strong defense.

240
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,736
What the hell?

241
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,571
Look at this bastard.

242
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,324
You got caught snooping around my office.

243
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,284
How dare you stand tall, unashamed?

244
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,869
I'm sorry, sir.

245
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,787
What were you doing?

246
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,332
You got caught red-handed,
so give me an excuse.

247
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,626
Did you steal something?

248
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,294
Or was it a power fantasy?

249
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,172
Were you sitting at my desk
picturing yourself as the assistant chief?

250
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,508
Were you imagining that you had
Chief Woo and I groveling at your feet?

251
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,220
How dare you glare at me?

252
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,764
-Yes.
-"Yes"?

253
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,975
That's it?

254
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,977
I'm sorry, sir.

255
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,108
Get out.

256
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,222
What are you doing?

257
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,327
Why my office?
Why didn't you sneak into that office?

258
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,497
You should have sneaked
into Chief Woo's office

259
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,207
had you wanted a better title.

260
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,208
Why pick my office?

261
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,754
You worked at the Seongnam Branch Office
two years ago.

262
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,173
Were you in the criminal division?

263
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,842
What?

264
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,972
How dare you ask me a question
when you owe me an explanation?

265
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,766
Gosh, you really are something.

266
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,821
Yes. I was in Criminal Division Two.

267
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,114
What about it?

268
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,702
I'm sorry I sneaked into your office.

269
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,050
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

270
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,350
I was wondering what they'd opt for.

271
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,979
Would the prosecution
treat the witness like a VIP

272
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,106
for saying what they had wanted to hear?

273
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,902
Or would they give him
a harsher punishment

274
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,696
because they've suffered
as much as we did because of him.

275
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,282
It looks like he did get a VIP treatment.

276
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,534
The central office just let him go.

277
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,662
-Who said that?
-Prosecutor Hwang.

278
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,291
Also, the suicide note was written
by Sergeant Song himself.

279
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,341
As soon as
the witness' identity was revealed,

280
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,468
Chief Woo called me.

281
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,762
You mean, Chief Woo Tae-ha?

282
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,264
Why did he call you?

283
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,519
Why not? I can't even have coffee with him
after going through this ordeal together?

284
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,687
You're always with Prosecutor Hwang.

285
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,398
"Always"? That's not true.

286
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,944
And you make it sound as if
we're a pair of cockroaches or something.

287
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,695
What is this?

288
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,031
You can be friends with a prosecutor,
but I can't?

289
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,700
Gosh, no. That's not what I meant.

290
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,245
Sit down.

291
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,413
Stop standing around.
You're too tall for that.

292
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,042
You're taller than I am.

293
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,587
Are you more invested?

294
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,965
Invested in what?

295
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,675
Prosecutor Hwang.

296
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,845
He's an adult,
but you left with him and gave him a ride

297
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,763
because he had an upset stomach.

298
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,224
You like him,
but he's not interested, right?

299
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,643
Gosh, please.

300
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,854
I'm going to date an artist.

301
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,149
Why would you date an artist?
He'll be broke.

302
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,068
Men who have a nine-to-five job
are the best husband material.

303
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,573
My goodness, my grandma said
the exact same thing.

304
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,787
He's a prosecutor too.
Don't trust him too much.

305
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,291
Chief Woo probably wanted
something more than just coffee as well.

306
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,752
Do you also think

307
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,922
all of this feels very much forced?

308
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,217
As if someone was sitting in the cockpit.

309
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,307
Be careful.

310
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,894
If we suspect the prosecution
and the witness and dig into it rashly,

311
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,562
we could ruin everything.

312
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,815
We're trying to take what they have,
and they don't want change.

313
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,942
To lure them to the negotiation table,

314
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,695
we must pretend
that there's nothing wrong for now.

315
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,906
But keep a watchful eye on the witness

316
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,159
and be ready to bring him in
when things seem unfavorable to us.

317
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,122
You always have a plan for everything.

318
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,210
All right, you may leave.

319
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,509
Chief.

320
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,472
I want to keep investigating
the Prosecutor Seo case.

321
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,892
-No, you can't.
-Please, Chief.

322
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,145
Is this about your career?

323
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,231
You want to return to detective work
after you're done here,

324
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,858
but you can't run a detective squad
due to inexperience,

325
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,444
and the captain positions
are occupied by your seniors.

326
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,906
So you want to lead the investigation
task force and prove yourself?

327
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,951
No, Chief. Such a thought
never even occurred to me.

328
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,453
I just want to catch the culprit.
That's all.

329
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:55,428
I don't need to hear more. We have
enough to indict Hanjo Engineering.

330
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,182
They violated
the Financial Investment Services Act

331
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,893
and the Act on External Audit
of Stock Companies.

332
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:06,314
They can also be indicted for embezzlement
and instigating destruction of evidence.

333
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,821
And they'll hand over the rest
if you make up your mind?

334
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,658
If I'm willing to reach out
to Lee Yeon-jae.

335
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,246
Then we'll have him for sure.

336
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,542
It looks like we can actually
take Lee Sung-jae down this time.

337
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,085
What about the commission?

338
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,422
They asked Hanjo Engineering
for an explanation but nothing after that.

339
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,966
I don't think they'll be suspended.

340
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,181
But it'll be a different story

341
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,268
if you can get your hands
on the actual document that you saw.

342
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,312
Should I take this on?

343
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,231
There's no way they'd just hand it over.

344
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,444
Of course not. This is just bait.

345
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,699
Like that lawyer said,

346
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,827
Lee Yeon-jae won't win the lawsuit
even if I take this on.

347
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,162
But she'll gain more power.

348
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:06,124
At the moment, the group is divided
between her and her stepbrother.

349
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,001
If you help her take him down,

350
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,129
she'll take her father's place
and become the real reigning queen.

351
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,340
So I shouldn't do it?

352
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,721
One of them is bound
to be ousted eventually.

353
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,183
Whether you do it or not,
the results will be the same.

354
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,480
Probably, right?

355
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,069
Okay.

356
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,703
Hello?

357
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,580
Yes.

358
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,832
Right.

359
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,835
You made a wise decision.

360
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,922
Sure, okay.

361
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,175
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG WON-CHUL

362
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,347
H, MR. PARK

363
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,770
I'VE SUCCEEDED

364
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,575
EASTERN OFFICE LAUNCHES
INVESTIGATION ON HANJO ENGINEERING

365
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,662
Since we've found detailed evidence

366
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,415
of Hanjo Engineering's accounting fraud,

367
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,250
we plan to launch

368
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,169
-an extensive investigation…
-The eastern office just announced

369
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,840
that they detected an illegal transaction
made by Hanjo Engineering.

370
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,008
-Is Hanjo their sworn enemy?
-They are planning

371
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,636
-to contact the financial…
-I guess you should go there.

372
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,555
-I've already sent someone.
-Who? Si-mok?

373
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,932
The prosecution is stating that
search and seizure…

374
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,435
That's why that prick
was nowhere to be seen.

375
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,146
Why call him a prick?
You used to be protective of him.

376
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,610
What's your thought
on Hanjo's governance structure?

377
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:58,987
Please say a few words.

378
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,323
We're focusing on

379
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,034
Hanjo Engineering's accounting fraud

380
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,288
and whether or not they've violated
the Capital Markets Act,

381
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,750
so we're in no position to comment
on their governance structure.

382
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,752
How did you discover the accounting fraud?

383
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,378
The scope of the damage?

384
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,963
We don't have such details yet.

385
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,633
We will brief you on the progress
in the near future.

386
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,845
-Will you conduct a search and seizure?
-Will Mr. Lee be investigated?

387
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,597
-Could you give us more detail?
-Wait.

388
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,015
What will happen to Mr. Lee?

389
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,391
Just a comment, please.

390
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,645
Hey.

391
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,735
I guess Chief Woo sent you
because of Hanjo.

392
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,198
Have a seat.

393
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,626
Was it already discussed with
the Securities and Futures Commission?

394
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,880
Yes, they'll be charged with violation
of auditing standards.

395
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,966
I told you Lee Sung-jae
was going to be next.

396
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,303
The press aide even
mentioned Hanjo's governance.

397
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,681
I guess you got something
that'll take down Lee Sung-jae for good.

398
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,267
Did our Deputy Chief say such a thing?

399
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,686
Well…

400
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,565
By the way,
why do you keep trying to visit me?

401
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,068
What was it last time?

402
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,654
Sir, you were in the 25th class, right?

403
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,031
May I stop by your office tomorrow?

404
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,324
What was it?

405
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,786
You knew the lawyer Park Gwang-su, right?

406
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,705
He was a Chief Prosecutor,
and you were in the same class.

407
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,211
Why are you mentioning someone who's dead?

408
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,088
His death was one of the cases

409
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,966
that Prosecutor Seo was looking into
before he disappeared.

410
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,067
What does that case have to do
with anything?

411
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:06,364
I'm not sure. But some say
he never drank any alcohol,

412
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,867
and some say that he did drink.

413
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,618
Things don't add up.

414
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,622
He didn't drink any alcohol.
Whoever said that knows nothing about him.

415
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,624
I heard that from his wife, though.

416
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,421
-What?
-So the secretary was right.

417
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,174
Then was it also true
that he was troubled financially?

418
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,342
How do you know that?

419
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,680
-We said we'd keep that to ourselves.
-Who do you mean by "we"?

420
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,391
Our colleagues did,
when we met at his funeral.

421
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,477
His youngest brother's business
seemed to have failed.

422
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,397
One classmate who was close to Mr. Park

423
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,900
looked at that brother's face and said

424
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,860
he would have caused the heart attack.

425
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,238
It seemed like his brothers
stood surety for him.

426
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,616
But where did you hear all this?

427
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,537
You told someone else about
his financial trouble, didn't you?

428
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,666
I told you we said we'd keep it a secret.
It's not good news, you know.

429
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,085
His secretary at the law firm even knew

430
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,796
that his brother was the cause
of his financial trouble.

431
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,092
I don't think he would have
told his secretary about that.

432
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,058
A lawyer from some law firm asked
about Mr. Park before.

433
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,393
He said he was taking over his case.

434
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,980
But they suddenly came to us
and I ended up taking it on.

435
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,775
Do you happen to know
a man named Park Gwang-su?

436
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,069
So I told him some things.

437
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,614
It's unusual, but lawyers sometimes
do that when requested by their clients.

438
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,075
I guess it could have been a VIP.

439
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,452
That client.

440
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,830
The one who used to be a client
of Mr. Park's law firm.

441
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,540
Do you know who it is?

442
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,417
No, I don't know that much.

443
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,543
I'll ask myself, then.

444
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,338
Can you give me the number
of that lawyer you talked to?

445
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,304
This is related to Seo Dong-jae?

446
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,977
Don't worry.

447
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,438
I'm the one who should be asking you
not to reveal the source.

448
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,567
What would I gain
if people found out where I got this?

449
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,029
Oh Ju-seon.

450
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,241
Oh Ju-seon?

451
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,160
He's quite the miracle worker, isn't he?

452
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,037
Do you know someone named Oh Ju-seon?

453
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,832
He was formerly a presiding judge
at the High Court.

454
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,334
It was the Eastern Office back then, too.

455
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,877
What do you mean?

456
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,423
OH JU-SEON

457
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,383
OH JU-SEON
LAWYER, FORMER JUDGE

458
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,221
DOCUMENTS FOR APPROVAL

459
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,973
It's Oh Ju-seon, right?

460
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,227
The person you were just talking to.

461
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,106
He's the one who brought something
that would take down Lee Sung-jae.

462
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,320
You know who'll benefit the most
from taking down Lee Sung-jae.

463
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:55,533
You've just made a deal with Lee Yeon-jae,
not the lawyer Oh Ju-seon.

464
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,869
Not officially.

465
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,872
He has no official connection
with the Hanjo Group.

466
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,042
He's working for Hanjo, isn't he?

467
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,252
Don't ask any more questions.
I don't know.

468
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,298
I'll find out myself, then.

469
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,472
Sorry for calling you so suddenly.

470
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,808
It's fine, but my lunch break ends soon.

471
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,809
What is it?

472
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,063
Well, the last time we met,

473
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,648
you mentioned Mr. Park's
financial trouble.

474
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,611
The person who conveyed that information
to you was Oh Ju-seon, right?

475
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,155
You told me that

476
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,741
you only found out about it after he died.

477
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,702
That's because Oh Ju-seon told you

478
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,122
about his financial trouble
when he met you after he died, right?

479
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,374
Why do you say "conveyed"?

480
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,170
You just asked if he
"conveyed that information" to me.

481
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,380
Because he heard it
from someone else, too.

482
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:56,135
He heard that from someone
who knew Mr. Park before he died.

483
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,971
That's why I said "conveyed."
Is there a problem?

484
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:03,309
Then you're saying that the lawyer
named Oh Ju-seon

485
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:07,063
didn't know Mr. Park personally
while he was alive?

486
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,234
Did Mr. Oh say he was close to Mr. Park?

487
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,904
Yes. He's the one who mentioned
Mr. Park's financial trouble first.

488
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,909
So I thought they must have been close
for him to know that.

489
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,873
I guess he used that information as bait

490
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,544
since Mr. Oh was from a rival law firm,

491
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,964
and since you probably wouldn't
have told him about Mr. Park easily.

492
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,676
We wouldn't call them our rival.
We're the top law firm in Korea.

493
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,179
You lost your client to such a firm.
There must've been a lot of talking.

494
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:43,516
-Who's that client?
-What do you mean? Lost our client?

495
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,145
Mr. Park's client
went to Mr. Oh's law firm.

496
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,772
Where did you hear that?

497
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,524
We didn't lose any of our clients.

498
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,030
Is Hanjo one of your clients?

499
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,949
Hanjo Group?

500
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,827
No, but our CEO would've loved
to have them as our client.

501
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,708
Then what did Mr. Oh ask about Mr. Park?

502
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,420
He just asked if Mr. Park was stressed
about anything

503
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,963
at our firm before his death.

504
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,550
And that he couldn't believe
what happened to him.

505
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,052
So I asked him
why he suddenly started thinking that

506
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,013
a year after his death.

507
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,932
Hang on.

508
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,897
You met Mr. Oh recently?
Not right after Mr. Park's death?

509
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,316
It was only a few days before I met you

510
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,693
that Mr. Oh came to see me.

511
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,155
Since you two came to ask me
about his death in a row,

512
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,241
I thought there was something odd
about his death

513
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,160
and that there'd be a reinvestigation.

514
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,011
You've just made a deal with Lee Yeon-jae,
not the lawyer Oh Ju-seon.

515
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,471
Not officially.

516
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,515
He has no official connection
with Hanjo Group.

517
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,808
Is it the Hanjo Group?

518
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,312
Is Oh Ju-seon the unofficial
replacement for Park Gwang-su?

519
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,690
Hanjo covered up
what happened to Mr. Park.

520
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,525
Is this why Mr. Oh is digging into it?

521
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,070
Because he's afraid of dying like Mr. Park

522
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,280
if he starts working for Hanjo rashly?

523
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,116
If that client was
one of the law firm's clients,

524
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,912
would he have needed to take the day off
just to meet them?

525
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,501
So he was working for a law firm
but secretly met with a personal client.

526
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,962
Was he stealing one of the firm's clients?

527
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,173
What if he wasn't stealing a client
from the law firm?

528
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,551
What if Hanjo had already been
using Park Gwang-su in secret?

529
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,054
But why Park Gwang-su?

530
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:58,651
Did you know that his dashcam was
turned off only on the day of his death?

531
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:02,530
It's unusual, but lawyers sometimes
do that when requested by their clients.

532
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,409
Clients ask lawyers to turn off
their dashcams?

533
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,744
When they meet in person, there's a chance

534
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,330
that they could be
recorded in the dashcam footage.

535
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:15,710
Some clients don't want
to be filmed in any way.

536
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,129
It must've been a long trip.

537
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,213
Why Namyangju?

538
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,300
Because he couldn't be seen at Hanjo,

539
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,052
and his connection with them
needed to remain a secret?

540
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,558
Hanjo would've had many locations to meet
secretly even in the heart of Seoul.

541
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,769
Was it not because of Park Gwang-su?

542
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,651
No…

543
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,697
The reason companies seek out
former judges and prosecutors…

544
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,491
This way.

545
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,747
Connections… Legal circles…

546
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,916
How much did Prosecutor Seo know?

547
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,878
Even if Hanjo was involved
in Mr. Park's death,

548
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,547
the cause was only a heart attack.

549
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,176
Could this really be connected
to the kidnapping?

550
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,721
Did Prosecutor Seo find out that
a murder was disguised as a heart attack?

551
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,349
Could that be what happened?

552
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,607
NAMYANGJU GEUMNAM-RI HIGHWAY 45

553
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,110
Someone who practices law
that Hanjo met secretly

554
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,237
through Mr. Park during their lawsuit…

555
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,365
If that person was behind it all…

556
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,451
Could this be why
I couldn't solve this case?

557
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,994
Is that why

558
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,580
I haven't found Prosecutor Seo yet?

559
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,750
Park Gwang-su…

560
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,044
The 25th class?

561
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,716
Sir, you were in the 25th class, right?

562
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,593
Sungmoon, Hanjo, and Lee Sung-jae.

563
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,512
I'll be sure to take them down.

564
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,055
Why continue to deal with Hanjo yourself

565
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,348
and not hand them over
to the central office?

566
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,684
The Hanjo HQ is under our jurisdiction.
I've done so much work for it.

567
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,273
Hello, this is Jung Min-ha.

568
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,776
Near the scene?

569
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,573
Well, there's a golf course.
But that's not what you mean, right?

570
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,325
There aren't any restaurants

571
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,662
they could have used
to meet in secret near the place he died.

572
00:40:56,745 --> 00:41:01,667
There are some country houses
and vacation homes in that area.

573
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,170
-Vacation homes?
-Yes.

574
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,882
Oh, by the way,
do you have some time today?

575
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,676
Is something going on?

576
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,470
No, it's nothing much,

577
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,347
but I want to ask you something.

578
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:20,936
It's about Prosecutor Seo's missing case.

579
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,272
Did you take over that case?

580
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,024
Are you in charge?

581
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,651
No, but it's something about that…

582
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,987
What do you mean?

583
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,698
Could I tell you in person?

584
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,576
It could really be nothing, though.

585
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,831
All right, then.
Call me when you're coming.

586
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,184
-Hello.
-Hello.

587
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,021
Everyone else went home.

588
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,439
Oh, I see.

589
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,280
Oh…

590
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,412
Go ahead.

591
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,667
Prosecutor Seo took on
a middle school violence case.

592
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,503
The one he was working on
the day he went missing, right?

593
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,423
Yes, and those students were charged
again for assault a few days ago.

594
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:35,177
Three of them brought alcohol
into a karaoke, and the owner caught them.

595
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,264
But they hit the owner
with a fire extinguisher,

596
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,474
locked him in the storage and ran away.

597
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,520
That kept lingering on my mind
so I checked their prior case again,

598
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,355
and the two cases were similar.

599
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,651
Sorry, we're not allowed to
take the documents outside,

600
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,695
so I only brought the photos.

601
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,449
They hit the victim on the head,

602
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,035
and then assaulted him
in the bathroom again.

603
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:06,083
And we got these photos as reference.

604
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,418
Their teacher sent these,

605
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:12,089
saying that there are no bullies
in his class and that they were friends.

606
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,718
Prosecutor Seo had them in the file,
so I brought them.

607
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,977
-Is he the victim?
-Yes.

608
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,438
And these three were the ones
who assaulted him.

609
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,066
I'm not sure how Prosecutor Seo
was assaulted,

610
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,862
but I guessed it could've been similar.

611
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,989
He was attacked from behind and locked up.

612
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,492
I looked into their whereabouts
on the day he disappeared just in case…

613
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:45,289
Itaewon Station is pretty close
to the scene in Bogwang-dong, right?

614
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,459
Yes. About ten minutes by foot.

615
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,712
Did they go to Itaewon that day?

616
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,923
Yes, their transportation cards
were used at Itaewon Station.

617
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,593
They exited the station
around eight that day

618
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,013
and returned to Noksapyeong Station
at 10:11 p.m.

619
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,182
Two hours and ten minutes…

620
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,352
But they're still kids.

621
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,065
Do you also think I'm going overboard?

622
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,611
How would they have met?

623
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,159
We should go that way. I know I'm right.

624
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,310
Even if they crossed paths by coincidence,

625
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,312
how did they end up at the scene?

626
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,734
Didn't you take the outer ring road here
because of the traffic?

627
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,195
Oh, I took the subway.

628
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,326
Prosecutor Seo was going to meet someone
in Yeouido the day he went missing.

629
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,495
But his car GPS showed

630
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,456
that he went to Itaewon
three hours earlier,

631
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,334
when the road was the busiest.

632
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,587
Maybe he was heading to Bogwang-dong

633
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,590
to meet the culprit
before going to Yeouido.

634
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,342
Yes, that's pretty likely.

635
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:25,222
I'm sure he wouldn't have made plans
to meet those kids in Itaewon.

636
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,143
Then I guess they wouldn't have
kidnapped him…

637
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,275
These are his phone call records.

638
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,320
If he was going to meet them that day,
he would have called them.

639
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:44,700
Check if any of their names or numbers
are on the list.

640
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,289
None of them are here.

641
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:52,958
I'm sorry.

642
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:58,172
Are you taking over
the school violence cases?

643
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,089
Yes.

644
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,758
And someone else is on the missing case?

645
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,387
The best prosecutor in our department
took over the case.

646
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,014
It's an important case after all.

647
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,393
Did that veteran prosecutor
reject your opinion

648
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,146
and tell you that it's ridiculous
to suspect those kids?

649
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,733
I did think I was going a bit far,
but some things seemed strange.

650
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,403
He did hear out what I had to tell him.

651
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,449
If they really did,
I don't think you would've come here.

652
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,959
I guess your senior didn't take
Professor Kim Mun-sik's class.

653
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,212
You mean Philosophy of Law?

654
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,509
The security system has been activated.

655
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,054
Besides Crime and Punishment,
the professor quoted the phrase

656
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,306
"The devil is in the detail" the most.

657
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,392
Then you don't think
I was going overboard?

658
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,648
I guess that professor said
the same things in class for decades.

659
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,443
You must have taken that class
a long time ago, right?

660
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,301
How old are you, Prosecutor Jung?

661
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,387
Pardon?

662
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,306
Never mind.

663
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,393
I'm 28.

664
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,353
Thank you for today.

665
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,755
Yes?

666
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,633
Please send me the photos
of those middle school students.

667
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,510
The ones taken on a school trip?

668
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:12,180
Yes. And have you heard anything
about the Tongyeong case

669
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,849
from Prosecutor Seo?

670
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,268
The university students
who drowned in March.

671
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,562
No, nothing.

672
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,771
All right.

673
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,607
I'll ask people in his office.

674
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,618
Why did he ask about Tongyeong?

675
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,454
What's this?

676
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,788
Tongyeong?

677
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,082
And Prosecutor Seo called the survivor?

678
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,629
According to him, it wasn't the first time
that Prosecutor Seo called him.

679
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,932
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

680
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,813
They do look like close friends
at a glance,

681
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:05,067
but knowing that he's a victim
makes the photo seem different.

682
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,818
Anyway, what about Tongyeong?

683
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,072
Sometimes there's a hierarchy

684
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,200
formed among male students.

685
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,451
Even if they're friends.

686
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,746
Did you get that in the photo
of the students in Tongyeong?

687
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,706
Not at first.

688
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,334
But it seemed different
when I looked at it yesterday.

689
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,003
After seeing the photo
of the Namyangju students?

690
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,421
Yes.

691
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,185
POLICE VISITS TONGYEONG VICTIM'S FAMILY

692
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,689
But Prosecutor Seo…

693
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,109
What was that kid's name?
The survivor of the Tongyeong case.

694
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,237
-Kim Hu-jeong.
-Yes. He called Kim Hu-jeong

695
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,197
because he wanted to ask if Chief Choi

696
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,077
had told him to say bad things
about the prosecution, right?

697
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,537
That's what Kim Hu-jeong said.

698
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:03,208
He said Prosecutor Seo called him twice,
once after Chief Choi visited that family,

699
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,876
and once before he went missing.

700
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,045
The call history shows that.

701
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,880
But then I thought,

702
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,508
"That could've been the case
the first time,

703
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,428
but why did he call Kim Hu-jeong again
after time has passed?

704
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,972
Did he really call him just to ask him
the same thing?"

705
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,184
What if he was just poking around
for leads?

706
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,687
That's something he would've done.

707
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,981
If that's really the case…

708
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,819
If it were you, who would you ask first?

709
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,279
Kim Hu-jeong,

710
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:36,158
or the victim's family
that Chief Choi visited?

711
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,702
The victim's family.

712
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,624
So do you think he's a suspect?

713
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,919
Well, I'm not sure yet.

714
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,257
But it suddenly occurred to me last night.

715
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,177
Why hadn't I found it suspicious to find

716
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,180
Kim Hu-jeong's name
in Prosecutor Seo's call history?

717
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,516
Maybe it didn't seem special back then.

718
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,019
It could really be nothing special.

719
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:08,273
Still, I should have paid
more attention to it when I first saw it.

720
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,569
Prosecutor Seo took on

721
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,363
school violence cases
for the past few years.

722
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:24,790
If he was reminded of something
while seeing these photos…

723
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,800
POLICE VISITS TONGYEONG VICTIM'S FAMILY

724
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,802
Then if Prosecutor Seo

725
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,013
called Kim Hu-jeong the second time

726
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:43,934
because he thought that maybe
the Tongyeong kids weren't really friends,

727
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:49,314
then Kim Hu-jeong would have been
startled by that phone call.

728
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,857
It was from a prosecutor of all people.

729
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,777
The people at the Uijeongbu Office said

730
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,863
Prosecutor Seo didn't mention
anything about the Tongyeong case.

731
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,200
But you said he usually didn't share
much with people in his office.

732
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,245
No, I mean his junior prosecutor,
not the investigators.

733
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,707
It seemed like he talked a lot
with the junior prosecutor.

734
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,919
You mean the one he had a meal with?
The one in the security footage?

735
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,963
Were they close?

736
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,093
Why? Does she seem suspicious?

737
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,389
They're just one year apart.

738
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,476
Who? Her and Prosecutor Seo?

739
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,812
What? Were you checking
their age difference?

740
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,856
I meant Young Eun-soo.

741
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,486
Seeing Prosecutor Seo's junior

742
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,614
made me think

743
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,617
that if Young Eun-soo hadn't died,

744
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,912
she'd be working now like her

745
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,749
at some prosecutors' office.

746
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,003
Near the beach, or in a small city.
She'd be living

747
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,213
every day just like her.

748
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,718
It made me think

749
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,555
that it's actually pretty simple.

750
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,557
What is?

751
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,560
Living and dying.

752
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,024
You're right. It's simple.

753
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,068
It changes in an instant.

754
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,654
That's what makes it so sad.

755
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,954
All right, what should I look into first?

756
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,833
Did you say the Tongyeong students
went to the same middle school?

757
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,295
Yes, but they attended different
high schools and universities.

758
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,590
Then going to their schools now
probably won't help.

759
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:43,053
Does Kim Hu-jeong
live in Bogwang-dong by any chance?

760
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,013
Then there'd be a much higher chance.

761
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,473
His address was…

762
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,392
I think it was Gwangjang-dong.

763
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:50,977
That's pretty far.

764
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,690
Could he have taken the kids
who bullied him in the past to the beach

765
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,567
and drowned them?

766
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,363
Killing middle school classmates
after he became an adult?

767
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,409
We could be wrong, though.

768
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,621
We still have to look into
every possibility.

769
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,207
Plus, you saw what happened
with the Segok Station case.

770
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,960
-That's right!
-What?

771
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,503
I should visit City Hall.

772
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,923
What time is it?
Oh, no. It's almost one already.

773
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,132
Oh, my gosh.

774
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,804
-Does Chief Woo know you're here?
-No.

775
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,223
It's not like we're doing something wrong.

776
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,933
We're trying to catch the culprit.

777
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,355
Gosh.

778
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,068
Is he in?

779
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,236
No.

780
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,078
-Yes?
-I'm at City Hall.

781
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:54,165
I checked the residence registry.
Kim Hu-jeong used to live in Bogwang-dong.

782
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,598
Mr. Kim Hu-jeong.

783
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,600
Who are you?

784
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,650
Can we have a word?

785
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,453
Would you like to come in?

786
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,822
This was our first trip

787
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,616
since starting college.

788
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,081
PROSECUTION SERVICE

789
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,837
We came here together…

790
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,582
What's this about?

791
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,042
You know Prosecutor Seo, right?

792
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,300
Mr. Kim Hu-jeong.

793
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,893
Prosecutor Seo!

794
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,895
Are you in there?

795
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,146
Seo Dong-jae!

796
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,869
Is Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae alive?

797
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,830
The whole room smells of bleach.

798
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,208
That means he cleaned the room
very recently.

799
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,293
It's Seo Dong-jae. You remember me, right?

800
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,587
That photo…
I don't think it was taken here.

801
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,965
They were there for a reason.
This isn't a coincidence.

802
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,718
Tell me right now!

803
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,097
One of these is the route
he used to move Prosecutor Seo.

804
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,848
Track these in reverse order.

805
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,809
-My gosh.
-Did you think it'd end

806
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,352
if you killed them?

807
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,520
What did you do to him?

808
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,773
What did you do to Prosecutor Seo?

809
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,608
Did you abandon him when he was alive?

810
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:36,322
