1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,886
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,472
Mr. Park is dead.

4
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,767
Si-mok is the one who found the body first
and arrested the suspect.

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,894
What if Mr. Park told him everything
before he died?

6
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,897
If I open my mouth, he might get
buried alive in a matter of seconds.

7
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,231
I will never die alone.

8
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,942
-How did you get into the house?
-Somebody opened the door from inside.

9
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,527
-Who?
-How would I know?

10
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,197
I have stolen things,
but I would never kill anyone!

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,866
He insists that the real killer
must have let him in on purpose

12
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,534
to frame him for the murder.

13
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,454
Can you think of a counterclaim
that can refute everything at one blow?

14
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,998
Decisive evidence
that the victim was alive at that time.

15
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,958
The defendant is denying clear evidence

16
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,002
and not reflecting on what he did.

17
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,338
So, I hereby sentence
the defendant to 22 years in prison.

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,216
How dare he think of prosecutors
as a safety net?

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,092
-Don't you think he had a reason?
-So what?

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,720
A robbery murder
committed by a third party.

21
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,932
A third party? It sounds like you think
there is a second party involved as well.

22
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,683
Someone was being threatened.

23
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,144
The prosecutor altered the evidence

24
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,355
and turned me into a murderer.

25
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,941
Locate Jin-seob Kang's whereabouts
immediately. He can't be alone.

26
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,443
I would like to report that prosecutor
who disgraced and tortured me

27
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,028
through my death.

28
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,905
I plead my innocence through my death.

29
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,283
I... I did not kill him.

30
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,068
I'm the prosecutor who called earlier.

31
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,153
So, what happened?

32
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,902
TRUE CORRECTION FOR A BRIGHT FUTURE

33
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,197
It was already too late when we got there.
There was nothing we could do.

34
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,616
-I would like to see him.
-Sure.

35
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,537
It was after our evening roll call,

36
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,248
and there weren't any signs.

37
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,960
He tied his prison uniform
on a window bar and hung himself.

38
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,337
He was obviously very determined.

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,771
The prosecutor altered the evidence

40
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,898
and turned me into a murderer.

41
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,358
It is suicide.

42
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,697
The letter you received.
Could you tell me what was written...

43
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,199
It is not a letter.
And there was nothing about this.

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,575
I see.

45
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,831
-Thank you for showing me.
-No problem.

46
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,380
"Thank you for showing me?" Goodness.

47
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,216
How can he say such a thing
about a dead person?

48
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,184
Jin-seob!

49
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,478
Why did you send it to me?

50
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,565
Why did you send the letter of appeal?

51
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,276
Are you that prosecutor?

52
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,486
You killed him.

53
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,864
You killed Jin-seob!

54
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,199
Why didn't you stop him? Please answer me.

55
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,285
Bring him back to life!

56
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,538
You must have read it.
You knew he would take his own life!

57
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,046
All right. Your husband told you
to do it, didn't he?

58
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,465
What exactly did he tell you to do?

59
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,386
I bet he promised you that you and his son
wouldn't have to worry about money.

60
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,097
You must have sent it because he said
he had prepared a way

61
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,141
you can support yourself
and that you must cooperate.

62
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,893
Did you get a large sum of money recently?

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,479
Did you accept it knowing that you got it
in exchange for his life?

64
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,981
Are you saying

65
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,778
I sent that letter because I got paid?

66
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,030
-Sir!
-Please answer me.

67
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,699
Answer me if you think
he died an unfair death.

68
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,992
It is unfair.

69
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,204
It is so unfair
that it is making my blood boil!

70
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,750
It is utterly breaking my heart because
I think it is so unfair and enraging.

71
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,543
Calm down.

72
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,589
What exactly did your husband say

73
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,300
when he asked you to send that letter?

74
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,183
He told me
that he just wants to scare them.

75
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,065
He said he is not actually going to die.

76
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,070
How am I supposed to live now?

77
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,576
How can he die and leave me all alone?

78
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,203
I think that's enough.

79
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,872
Please take her to him.

80
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,170
Is she putting on a show?

81
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,796
It is possible.

82
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,425
But that was murder. Now, it is suicide.

83
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,555
Why didn't he take everything with him
if he was hired to do the job?

84
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,849
Why did he try to plead his innocence?

85
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,852
The prosecutor altered the evidence...

86
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,522
What made him so convinced?

87

VIDEO ANALYSIS LAB

88
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,458
Excuse me.
I need to bother you for a minute.

89
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,876
Well, I'm done for the day.

90
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,629
I was about to leave.

91
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,135
Those things you see in TV series
are obviously not realistic.

92
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,263
In reality, this is the most
you are going to get.

93
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,808
Plus, it is not even a frontal shot.

94
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,645
It is barely within the frame.

95
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,980
I don't think we will get anything
even if I keep trying.

96
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,858
Is there a chance that this part
could have been manipulated?

97
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,069
Manipulated...

98
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,655
It doesn't seem so.

99
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,282
Yes, it is the original footage.
It wasn't manipulated.

100
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,080
There are so many CCTVs and dash cameras
these days that my work never ends.

101
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,042
Even with this, that wouldn't have been
captured if the angle was a little off.

102
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,641
This is driving me nuts.

103
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,935
Why did he let that woman handle it?

104

DNA ANALYSIS LAB

105
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,448
Yes, sir.

106
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,659
Yes.

107
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,415
I will leave right away.

108
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,765
What is the Truth
Behind the Huam-dong Murder Case?

109
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,274
Do you know how many calls I got?

110
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,152
How dare a murderer try to threaten
prosecution with a letter like that?

111
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,653
He died.

112
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,282
Are you sure?

113
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,200
I just checked.

114
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,247
Was the interrogation coercive?

115
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,750
-No.
-Were any of the procedures inappropriate?

116
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,084
No, sir.

117
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,962
Was the evidence fabricated?

118
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,255
No, it wasn't.

119
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,841
Did he lie right before he killed himself?

120
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,010
It sounded like he was very sure of it.

121
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,471
I checked it multiple times.
It wasn't fabricated.

122
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,521
The police should have been turned
upside down, not us.

123
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,233
You arrested him and got the evidence.
Do you now realize what you have done?

124
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,986
You ran over there
just because Mr. Park called you?

125
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,988
You're screwing me over in many ways.

126
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,492
I apologize.

127
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,256
Mr. Park told me

128
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,342
that he joined hands with you.

129
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,803
You ran over there
just because Mr. Park called you?

130
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,097
I see you are trying to screw me over
in many ways.

131
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,225
You knew you would get screwed over.

132
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,143
Why didn't you stop me?

133
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,734
FIVE MONTHS AGO

134
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,372
Smile a lot, okay?

135
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,874
Don't let him think you are easy.
Smile a lot

136
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,210
and act cutesy. Got it?
You are good at things like that.

137
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,087
You should keep smiling.

138
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,840
-Okay? Go in.
-Yes, sir.

139
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,324
-You are from the western office.
-Yes.

140
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,202
Welcome to Hansung Seorak Resort.

141
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,914
For everyone
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office,

142
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,542
we reserved our rooms with the best view
on the tenth floor.

143
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,793
Great, thank you.

144
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,539
For everyone
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office,

145
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,208
we reserved our rooms with the best view
on the tenth floor.

146
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,160
Mr. Seo.

147
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,746
Hey. Have you seen Mr. Lee?

148
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,164
No.

149
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,043
Gosh, he needs to give an opening speech.
Why isn't he picking up his phone?

150
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,629
Sir!

151
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,925
-Hey, is everything ready?
-Yes, sir.

152
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,343
Great. Good work.

153
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,016
-Goodness, you look great.
-Look who's talking.

154
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,142
Cut it out.

155
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,227
You know Prosecutor Seo, right?

156
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,063
-I'm Dong-jae Seo.
-Goodness. You are very handsome.

157
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,274
-Thank you.
-He is the ace of my team.

158
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,152
-He is handsome and stylish.
-He also knows how to have fun.

159
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,592
Please move your car.

160
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:33,223
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

161
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,776
Goodness, you look great. This is
the head of Yongsan Police Station.

162
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,963
Goodness, sorry. We meet again.

163
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,884
-I'm Lieutenant Yeo-jin Han.
-Where is the evidence room here?

164
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,427
Pardon? Why...

165
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,182
Is it for a re-investigation?
Are you re-investigating the case?

166
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,226
Why? Is something bothering you?

167
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,645
Are you worried
because of the letter of appeal?

168
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,314
You are the one who should be worried
as you ruined everything.

169
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,650
What are you talking about?
I didn't ruin anything.

170
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,110
You handled everything alone.

171
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,154
I guess Sergeant Kim hasn't told you yet.

172
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,116
About what?

173
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,493
He seemed to be stressing out
over the DNA test results.

174
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,078
What DNA...

175
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,539
What do the results say?

176
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,959
Why are you asking me when you are the one
who put in the request?

177
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,877
What did Sergeant Kim say?

178
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,629
Tell me exactly what he said.

179
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,589
"This is driving me nuts."

180
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,425
Goodness, this is driving me nuts.

181
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,385
Why did he let that woman handle it?

182
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,303
"Why did he let that woman handle it?"

183
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,016
What?

184
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,647
-Wait.
-That's all I know.

185
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,773
It is not about that.

186
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,615
Excuse me.

187
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,284
Goodness.

188
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,493
Goodness!

189
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,704
What was that about? My gosh.

190
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,788
Lieutenant Han.

191
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,332
-Yes.
-Have you seen Sergeant Kim?

192
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,584
Is he back?

193
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,918
I was actually...

194
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,463
Detective Seo said he saw him,
but I can't find him.

195
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,507
We are heading out
to that barbecue restaurant to...

196
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,968
I see. Right now, I can't join you
because...

197
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,014
-Don't drink too much.
-All right.

198
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,460
How did you know that?

199
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,962
EVIDENCE: VICTIM'S CELLULAR PHONE

200
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,343
Why do you keep ignoring me?

201
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,306
Is this it?

202
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,687
I'm the one who called that cable company.

203
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,315
RECENT CALL HISTORY

204
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,610
SI-MOK HWANG

205
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,028
Then, what is this?

206
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,614
Did he call you to meet up?

207
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,495
What was it about?
You won't answer me again, will you?

208
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,459
LCJ?

209
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,586
LCJ?

210
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,089
Is it someone you know?

211
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,633
Mr. Park told me

212
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,552
that he joined hands with you.

213
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,763
I'm asking if you know this person.

214
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,308
Moo-sung Park called this person
after getting off the phone with you.

215
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,811
Do you know this person...

216
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,439
I asked you if it's someone you know.

217
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,234
Goodness.

218
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,195
I have a hand too, okay?

219
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,116
Who is this?

220
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,203
I would have gone through this phone first
had the case not been closed abruptly.

221
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,715
The number you are trying to call is
not reachable. Please...

222
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,477
WESTERN SEOUL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

223
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,865
Mr. Kang, the suspect of the Huam-dong
murder who was detained

224
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,451
at Southern Seoul Detention Center,
committed suicide

225
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,662
-Why do they always say it's unfair?
-by hanging last night.

226
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,831
-I mean, he did it.
-Due to dashboard camera footage,

227
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,001
-But that is extreme. Isn't it crazy?
-the act of crime was confirmed

228
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,003
-Who? Lieutenant Han?
-but he kept denying it

229
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,755
-Yes.
-and was sentenced to 22 years.

230
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,257
No, Your Honor. I...

231
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,174
-Hello.
-I didn't do it.

232
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,801
That must be fake. Why are you lying?

233
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,011
He was already dead when I got there!

234
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,846
Claiming that the evidence was fabricated,

235
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,683
Mr. Park sent a letter of appeal
pleading his innocence

236
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,726
-Hey, turn it off!
-through his wife.

237
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,395
-I'm already sick of it.
-Hence,

238
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,855
prosecution's investigation process
has been brought into question.

239
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,276
Prosecutors are getting all the blame
for what happened with that case.

240
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,069
That should happen occasionally.

241
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,154
Salute.

242
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,409
What happened with the test results
yesterday?

243
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:26,910
What results?

244
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,622
What happened with the DNA analysis
of the bloodstain found in Huam-dong?

245
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,292
That thing.

246
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,210
The bloodstain

247
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,754
wasn't from human blood.

248
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,965
It turned out to be dog blood.

249
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:42,968
But...

250
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,304
He seemed to be stressing out
over the DNA test results.

251
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,390
"This is driving me nuts.
Why did he let that woman handle it?"

252
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,601
-Okay.
-All right.

253
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,081
All right. Let's get this done fast.

254
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,876
In there. Hey, hurry up.

255
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,088
Put them down gently, please.
Every page is the result of my hard work.

256
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,799
Hey, Si-mok.

257
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,470
What are those? They are
for the special prostitution crackdown.

258
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,138
I see.

259
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,772
What about the media briefing?

260
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,565
I'm heading there now.

261
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,277
You will become famous
as a pretty prosecutor after it airs.

262
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,821
Just remember what I taught you.

263
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,823
Pick a spot and keep staring at it.

264
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,450
Faltering eyes make you look unsure.

265
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,868
Also, don't move your hands too much.

266
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,662
I will put those tips to good use.

267
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,414
You got this.

268
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,838
Eun-soo will join
my special crackdown team.

269
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,591
This is how junior officers
should be mentored.

270
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,510
They are not here to clean up your mess.

271
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,679
I see. Is that so?

272
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,101
We need law for making sure
everyone cleans up their own mess.

273
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:57,060
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

274
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,653
Firstly,

275
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,531
I would like to express my condolences
on the unfortunate loss.

276
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,953
However, the claims made
by the late Mr. Jin-seob Kang

277
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,080
are completely groundless and fabricated.

278
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,125
We, the prosecution, would like
to inform all citizens

279
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,002
that we strictly followed
the Rules of Evidence

280
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,504
and that no fabrication
or questionable behavior

281
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,798
of any kind took place in our proceedings
or during the trial.

282
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,856
Thank you.

283
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,367
It is Moo-sung Park's blood.

284
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,582
His blood was found
at a totally random spot.

285
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,465
Mr. Kang struggled
with confinement itself.

286
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,885
He had made a suicide attempt
even while serving his previous sentence.

287
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,471
Hence, as I mentioned earlier,

288
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,307
we can confidently assure you
that connecting his death

289
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,060
to Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
is completely unreasonable.

290
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,687
How will Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
handle the situation?

291
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,397
Is there anything else
you would like to add?

292
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,733
Does that mean his case is closed?

293
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:48,505
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

294
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,219
SERGEANT KIM

295
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,493
The evidence.

296
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,373
That footage we watched right here
during Jin-seob Kang's trial.

297
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,167
Didn't the prosecution manipulate
the image?

298
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,963
Why did you go to the victim's house?

299
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,798
What is your relationship with him?

300
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,301
Why is Sergeant Kim involved in this?

301
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,553
Why are you bringing him up?

302
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,181
Why is he trying to conceal the culprit
by lying about the test results?

303
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,768
Answer me.

304
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,941
Are you sure you don't want to hear about
what I have found out?

305
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,240
Moo-sung Park was like a sponsor
to many power brokers.

306
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,285
He supplied them with money,
women and so on.

307
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,581
Then when he became penniless, he got
nothing but disrespect and contempt

308
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,083
in return for everything
he has done for them.

309
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,919
What do you think happened after that?

310
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,715
Are you saying he got killed
because he threatened those in power?

311
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,509
Also, one of them must be the culprit?

312
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,303
Sergeant Kim knows about it too.

313
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,972
Mr. Park wanted to see me that day

314
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,224
to disclose a corrupt deed to me.

315
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,561
Sergeant Kim smirked when I said to him
that I know Mr. Park personally.

316
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,190
-Why?
-He must have thought I took bribes.

317
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,152
If he had known nothing about Mr. Park,

318
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,073
would he be able to connect
an unemployed man in his 50s

319
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,575
who was found dead in a shabby, old house
to bribery right away?

320
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,621
Does that mean he was bribed too?

321
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,997
No.

322
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,458
He is far below the level.

323
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,921
He couldn't tell me his first impression
of Mr. Park, so he must not have met him.

324
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,008
It must be someone who is higher up.

325
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,012
What? How can you think
the police would do such a thing?

326
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,889
Are you implying someone

327
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,725
who is high up killed him and told those
in the lower ranks to conceal it?

328
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,310
How dare you disgrace
the police like that?

329
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,146
Last week, a detective who is specialized
in financial crimes

330
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,316
got caught by us because he was
scamming people using his specialty.

331
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,444
That

332
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,113
is different from this.

333
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,907
Mr. Park's laptop which was
in his bedroom is gone.

334
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,826
It was collected at the scene as evidence.

335
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,370
Did you see a laptop
in the evidence collection box yesterday?

336
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,373
It is not even on the police's
evidence list for the case.

337
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,585
Someone must have tried to find a list
of those bribed by Mr. Park as instructed.

338
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,672
If the laptop is returned later on,
no one would know that the list is gone.

339
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,674
There is a list?

340
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,925
Now, it's your turn.

341
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,301
What have you found out?

342
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,730
RESULT

343
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,315
ALL 11 FOUND IN BOTH SAMPLES
RH+ AND BB FOUND IN BOTH SAMPLES

344
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,152
Where did you find the blood?

345
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,862
The house behind his place.

346
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,448
Jin-seob Kang didn't even go there.

347
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,075
Someone else must have left
the bloodstain there.

348
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,494
The culprit is someone else.

349
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,584
You are not even surprised.

350
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,462
Did you already know about this too?

351
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,474
Did you know everything?

352
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,517
Is that why you charged
a random person with...

353
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,947
Who fabricated the evidence?

354
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,283
Was it you and the prosecutor
who presented the case?

355
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,548
Did you actually make that footage
to frame Jin-seob Kang?

356
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,094
The footage.

357
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,809
Where are we going?

358
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,411
Mr. Hwang.

359
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,834
Hey, what's your problem?

360
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,593
Will you be okay? Should I drive?

361
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,346
Now, there is no way
that clip is telling the truth.

362
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,306
It was fabricated.

363
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,183
They got me.

364
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,143
They got you?

365
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,188
Are you saying the culprit is
the one who fabricated it?

366
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,400
Who would go through all the trouble?

367
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,402
Why would someone do such a thing?

368
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,573
Where exactly did you find the bloodstain?

369
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:24,924
Hey!

370
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,594
You prick.

371
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,971
Thank you for this.

372
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,142
You are returning it just now?

373
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,562
By the way, isn't this that man?

374
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,940
The man who took his own life in jail.
It has been all over the news.

375
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,776
By the way, why is your car always here?

376
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,029
Is it always parked here like this?

377
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,991
This is a narrow alleyway.
This is the only way it can be parked.

378
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,534
Since when has it been here?

379
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,162
What do you mean? I was off today

380
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,663
after working for days in a row.

381
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,999
You weren't off on January 16, right?

382
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,044
From the dash camera footage, it looked
like it was parked here all day long.

383
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,589
-That...
-Did you get caught drinking and driving?

384
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,884
-You couldn't work that day, right?
-What are you talking about?

385
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,929
Some jerk reported me for refusing him
as a passenger.

386
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,390
I had to pay a fine of 400,000 won
because of that curly-haired bastard.

387
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,683
Curly hair?

388
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,394
His hairdo made him look
like an old woman. He was drunk too.

389
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,355
When and where was it?

390
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,023
When exactly in January
did you get reported?

391
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,901
It was right by Yeongdeungpo Station.

392
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,235
The date was...

393
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,656
Anyway, I think my license
got suspended on January 13.

394
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,699
January 13?

395
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,411
All right.

396
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,749
That man, seriously.
I bet he repels people wherever he goes.

397
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,042
Sir.

398
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,627
On the day of the incident,

399
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,338
did you see anyone walking by
behind this house?

400
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,923
Was anyone climbing over the wall?

401
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,342
Even if someone walked
in front of the house,

402
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,718
I wouldn't remember it now.

403
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,011
Right.

404
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,223
If you remember anything,

405
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,392
please give me a call. Thank you.

406
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,694
It is that house.
That is where I found the bloodstain.

407
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,241
If you see this,

408
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,161
it's one of those gate spikes.

409
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,470
Mr. Hwang.

410
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,772
This must be why he climbed over
the gate instead of entering through here.

411
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,066
That one isn't working.

412
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,317
How do you know?

413
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,738
It is an old model that only works
when the red light is on.

414
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,157
The culprit must not have known
that it is not working.

415
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,243
Had he been that clueless,
he would have walked right into the house.

416
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,203
Then, he would have been captured
on the dash camera.

417
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,706
How did he know about that?

418
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,211
He must have checked the area beforehand
and saw the taxi with a dash camera.

419
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,423
He even calculated the angle,

420
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,800
yet he couldn't tell
that this security camera is dead?

421
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,638
It's possible that he only thought
about what he saw.

422
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,716
That spike over there.

423
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,219
That is where I found the blood.

424
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,387
He must have jumped
from there to over here

425
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,597
and probably went that way.

426
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,990
That was discarded there
after the incident took place.

427
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,992
What he used to prop himself

428
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,662
must have been picked up that week
by a recycling collection truck.

429
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,874
I'd have found his traces had I come here
to collect corroborative evidence.

430
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,835
It was right in front of my eyes.

431
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,255
We could have found witnesses
if we asked the neighbors right away.

432
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,715
Can you find out who reported
the taxi driver?

433
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,300
Who?

434
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,844
The man he refused to take?

435
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,388
Do you think he might be
connected to this as well?

436
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,931
Because it happened on January 13?

437
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,102
Somebody made him get his license
suspended three days before the incident?

438
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,814
-It can be.
-What are you talking about?

439
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,442
Then, the man who reported him must be
the killer or an accomplice at least.

440
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,778
The victim was caught on the dash camera.

441
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,782
The killer managed to calculate everything
so Jin-seob Kang looks like the culprit.

442
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,369
No. He would have had to break
the victim's TV before that.

443
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,622
Then, he got on that cab
out of countless cabs in Yeongdeungpo

444
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,416
and picked a fight only to report him.

445
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,710
Also, he somehow made a prosecutor
find the footage

446
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,628
and use it as evidence.

447
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,549
Do you think that is possible?

448
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,842
We should check.

449
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,062
Is this Yeongdeungpo Police Station?

450
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,772
The traffic division, please.

451
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,422
The door opened 11 seconds
after the doorbell rang.

452
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,133
Someone who is right-handed.

453
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,011
A shallow stab wound on his side.
The knife brushed against his arm.

454
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,514
His neck. The fatal wound.

455
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,978
Hello?

456
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,146
In total, 37 seconds.

457
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,857
That must have been enough time

458
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,903
for Jin-seob to come into the house
and witness the murder.

459
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,295
It is possible
that the murder took place first.

460
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,629
What if Mr. Park was killed first,

461
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,424
and the killer let Jin-seob in?

462
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,100
Please don't kill me.

463
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,736
It still doesn't add up.

464
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,239
Then, there is only one scenario left.

465
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,672
When the doorbell rang,

466
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,259
he'd already been killed.

467
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,725
What are you doing?

468
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,278
You are not Moo-sung Park.

469
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,365
Who are you?

470
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,928
What were you doing?

471
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,806
So, who reported the taxi driver?

472
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,850
You mean the curly-haired man?

473
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,270
Is it someone who actually exists?

474
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,230
Yes, I spoke to him on the phone.

475
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,024
I confirmed his identity.

476
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:30,779
Put it down.

477
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
Why did you go through
the call history of a dead person?

478
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,331
Because I refuse to be used.

479
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,082
Used?

480
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,253
If I didn't come here at that time

481
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,548
and had the investigation
not been closed prematurely,

482
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,886
we would have been able to find
traces of the real killer.

483
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,847
Are you feeling guilty?

484
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,770
To the killer, was my coming here
a lucky coincidence

485
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,230
or could it also

486
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,274
have been a part of the plan?

487
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,818
If it was part of the plan,

488
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,863
the killer had to have known
that you would be coming here

489
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,448
on that day and at that time.

490
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,577
Hang on.

491
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,997
Immediately after getting off
the phone with you,

492
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,375
the victim spoke to someone named LCJ.

493
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,834
Then, LCJ could be...

494
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,045
He is the deputy chief prosecutor.

495
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,421
Pardon?

496
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,884
Does that mean the deputy chief prosecutor
tried to shut the victim up

497
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,178
and helped the real killer get away?

498
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,556
Now, he can take me down all he wants.

499
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,350
There is evidence to prove
that the apprehension itself was unjust.

500
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,978
You arrested him and got the evidence.

501
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,397
Do you now realize what you have done?

502
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,732
Is that what he meant?

503
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,236
Isn't he just below the chief prosecutor?

504
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,612
Why would he do such a thing?

505
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,366
He must have committed
some serious corrupt deeds.

506
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,702
I wonder too.

507
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,580
You don't know either?

508
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,293
He is not aware of the fact
that I don't know.

509
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,462
You should strike first.

510
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,339
He is the person behind this murder case.

511
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,883
It is still just a speculation.

512
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,221
He is just one
of the many potential suspects.

513
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,558
Let's go.

514
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,562
Wait.

515
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,817
If Jin-seob Kang just happened
to come here at that time,

516
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,989
it is possible that they wanted
to frame you for the murder.

517
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,493
Had you arrived just a few minutes
before he did,

518
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,496
you might have made
the exact same claims as he did.

519
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,583
That someone let you in,
and the victim was already dead.

520
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,917
Then...

521
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,880
Because I refuse to be used.

522
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,133
That is what you meant
when you mentioned being used, right?

523
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,137
We don't know anything yet.

524
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,932
Just like how we can't see anything
at the moment.

525
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,647
We just have to

526
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,982
turn on the light.

527
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,986
We will find out.

528
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,914
To whom should I report this?

529
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,545
It is not like I can go directly
to the superintendent.

530
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,257
Your superintendent
and the deputy chief prosecutor

531
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,134
are friends.

532
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,555
These people are not scared
of the criticism they would face

533
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,474
for driving Jin-seob to death
by wrongly accusing him.

534
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,853
They must have been relieved
that their sponsor wasn't revealed,

535
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,273
but they are probably back to being
all anxious thanks to you.

536
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,943
They want to bury it as soon as possible
regardless of how it's done.

537
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,611
There is no such thing as a perfect crime,

538
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,947
but we both know
that there is a ton of unsolved cases.

539
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,117
Letting a killer get away
wouldn't even be a big deal to them.

540
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,621
The entire Violent Crimes Unit
will be thrown upside down.

541
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,207
We caught the killer
and put him behind bars.

542
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,210
Then, he took his own life and made sure
to let the whole country know.

543
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,714
Now, we have to overturn
what we said and tell everyone

544
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,048
that he is not the killer.

545
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,760
So, do you want to bury it away
like Sergeant Kim?

546
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,764
What about you?

547
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,349
Will you be okay if this breaks out?

548
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,143
Me?

549
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,896
It will affect you the most.

550
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,526
Our job is to find the truth, isn't it?

551
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,737
The truth, which could have been
buried completely,

552
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,490
was scooped out by you
right before it got buried away.

553
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,743
You must not let this situation decide

554
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,120
whether you will bring it to light or not.

555
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,123
What kind of person is Yeo-jin Han,

556
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,709
and what kind of life has she led?

557
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,545
That is what it depends on.

558
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,221
Please drop me off over there.

559
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,837
What kind of person is Yeo-jin Han,

560
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,507
and what kind of life has she led?

561
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,093
That is what it depends on.

562
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,119
Convict Who Committed Suicide

563
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,548
Turns Out to be Innocent

564
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,269
Excuse me.

565
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,186
Yes, sir.

566
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,273
When my wife gets back,
tell her that I will be home late today.

567
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,867
You must remember the convicted murderer
of the Huam-dong murder case

568
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,786
who committed suicide
while serving his sentence.

569
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,913
While many of us are still shocked
by his death,

570
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,792
the recently raised possibility
that he wasn't the actual killer

571
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,502
is creating a big stir.

572
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,423
As Mr. Kang's claim
that he did not kill Mr. Park

573
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,799
has been confirmed to be true,

574
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,469
it is said that his claim
in his letter of appeal

575
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:54,306
that the prosecutor in charge tampered
with the evidence might also be true.

576
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,727
While public criticism is directed
at the police and prosecution

577
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,271
for only admitting their failing
after Mr. Kang's death as well as

578
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,898
for the poor quality of the investigation,

579
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,233
the failure of the investigation
means that the case has again

580
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,318
become an unsolved mystery.

581
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,112
I did it for us.
For all of you, my colleagues.

582
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,323
People already think the police

583
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,617
are incompetent and that our
preliminary investigations suck.

584
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,328
I thought many of us might lose our jobs
if this got leaked.

585
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,957
You could have waited
until we caught the killer.

586
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,250
Couldn't you wait?

587
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,169
If you care that much
about your colleagues,

588
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,588
you should have told us
so that we could investigate together.

589
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,048
How can you say it is dog's blood?

590
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,258
-Do you think you are making sense?
-Shut it!

591
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,428
Do we look like big jokes to you?

592
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,306
How dare you go ahead and disclose
what we were investigating to the media?

593
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,018
Also, you. Have you lost your mind?

594
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,188
Why did you keep
such important information to yourself?

595
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,482
Did you want to catch the killer
and become a hero?

596
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,359
Why are you being like this now?

597
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,112
I wouldn't have done it
if nothing had happened to Jin-seob Kang.

598
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,864
But he died, and apparently,
he is not the killer.

599
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,032
What was I supposed to do?

600
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,659
Are you saying you wanted people to think

601
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,994
that he is the killer
because he is dead anyway?

602
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,038
Will he come back to life
if that is not the case?

603
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,541
Will he resurrect
if he can clear his name?

604
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,001
He killed himself
because of the false accusation.

605
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,921
Think about how he must have felt
for him to hang himself

606
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,631
when he even has a child.

607
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,299
He is not the only one who feels that way.

608
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,468
Every prison is filled with people
who are wrongly accused.

609
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,889
-Only morons would do something like that.
-Hey.

610
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:18,807
Shut it.

611
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,351
How can you say

612
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,438
such a thing as a member
of the police force?

613
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,023
You two are equally out of line.

614
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,819
You two are both suspended.
You are not allowed to do anything.

615
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,571
I don't even want to see you two!

616
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,281
Get out!

617
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,949
Goodness.

618
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,501
What?

619
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,795
What?

620
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,923
-Chief, have you...
-Have I what?

621
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,051
Never mind.

622
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,400
Please give me the laptop
you removed from the scene.

623
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,362
-Sorry?
-The laptop you took from the scene.

624
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,447
Why are you keeping it?

625
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,866
What are you talking about?

626
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,326
You returned to the scene and took it.

627
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,244
I know everything,
so just give it to me, please.

628
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,164
Well, it's not like

629
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,335
I did it out of greed.

630
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,341
I just forgot to register it as evidence
because I have been swamped.

631
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,218
I have my own laptop right here.

632
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,720
There is nothing in there.

633
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,269
PROSECUTOR HWANG

634
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,108
Is this Kowane?

635
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,860
Hello?

636
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,612
Nothing.

637
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,739
I got Moo-sung Park's laptop.

638
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,658
I think it is his son's.

639
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,035
There was no computer in his son's room.

640
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,037
-Pardon?
-It doesn't make sense

641
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,997
that there is no computer
in a youngster's room.

642
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,292
He must have used it
since his son was away in the military.

643
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,588
Anyway, I will take it
to the Cyber Investigation Unit.

644
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,842
I will ask them to recover
all the deleted files.

645
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,178
There is probably nothing important
as the culprit left it.

646
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,932
He is really something.

647
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,017
He didn't even ask me if I'm okay

648
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,727
when he obviously knows
how things are now.

649
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,856
Goodness, what a character.

650
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,065
By the way,

651
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,820
why didn't he take this laptop if it was
because of evidence for bribery?

652
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,656
I mean, he went through every nook
and cranny of the house.

653
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,994
Did he open this
after he killed the victim?

654
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,249
-She is here!
-There she is.

655
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,500
The prosecutor is here!

656
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,460
-Did you really fabricate the evidence?
-Is it true?

657
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,670
When was the bloodstain found?

658
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:54,963
-Say a few words.
-Did you know?

659
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,715
Are you aware
that people call you a murderer?

660
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,306
-How do you feel?
-Please say a few words.

661
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,265
Are you okay?

662
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,601
Isn't Mr. Il-jae Young your father?

663
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,394
Does he know you tampered
with the evidence?

664
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:10,770
Get out of my way.

665
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,968
You are looking so confident
after putting your mentee in a total bind.

666
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,836
Is Mr. Seo...

667
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,047
He is not here at the moment.

668
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,133
I put wrong documents
on his desk by mistake.

669
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,219
Could you tell him that I stopped by
and picked them up?

670
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,888
Sure.

671
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,626
INVESTIGATION REPORT ON PROSTITUTION

672
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:57,836
PERSONAL INFORMATION

673
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,275
Mr. Hwang is here.

674
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:21,609
What?

675
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,542
What are you doing here?

676
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,753
Well...

677
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,047
I thought our documents got mixed,

678
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,465
but this isn't mine. My apologies.

679
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,341
Why would your documents be here?

680
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,136
You were obviously peeping at it.
Don't lie to my face.

681
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,474
Is it important enough for someone
to sneak in and peep at it?

682
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:53,683
I didn't know.

683
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,310
You prick.

684
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,730
Hey, if you have energy
to waste like this,

685
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,440
just go tell the truth.

686
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,110
Be a man and tell everyone who made
Eun-soo go through the public humiliation.

687
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,947
Okay, I will.

688
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,243
That piece of...

689
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,878
Hey!

690
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,632
What were you looking for?

691
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,884
Why were you going through my stuff?

692
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:28,927
What are you two doing?

693
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,560
Why would you do that here?

694
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,730
Take it outside since there is
a ton of reporters there.

695
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,192
Go let the entire nation know
that Criminal Division Three is messed up!

696
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,570
-I apologize.
-I apologize.

697
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,294
So? Did he see it?

698
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,131
No, do you think I would let him?

699
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,550
-I don't think he saw it.
-You think?

700
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,177
He didn't see it, sir.

701
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,139
But

702
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,266
he went through my office
right in front of my eyes.

703
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,767
He practically declares war against us.

704
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,894
Who's responsible for bringing us
the public criticism?

705
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,355
Please fire him immediately.

706
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,899
He won't have anything to say
as he has dug his own grave.

707
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,193
An internal investigation
has been scheduled.

708
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,904
From fabrication and concealment
of evidence to use of coercion,

709
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,281
everything will be questioned.

710
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,160
Will we be able to get rid of him
without lifting a finger then?

711
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,244
What are you talking about?

712
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,997
All of us will be screwed
if Si-mok opens his mouth.

713
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,586
This should have ended with Jin-seob Kang.

714
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,005
Is there any way we can avoid
the investigation?

715
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,634
The Inspector General has to be
extremely cautious at the moment,

716
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,178
yet we hit him with this big news.

717
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,096
Do you think he will do it for us?

718
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,974
Then, what should we do about it?

719
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,896
"Clamor in the east, attack in the west."

720
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,483
If we target Si-mok directly,
he will counterattack.

721
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,736
Eun-soo Young presented
the case in the trial.

722
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,989
Her face is now known as well
due to the media briefing.

723
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,283
It is unfortunate, but we will have
to hold her accountable.

724
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,494
But it is not even her fault.

725
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,538
What about Si-mok then?
Will you just leave him like that?

726
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,961
Anyhow, have you found anything yet?

727
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,508
I'm doing my best
to track her down, but...

728
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,428
How many girls will you have to catch
in order to find any trace?

729
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,723
Did I put you in charge of it
so you can strut around with girls?

730
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,726
I apologize. If she is not a working girl,
it will be harder to find her.

731
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,937
Mr. Park brought her to me.
She must be a working girl.

732
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,397
I will find her soon.

733
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,358
Please give me a little more time.

734
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,236
Tell Si-mok to come to my office.

735
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:54,697
Yes, sir.

736
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,434
She is a murderer.
She's the one who killed him.

737
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,064
She's not a prosecutor but a murderer.

738
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:41,286
Hi, Mom.

739
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,624
Mom, what is wrong?

740
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,252
Why are you being like this now?

741
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,920
Why would Dad die?

742
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,131
I will be there shortly, okay?

743
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,387
-Yes, sir.
-Come to Taehwawon.

744
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:06,144
TAEHWAWON

745
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,303
-Jajangmyeon, please.
-Sure.

746
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,222
I'm sure you know Mr. Lee.

747
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,393
This is Mr. Yoon.
You have seen him around, right?

748
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,065
You will be
under an internal investigation.

749
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,192
I see.

750
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,444
Did you know about it?
The decision has just been made.

751
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,695
No, I didn't.

752
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,406
He's always like that.
You'll get used to it.

753
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:01,783
I bet it will turn

754
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,409
into a disciplinary hearing.

755
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,246
-Do you feel that it is unfair?
-No, I don't.

756
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:12,251
Shall I order sweet and sour pork for you?
This might be our last meal together.

757
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,961
Don't be so petty.

758
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,463
Get him the seafood dish.

759
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,508
Seafood dish, my foot. Why should I?

760
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,434
Do you have something to say?

761
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,479
No. What do you mean, sir?

762
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,690
Why are you asking me?
You know what I mean.

763
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,441
I really don't know.

764
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,616
Here you go.

765
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,372
Eat.

766
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,168
Are you slow-witted or rude?

767
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,045
Just let him eat.

768
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,465
As you say.

769
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,138
Please excuse me for a second.

770
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:06,723
Hello?

771
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,726
Yes. Sure.

772
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,730
I apologize. It looks like
I need to get back to the office now.

773
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,949
Goodness.

774
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,663
We shouldn't have let him know after all.

775
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,540
Do you want some?

776
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,168
You can have it all.

777
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,051
KOOKIL DAILY

778
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:49,098
Extreme Incompetence Shown
by Prosecution and Police

779
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,484
Did you want to see me, sir?

780
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:00,735
I guess you were outside.

781
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,494
Si-mok.

782
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:10,912
Yes, sir.

783
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,462
An internal investigation
has been scheduled.

784
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,465
Right.

785
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,510
At least one person will be let go
to placate the public sentiment.

786
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,890
Dismissed civil servants
can neither work at law firms

787
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,809
nor open their own law practice.

788
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,393
What will you do?

789
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,355
I know that you bought
your apartment pretty recently.

790
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,608
You must have had to take out
a huge loan for it.

791
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,490
You know that I'm aiming
for the Inspector General badge, right?

792
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,117
I'm waiting for the announcement now.

793
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,036
That vacant post

794
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,871
will be mine.

795
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,292
It is 99 percent confirmed.

796
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,545
Congratulations, sir.

797
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,839
Congratulations to you too.

798
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,634
As your direct supervisor,

799
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,053
who will be the next Inspector General,

800
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,348
I will make you the head
of Criminal Division Three.

801
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,186
You said at least one person
would have to be let go.

802
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:18,729
I did.

803
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,274
Will it be Eun-soo?

804
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,530
What do you think of Dong-jae?

805
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,826
Was it eight years ago?

806
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,287
Because he couldn't give up
his bad habits,

807
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,831
Dong-jae hid an important piece
of evidence until the end of a trial

808
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,332
and got in serious trouble for it.

809
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,959
Do you know what he told me back then?

810
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,169
He blamed it on his trainee.

811
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,881
He said his trainee was unresponsive
no matter what he said.

812
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,758
He told me he wondered if we hired
a man with some brain problems,

813
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,385
and I believed him.

814
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,014
But do you know?

815
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,226
That trainee who was thought to have
brain problems turned out to be

816
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,606
the smartest person in our office here.

817
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,953
I saw something interesting
in the trial records.

818
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:20,541
What a coincidence that Dong-jae was
the one who dropped off the footage

819
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,043
during the trial.

820
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:33,888
All right.

821
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,766
The ingredients are ready.

822
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:39,769
What do you say?

823
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,438
What do you want to cook with them?

824
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,572
Extreme Incompetence Shown
by Prosecution and Police

825
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:05,836
You ought to be different.

826
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,339
Unlike someone we know,

827
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,134
you should protect your mentee,
don't you think?

828
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:13,970
What do you mean by that, sir?

829
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,724
Eun-soo is the one
whose name is on the line.

830
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:20,935
If you are going to be stubborn,

831
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,480
you will have no choice,
but to get fired with her.

832
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:36,951
Listen.

833
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,417
I don't know

834
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,173
Mr. Park.

835
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,511
Got it?

836
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,476
Room 1018 at Hansung Seorak Resort.

837
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,523
Shall we say you don't know
anything about it either?

838
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,367
I will think you understood what I said.

839
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,540
The head of the criminal division
isn't good enough.

840
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,840
I like this office.

841
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,304
Please give me this position.

842
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,812
Is this what you wanted ultimately?

843
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,815
Are you also desperate
to move up the ladder?

844
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:54,028
I will follow your path, sir.

845
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:55,738
Please lead the way.

846
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:58,949
Then, what?

847
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,538
Please guide me.

848
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,819
STRANGER

849
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,490
Moo-sung got a threatening call
a day before he was killed.

850
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,117
Do you think he is the killer?

851
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,785
The man Moo-sung last met on that day?

852
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,912
He used an office phone
not to expose his phone number.

853
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:47,790
-He's still a suspect, not the killer.
-Why did he have to kill the dog?

854
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:51,460
-Are you the one who killed Mr. Park?
-No, sir.

855
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,420
There's only one way to turn this table.

856
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,005
Look for a scapegoat for this.

857
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,341
Where were you at the time of the murder?

858
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,468
If I'm humiliated by this in any way,

859
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,220
I'll bring you down first.

860
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,973
If you blow the whistle on me,
things will get ugly for you too.

861
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:07,184
I'll catch the killer no matter what.
I'd rather get fired.

862
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,729
This man... He is the killer.

863
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,196
