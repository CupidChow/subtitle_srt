1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,212
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,468
Your duty is to serve justice.

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,471
You should never hide
behind the word "anyone."

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,059
I never imagined I'd be ruining
the career of the first person

6
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,228
I sincerely respected
after I became a cop.

7
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,230
Let's not go this far, all right?

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,274
He committed a serious crime,

9
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,985
and there's enough evidence
for him to get arrested.

10
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,029
He already tried
to get rid of the evidence.

11
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,240
I'll show you what it means
to have the authority to indict.

12
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,452
I'll indict you. You'll be sentenced

13
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,705
and I'll make you
a corrupt cop and a convict.

14
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,296
Chief Woo threatened to harm
a judicial police officer.

15
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,257
And Kim Myeong-han's recording
ended up serving

16
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,385
as evidence for how Chief Woo
abandoned the body.

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,513
All the statements are listed

18
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,098
under "reason for warrant request."

19
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,391
CHIEF WOO TAE-HA

20
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,382
FINALE

21
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,886
PRESS ROOM

22
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,941
The cause of Park Gwang-su's death

23
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,487
was myocardial infarction as stated
in the autopsy report at the time.

24
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,117
As for the suspicions surrounding
the location of his death,

25
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,413
the result of the police
and the prosecution's

26
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,040
internal investigation that conclude
that the body was moved

27
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,458
is correct.

28
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,462
And the statement

29
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,258
that the body was abandoned
to conceal the details

30
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,511
of the meeting that took place
at a vacation home in Namyangju

31
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,722
is also true.

32
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,863
He's not just bluffing.

33
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,242
Considering his influence
and moral attitudes,

34
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,580
I know that Chief Woo is capable
of destroying Inspector Han's life.

35
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,709
He may be able to shut us up,

36
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,254
but he won't be able
to silence Director Kim Myeong-han.

37
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,883
You're his only way out of this.

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,429
Now that he can't deny the fact that
he was at the vacation home,

39
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,348
the only way he can escape conviction

40
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,517
would be by dragging you into this
once again,

41
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,561
just like the night Mr. Park died.

42
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,690
I see that you're already picking up
nasty habits.

43
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,153
Are you trying to do to me exactly
what your boss did to Inspector Han?

44
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,739
The day of the incident,

45
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:04,118
a police official who was
at the vacation home summoned me.

46
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,747
Since I was the chief
of Namyangju Police Station,

47
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,334
I went to the scene
to sort out the situation.

48
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:16,297
Then, along with a high-ranking official
from the prosecution who was there,

49
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,509
I moved Mr. Park's body

50
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,220
to the highway in Namyangju.

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,182
You said I'll be done for either way,
so why did you come to see me?

52
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,893
Because you can choose

53
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,688
how this is going to end, Chief Choi.

54
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,943
If you continue to deny your involvement,

55
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,072
Director Kim will finish you off,
and Inspector Han, by Chief Woo.

56
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,490
Both of you will be ruined.

57
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,035
However, you also have the option
to come clean

58
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,913
and step down of your own accord.

59
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,167
And that way,
Inspector Han is protected too.

60
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,006
You're a bad judge of character.

61
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,010
Do you actually think I'd drop
a bomb like that to protect her?

62
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,388
A little while ago,

63
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,518
I saw her getting very angry at someone.

64
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,522
It was because someone did not address you
with honorifics.

65
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,649
He wasn't even bad-mouthing you.

66
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,487
She opens up to others easily

67
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:26,159
but does not blindly trust
or respect just about anybody.

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,872
And I don't think that bond
between you two is one-sided.

69
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:37,045
And I'm here because I trust that she is
a good judge of character,

70
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,466
not because I think
I can appeal to your conscience.

71
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,260
No one else was involved.

72
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,597
As of this moment,
I am stepping down from my position.

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,183
And I promise to cooperate
with the investigation

74
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,810
to clear any remaining doubts.

75
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,231
As a public official whose duty
is to uphold the law,

76
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,693
I contributed to the confusion
at the scene.

77
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,445
For that,

78
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,866
I sincerely apologize to the citizens
and the victim's family.

79
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,632
Both Chief Choi and Chief Woo lied to you.

80
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,095
Park Gwang-su never left the vacation
home, while he was alive at least.

81
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,430
Those idiots.

82
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,141
They dug their own graves.

83
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,187
Thankfully, Hanjo
hasn't been brought up yet.

84
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,940
We can't let Lee Sung-jae know
we were involved.

85
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,275
He'll try to use it against us
at all costs.

86
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,070
Well, he's likely to find out.

87
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,990
To see Chief Woo, who was sure
he had everything under control,

88
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,952
stabbed in the back like this…

89
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,416
There is one person
who can bring things back under control.

90
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,211
Should Mr. Oh make a move?

91
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,464
I was just about to say that.

92
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,342
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll listen.

93
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,177
No, it's not that.

94
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,472
I guess you can read my mind sometimes.

95
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,808
Thank goodness you work for me.

96
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,518
If you go work for someone else,

97
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,395
it'll be over for me.

98
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,774
Mr. Oh will have to arrange
the meeting himself,

99
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,775
but I want you

100
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,361
to tell them where we stand.

101
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,113
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,996
I will never betray you, ma'am.

103
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,873
No matter what.

104
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,282
Who do they take me for?

105
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,076
How dare they call me up
out of the blue and summon me?

106
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,291
You bastards!
I used to serve as the presiding judge!

107
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,418
Damn it.

108
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,097
PROSECUTOR IN COMMAND

109
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,236
I suppose you didn't get along with him.

110
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,114
You want a chance to screw over your boss?

111
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,702
You'll have him investigate Chief Woo?

112
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,124
Yes, you do it.

113
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,793
Yes, sir.

114
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,506
Mr. Kim.

115
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,508
Yes, sir.

116
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,447
Was it Chief Woo?

117
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,242
The fake witness and letter.

118
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,370
Yes, it seems so.

119
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,956
Does he know?

120
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,584
Yes.

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,350
Let's try to be positive.

122
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,728
You won't find a better partner.

123
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,063
How can you

124
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,151
call them a partner
after what you just heard?

125
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:12,987
Goodness.

126
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,615
You see, Mr. Kang…

127
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,825
I only have only one goal.

128
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,203
To retire when my kids
get their college degrees.

129
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,248
When I retire,
I'll cut all ties with this country,

130
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,918
move to somewhere in the Pacific Ocean,
and just enjoy my life.

131
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,299
Both you and I have worked
extremely hard all our lives,

132
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,092
so we deserve that kind of luxury.

133
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,223
And to get there, we must be patient now.

134
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,017
Please help me out, okay?

135
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,320
Chief Oh!

136
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,198
Hey, hi.

137
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,369
I should just call you Mr. Oh now,
but I can't quit the old habit.

138
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,121
He's a deputy chief prosecutor
and my junior.

139
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,581
And this is…

140
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,835
Let's have a meal together sometime.

141
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,379
Sure, let's do that.

142
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,048
-Sounds good. See you soon.
-Yes, see you.

143
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,304
A deputy chief is considered
a high-ranking position here.

144
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,765
He's always very polite to his seniors.

145
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,659
The eastern office
shouldn't mess with Hanjo anymore.

146
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,371
Should you refuse to do so,

147
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,876
I'll make it look like you illegally
acquired our financial statements

148
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,256
because you'd been holding
a grudge against Hanjo.

149
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,007
And we have

150
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,386
a witness right here.

151
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,017
I only ask
because I'm not well-versed in law.

152
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,020
But couldn't you face
up to five years in prison

153
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,982
for leaking someone's personal information
without consent?

154
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,027
I'm curious.

155
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,364
If you and Hanjo start
a full-out legal battle,

156
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,035
who will your colleagues side with
in the end?

157
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,407
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE REFORMATION UNIT
CHOI BIT

158
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,758
Are you happy you survived alone?

159
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,222
You think I survived?

160
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,599
You see, I was going to

161
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,893
leave you out of it.

162
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,812
That was

163
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,608
the worst moment of my life,

164
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,902
until today.

165
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,740
The one who said he'd come back
couldn't be reached,

166
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,117
and I was left with a corpse.

167
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,037
All sorts of thoughts ran through my head,

168
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,831
and you came,

169
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,169
not knowing anything,
just because your boss called.

170
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,173
We were there together

171
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,177
for less than 30 minutes, I think.

172
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,097
During that short amount of time,

173
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,765
we were in it together

174
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,226
as perfect partners.

175
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,271
That memory has stuck with me,

176
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,483
so I was going to leave you out of it.

177
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,944
You used me.

178
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,573
I used you? Did I drag you into it?

179
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,075
Take it up with your director.

180
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,203
You sent them to the detention center
on purpose.

181
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,916
You knew my name would come up
if they met with the director.

182
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,629
"That's how he got out of it a year ago,
so he would never cover for her."

183
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,634
You told them yourself
so that you could use him.

184
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,471
You must have waited until
Inspector Han left the detention center

185
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,098
so you could use me next.

186
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,727
Because you needed me to threaten her.

187
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,396
If you had truly wanted
to leave me out of it,

188
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,317
you shouldn't have mentioned the director.

189
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,363
What about me? If I don't mention him,
who's left to take the blame?

190
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,865
Me! Only me!

191
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,200
Why should I take the fall?

192
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,703
Of course, you wouldn't do that.
And you didn't.

193
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,580
So this is the outcome.

194
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,832
It's over now.

195
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,546
No, it's not over.

196
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,424
Not while I'm still alive.

197
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,447
What if I told you this is

198
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,534
your last chance to serve the public
as a member of the police force?

199
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,496
If Chief Woo

200
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,540
remains in his position,
the fake witness won't ever talk.

201
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,044
A petty criminal who's been
in and out of jail all his life

202
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,213
now has a high-ranking prosecutor
looking after him.

203
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,760
So you're saying we must bring
Chief Woo down to make him talk?

204
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,929
Yes.

205
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,474
And you want me to do that?

206
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,726
Because you're the only one who can do it.

207
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,146
You moved the body with him,

208
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,192
so I'm sure he won't be able to
deny your statement.

209
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,931
Don't be like this.
Others will speak ill of us.

210
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,268
-Salute!
-Salute!

211
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,897
This is why they say
old sayings are never wrong.

212
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,982
"Never trust others."

213
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,611
Not "Old habits die hard"?

214
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,593
If you have anything to say against
the statements made by the others,

215
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,178
you should do it now.

216
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,310
We'll move on
if you don't have anything to say.

217
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,604
How do you know Jeon Gi-hyeok?

218
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,656
It would have been perfect

219
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,992
if it weren't for Seo Dong-jae.

220
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,789
Had we never had to trace his last steps,

221
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,167
Park Gwang-su wouldn't
have been brought up again,

222
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,795
and I wouldn't have been pulled into this.

223
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,089
There shouldn't have been

224
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,925
any problems no matter the circumstances.

225
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,181
Do you admit
to interfering with the investigation

226
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,142
and deliberately causing confusion?

227
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,562
Hwang Si-mok.

228
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,689
Don't mess with me.

229
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,113
If those people
never removed the warning sign,

230
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,031
if they never posted that photo,

231
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,535
if their judge-turned-lawyer
never received special treatment,

232
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,247
and if Prosecutor Seo
never noticed any of it…

233
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,876
How is this any different
from what the kidnapper was thinking?

234
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,837
At least he can say
that he was persistently bullied.

235
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,756
What's your excuse?

236
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,142
Shall we continue this tomorrow?

237
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,444
MESSAGES

238
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,196
HOW'S IT GOING?

239
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,246
Hey.

240
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,046
Are you happy now?

241
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,715
To be on the giving end of it
for a change.

242
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,051
What do you mean, sir?

243
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,095
Why do you think
I'm letting you handle Chief Woo?

244
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,561
Have a seat.

245
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,238
I won't say this twice.

246
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,909
Don't complicate things.
He was in on it alone.

247
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,953
Yes, he made a mistake.

248
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,747
How he handled Mr. Park's case
is simply wrong.

249
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,834
But an assistant chief manipulating a case
to gain the upper hand over the police?

250
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,170
That's a whole different story.

251
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,345
I can fire him, if that's what you want.
Just end it with abandonment of a corpse.

252
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,017
What? Are you worried
the police would be up in arms

253
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,061
even if you kept your lips sealed?

254
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,981
No, sir.

255
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,567
Good. I'm glad.

256
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,736
I'm going out of my way for you.

257
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,990
Anyone else would've been fired
on the spot.

258
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,033
I'd never do all this
for a mere prosecutor.

259
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,747
If the fact that Chief Woo

260
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,625
deliberately accused the police
is made public,

261
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,128
we'll really lose
our investigative authority.

262
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,880
The police will rule the world.
Are you okay with that?

263
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,634
No, sir.

264
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,511
Exactly.

265
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,723
Chief Woo's case has nothing to do

266
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,101
with the prosecution-police conflict
whatsoever, okay?

267
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,895
I can't do that, sir.

268
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:58,859
Look.

269
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,237
I'm not negotiating with you.

270
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,782
Just do as I say.

271
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,827
I'm sorry, sir.

272
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,664
Do you want to be the one who sold off

273
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,250
our investigative authority
we had kept for 70 years?

274
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,962
If I can sell that,

275
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,673
it must mean that someone has
put it up for sale already.

276
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,886
I'm talking about those
who made the authority

277
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,014
we maintained for the past 70 years
something to be bargained with.

278
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,724
They've failed to protect it

279
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,435
by abusing and misusing it.

280
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,443
Who are you referring to?

281
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,289
How dare he…

282
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,334
You'll pay for this!

283
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,621
Hello?

284
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,623
Hwang Si-mok.

285
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,043
Yes, Mr. Kang. I mean, Chief.

286
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,006
Hello?

287
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,302
The eastern office
shouldn't mess with Hanjo anymore.

288
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,345
One more thing.

289
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,640
There are talks of a vacation home.

290
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,434
Go ahead, sir.

291
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,604
Please make sure no one in the prosecution
brings up Hanjo

292
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,691
with regards to that.

293
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,114
Prosecutor Hwang.

294
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,283
Yes, sir. Is something wrong?

295
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,121
-Where are you?
-I'm busy. I have to go.

296
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,799
Doctor! Over here.

297
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,926
-You cannot come in, sir.
-Okay.

298
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,805
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

299
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,015
Mr. Seo Dong-jae?

300
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,683
Mr. Seo Dong-jae?

301
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,852
Can you hear us?

302
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,536
Seo Dong-jae…

303
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,039
Is Seo Dong-jae's guardian here?

304
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,668
Anyone here for Seo Dong-jae?

305
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,551
Mr. Seo Dong-jae?

306
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,053
Can you hear us?

307
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,972
Blink your eyes if you can see me.

308
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,564
His hand…

309
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,026
I think he knows. He held my hand.

310
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,403
I think he can hear us.

311
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,279
You shouldn't be here.

312
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,448
The doctor is on his way.
Please wait outside.

313
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,827
Thank you. Thank you so much.

314
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,020
Hey.

315
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,357
Okay, I'll pick it up on my way home.

316
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,360
Gosh, I'm about to fall asleep too.

317
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,904
All right.

318
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,075
Thank you.

319
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,382
My goodness.

320
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,926
-Hey, you're here.
-Why did you come so early?

321
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,137
You didn't go home?

322
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,138
No.

323
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,391
Oh, they called
and said that the council is over.

324
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,976
The council has been disbanded.

325
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,105
Two higher-ups are out.
There's no way they can carry on with it.

326
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,566
We're the ones who need
the investigative powers.

327
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,151
The higher-ups ruined it.

328
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,196
Come on.
Nothing would have come out of it anyway.

329
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,115
We would have just kept
arguing and fighting.

330
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,658
But it's like that everywhere.

331
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,952
I'm worried about this country.

332
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,371
Think about it though.

333
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,540
It was natural to bribe traffic officers

334
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,751
when they stopped you on the road
when they stopped you.

335
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,795
But now, it'll get you in trouble.

336
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,255
The country looks as if it's in a mess,

337
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,717
but I'm sure people still live here
because things have improved.

338
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,386
Hey, people no longer bribe
traffic officers

339
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,389
because the fines
are automated these days.

340
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,018
Hey.

341
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:15,188
How about a drink to celebrate
the council being disbanded?

342
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,189
Sure.

343
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,858
-I'll make a reservation.
-You're late.

344
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,860
And why do you make a reservation?

345
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,029
By the way, is it even worth celebrating?

346
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,406
-Don't you want to drink?
-I want to.

347
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,535
Hey, I got you that caramel drink.

348
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,245
Thank you.

349
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,788
There's no syrup in this, right?

350
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,834
Director Kim felt guilty
about what happened at the vacation home

351
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,669
and was going to come clean,

352
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,338
but the prosecution found out
and investigated him,

353
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,298
and arrested him with another charge.

354
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,634
The council has been disbanded.

355
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,136
The government and the Judiciary Committee
make the final decision

356
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,181
because both us and the prosecution
don't deserve to do so.

357
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,435
Hence, the Reformation Unit
will also be disbanded soon.

358
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,146
-Disbanded?
-The unit will be disbanded?

359
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,983
Most of you will be absorbed
into the Intelligence Bureau.

360
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,651
So report to me until then.

361
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,570
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

362
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,996
Can we talk?

363
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,388
So most of us will be absorbed into
the Intelligence Bureau. What an irony.

364
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,557
What do you mean?

365
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,768
As you know, Chief Choi
also managed the Intelligence Bureau.

366
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,771
They obviously know whose fault it was
that she had to resign.

367
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,232
How would they feel
about you joining them?

368
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,693
We had a talk with them.

369
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,362
Inspector Han,
do you have to stay at the HQ?

370
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,198
It's not like you have nowhere else to go.

371
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:54,037
Exactly. I also think
fieldwork suits you the best.

372
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,288
Go back out on the field.

373
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,541
Just let us know.
I can speak with the director

374
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,043
and send you back to Yongsan.

375
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,755
I don't care where you two end up,

376
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,424
but why do you care where I go?

377
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,556
Well, let's be honest.
You know what you did.

378
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,141
No department will welcome you.

379
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,270
You'll make everyone uncomfortable.
Don't you see that?

380
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,314
Did you guys see this coming?

381
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,150
You've always tried to keep me in check.

382
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,779
Is it because of your career?

383
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,740
Do you want to stay here
to climb the ladder?

384
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,993
Inspector Han.

385
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,538
Even here at the National Police Agency,

386
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,459
you need connections to get a promotion.

387
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,672
Wasn't Chief Choi virtually
her only connection?

388
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,549
We're doing this for your own sake.

389
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,134
I've been easy

390
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,929
on you guys for your own sake,

391
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,055
but…

392
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,601
look at you crossing the line.

393
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,187
-Are you provoking us?
-What will you do?

394
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,357
Bring it on.
I'll show you that you were right.

395
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,359
I will show you that you were

396
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,654
actually right to keep me in check.
I don't need any connections.

397
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,826
I hope you don't end up joining my team
and crying your eyes out.

398
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,953
Gosh, you're so childish.

399
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,664
Leave her be.
Let's not waste any time on her.

400
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,416
Yes, Detective Jang.

401
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,876
Do you have time to talk?

402
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,836
Yes, go on.

403
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,631
Do you have time this evening?
We're having a drink later. Want to come?

404
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,803
You're inviting me?

405
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,847
How about that tripe place
near the station?

406
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,391
Oh, you don't eat tripes, do you?

407
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,938
Hello?

408
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,942
Well, later, I…

409
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,657
Is everything okay there?

410
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,036
We should worry if everything's okay.

411
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,082
Oh, right. Kim Hu-jeong was sent
to the detention center.

412
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,583
He was so upset about it.

413
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,587
-I see.
-He said he was unlucky,

414
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,215
and that if the victim hadn't sent
his dad that photo,

415
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,841
it wouldn't have been on the news,

416
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,427
and Prosecutor Seo wouldn't have
suspected anything.

417
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,263
I see.

418
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,725
Where are you right now?

419
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,769
Are you okay?

420
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,067
Where else would I be?
I'm working right now.

421
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,861
Sorry, but I got to go now.

422
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,781
I'll call you back later.

423
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,491
Okay.

424
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,621
She didn't sound okay.

425
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,125
It's obvious.

426
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:32,130
They must be treating her like she's
the one who did something wrong.

427
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,297
Is this true?

428
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,467
Well, I couldn't really ask that.

429
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,098
She should just come back
before she goes through something worse.

430
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,764
The council is disbanded.

431
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,100
We just showed everyone
that we're the ones

432
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,061
who should be reformed,
not the ones leading the reformation.

433
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,273
We can't make any excuses, though.

434
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,776
And…

435
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,823
you're going back to your original post.

436
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:41,991
It was Wonju, right?

437
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:42,909
Yes.

438
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,286
You're starting work there next week.

439
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,455
Yes, sir.

440
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,334
Is that it? There's nothing else
you want to say?

441
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,587
Well… I guess I should get ready.

442
00:36:56,297 --> 00:37:01,135
Did you really think that I've known
Jeon Gi-hyeok since I worked in Seongnam?

443
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,722
I thought it was a 50-50 chance.

444
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,644
You were able to connect Chief Woo
to the vacation home,

445
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,728
but what if it was me?

446
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,315
If I was the one behind Jeon Gi-hyeok,
then how would you have caught me?

447
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,609
I don't think

448
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,364
it's a coincidence that the culprit
behind both cases was the same person.

449
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,326
He seemed pretty used to

450
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,786
justifying his own actions.

451
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,332
I'm sure he didn't pick up
that habit overnight.

452
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,129
Focus on your own work.

453
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,132
I should figure out what to do now here,

454
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,135
even if our team could
disappear at any moment.

455
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,221
I'm sorry, sir.

456
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,558
-Let's go eat.
-Okay.

457
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,727
If everyone works like you and Ms. Han,

458
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,021
we won't need to fight
over investigative rights.

459
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,650
Well, they did work together too.

460
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,027
Chief Woo and Chief Choi.

461
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,614
Why did things end so differently
for them?

462
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,454
-Let's continue after lunch.
-Yes, sir.

463
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,061
Why don't you live quietly
when you go to Gangwon Province?

464
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,980
Stop sticking out.

465
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,694
I guess you can't.

466
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,907
Right. At least you should live
a different life.

467
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,555
Pardon me, ma'am.

468
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,808
Chief Prosecutor Kang Won-chul is here.

469
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,687
He came without an appointment.
Should I send him back?

470
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,034
There's just been an announcement
that he resigned.

471
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,606
You must be busy with handovers.

472
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,900
You know everything

473
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,861
that happens within the prosecution.

474
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,783
Hanjo visited my office before,

475
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,785
so I thought I should pay a visit as well.

476
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,913
So what are you here for?

477
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:19,208
The central district office
will investigate the Namyangju case.

478
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,626
You'll know soon anyway.

479
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,172
The internal investigation team
already reported

480
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,925
the possibility
that Park Gwang-su gathered

481
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,512
the officials at the vacation home
under Hanjo's orders.

482
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,431
Internal investigation team?

483
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,184
I think I know who it is.

484
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,395
Please leave him be.

485
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,898
I'm leaving the prosecution,
but don't harm Prosecutor Hwang.

486
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,694
Whether you leave or are kicked out,

487
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,280
I have nothing to do with it.

488
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,118
Is that why you came here?
To protect your junior?

489
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,288
Did you think I'd be moved
and shed tears or something?

490
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,544
I guess my senior Lee Chang-jun
was wrong until the end.

491
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,341
He said his sole mistake was not
cutting ties with Park Moo-sung.

492
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,342
But he was wrong.

493
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,179
The biggest mistake of his life

494
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,848
was being sold off to the Hanjo Group

495
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,516
and meeting you.

496
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,898
You should go now. Please get up.

497
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,278
If you had not brought him to Hanjo Group,

498
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,990
and if he had just stayed
in the prosecution,

499
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,075
he wouldn't have died.

500
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,828
And the prosecution
would have been better off.

501
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:38,787
My…

502
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,251
My husband fell to his death.

503
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,380
He exposed my father, my family,

504
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,091
the things they said
while doing business over drinks,

505
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,010
and all the dirty things they did!

506
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,554
If he hadn't met me,

507
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,391
he would have lived differently.

508
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,936
But I don't feel sorry at all.

509
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,273
Does his last moments
have to affect the work I do?

510
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,152
Do I have to follow his wishes
when making decisions for the company?

511
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,487
Never!

512
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,989
"Better off"?

513
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,369
What kind of an organization
is affected by a single person?

514
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,622
Organizations are made up of people too.

515
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,792
Corporations are also organizations.

516
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,295
You have the power to complete

517
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,549
what Mr. Lee wanted to achieve.

518
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,051
You can make a change.

519
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,637
Until when are you going to continue

520
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,223
to bribe and cheat like
those ahead of you did?

521
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,768
You can put a stop to that now.

522
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,736
Leave now, or we'll drag you out.

523
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,572
Seo Dong-jae regained
consciousness for now,

524
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,033
but we can't be sure
if he's going to be all right.

525
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,994
And Hwang Si-mok

526
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,997
is a prosecutor that your late husband
trusted until the end.

527
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,001
Please don't harm them.

528
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,670
Leave them be.

529
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,148
That crazy jerk.

530
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,074
Ma'am.

531
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,581
You're only a small step ahead
in the battle against Lee Sung-jae.

532
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,047
The central district office.

533
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:54,882
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,677
Find out who the prosecutor in charge is.

535
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,639
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,126
Why didn't you order something first?

537
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,711
Oh, your hair…

538
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,674
-Is it weird?
-I just meant it's different.

539
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,053
Excuse me.

540
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,806
-Do you want rice wine or soju?
-Soju.

541
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,475
We'll have soju. Do you want pajeon?

542
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,644
We'll have pajeon too,
with lots of cabbages.

543
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,937
-Okay.
-Thank you.

544
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,320
It's like when we first met.

545
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,322
With your short hair.

546
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,533
I haven't changed a bit, right?

547
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,543
But why did you suddenly ask to meet?
Is something going on?

548
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,212
Oh, I have to go to Gangwon Province soon.

549
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,922
What? When?

550
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,340
This weekend.

551
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:19,758
That soon?

552
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,094
I came here because of the council.

553
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,055
But it's over now,
so they have no reason to keep me here.

554
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,854
If you're leaving that soon,
who will take over your cases?

555
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,480
The vacation home and stuff.

556
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,985
It's an official investigation now,
so it should be transferred anyway.

557
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,362
It was sent to
the central district office today.

558
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,116
Thank you.

559
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,453
Thank you.

560
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,255
I never thought

561
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,134
the council would end like this.

562
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,471
I spent a year and a half
working for that council.

563
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,435
Will the higher-ups be replaced
with more honest people

564
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,480
while I'm catching bad men out there?

565
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,361
Why are you talking
as if those two are the same?

566
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,285
Your eyes are red
and you look pretty tired.

567
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,037
Were you busy with the handover?

568
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,918
I woke up in the middle of the night,
but I couldn't go back to sleep

569
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,877
because of a dream.

570
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,421
What kind of a dream? A nightmare?

571
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,840
It was about the Western Seoul office.

572
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,468
Dreaming about work is the worst.

573
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,387
And even worse
if you see your boss in your dream.

574
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,308
Everyone from back then
appeared in that dream.

575
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,396
Young Eun-soo, Chief Prosecutor Kang,

576
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,109
Mr. Yoon, Chief Prosecutor Lee,
and Prosecutor Seo.

577
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,863
What did they do?

578
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,283
Well, they were all heading
somewhere together.

579
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,286
Prosecutor Seo stopped on the way, though.

580
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,539
And Chief Prosecutor Kang
went somewhere else.

581
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,547
-Hang on.
-What?

582
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,054
Prosecutor Young, Chief Prosecutor Kang…

583
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,015
There were five people besides you,

584
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,060
and Prosecutor Seo stopped.

585
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,437
-He woke up today, right?
-Yes.

586
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,607
Chief Prosecutor Kang went somewhere else.

587
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,317
He resigned, right?

588
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,028
-Yes.
-So the other three went together?

589
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,864
Chief Prosecutor Lee, Prosecutor Young,

590
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,992
and Mr. Yoon?

591
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,828
Yes, those three disappeared together.

592
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,589
If you're leaving on the weekend,

593
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,674
then you won't have time
to go anywhere else.

594
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,884
I probably won't.

595
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,262
All right, then.

596
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,146
Goodbye.

597
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,775
It feels like we keep repeating this.

598
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,528
"Goodbye, take care."

599
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,865
Take care, Senior Inspector Han.

600
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,410
Well, I guess

601
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,079
I'll be okay.

602
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,378
Is there a chance you won't be okay?

603
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,716
Cheers.

604
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,517
Oh, thank you.

605
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,062
This looks delicious.

606
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,314
-Enjoy your food.
-Okay, thank you!

607
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,317
Wow, there's shrimp in here.

608
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,902
I'm going to try it first.

609
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,656
Yes, this is really good.

610
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,121
Hello.

611
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,967
You can talk to him
if you have anything to say.

612
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,761
He understands everything.

613
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,934
It seems like it.

614
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,043
We promised

615
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,880
to have a meal together.

616
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,927
If you go now,

617
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,931
my husband will be upset
about you coming so early.

618
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,316
People say that

619
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,361
he only trusted Prosecutor Hwang
until the end,

620
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,615
but it's not true. I heard it myself.

621
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,410
He really cared for you too.

622
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,500
He said you'd be fine on your own

623
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,336
but he couldn't help but worry about you.

624
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,339
He said he might push you away for a while

625
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,051
but he couldn't really forget about you.

626
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,432
Get better soon.

627
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,143
You should

628
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,230
walk around all dressed up like before.

629
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,780
You're the only one left

630
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,659
who can connect me to the dead lawyer.

631
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,662
We already took care of things
with his family.

632
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,420
Get better soon.

633
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,351
It must be tough for you.

634
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,605
It's all right.
Thank you for coming, Ms. Lee.

635
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,327
You came again.

636
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:38,882
I saw the news that Prosecutor Seo
was found alive.

637
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,260
We can't be sure if he'll be okay, though.

638
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,387
He's not fully conscious yet.

639
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,105
Did you have business here today, too?

640
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,609
Well…

641
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,778
The package…

642
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,907
I found out who sent it.

643
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,910
The package I got?

644
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,788
Who is it?

645
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,420
Kyung-wan. Park Moo-sung's son.

646
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,057
You must be mistaken.

647
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,351
No, I'm sure he had a reason.

648
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,897
What reason?

649
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,608
I'm not sure…

650
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,822
But I've seen victims do similar things.

651
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,409
They send packages
to the perpetrators in jail.

652
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:52,122
They do that because they thought
it might make them feel at peace.

653
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,085
So your existence

654
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,005
could have some meaning to Kyung-wan.

655
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,800
But that's just what I think.

656
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,762
You can hear that reason
from him yourself.

657
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,350
He's…

658
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,729
coming here?

659
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,106
I told you before

660
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:23,862
that you definitely made
the wrong decision.

661
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,656
I still think so,

662
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,870
but I don't think that defines
who you are.

663
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,918
Maybe you'll receive a package
with the sender's name on it someday.

664
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,505
And maybe that sender could be

665
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,674
sitting here someday.

666
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,140
You'll wait for that day, won't you?

667
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,229
I think I'll have business here again

668
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,106
in a few months.

669
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,524
I'll see you again then.

670
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,497
You saw the news, right?

671
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,957
Prosecutor Woo's getting dismissed.

672
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,252
We requested a search warrant again.

673
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,422
It'll be issued for sure this time.

674
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,717
We're going to investigate
all your surroundings.

675
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,928
Will you take all the blame?

676
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,641
And I…

677
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,186
Well, this is just out of pure curiosity.

678
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,231
What was all that about the dishes?

679
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,989
I just wrote something
that would confuse you.

680
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,118
The police mark was the important thing.

681
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,331
And he said it shouldn't show too clearly.

682
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,875
So he ordered all that.

683
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,171
How did you first get to know him?

684
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,343
I had a fight with a friend
a long time ago,

685
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,804
and he was the one who questioned me.

686
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,974
I see.

687
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,107
So, how did it go?

688
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,403
What did he get in return for doing that?

689
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,906
He was offered immunity
from being charged with petty crimes.

690
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,410
Does he think the law is his or what?

691
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,954
-Hey. Is he still not here?
-Sir?

692
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,789
They're doing the paperwork now.

693
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,417
We're finally getting another teammate.

694
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,710
Hello!

695
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,045
Hello!

696
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,092
-You're here!
-Hello.

697
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,429
Your skin looks even darker now.

698
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,723
I can only see your teeth from far away.

699
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,766
-Hand that to me.
-Hello.

700
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,768
-Here.
-Hello.

701
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,437
-Hello.
-How have you been?

702
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,563
Great.

703
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,315
-You know Detective Seo, right?
-Yes.

704
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,234
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

705
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,362
-That desk owner was promoted.
-Really?

706
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:33,551
Hello, I'm Han Yeo-jin,
and I'll be working with you from now on.

707
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,351
I hope you can help me out.

708
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:44,979
Let's go have coffee.

709
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,786
INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
CHIEF CHOI BIT

710
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,852
SUPREME OFFICE PROSECUTOR QUESTIONED
FOR MANIPULATION OF EVIDENCE

711
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,813
FORCED A FAKE WITNESS TO COME FORWARD

712
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,068
Hey.

713
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,988
You really came.

714
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:39,534
Wow, you look great.

715
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,952
It's all thanks to me.

716
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,207
I must be destined to end up in heaven.

717
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,792
I couldn't catch any fish.

718
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,129
But you used to have fish stew
almost every day.

719
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:54,382
Right. I was thinking of catching fish
and making fish stew today.

720
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,550
You should have some.

721
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,098
I have to go back by today.

722
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,729
Anyway, you seem to be relocating
to so many places.

723
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,272
Have a seat.

724
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,779
I heard Woo Tae-ha still
hasn't been arrested.

725
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,574
He'll be indicted, though.

726
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,952
I guess he won't be able to join
a law firm, then.

727
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,621
For now, anyway.

728
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,958
I heard you refused
all the offers from law firms.

729
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,836
I shouldn't join any
right after resigning.

730
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,425
How long should I do this
for it to be okay?

731
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,929
No matter how long you stay here,

732
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,599
your past won't be erased.

733
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,311
You're so cold.

734
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,442
Was it because of Hanjo?

735
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,987
No, it was because of myself.

736
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,493
It was special treatment.

737
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,037
I closed the Tongyeong case quickly.

738
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,540
If I had looked into it just once more,

739
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,627
I would've noticed that the culprit
seemed suspicious,

740
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,046
not the ones who cut the line.

741
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,300
And none of this
would have happened to Dong-jae.

742
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,803
No, not just him.

743
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,888
I bet there are many more victims

744
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,474
that suffered because of what I did.

745
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,812
What you said about my past
not being erased…

746
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,564
You weren't referring to my career.

747
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,776
What you really wanted to say

748
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,071
was that the things I did as a prosecutor

749
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,700
will have a long shadow behind them.

750
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:14,355
There was group bullying
at Segok Police Station.

751
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,733
The police will try to cover it up.

752
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,028
But I'm going to a different office now,
so it's up to the office in charge.

753
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,157
Please investigate this case,
Prosecutor Jung.

754
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,743
WILL

755
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,536
"I'm in hell."

756
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,885
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE

757
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,771
Doggedly chasing after the truth

758
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,273
and marching towards what's right

759
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,984
is a never-ending process.

760
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,613
To stop, even for a moment, is to fail.

761
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,659
Marching towards change is

762
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,162
like having two needles as your feet

763
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,706
with an invisible thread
trailing after you,

764
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,167
never stopping for a breath
as you march on.

765
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:23,925
In the belief that a handful of hope
is better than immeasurable despair,

766
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,053
we move forward
with unwavering determination

767
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:28,930
once again.

768
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:33,434
WONJU PROSECUTORS' BRANCH OFFICE

769
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,061
The Director is coming.

770
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,105
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

771
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,107
Hello.

772
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:42,693
It's nice to meet you.

773
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:44,779
Please do your best.

774
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:46,614
This way, sir.

775
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,621
I heard a lot about you from Chief Choi.

776
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,082
I'm looking forward to working with you.

777
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,668
Inspector Han Yeo-jin.

778
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,842
Thank you, sir.

779
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,345
All right.

780
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,759
When did you find out about Namyangju?

781
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,721
What's your opinion on
the Tongyeong case culprit's appeal?

782
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,389
-Give us a comment.
-Any comments?

783
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,224
Do you have nothing to say about it?

784
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,185
-How is your injury?
-Give us a comment.

785
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,937
Is he really filing an appeal?

786
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,315
Please give us a comment.

787
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,233
Sir, please say something about it.

788
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,319
Please give us a comment, sir.

789
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:10,239
Did the late Park Gwang-su
have a connection with Hanjo Group?

790
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,035
Did you hear anything about him
working for Hanjo?

791
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,494
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

792
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,261
Prosecutor Hwang!

793
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,181
Oh, Mr. Kim Ho-seob.

794
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,975
So you really were here!

795
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,268
Did you relocate to Wonju?

796
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,730
Yes, I just got here and saw your name.

797
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,858
I thought, "Hey, this name isn't
a common name."

798
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,110
It's a surprise to see you here.

799
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,406
-Which room are you in?
-I'm in 507. And you?

800
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,491
I'm in 506.

801
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:54,825
It's right next to mine!

802
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,954
Oh, did you hear about Ms. Choi?

803
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,039
She went to Hwasun.

804
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,457
Oh, that's her hometown.

805
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,084
Wow, you remember.

806
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,045
Do you remember my hometown too?

807
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,129
It's Jecheon.

808
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,132
Oh, you really haven't changed!

809
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,593
You smiled just now!

810
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:14,804
What about my hometown?

811
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,976
Seoul? Jeju Island? Geoje island?

812
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,687
Wando? Busan? Ulsan? Changwon? Masan?

813
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,522
Daegu? Gwangju?

814
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,095
SPECIAL THANKS TO YU JAE-MYEONG,
