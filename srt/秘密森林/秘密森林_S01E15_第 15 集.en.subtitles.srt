1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,919
STRANGER

2
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,386
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,724
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACE NAMES
AND CASES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,634
Yes.

5
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,436
How can it be

6
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,980
someone in the prosecution?

7
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,150
I guess it is easy to miss
what's right in front of you.

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,071
You all worked so closely with him.
How can you not have known?

9
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,284
We do all the work
while they just act cool and important.

10
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,455
Don't even get me started on team dinners.
They go out for dinners so often.

11
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,375
You couldn't catch the culprit
because you were too close with him.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,752
What Captain said was right.

13
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,880
People should keep some distance
from each other.

14
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,675
God.

15
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,344
Did he actually live here?

16
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
Mr. Hwang.

17
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,451
Yes.

18
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,877
Yes, I do.

19
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,477
Why did you kill him?

20
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,068
Because that scum

21
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,403
deserved to be killed

22
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,240
with my own hands.

23
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,372
I contemplated every single day.

24
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,666
I contemplated how to kill him.

25
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,837
I wanted to find the best way to kill him

26
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,465
so that he can understand my pain.

27
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,842
What pain?

28
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,179
Of getting burned by fire.

29
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,645
Do you know why people say "hellfire"?

30
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,651
I heard that pain from being burned
by fire is the worst of all.

31
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,531
That was what that little body
had to endure.

32
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,659
That delicate skin...

33
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,539
He was completely burned.

34
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,337
He came back

35
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,756
as a black scorched mass.

36
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,345
I'm talking about my son.

37
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,562
He was six.

38
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,067
His hands were so soft.

39
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,202
That morning, I held that hand of his
and took him to his kindergarten.

40
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,957
I got him on the bus.

41
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,879
I told him to follow his friends
and get on.

42
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,757
Have fun, okay?

43
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,259
Have a good day.

44
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,136
-Don't fight with your friends.
-Bye!

45
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,724
Yes, the bus is about to leave.

46
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,352
It's Mom. She's on the phone now.

47
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,022
Right. Yes.

48
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,151
I'll call you. All right.

49
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,068
Bye!

50
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,279
-Bye!
-Okay.

51
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,535
The bus just left. All right.

52
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,872
Yes, I'll pick him up in the evening.

53
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,876
Okay.

54
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,212
I promised him that I'd pick him up
in the evening.

55
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:34,597
-It's reported that they'll proceed.
-This is breaking news.

56
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,767
Around 4:10 p.m. today,
tires of Incheon-bound tour bus

57
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,145
exploded near Yeongjong Interchange.

58
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,731
A fire broke out after it crashed
into the guardrail,

59
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,651
and dozens of people on the bus including
kindergarten children and teachers

60
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,279
were killed or injured in the accident.

61
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,407
It wasn't an accident.

62
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,787
It was not an accident.

63
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,375
There's a device called stabilizer.

64
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,795
It helps vehicles maintain balance,
but the bus company had removed it

65
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,046
in order to save cost.

66
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,258
They used recycled tires
that were patched up with rubber.

67
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,262
The driver had gotten fired in the past
for looking at his phone while driving.

68
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,930
However, the verdict was...

69
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,185
They blamed it on the faulty construction
of the guardrail.

70
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,397
The guardrail.

71
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,068
The guardrail?

72
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,196
That is not what happened.

73
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,741
I took a leave of absence
for a year and did everything

74
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,910
to find out why my son died.

75
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,162
I wanted to find out why my son

76
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,792
had to die because of that guardrail,
which no one knows who installed it

77
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,627
because all records had
conveniently disappeared.

78
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,592
It was a murder.

79
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,635
They're guilty of murder.

80
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,680
The bastards in the bus company
killed all those people.

81
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,057
But only the driver got
a three-year sentence.

82
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,183
The owner of the company?

83
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,230
The public officials who received bribes
and allowed the company to operate?

84
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,986
In total, 14 kids aged around 4 to 5
died because of them,

85
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,531
yet those pricks didn't even spend a year
in prison.

86
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,828
Did someone have their back?

87
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,249
A broker.

88
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,586
He asked a high-ranking authority
to downplay the case,

89
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,421
and before that...

90
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,383
That bus shouldn't have been allowed
to operate to begin with.

91
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,719
The kids were going on a field trip
that day.

92
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,764
The bus could operate until that day

93
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,476
because of the broker.

94
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,062
Was that broker Moo-sung Park?

95
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,199
I have a wish.

96
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,827
I hope that my son

97
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,789
died...

98
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,336
right at that moment.

99
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,548
The moment the accident happened

100
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,760
and the bus got turned upside down.

101
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,054
Right at that moment,

102
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,767
before the fire spread.

103
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,772
I hope that he didn't feel any pain

104
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,777
and instantly...

105
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,198
I hope he died instantly.

106
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,163
His body...

107
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,294
His body got burned,

108
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,386
but I hope it happened after he died.

109
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,311
I've been praying every single day.

110
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,733
I've never forgotten about him,
even for a day.

111
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:26,996
Hey.

112
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,749
Welcome back. I'm glad to see you.

113
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,127
Those who are alive must go on living.

114
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,047
Try to bury him in your heart

115
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,800
and forget about what happened.

116
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,601
Good.

117
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,649
Who's the high-ranking authority

118
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,904
that downplayed the scope of the case
as per Moo-sung Park's request?

119
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,116
The chief prosecutor here.

120
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,411
The chief prosecutor
of the western office.

121
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,874
It was two years ago. Are you referring to

122
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,002
Mr. Sang-wook Bae?

123
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,174
He pressured Incheon Prosecutors' Office.

124
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,727
You just admitted your motive.

125
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,564
How did you kill him?

126
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,140
That was me.

127
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,071
Analysis lab

128
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,973
I had planned it for a long time.

129
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,364
Is this the customer service center?
I think my TV is broken. What should I do?

130
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,392
Where is 75-3?

131
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,110
What about Jin-seob Kang?

132
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,446
He was part of my plan.

133
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,410
I'm really sorry.

134
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,500
Was I part of it too?

135
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,837
-Yes.
-Then what about Jin-seob Kang's death?

136
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,636
That I didn't expect.

137
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,680
Are you saying

138
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,307
that you came up with the entire plan?

139
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,311
Why? Do you think I couldn't do that
on my own?

140
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,900
I had been picturing it in my head
over and over for a long time

141
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,571
since the moment I found out
that Moo-sung Park was the broker.

142
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,493
Then why have you done nothing
to Mr. Bae, the former chief prosecutor?

143
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,539
That son of a bitch...

144
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,210
Even after what he did, he wanted
to become a member of Congress...

145
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,215
I'll be sure to make him stand trial.

146
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,261
He'll be dragged to court like a dog
to face the law which he trampled upon,

147
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,055
and every one of his corrupt
and wrong deeds will be revealed.

148
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,933
I'll be sure to watch it.

149
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,770
Why did you harm Ga-young, then?

150
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,691
To let people know

151
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,278
what the so-called leaders of our society

152
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,823
exchange amongst themselves
in return for people's lives.

153
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,536
I figured she'd wake up and disclose
all men to whom she's given sexual favors.

154
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,330
You don't think

155
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,043
the chief of Yongsan Police Station
was the only one, do you?

156
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,880
Mister.

157
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,341
All guys spend money on women.

158
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,179
What do you want me to do?

159
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,890
Shall I meet your wife
in my school uniform?

160
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,977
Ga-young is still very young,
but she's just like Moo-sung Park.

161
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,437
He uses money,

162
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,316
whereas she uses her body.
That's the only difference.

163
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,402
It sounds like you're deluding yourself.

164
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,157
Whether they become someone's brokers
or use their bodies,

165
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,744
don't you think you have no right
to punish them?

166
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,462
Have those with the right done anything?

167
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,714
Is that why you killed
Eun-soo Young as well?

168
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,010
Ms. Young...

169
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,015
That wasn't me.

170
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,519
Why did you kill her?

171
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,606
I don't care whatever happens to me
from now on.

172
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,027
I already gave up on my future
when I started this.

173
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,362
But Ms. Young's murder...

174
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,197
I...

175
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,867
I have nothing to do with it.

176
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,294
You said you don't care whatever happens.
Then why did you rush to the airport?

177
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:54,049
Weren't you trying to flee the country
because you knew you'd be caught?

178
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,386
I don't have anything else to say.

179
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,763
Why did you kill Ms. Young?

180
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,018
I'm going to ask you once again.

181
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,857
Why did you kill her?

182
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,982
Did killing him

183
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,528
make you feel better?

184
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,575
It felt like

185
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,829
my heart had been completely empty

186
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,998
since my son died.

187
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,417
But that void

188
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,547
has been filled with fear.

189
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,884
The way he was looking at me.

190
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,763
The way he writhed as he was dying.

191
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,559
And the blood.

192
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,391
He declined an autopsy on his son
back then.

193
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,188
He was scared that soot might be found
in that little boy's lungs

194
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,857
which would confirm
that he had burned to death.

195
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,257
She had a severe convulsion
in his car earlier.

196
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,009
She had a convulsion?

197
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,389
When she was hiding
in the underground parking lot.

198
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,600
I guess it was because she had never left
the ward before.

199
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,314
I should've figured it out
a long time ago.

200
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,109
Yes, this is Won-chul Kang.
I'm sorry for calling so late.

201
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,947
Yes, that's what happened.

202
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,702
Speaking of which, we'll put in a request
for two search warrants.

203
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,496
Please issue them right away.

204
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,834
Congressman Sang-wook Bae.

205
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,464
That's right. The former chief prosecutor,
Sang-wook Bae.

206
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,258
The other one is for a seizure
of a company that's related to the case.

207
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,927
I know it's the weekend,

208
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,221
but please take care of it
first thing in the morning.

209
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:10,972
Thank you.

210
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,397
We'll get in trouble if the evidence
on Mr. Bae isn't strong.

211
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,649
At the moment, it's just Mr. Yoon's claim.

212
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,527
We'll find out
only after we investigate him.

213
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,695
He wouldn't have talked nonsense.

214
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,739
By any chance, did you know

215
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,160
that the former chief prosecutor
meddled in the trial for the bus case?

216
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,995
No, I did not.

217
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,375
Even assistant chief prosecutors
didn't know about it.

218
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,794
How did Mr. Yoon know about it?

219
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,798
He's specialized
in internal investigations, you know.

220
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,218
But he said that he didn't kill Eun-soo.

221
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,013
What's your thought on that?

222
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,353
I don't know anything anymore.

223
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,648
I really hope he didn't go that far.

224
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,112
I'll investigate more.

225
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,448
You should call it a day.

226
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,533
You got a lot done today.

227
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,285
You've arrested the culprit.

228
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,455
Congratulations.

229
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,767
This is the footage of the Yongsan-gu
serial murder case culprit

230
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,102
getting arrested at the airport
after a fight with the police.

231
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,022
This serial killer, who has terrorized
all residents of Yongsan-gu,

232
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,191
was an employee
of Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office,

233
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,984
which is causing a bigger stir.

234
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,905
-Oh, it's you.
-Yes, I'm home.

235
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,416
Do you know the killer?

236
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,169
Of course.

237
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:51,424
Was he holding a grudge
against Moo-sung Park too?

238
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,720
I'm not sure. I don't know that much yet.

239
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,016
That fellow, Moo-sung Park,
was too greedy for his own good.

240
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,102
Yes.

241
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,189
Have you found the rats?

242
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,403
I gave different information
to each of my two secretaries,

243
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,363
but neither of them made a move.

244
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,699
-Different information?
-Yes.

245
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,659
I told them I have a visitor from Ukraine

246
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,411
and gave them different hotel names.

247
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,998
I actually had a foreigner stay
at each hotel,

248
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,961
but neither of them tried to contact him
or reacted in any way.

249
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
You should go get some rest.

250
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,472
Good night.

251
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,229
The Prosecutor's Office Conducts
Investigation on Additional Crime.

252
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,856
DAEJUN VILLA

253
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,402
He was caught at the airport
out of all places.

254
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,407
Was it a coincidence?

255
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,519
I thought you'd be asleep.

256
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,939
We didn't get to finish
our conversation earlier, you know.

257
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,586
You should go see Soo-jung.

258
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,424
I know that she's very independent,
but she still needs her mom.

259
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,760
I can't go, but you should visit her.

260
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,391
I didn't expect things
to unfold like this.

261
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,687
You snooped on my assets,
and now you want me to leave?

262
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,274
What excuse would you have come up with
if Soo-jung wasn't in the States?

263
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,446
I'll have to make a public disclosure
of all of my assets soon,

264
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,826
including what you own as well as
all properties under Soo-jung's name.

265
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,495
That's why I looked into it.

266
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,872
If that was the case,

267
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,042
all you had to do was talk it over
with me in advance and...

268
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,503
why do you want me gone?

269
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,925
It'll be better for you to be away
when the process commences.

270
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,219
People will get awfully jealous
of our wealth.

271
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,597
Come back when things quiet down.

272
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,733
Don't forget about me no matter
how much fun you have with Soo-jung.

273
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:55,859
Okay?

274
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,536
I don't regret it.

275
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm talking about going
to Sung-jae's trial that day.

276
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,423
You said that I shouldn't have come.

277
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,382
I don't feel that way.

278
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,218
Because I attended it,

279
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,680
you can be here with me now.

280
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,058
Why should I regret it?

281
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,363
You looked so beautiful that day.

282
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,203
I saw you sitting in the audience,

283
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,872
and your face lit up the entire courtroom.

284
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,340
-What about now?
-Now?

285
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,229
You're still beautiful.

286
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,604
Hello?

287
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,859
Do you want to meet that high school girl
who sent the letter tomorrow?

288
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,152
Then what?

289
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,614
You can ask her when and where she met
that man and what she was wearing.

290
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,157
You want me to find out the details?

291
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,451
All right.

292
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,370
Are you home now?

293
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,544
Yes, I'm home.

294
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,091
The place where I said something
unnecessary and caused someone's death.

295
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,010
I'm here now.

296
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,600
Why did I answer Ms. Young's call?

297
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,270
It wasn't even for me.

298
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,734
Why did I pick it up
and make her come here?

299
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,153
Was I possessed by something?

300
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,909
What was I possessed by, then?

301
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,913
You didn't do anything wrong.

302
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,710
I was the one who asked Mr. Yoon
to join our team in the first place.

303
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,467
The special investigation's goal was

304
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,345
to catch the killer and dig up
on the Moo-sung Park scandal,

305
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,973
yet I recruited the killer himself
to our team.

306
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,478
Why did he kill him?

307
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,566
Among the former chief prosecutors
of our office,

308
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,944
there's a man named Sang-wook Bae.

309
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,237
What about him?

310
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,865
He and Moo-sung Park colluded

311
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,785
to conceal the truth about the accident
that killed Mr. Yoon's son.

312
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,246
Even so...

313
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,209
How can he treat someone's child like that

314
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,836
when he's devastated by his son's death?

315
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,631
Even if he had chosen
to live his life like that...

316
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,509
What do you mean by that?

317
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,177
His place is...

318
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,180
I saw his place and...

319
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,854
He got divorced too. It must've been
shortly after the accident.

320
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,406
When something goes wrong with a child,

321
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,949
parents end up

322
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,952
hating each other.

323
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,122
Shouldn't they gather strength
at times like that?

324
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,581
They should be there for each other.

325
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,669
I guess families like that do exist
somewhere out there.

326
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,257
What about your parents?

327
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,266
Why didn't you tell me
about your brain surgery?

328
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,351
It's nothing important.

329
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,439
Is the pain gone?

330
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,400
Yes, it's gone.

331
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,403
That's all I needed to know.

332
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,033
Tell me if the pain comes back.

333
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,332
Well, there's nothing I can do
even if you tell me.

334
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,090
You should still tell me if it hurts.

335
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,468
I can at least take you to a hospital.

336
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,809
About Ms. Young...

337
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,355
He said he didn't kill her.

338
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,317
Mr. Yoon said that?

339
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,028
Why am I still addressing him politely?

340
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,739
Did Se-won say that to you himself?

341
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:40,161
I'll need to investigate further
to find out what happened, but her death

342
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,540
might not have anything to do with you
inviting her to your place that day.

343
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,629
Get some sleep.

344
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,590
You should too.

345
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,626
What a long day.

346
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,317
You said nothing about this
even yesterday.

347
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,737
I suddenly got the urge
to go see Soo-jung last night.

348
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,907
You've held it back for a long time.
I know how much you like to travel.

349
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,660
-I'll see you soon.
-All right.

350
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,703
See you later.

351
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:05,997
I'll drive.

352
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,874
Okay, sir.

353
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,792
You're going to drive?

354
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,420
It's a beautiful day.

355
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,131
I'm leaving.

356
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,884
It's not a big deal.
Why are you smiling ear to ear?

357
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,136
Dad, it's something
you've never even done yourself.

358
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,223
See you later, Father.

359
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,077
The sky hasn't been this clear
in a long time.

360
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,206
This is what the sky actually looks like.

361
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,584
It's a good time of the year to travel.

362
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:00,968
What is it?

363
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,890
DONATION AGREEMENT

364
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,559
Let's move your cash
to your scholarship foundation

365
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,977
just for the time being.

366
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,229
THE DETAILS OF DONATION

367
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,359
It says I'm donating 80 billion won
to my foundation.

368
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,112
Yes. We have to move it there
in order to get it all back

369
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,156
after the public disclosure.

370
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,328
I'll tell those in the foundation.

371
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,675
-Aren't you hungry?
-No, I'm not.

372
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,927
-You haven't eaten anything.
-I'm fine.

373
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,595
Honey.

374
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,649
Let's go.

375
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,307
Goodbye.

376
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,277
Hello, this is Chang-jun Lee.

377
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,613
I'm calling
about Prosecutor Joon-sik Gong.

378
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,115
Yes, the former division head.

379
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,534
He'll stand trial soon.

380
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,911
No one can say things about him going

381
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,122
to the legal affairs team at your company.

382
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,373
You know that, right?

383
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,505
Yes, Mr. Song.
I'm sorry to bother you on your day off.

384
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,091
I'd like to meet with you today.

385
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,428
Yes. Please meet me at my office
in an hour.

386
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,894
How is there no trace
of Ms. Young's blood?

387
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,854
Those clothes were covered in blood.

388
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,732
I guess he wore something else that day.

389
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,861
Do killers have to wear the same clothes
every time they kill someone?

390
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,281
He must get grossed out too.

391
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,494
First, let's find the person
who bought the knife.

392
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,288
Gosh, I thought it was all over.

393
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,583
What are you doing here?

394
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,762
Did Mr. Yoon really do it?

395
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,350
No one is making it up.
I mean, he admitted it himself.

396
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,603
There's plenty of evidence as well.

397
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,107
Does that mean he killed Ms. Young too?

398
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,360
He's insisting that he didn't, but...

399
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,695
He's just wasting his energy
by denying it. We're...

400
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,656
Gosh, damn it.

401
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,742
He got caught on the run after killing her
because she figured it out.

402
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,160
No one would believe him.

403
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,622
You know what?

404
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,668
I can't believe
that this was only a few days ago.

405
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,297
I know. The serial killer was among us.

406
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,800
And the victim
who was soon to be killed by him.

407
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,847
Why did we have no clue?
He was right beside us.

408
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:42,064
I wish people wear labels
saying whether they're evil or nice.

409
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,651
I wish that too.

410
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,823
Even many of us here wouldn't fall into
exactly one of the categories.

411
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,834
They're leaving now to carry out
the confiscation of the bus company.

412
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,002
Okay.

413
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,213
I'm sorry that you have to leave
when you just got here.

414
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,550
You all must be busy. I'm sorry
I took up your time. See you all later.

415
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,343
-Bye.
-Have a good day.

416
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,678
-Oh, this.
-Gosh.

417
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,513
Bye.

418
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,558
What did you mean when you said
many of us here can't be categorized?

419
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,478
I was referring to someone specific.

420
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,483
You think he's a nice person as he seems
to be working hard to catch the culprit,

421
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,110
then you see him dumping
everything on others

422
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,778
and wonder what he's really like.

423
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,156
Whom are you talking about?

424
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,116
Captain.

425
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,495
He begged Kyung-wan on his knees
the day before he came clean.

426
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,289
The point he tried to make was
that he didn't do anything wrong.

427
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,709
I only found out about it
because I ran into him that day.

428
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,586
For goodness' sake.

429
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,255
People are more or less the same.

430
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,633
No one is that horribly evil
or angelically nice.

431
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,386
Those of us that belong to the common herd
just go where our lives take us.

432
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,764
What if going with the flow like that

433
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,643
takes you to a place you don't even know?

434
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,855
The seizure itself is a prosecution's job,
so don't step on anyone's toes.

435
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,816
They changed the name to continue
operating after killing the kids,

436
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,027
so don't go easy on those pricks. Got it?

437
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,028
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

438
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,956
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

439
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,136
Gosh, it looks like time has been
on pause here.

440
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,848
What brings you here?

441
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,187
Did we neglect what was right in front
of our eyes? Is that it?

442
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,402
After Eun-soo...

443
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,781
I assumed that things went haywire
for him after what happened to her.

444
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,367
I thought that was why
he was running away.

445
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,162
Who are you talking about?

446
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,542
Mr. Chief Secretary.

447
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,377
Where did he go?

448
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,754
His wife came by the office to see him.

449
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,381
They talked about divorce.

450
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,759
Then he got ready to leave the country
without telling anyone.

451
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,471
Getting divorced and leaving the country?
When and where?

452
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,767
That I don't know. I just got
a quick glance at the itinerary.

453
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,605
Anyway, it doesn't even matter anymore
because he's not the killer.

454
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,273
Who cares where he's going?

455
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,485
Right.

456
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,155
He certainly doesn't have
the guts to kill anyone.

457
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,908
He's just a materialistic guy
who uses his wife.

458
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,744
Mr. Yoon

459
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,872
is saying that he didn't kill Eun-soo.

460
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,584
It sounds like you believe him.

461
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,756
Do you remember what we talked about
at Mr. Kang's office a while ago?

462
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,550
I said that Mr. Young must have been
framed like that

463
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,303
because he knows something.

464
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,353
Some documents went missing
on the day that Eun-soo died.

465
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,315
They're about Hanjo Group, and Mr. Young
had been keeping them at home.

466
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,193
It looks like Eun-soo took them, but...

467
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,657
If she died when she had them with her...

468
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,410
What if she died because she had them?

469
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,456
It must've been Chairman Lee.

470
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,125
There's one more person.

471
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,838
Chang-jun Lee.

472
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,637
Gosh, he just can't get his name
crossed out from the suspect list.

473
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,183
I'll need to investigate Mr. Yoon further
to find out more,

474
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,521
but we can't dismiss the possibility
that it was Hanjo's doing.

475
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,939
That being said,

476
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,983
the man in the photos
I sent to you the other day...

477
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,737
Excuse me for a second.
Si-mok Hwang speaking.

478
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,573
Yes.

479
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,577
No, I'll come down.

480
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,164
What's the matter?

481
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,291
It's Mr. Young.

482
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,712
What brings him here?

483
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,176
Why can't I meet the culprit?

484
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,054
Mr. Yoon is refusing all visitors.

485
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,598
I just want to see him.
I can't even do that?

486
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,768
Is that really why you're here?

487
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,687
There's something I have to ask him.

488
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,689
I have to ask you something as well.

489
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,274
Let's sit down and talk.

490
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,900
Coming all the way here
must've been tiring.

491
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,998
What went missing?
What exactly was it about?

492
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,459
It's...

493
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,296
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

494
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:04,887
Since his children were young,

495
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,806
Yun-beom Lee has distributed

496
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,392
his assets to them little by little

497
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,312
and bought his company's shares with them.

498
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,064
Knowing that switching
to a holding company

499
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:20,068
meant that any dividend it receives
from its subsidiaries is tax-exempt,

500
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,987
he has evaded hundreds of millions
of won in taxes.

501
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,742
When I heard that Hanjo Distribution
went public,

502
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,952
I thought something was off.

503
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,914
Hanjo Distribution...

504
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,958
Moo-sung Park invested everything he had
in that company before he died.

505
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,961
I didn't know about him back then.

506
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,591
I knew that Chairman Lee's children
were involved.

507
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,968
Had you pushed ahead
with that investigation,

508
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,805
Ms. Yeon-jae Lee would've been...

509
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,098
Chang-jun's wife?

510
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,644
She would've been arrested for tax fraud.

511
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,564
Whether she was directly involved
or not doesn't matter.

512
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,819
Then, Mr. Lee must've been in a position

513
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,779
where he either had to betray you

514
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,865
or put his wife behind bars.

515
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,534
Those must've been his only options.

516
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,248
That's why he cried
when he came to see me.

517
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:15,958
What?

518
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,380
Did he ask you to stop the investigation?

519
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,632
He didn't say anything.

520
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,511
I think that was
when Chairman Lee was busy

521
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,388
cooking up his scheme to get rid of me.

522
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,727
Then it wasn't about an affair or things
like that. He did it to save his wife.

523
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,522
An affair?

524
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,440
It's nothing, sir.

525
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,444
That means Moo-sung Park lied to me
until right before he died.

526
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,448
Is there a chance that the killer

527
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,951
has an association with Chairman Lee?

528
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,454
No association has been confirmed yet.

529
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,749
You don't know anything either?

530
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,167
No. I apologize, sir.

531
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,007
I need to ask him directly

532
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,551
and find out who's behind him.

533
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,054
I must ask him myself.

534
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,931
Let me meet him.

535
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,934
Who's the scum

536
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,645
that killed Eun-soo...

537
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,530
Sir.

538
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,078
You know how Si-mok is.

539
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,373
He's the most trustworthy prosecutor
in the entire country.

540
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,128
He'll bring the truth to light,
so please just trust him.

541
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,089
Let me take you home, sir.
I'll give you a ride.

542
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,707
I've worked under Mr. Lee
for over a decade,

543
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,043
yet I still can't figure out

544
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,087
who he really is.

545
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,215
It is true that he has changed
a lot though.

546
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,385
I'm sorry.

547
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,303
I beg your pardon?

548
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,472
Your shoulder.

549
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,557
Get out, you scumbag!

550
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,103
You shouldn't worry about me.

551
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,940
Because you're so considerate,
wolves like Chairman Lee...

552
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,657
What does the lost document look like?

553
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,244
It's the one I used to use
at the training institute.

554
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,539
It must have the institute's logo on.

555
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,661
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

556
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,751
The institute's logo.

557
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,753
The logo.

558
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,713
The institute's logo...

559
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,171
You're here on your day off.

560
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,514
-Why are you here today, sir?
-Go home.

561
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,142
How can I go home
when you're here to work, sir?

562
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,102
Get going now.

563
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,147
Yes, sir. Have a good day.

564
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,128
Why didn't he say anything about it?

565
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,213
He caught me in the act.

566
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,763
Is Mr. Chief Secretary in his office?

567
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,640
Yes, but may I ask who you are?

568
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,393
-Please come in.
-Thank you.

569
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,149
-Shall I make some tea?
-Drop this off immediately.

570
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,151
You don't need to come back.

571
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,200
BLUE HOUSE

572
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,077
Cheongsol Scholarship Foundation

573
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,621
A scholarship foundation?

574
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,589
I'd like you to start getting ready
for selling the bank.

575
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,883
Already?

576
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,759
Yes. Why wait?

577
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,053
You did a great job at marketing the bank

578
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,390
saying that you've secured a lump sum
from Hong Kong as an investment,

579
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,225
so the stock price will go up in no time.

580
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,643
Yes, that is true.

581
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,731
The stock price will crash
when we pull out the investment.

582
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,192
When retail investors start
crying over their losses,

583
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,944
external meddling will begin right away.

584
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,239
I'd like it to be sold
before that happens.

585
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,783
There's one thing that concerns me though.

586
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,577
What is it, sir?

587
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,331
If the payment from it gets deposited
directly into my father-in-law's account,

588
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,833
it might get traced.

589
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,878
Hence, I'd like it to meander a little.

590
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,758
Our majority shareholder
is no longer Chairman Lee.

591
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,761
It's now Mr. Sung-jae Lee.
Didn't you know about it, sir?

592
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,846
My brother-in-law?

593
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,809
Has the ownership of the shares
been transferred to him?

594
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:50,769
Yes.

595
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:57,400
Then what will happen to the profit
from JR Holdings purchasing the bank?

596
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,945
It'll go to Mr. Lee.

597
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,739
The account is held in Swiss,

598
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,449
so you have nothing to worry about.

599
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,619
Oh, I see.

600
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,870
Yes.

601
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:35,981
Yes, it's me.

602
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,151
I just sent you the signed copy
with Ms. Lee's signature,

603
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,862
so take care of it
as soon as you receive it.

604
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,534
She's voluntarily donating her assets.

605
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,160
Please make that clear.

606
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,330
All right, then.

607
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,595
CONGRESSMAN SANG-WOOK BAE

608
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,560
Hello, Congressman Bae.
It's been a long time.

609
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,480
I guess you've heard.

610
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,193
Yes, there must be a search and seizure
going on at Sepoong Transportation now.

611
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:27,657
I didn't expect that you'd be affected
by the Huam-dong case.

612
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:36,207
I don't think you're in a situation
where you can worry about saving face.

613
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,587
The killer must've told them
everything by now.

614
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,631
It's only a matter of time
before your name comes up.

615
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,886
Yes, that's what I was waiting to hear.

616
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,433
I'm sure there will be something
I can do for you.

617
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,436
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

618
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,855
I initially assumed that you were the one
who wanted to proceed it quickly.

619
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:44,651
But oddly, he didn't even know
about the change in majority shareholder.

620
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,238
All right. I'll call you again soon.

621
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,578
CHANG-JUN LEE

622
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,793
The subscriber you're trying to reach is
unavailable now. Please leave a message.

623
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,673
What on earth is he up to?

624
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,551
He even used me as an excuse.

625
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,059
DONG-JAE SEO

626
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,188
Come to my office now.

627
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,108
I'm back.

628
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,944
I'm sorry for making you work
on your day off.

629
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,279
Please don't worry about it.

630
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,199
I'm so confused and disturbed
that I can't really relax anyway.

631
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,617
Here it is.

632
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,329
The airport is huge, which means
there are many security cameras.

633
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,166
I heard that the team there
spent the whole night editing the footage

634
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,209
to gather all the parts
where Mr. Yoon is captured.

635
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,631
What was the other thing? Oh, I reviewed
every call on his call history,

636
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,843
but they were all for his work
at the special investigation team.

637
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,929
It doesn't even look like he spoke
to anyone over the phone personally.

638
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,308
Please see if he had a burner phone
or a phone under a different name.

639
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,601
Sure.

640
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,771
TERMINAL AREA 3, SECOND FLOOR

641
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,190
Oh, over there...

642
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,486
There he is. That's Mr. Yoon.

643
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,531
He vanished instantly.

644
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,617
On the lower right corner.

645
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,869
Oh, you're right.

646
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,747
Which floor is he on?

647
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,082
ESCALATOR 3, THIRD FLOOR

648
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,793
He just got to the third floor, right?

649
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,003
International Departures.

650
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,680
CHECK-IN COUNTER K, THIRD FLOOR

651
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,682
CHECK-IN COUNTER, THIRD FLOOD

652
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,274
Did he know that we were after him?

653
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,443
He seems very much on guard.

654
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,077
Is he thinking where he should go?

655
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,373
I guess he didn't even have time to get
a ticket before rushing to the airport.

656
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,503
He's walking away.

657
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,588
AREA J, THIRD FLOOR

658
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,548
DEPARTURE HALL

659
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,757
FOOD COURT 5, THIRD FLOOR

660
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,050
Why didn't he leave right away?

661
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,719
I bet every second mattered.

662
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,139
GATE 14, THIRD FLOOR

663
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,310
He's going back to the check-in area.

664
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:39,576
CENTRAL AISLE, SECOND FLOOR

665
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,131
Why does he keep looking around?

666
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,050
If I were him, I would've fled right away
without wasting my time.

667
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,177
He's looking for someone.

668
00:59:58,886 --> 00:59:59,929
He's not on guard.

669
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,931
What? Looking for whom?

670
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,060
I can tell that he's looking for someone.

671
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,398
His accomplice.

672
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,859
Was he supposed to meet him there?

673
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,780
I don't care whatever happens
to me from now on.

674
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,282
I already gave up on my future

675
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,784
when I started this.

676
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,244
But Ms. Young's murder...

677
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,748
I have nothing to do with it.

678
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,168
You said you don't care whatever happens.
Then why did you rush to the airport?

679
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:35,006
Weren't you trying to flee the country
because you knew you'd be caught?

680
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,799
I don't have anything else to say.

681
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,639
Please send Mr. Yoon
to the interrogation room.

682
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,765
Sure.

683
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,030
How did you send that letter
to Sungmoon Daily?

684
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,991
I asked a girl I met on the street
to do it for me.

685
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,451
I met the high school girl.

686
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,912
Where did you meet her?
And how did you ask her?

687
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,413
It was an alley in Sinchon.

688
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,623
It was near Sinchon.

689
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,334
I asked her to send a letter
to Sungmoon Daily for me.

690
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,545
She said she followed his instructions
and sent the letter at the post office.

691
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,839
What was that girl wearing?

692
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,551
She said he must've known her age roughly
as she was wearing her school uniform.

693
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,261
-Her school uniform.
-What color?

694
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,097
-Brown.
-Brown.

695
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,980
So you're the one who tipped off
Sungmoon Daily?

696
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,693
You already know the answer.

697
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,823
Then why did you choose
Sungmoon Daily out of all media outlets?

698
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,120
Why did you send it to Sungmoon Daily?

699
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,832
The same reason as why you gave them
the information on Matsuyama.

700
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,294
I knew that the CEO of Sungmoon
would publish it as a cover story.

701
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,681
How did you know
that he'd respond like that?

702
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,518
I was in charge of internal investigations
for seven years.

703
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,353
I should know that much.

704
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,649
Is that why you knew what only those
directly involved would know?

705
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,694
Is that also why you knew about how
Mr. Sang-wook Bae meddled in the trial?

706
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,446
No one here knew about it.

707
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,156
Collecting intel was my job.

708
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,032
Then let's hear more about it.

709
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,328
How did you find out that Mr. Bae
pressured Incheon Prosecutors' Office?

710
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:31,122
I worked hard on it for a year...

711
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:35,084
Right, so give me the details
of what you did during that one year.

712
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,755
There's no way he made it obvious

713
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,591
and it's not like those who were pressured
would tell you about it.

714
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,384
How did you find out?

715
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,685
If you didn't find out yourself,

716
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,689
did someone tell you about it?

717
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,533
I see that you're trying hard
to protect your accomplice.

718
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,038
You must've gone to the airport
to meet up with him.

719
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,123
You planned to flee together.

720
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,544
Isn't that why you kept looking for
someone?

721
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,881
You looked more desperate
than a little boy looking for his mom.

722
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:26,469
Did he leave without you?
He must've had your itinerary.

723
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,680
He's the one who killed Eun-soo.

724
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,725
That's why you insist
that you didn't kill her.

725
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,812
It was a collaboration between you two
even though he betrayed you.

726
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,314
I mean, he ran away without you.

727
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,776
Or is he still in the country?

728
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,031
Is that why you're protecting him?

729
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,200
Are you two like brothers?

730
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:50,785
Is that it?

731
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,507
The person you were looking for
at the airport

732
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,843
wasn't your accomplice.

733
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,099
You went straight to the departure hall
with your passport,

734
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,685
but you had no interest
in leaving the country.

735
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,688
If you were to flee the country
because of what you did,

736
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,566
you should've gotten on whatever flight
that was available and left.

737
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,235
Instead, you kept looking for someone.

738
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,531
Had that person been your accomplice,
you would've called him

739
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,701
or set a time to meet up so that
you didn't have to wander everywhere.

740
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,495
There's no accomplice.
I did everything alone.

741
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,790
Someone else must've been at the airport
at the time you got arrested.

742
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,418
You must've gone there to catch
that person, not to flee the country.

743
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,920
You went to the entrance
of the departures area

744
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,630
and came back to buy a ticket

745
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,300
because you had concluded
that he already went in.

746
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,844
You must've wanted to get inside
to catch him. Who's that prick?

747
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,055
-I've got nothing to tell you.
-Who is that son of a bitch?

748
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,729
You said you've given up on your future
and that you don't care whatever happens,

749
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,064
yet he made you run
to the airport. Who is he?

750
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:18,998
How did it feel?

751
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,376
When you saw the dead body of Eun-soo

752
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,047
and the knife with the rose motif,
which you used to use, right beside her.

753
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,551
When you thought that someone killed her,
pretending to be you.

754
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,595
When you realized that the person schemed

755
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,514
to make the murder look like a part
of the serial case to screw you over.

756
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,309
You had to catch him.

757
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,356
You must've wanted to catch him
at all costs. Why?

758
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:47,944
You think you're not one of those psychos
who kill people for no reason.

759
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,238
You keep telling yourself
that all criminals deserve to be killed.

760
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,325
You're worse than those psychos.

761
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,954
All of your experience must've helped you
find the killer quickly.

762
01:05:58,746 --> 01:05:59,789
Tell me if I'm wrong.

763
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,835
INVESTIGATION REPORT

764
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,130
Have a look.

765
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,716
This man is the killer.

766
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,636
You went there to catch him.

767
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,013
I have nothing to say.

768
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,515
Why are you trying to protect him?

769
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:21,060
You're putting up with people
saying you got caught while fleeing

770
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,562
just to protect this son of a bitch.
Why are you keeping quiet?

771
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,398
This prick is running farther away

772
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,234
-while you're wasting my time like this.
-I have nothing to say.

773
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,989
I don't need an attorney.
I will exercise my right to remain silent.

774
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:51,966
Mr. Yoon.

775
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:55,720
I'm sure there's a reason.

776
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:58,764
A reason you can't tell me.

777
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,894
I'll find it myself.

778
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,872
It must be hard to go from wearing
the judicial robe to serving someone.

779
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,875
Not at all, sir.
I'm still a public official.

780
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,336
It looks like you still feel
very attached to your old job.

781
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,761
Sir, what do you mean by that?

782
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,097
Aren't you the one who leaked it?

783
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,725
The intel on Matsuyama.

784
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:44,518
Matsuyama...

785
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,272
Oh, are you referring to what was
on the news a little while ago?

786
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:55,362
Sir, I'm flattered to know
that you think I'm that competent,

787
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,324
but how could I leak such information
when I knew nothing about it?

788
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,911
I had no idea until they started going on
about it on TV.

789
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,121
Have some tea.

790
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:05,790
Thank you.

791
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,418
Did the CEO of the bank come by
Chang-jun's office today?

792
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:12,880
My apologies, sir.

793
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,716
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

794
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,894
Well, someone did come by to see him,
but I don't know who he is.

795
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,896
Is he a CEO of a bank?

796
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,856
Did you see anyone else?

797
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,484
Did anything else happen?

798
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,321
Mr. Lee sent me on an errand
as soon as his guest arrived,

799
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,074
so I don't know anything else.
I apologize.

800
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:41,492
What was the errand?

801
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,539
He asked me to deliver a letter
to a scholarship foundation.

802
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,415
But when I got there,

803
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,961
I learned that Ms. Lee is the chairwoman
of the foundation.

804
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,519
Yes, sir.

805
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:10,729
Call Mr. Moon
at Cheongsol Scholarship Foundation.

806
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:11,689
Right away, sir.

807
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,446
Hello, Mr. Moon.

808
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,074
There's something I want to ask you.

809
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,787
What did my son-in-law send you today?

810
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:30,708
He's moving money?

811
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,835
I never gave him permission!

812
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,299
Did you have to call at that moment?
I was with Chairman Lee.

813
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,593
You remember the photos
I sent you a little while ago, right?

814
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,761
Photos of the man
who sneaked into my place.

815
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,889
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

816
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,892
Can he be someone who works
with Chairman Lee or Mr. Lee?

817
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,768
How can I know that
from those photos alone?

818
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,103
His face wasn't clearly visible.

819
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,480
When I saw you at Mr. Kang's office,

820
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,357
you mentioned Chairman Lee's
executive assistant.

821
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,358
Mr. Woo?

822
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,819
Is there a possibility
that he could be the man in the photos?

823
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:01,697
Are you saying Mr. Woo
sneaked into your place? Why?

824
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,866
The man sneaked into my apartment

825
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,243
right after I put a stop
on the weapon import.

826
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,329
Eun-soo, who saw him that day, got killed,

827
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,581
and the documents related to Hanjo
went missing too.

828
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:11,874
Hold on a second.

829
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,322
Hey, did you say Eun-soo saw this man?

830
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:44,240
Yes.

831
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,909
-Is this a coincidence?
-What do you mean? Why?

832
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:49,995
I think this man is Mr. Woo,
Mr. Byung-jun Woo. But...

833
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,039
He's not in the office now.

834
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,291
You said you just saw Yun-beom Lee, right?

835
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,126
But Mr. Woo isn't there now?

836
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,963
No, he isn't. This was the first time
I saw Chairman Lee without him.

837
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,506
He was like Chairman Lee's shadow.

838
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:02,549
Hey, Si-mok.

839
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:05,386
Can all of this be a coincidence?

840
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,229
Please see if you can find Byung-jun Woo
in yesterday's outbound passenger data.

841
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,522
Byung-jun...

842
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:21,944
Those who know Byung-jun Woo.

843
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,843
Those who know about the jealousy
Sungmoon's CEO has been harboring.

844
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,953
Those who can find out
about Mr. Bae meddling in

845
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,997
the trial for the accident
using his authority.

846
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:26,675
Those who knew that Mr. Woo was
leaving the country yesterday afternoon.

847
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,229
The one who can move Mr. Yoon

848
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,566
to make him chase Mr. Woo.

849
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,069
Is Mr. Park not home yet?

850
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,573
Sir.

851
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:37,764
Killing a mutt

852
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:41,268
will just make you a butcher.

853
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,609
If you have to kill someone,

854
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:52,112
you should hear me out first.

855
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,915
FATHER-IN-LAW

856
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:11,256
FATHER

857
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:18,388
Mr. Hwang!

858
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,392
The name, Byung-jun Woo,
is on yesterday's outbound passenger list.

859
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:45,749
ALL EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

860
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,761
STRANGER

861
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:00,222
It's time for you to be honest, Father.

862
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:02,140
Bring Chang-jun to me right now!

863
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,351
We must strike them with full force.

864
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,520
If we approach them rashly,
we'll be crushed.

865
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,606
Control the media before they come up with
imaginative stories.

866
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,651
-Do you think you won this game?
-That's the only thing I regret.

867
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,196
You will regret that you've messed with us
for the rest of your life.

868
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,447
Who is "us"?

869
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,617
-Let's go catch the murderer.
-Request Interpol to issue a red notice.

870
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,327
Were you talking about me?

871
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,162
-I was thinking about you.
-Mr. Hwang?
