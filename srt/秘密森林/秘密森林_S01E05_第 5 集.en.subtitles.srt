1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,752
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,844
STRANGER

3
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,848
We are rolling.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,393
-Microphone check, one, two, three.
-Let's go.

5
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,774
The house you see behind me

6
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,568
is where Mr. Park was murdered
in January this year,

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,905
and another brutal crime
just took place here.

8
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,740
It sounds like another person got killed.

9
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,366
-Goodness.
-It was revealed

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,411
to the public after a student posted
a photo of the victim on social media.

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,123
A group of teenagers has been hanging out
at Mr. Park's empty house since his death.

12
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,709
They posted a photo of the victim
after discovering the body

13
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,878
instead of contacting the police,

14
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,380
-which has shocked many of us.
-The kids are coming out!

15
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,049
-They are coming out!
-There they are.

16
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,969
-Please say a few words.
-Please tell us what happened.

17
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,847
-Block the cameras!
-Say a few words.

18
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,933
-Wait.
-No photos!

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,435
No, you can't. Block them!

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,605
-Please say a few words.
-What exactly happened?

21
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,526
-Please look at the camera here!
-Please tell us what happened.

22
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,612
-What happened?
-How did you get into the house?

23
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,989
-Officers.
-Let us ask a question.

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,741
-Please cooperate!
-What happened?

25
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,451
Please cooperate.

26
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,004
What brings you here?

27
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,676
Is this related to the previous case?
Is it a copycat killing?

28
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,178
Another victim has been killed
despite your promise.

29
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,180
-Do you have anything to say?
-Please say something.

30
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,308
-Is it a serial murder?
-Is it true, Prosecutor?

31
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,274
-Prosecutor Hwang!
-Prosecutor, how do you feel?

32
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,068
-Prosecutor Hwang!
-Please say a few words.

33
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,967
FORENSIC SCIENCE OFFICER

34
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,450
Hey.

35
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,993
Try to find her belongings.

36
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,077
Whatever you can find.

37
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,537
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,749
Where on earth
did the owner of this house go?

39
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,668
She's left like that, yet none of
her clothes are around here.

40
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,003
Pardon?

41
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,797
Not even a purse.
There is nothing here whatsoever.

42
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,342
I know where the owner is.

43
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,714
It wouldn't have been easy to tie her
like that even if she was passed out.

44
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,239
There is no blood on the wall.

45
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,510
-Goodness!
-She is alive!

46
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,847
-She is alive.
-What? What did you say?

47
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,182
She's alive!

48
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,269
-She is alive?
-Hey!

49
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,730
Hey, come on!

50
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,523
-Hurry up and untie her.
-She was dead!

51
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,775
-Scissors!
-Untie her!

52
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,319
Just cut it with scissors.

53
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,362
Pass me scissors!

54
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,656
-Hurry and untie her!
-Untie her!

55
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,199
-Move aside.
-Get her up.

56
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,909
One, two, three. Goodness.

57
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,202
Be careful!

58
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,371
-Where to?
-To outside!

59
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,789
Hey, she is alive!

60
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,471
-She is alive?
-Move out of the way. She is alive!

61
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,933
Hey, wake up.

62
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,560
-Did you see who did this to you?
-Goodness!

63
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,229
She opened her eyes to live,
not to catch the culprit for us.

64
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,148
Paramedics.
Call the paramedics immediately.

65
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,408
Why didn't he finish her?

66
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,785
I mean, after all this trouble.

67
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,995
Also, why here?

68
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,747
What is he getting out of this?

69
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,772
Okay. One, two.

70
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,735
Open the door, please. Door!

71
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,237
-I think she is alive.
-Is she alive?

72
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,656
-Is she alive?
-Please tell us.

73
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,659
-Is she alive?
-Is she really alive?

74
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,038
-Is she alive?
-Please say a few words!

75
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,589
The girl is alive.
She will be taken to Namsan Hospital.

76
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,509
There are so many reporters here.
The killer will find out soon.

77
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,428
Please send us backup
right away. Yes, sir.

78
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,093
Try to be more careful, will you?

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,018
Detective Kim.

80
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,769
-Yes?
-It is from Chief.

81
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,314
Goodness, we know nothing yet.
Why is he calling? I know nothing.

82
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,775
Name, Min-ah Kwon.
Tell him that she should be around 25.

83
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,776
Who? The victim?

84
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,070
Do you know her?

85
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,198
I don't know her,
but I know where she lives.

86
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,200
-Sorry?
-He is waiting.

87
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,994
You just figure it out.

88
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,376
Prosecutor Hwang, wait.

89
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,339
How can you know where she lives
when you don't know her personally?

90
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,092
She works for an establishment
that got busted

91
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,552
during our prostitution crackdown.

92
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,929
So, is she a working girl?

93
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,181
She got caught again
during another crackdown last night.

94
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,309
She had already fled
when I figured out where she lives.

95
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,853
Now, that was two nights ago.

96
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,523
How did a working girl end up
at this house?

97
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,733
I would also like to know the answer.

98
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,360
And what it means.

99
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,238
She must have seen the culprit.

100
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,490
She must live.

101
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,700
-Prosecutor.
-Prosecutor!

102
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,786
-Prosecutor!
-Prosecutor, please say a few words.

103
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,788
Have you identified a prime suspect yet?

104
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,373
What is your thought on this incident?

105
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,126
-Prosecutor, will there be another...
-Please tell us.

106
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,294
Please say a few words.

107
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,713
-Tell us your thoughts on this case!
-Please comment.

108
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,757
Prosecutor, are you sure
you can catch the killer?

109
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,804
-I will insert it now.
-Move her immediately.

110
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,681
-Bring six more packs. Fluids too.
-Yes, Doctor.

111
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,391
-Has she had a shock yet?
-Yes, she has.

112
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,560
-It is in.
-Move her now.

113
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,897
-She'll live, right?
-It is hemorrhagic shock

114
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,315
with hypoxia and low blood pressure.

115
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,692
She will survive, right?

116
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,695
The puncture in the lung caused
blood loss and exposure to oxygen.

117
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,405
It could have been very dangerous.

118
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,658
She saw a serial killer.
She is the only witness.

119
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,410
Please make sure she lives.

120
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,621
I should do my best regardless
of whether she is a witness or not.

121
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,588
Whether she is a witness or not.

122
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,885
You must live. Don't let him beat you.

123
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,389
You were terrified. It was horrible.

124
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,101
Do not let it become your last memory
of this world.

125
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,562
You have to live!

126
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:16,907
Ms. Han!

127
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,744
-Sir.
-Hey.

128
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,120
What happened?

129
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,373
She is in the operating room now.
The doctor couldn't guarantee anything.

130
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,375
We got her identity.

131
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,294
The prosecutor knows her address.

132
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,004
He's heading there with Sergeant Kim.

133
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,174
-Do you mean Prosecutor Hwang?
-Yes.

134
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,801
How does he know her address?

135
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,971
The prosecution has been after her
due to a prostitution crackdown.

136
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,309
Mr. Park, hold down the fort
while I am gone, okay?

137
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,935
-You must keep an eye on her.
-Well...

138
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,313
Hey, Ms. Han. Yeo-jin.

139
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,761
IT IS SO FUCKING SCARY.

140
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,237
Honey.

141
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,700
Did something happen?

142
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,828
Why do you ask?

143
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,790
No, nothing happened.

144
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,545
It is nothing.

145
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,405
Good grief.

146
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,504
Goodness.

147
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,966
I would have opened the door for you.
Why did you come in through there?

148
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:39,884
You are right.

149
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,229
Is there any sign of a struggle?

150
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,362
Did the culprit

151
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,656
go through her stuff?

152
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,368
Don't touch anything!

153
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,787
It is possible she got abducted here.

154
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,547
Hey, it is me.

155
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,424
Send the forensic unit here.

156
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,718
Perfume.

157
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,595
A travel mug.

158
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,639
A makeup brush.

159
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,309
Right, when they are done there.

160
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,938
What?

161
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,151
Mr. Hwang, what is the address here again?

162
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,283
You said she works at a bar.

163
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,966
Goodness, something happened to the girl?

164
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,802
I don't know.
Something terrible must've happened.

165
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,352
Hello, you all are working so hard.

166
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,813
Hey, you made it.
What is going on with that girl?

167
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,232
She is in surgery at the moment.
Mr. Park is there.

168
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,985
Where is the forensic unit?

169
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,821
They can't come here because the scene
in Huam-dong is a total mess.

170
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,240
There are too many of these.

171
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,535
Prosecutor Hwang had no idea
she was abducted from here

172
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,536
and walked all over.

173
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,165
Where is he?

174
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,251
-He just left.
-What? Hey.

175
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,962
Did you get his fingerprint?

176
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,674
Our fingerprints must be all over
the place as we got in through the window.

177
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,761
Why did you get in through the window?

178
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,264
What do you think? Should we have
knocked down the door instead?

179
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,350
You said this is where she got abducted.
Was the door locked?

180
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,770
The abductor kindly locked
the door as he was leaving?

181
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,108
It doesn't have an electronic lock.
It couldn't have gotten locked on its own.

182
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,111
Well. If he used the door,
people would have seen him.

183
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,655
Anyway,

184
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,949
it is a mess here. Don't you think it is

185
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,576
because she felt threatened?

186
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,120
Goodness.

187
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,832
What did I do all this for?

188
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,081
There was no facial moisturizer.

189
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,126
I didn't see anything she would need daily
on her dressing table.

190
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,796
I thought maybe it wasn't an accident

191
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,341
and that she could have packed her stuff
and left home to lay low.

192
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,470
But it happened right here.
Only a few steps from her place.

193
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,308
I was late once again.

194
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,187
It is not your fault.

195
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,147
Who knew she would get abducted like this?

196
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,777
This was planned.

197
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,446
Sorry?

198
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,823
He left the laptop.

199
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,159
The blood was intentionally left there,

200
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,537
and he buried the dog underneath it.

201
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,249
Everything must have been planned
from the get-go.

202
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,546
Do you think it is a message for me?

203
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,634
I also felt

204
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,846
that someone might be leaving tracks
on purpose,

205
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,351
but why would it be a message for you?

206
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,562
I could have caught the culprit
like Mr. Park,

207
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,857
but I was late once again.
Why is this happening?

208
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,320
Who knew that you would be coming here?

209
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,245
If someone keeps harming people
around you,

210
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,623
that person must be holding grudges
against you or want to frame you.

211
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,382
Mr. Hwang, by any chance,

212
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,679
did you get involved with that girl?

213
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,182
The victim. It is like what you told me
earlier, right?

214
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,269
You said Moo-sung was like a sponsor
and that he used money and women.

215
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,189
He used her for that purpose, didn't he?

216
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,277
Is that how he bribed you?

217
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,700
If the culprit

218
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,660
is a man who loves the victim,

219
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,913
he could be holding grudges against you

220
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,581
and obviously against Moo-sung.

221
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,169
Why aren't you answering me?

222
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,671
Is there really something?

223
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,673
No, there is nothing.

224
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,635
Have a look.

225
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,429
I saw it at her place.

226
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,225
Her year of birth is listed as 1993
on her wireless carrier's records.

227
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,894
Some men might like stuff like this,

228
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,396
so it is possible
she was actually born in 1993.

229
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,524
What if this isn't a costume?

230
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,693
But it is her actual high school uniform.

231
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,822
Then, she must have been
a walking time bomb.

232
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,824
To some men, that is.

233
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,992
But it doesn't look like that.

234
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,330
He should've killed her quietly
if he wanted to shut her up.

235
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,999
This looks like he is dying
to advertise it.

236
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,918
I mean, why did he tie her there
of all places?

237
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,926
Let's just catch him.

238
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,512
Now, I really want to see
what this prick looks like.

239
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,139
I will look into this.

240
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,683
Oh god.

241
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,280
Why do you think you are being targeted?

242
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,533
Who would it be?

243
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,661
Why?

244
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,797
Yes, sir. We figured out
where she got abducted.

245
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,686
The serious teenage misbehavior
is shocking enough in and of itself,

246
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,689
but the fact that people without
any authorization were able to sneak

247
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,193
into the scene of an unsolved case,
which has been a mystery for months,

248
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,155
is making us doubt
the competency of the police.

249
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,160
Also, there has been no progress made
even though there is another victim now.

250
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,704
We would like to ask the police once again
if they are actually

251
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,414
determined to catch the culprit.

252
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,630
When will they stop fussing around
only after something happens?

253
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,716
Moreover, how many more lives will it take

254
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,968
for Korea to become safe?

255
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,683
When will Korea be able to dissociate
itself from its bad reputation of being

256
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,520
the country where man-made disasters
kill its civilians on a daily basis?

257
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,981
Thank you for watching Breaking News.

258
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,359
I hope all of you have a great day.

259
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,700
It's your doing, right?

260
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,328
Didn't you stage it as a murder
because you couldn't figure out

261
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,621
what to do after abducting her?

262
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,830
No, it wasn't me.

263
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,042
You mean it wasn't you?
Then, who is the mastermind?

264
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,795
We have each one of you in every room now.

265
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,798
You need to come clean first
if you want a lighter punishment.

266
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,716
I already told you
that we didn't kill her.

267
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,802
Otherwise, we wouldn't have
posted the photo.

268
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,929
You obviously did that
to use it as an excuse like this.

269
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,389
You think you are so smart, don't you?

270
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,475
Sir, I won't be punished
because I am under 14.

271
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,853
How dare you.
Hey, get your facts straight.

272
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,981
That is true in the Criminal Code,
but not the Family Law.

273
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,526
You are still a kid. What will you
be later if you are already like this?

274
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,527
Sir,

275
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,029
-I am not a kid.
-You little...

276
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,949
Hey, be quiet.

277
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,867
-Goodness.
-Stay still!

278
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,045
What are you doing? It hurts.

279
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,175
-Hello.
-Who are you?

280
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,219
POLICE, YEO-JIN HAN

281
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,763
Are you Min-ah's mother?

282
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,017
She is not home at the moment.
What is this about?

283
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,686
Your daughter is at a hospital now.

284
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,770
Pardon me?

285
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,106
Did you say hospital?

286
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,567
Well, she is supposed to be in Japan now.
What happened?

287
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,320
-Japan?
-Yes.

288
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,032
Isn't this your daughter?

289
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,078
No, this girl is not my daughter.

290
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,082
I got so scared for a moment.

291
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,734
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

292
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,403
-What?
-Where are you now?

293
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,489
There is an emergency meeting
at Mr. Kang's office.

294
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,615
Right now?

295
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,367
All right.

296
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,007
You all know the situation.
We have a lot to do.

297
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,843
Let's get started right away.

298
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,221
Mr. Seo isn't here yet.

299
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,056
He'll stop by
Yongsan Police Station first.

300
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,559
The new Huam-dong case.
Will Mr. Seo take it on?

301
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,729
By what standard?

302
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,900
What standard?

303
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,320
What makes you think
that you can question my standard?

304
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,990
Listen up.

305
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,451
I don't care even if you are friends
with some reporters.

306
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,120
Zip up your lips about this case.

307
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,123
The culprit is obviously determined
to make a complete fool of us.

308
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,500
Don't give people a reason to gossip more.
Do you all understand?

309
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,043
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

310
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,336
Si-mok.

311
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,547
Jin-seob's family has decided
to press charges

312
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,091
against the government,
the jail staff and us.

313
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,677
It is for criminal compensation
and compensation for damages.

314
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,762
We probably won't have to stand trial,

315
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,348
but know that it is your fault
and behave yourself.

316
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,394
Will you go on TV again?

317
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,313
No, sir.

318
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,274
You sure know how to answer.

319
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,569
This is a composite sketch of the suspect.

320
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,531
Name, Hyung-jun Yoo.
He is a member of the Yeongnam gang.

321
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,117
He used to be based in Mokpo.

322
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,870
He got himself in trouble again
right after completing his jail term.

323
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,539
Those who found Min-ah Kwon

324
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,459
They didn't do it?

325
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,212
Hello, Mr. Seo.

326
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,257
We didn't find any bloodstain on them.

327
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,011
If it was their doing,
things would have been so easy.

328
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,015
So, is it turning into a serial case then?

329
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,436
Sixty thousand volts.

330
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,520
What is this 60,000V for?

331
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,190
A permit is needed for that much voltage.

332
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,942
We are looking into that as well, but...

333
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,528
Please excuse me for a moment.

334
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,698
Yes.

335
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,242
What? She's not?

336
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,954
Then, who is Min-ah?

337
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,373
Darn it, the statement
has already been released.

338
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,418
Okay, I have to go. Hey, wait.

339
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,086
Message everyone in our group chat.

340
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,425
-Were you wrong on the girl's identity?
-Well.

341
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,596
That was the social security number
on her phone contract and her lease,

342
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,890
but it wasn't hers.

343
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:22,020
That is precisely why we were keeping
an eye on this girl.

344
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,732
She must have a connection to those
who supply minors with fake IDs.

345
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,733
But it is...

346
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,278
Things have gotten so complicated now.
I don't know how to interpret all this.

347
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,700
Who is at the hospital now?

348
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,703
Right. We sent an officer there.

349
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,830
He is there by himself,
but he will be sure

350
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,165
to keep a watchful eye on her.

351
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,795
We are always short-staffed, aren't we?

352
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,801
Damn it.

353
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:57,055
PROSECUTOR KANG

354
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,766
Aren't you in charge of manslaughter cases
with female victims?

355
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,770
I guess he wanted someone more senior
as it has turned into a bigger case now.

356
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,439
Who arrived on the scene first

357
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,317
and who knows the most about the case
won't really matter.

358
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,280
Are you trying to make me feel better
or being sarcastic?

359
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,240
You can rub salt into a wound

360
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,200
only when there is a wound.

361
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,868
You never get affected
by things like this.

362
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,791
I guess you will really behave yourself.

363
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,112
MEETING ROOM

364
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,238
Come in.

365
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,078
They have found out

366
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,247
that Min-ah was an alias.

367
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,797
Why?

368
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,009
-Pardon?
-Why did it have to be yesterday?

369
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,722
The night you went after her
all of a sudden.

370
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,683
Why did we end up with another victim
on that very night?

371
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,438
Why are you asking me, sir?

372
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,121
Do you think

373
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,748
I have something to do with it?

374
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,958
Why are you jumping to conclusions?

375
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,919
Do you feel guilty about something?

376
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,464
You even went to that bar.

377
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,633
Did you notice anything out of ordinary?

378
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,427
Did anyone follow you?

379
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,846
Well.

380
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,479
Si-mok.

381
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,565
He is the one who gave police
the information on the culprit.

382
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,026
He was tailing me,

383
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,195
and he must've followed her to her house.

384
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,323
Sir, don't you think it is strange?

385
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,827
Moo-sung Park died under Si-mok's watch,
and it happened again.

386
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,037
This can't be a coincidence.

387
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,914
You said he tailed you.

388
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,167
How did he figure out where she lives
when you couldn't?

389
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,294
You only went to the bar.

390
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,105
To me, what is more peculiar
than the timing

391
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,734
is why the culprit would target Min-ah.

392
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,236
When Mr. Park was killed,

393
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,447
I thought it must be one
of the many people

394
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,198
who were involved.

395
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,826
But with this Min-ah case,

396
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,661
it is almost

397
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,914
as if an invisible helping hand
gets involved

398
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,666
whenever you could get in trouble.

399
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,209
Have you forgotten her nickname?

400
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,005
I am asking if you have forgotten
what Mr. Park used to call her.

401
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,508
Why do you think
the culprit tied her there?

402
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,302
Why?

403
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,263
Why didn't he finish her?

404
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,141
He probably didn't expect her
to be found so soon.

405
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,688
I bet he had no idea that some teens
would be hanging out at a murder scene.

406
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,649
If it weren't for them,
she would have died already.

407
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,860
Yes, that place was their hangout.

408
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,863
They must have hung out there many times.

409
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,659
The culprit who thoroughly used the scene,
must have known about them.

410
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,580
It could have been someone else.

411
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,001
Or he might have wanted
to mete out a bigger punishment

412
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,633
so that she can't function
even if she wakes up.

413
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,429
That could be what he wanted.

414
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,708
Why did it have to be yesterday?

415
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,003
The night you went after her
all of a sudden.

416
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,257
Why did we end up with another victim
on that very night?

417
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,925
Was it a coincidence?

418
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,511
It happened on the day
Dong-jae chased her.

419
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,390
You even went to that bar.
Did you notice anything out of ordinary?

420
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,684
Did anyone follow you?

421
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,728
Was he following me?

422
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,606
Or did I lead him?

423
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,284
What will you do?

424
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,161
Her address and number.

425
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,830
Garwol-dong...

426
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,666
-That was probably when the culprit...
-behind Suwol Elementary School.

427
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,293
A building called Daejin Villa.

428
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,589
He probably left before I did.

429
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,933
No.

430
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,689
-Taxi!
-Hey!

431
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,581
Min-ah Kwon

432
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,543
It took me 46 minutes.

433
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,463
If he figured out her address
by tailing me,

434
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,173
he must have arrived there roughly

435
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,008
40 minutes after she did.

436
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,768
Would she have taken 40 minutes
when she was trying to run away?

437
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,938
She clearly saw Dong-jae chasing her.

438
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,649
Would she have wasted 40 minutes

439
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,152
at home?

440
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,286
It wasn't even 20m away.

441
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,330
He must have been waiting for her there.

442
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,583
That wouldn't be possible
if he was 40 minutes behind her.

443
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,711
Then, it wasn't me.
He must have used another route.

444
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,968
If he was someone she knows
and they were supposed to meet up,

445
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,553
he wouldn't have had to use a stun gun.

446
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,181
I mean, anyone could have seen them
in that alley.

447
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,934
He would've gotten her
into his car first to get away.

448
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,396
Yes, he already knew.

449
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,898
He must have been waiting there,

450
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,275
knowing where she lives
and that she would be coming.

451
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,444
But...

452
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,161
But he also knew
that we managed to track her down.

453
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,790
He must have been waiting
for her to be spotted by us.

454
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,500
Then, he put all of us on stage

455
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,211
and threw us into the scene
right before the murder.

456
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,967
How did he know about us
tracking her down?

457
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,470
Two days ago?

458
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,057
Well, let's see.
If it was in the evening...

459
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,768
This is it.

460
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,603
Someone on the inside.

461
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,815
The fact that he knew
people from our office were after her

462
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,567
means he is somehow connected.

463
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,070
I don't think he saw us
while hovering around her day and night.

464
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,573
He must either be someone who works here

465
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,993
or someone who is connected in some way.

466
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,037
Why is it so empty?

467
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,079
It is usually...

468
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,331
That's right. At this time two days ago,

469
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,667
Mr. Lee was giving his speech
in the assembly hall.

470
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,211
Why did he have to do that
at the end of the day?

471
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,557
Dong-jae, the investigator in his office,

472
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,185
Mr. Lee, who must have received
a report about it, and me.

473
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,480
In this building, those four people
knew about...

474
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,073
No, five.

475
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,918
Hey, are you not going to
answer the phone?

476
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,921
These people need a lesson.

477
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,341
This is Yongsan Police Station.

478
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,011
Hello? Please go ahead.

479
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,683
Well,

480
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,061
it is okay.

481
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,771
Why are you calling?

482
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,065
Where are you calling from?

483
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,739
Sergeant Kim, we have a big problem.

484
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,449
What now? Did another person get killed?

485
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,452
You need to see what we found
on the weapon.

486
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,582
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS

487
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,126
RESULT OF ANALYSIS

488
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,630
Hey, are you sure this is right?

489
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,632
You got the fingerprint.
I am certain of it.

490
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,684
Hello?

491
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,102
Hello.

492
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,104
Listen.

493
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,149
It is really okay.

494
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,192
Just tell me why you are calling.

495
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,153
I will keep it confidential.

496
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,363
Well... I think

497
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,740
I saw the culprit.

498
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,492
What is it?

499
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,791
You saw the culprit?

500
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,296
Please go on.

501
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,843
What should we do, Chang-jun?

502
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,429
I just got a call from the chairman.

503
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,223
He called you directly?
What is the problem though?

504
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,268
About the Huam-dong case.
He asked me what is going on with it,

505
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,519
and I ended up telling him.

506
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,855
I couldn't say we haven't even identified
any suspect yet.

507
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,315
So, what did you tell him?

508
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,233
I actually just got a report about it.

509
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,235
I was going to tell you first, but...

510
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,737
Stop beating around the bush.

511
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,073
What?

512
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,285
What did you just say?

513
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,086
All of this?

514
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,965
-Take them to the records room.
-I can go.

515
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,031
Forget it.

516
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,411
What was that about?

517
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,624
Hello, sir.

518
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,465
I am going to the post office.

519
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,387
It is so tense here
every single day. Goodness.

520
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,271
Are you the one with the knife?

521
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,065
Are you the one who stabbed the girl?

522
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,650
No, I didn't.

523
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,277
Your fingerprints

524
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,238
were found all over the weapon.
How will you explain it?

525
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,491
I touched it.

526
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,618
Tell me.

527
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,621
Have you gotten into an alliance
with someone to stop my promotion?

528
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,915
I am sorry,

529
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,085
but I have never seen anyone
who wants to be my ally.

530
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,586
I am not here to joke around with you!

531
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,882
Your fingerprint is all over the weapon
and everything in her house.

532
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,845
There is more. There is now a witness
who is saying you are the culprit.

533
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,806
Thanks to you, not a day here
goes by without problems!

534
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,144
Every piece of evidence
is perfectly pointing to me.

535
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,646
Then, why don't you think
that I am the culprit?

536
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,317
-You piece of...
-I used to be called a psycho,

537
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,776
and even all the evidence is perfect.

538
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,654
Why aren't you suspicious of me at all?

539
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,282
Is it because you know who the culprit is?

540
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,118
-How dare you, son of a...
-Min-ah.

541
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,455
Did you do it, sir?

542
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,753
No matter

543
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,005
how cornered one feels,

544
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,466
one must know what one shouldn't do.

545
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,760
Last October,

546
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,888
Mr. Park sent an underage girl to you.

547
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,059
Then, he threatened you saying he would
disclose it all as you didn't help him,

548
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,185
but he ended up

549
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,936
getting silenced for good.

550
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,646
Also today,

551
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,274
that underage girl was found.

552
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,027
The girl, whom you have been
so desperately looking for,

553
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,154
was found nearly dead.

554
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,366
Can all of this be a coincidence?

555
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,665
Please tell me the truth.

556
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,377
Nothing happened.

557
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,422
Nothing happened.

558
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,717
Not because I am fastidious to the point
that people question my orientation.

559
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,511
Mr. Park was already going downhill then.

560
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,476
I only opened the door for him
so he wouldn't cause a scene,

561
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,936
but it wasn't him. It was a woman.

562
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,439
No one would have been able to guess
that she could be a minor.

563
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,192
Yes, I admit that I was tempted.

564
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,652
But I told her to leave. Why?

565
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,904
Because I knew that it was a trap.

566
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,989
I knew that it would be
a sure way to a muddy road.

567
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,659
I know you think
no one is smarter than you.

568
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,203
But know this, Si-mok. I am above you.

569
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,542
Min-ah must have blackmailed you
since her source of income, Mr. Park died,

570
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,504
saying that the whole world
would believe her over you no matter

571
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,297
how desperately you try
to plead your innocence.

572
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,346
Mr. Park called her Bell.

573
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,558
What does that mean?

574
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,561
It is because she always showed up.

575
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,439
She is like a doorbell
that is answered right away.

576
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,942
Do you think he rang that bell
only for me?

577
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,031
We are prosecutors.

578
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,368
Some of us accept money
or such forms of entertainment as a bribe.

579
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,621
Some former high-ups expect
special treatment on their cases.

580
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,876
It happens when people like us study
only to gain power and honor.

581
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,795
Some of us are immature
and act up, but we are still prosecutors.

582
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,175
We are here to protect the law
and to fight for justice.

583
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,138
I have a faith.

584
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,141
I believe that there are two types
of people in this building.

585
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,394
Guardians and criminals.
Barrister's robes and prison uniforms.

586
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,521
No matter what the situation may be,

587
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,608
I believe we are different
from those we need to punish.

588
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,778
I firmly trust that we would never
harm others no matter how lax we become.

589
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,991
But what did you just accuse me of?

590
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,871
You didn't answer my question.

591
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,670
I did not kill anyone.

592
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,383
That was discourteous of me. I apologize.

593
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,974
Prosecutor. Prosecutor Hwang.

594
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,935
Prosecutor Hwang, are you there?

595
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,480
It is your turn now.

596
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,027
What is going on?

597
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,988
That is what I want to ask you.
What on earth...

598
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,122
Sir.

599
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,130
I would like to ask him a few questions.
It is for the investigation.

600
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,680
Prosecutor Hwang,
where were you between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.

601
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,139
last night?

602
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,397
Your colleagues must have been
here too, right?

603
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,191
No, everyone had left for the day.

604
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,319
Does that mean you were alone here?
Oh dear.

605
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,738
We have never dealt
with something like this before.

606
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,158
I touched the knife used
for the attempted murder of Min-ah

607
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,493
with my bare hands ten days ago.

608
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,831
How did that happen?

609
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,542
I tried reenacting the crime at the scene

610
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,503
to see if Jin-seob's claim could be true.

611
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,048
I used a knife I found in the kitchen
that looked similar to the murder weapon

612
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,092
although it was a little smaller.

613
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,052
Can you prove it in any way?

614
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,971
Except for your words...

615
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,392
Was the culprit's fingerprint
not found on the weapon at all?

616
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,437
No. We only found yours.

617
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,898
The way you asked that question

618
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,360
makes it sound like you want to tell me
the culprit's fingerprints

619
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,404
shouldn't be the same as yours.

620
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,989
Let me tell you.

621
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,908
Coming here wasn't easy for us.

622
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,161
The fingerprint isn't the only problem.

623
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,957
Someone called us claiming
that you are the culprit.

624
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,710
You are talking
about the illegal taxi driver, right?

625
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,172
I got Min-ah's address from him.

626
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,258
Dong-jae.

627
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,304
I didn't think it was you.

628
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,182
But the witness said
that you were very violent toward him.

629
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,895
He tried not to give you her address
because of his loyalty to those girls,

630
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,940
but he thought he could die
if he continued to refuse your request.

631
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,652
I didn't believe him, of course.

632
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,987
Everyone must have their reasons.

633
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,823
Well, thinking from the taxi driver's
perspective,

634
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,325
I could look like the culprit

635
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,994
because the incident took place
on the same day.

636
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,371
But what happened after that

637
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,873
is not any different from what I told you

638
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,625
when I took you to the victim's place.

639
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,959
I got her address,

640
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,796
-but she had already left.
-You took him there?

641
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,007
Are you saying we helped the police
confirm the victim's identity?

642
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,885
His chief didn't mention
anything to me though.

643
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,723
I guess they wanted to take
all the credit. Well, it happens.

644
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,768
That being said,

645
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,815
I did some thinking too.

646
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,902
I thought about why you took us there

647
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,780
when you had something
to feel guilty about.

648
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,534
Then, this thought popped into my head.

649
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:07,454
If your claim that you didn't see her
when you got to her place isn't true,

650
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,874
and if you actually followed that girl

651
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,918
into her place last night,

652
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,505
you must have thought hard
about what to do with your traces

653
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,632
which you left all over her place.

654
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,344
That must be why you went in there again
accompanied by us, the police.

655
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,556
Your fingerprint has been found.
And we have a witness.

656
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,517
You were most likely the last person
who saw the victim.

657
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,813
What would you do
if you meet a suspect like that?

658
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,817
I think I have already explained
everything to you.

659
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:41,280
Someone also strongly claimed
his innocence a while ago.

660
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,449
But what did you do to him?

661
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,452
I arrested and charged him.

662
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,455
What are you all doing here?

663
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,960
Bring firmer evidence
if you want to take one of my people.

664
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,716
For goodness' sake.

665
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:11,018
What can be firmer evidence
than fingerprints?

666
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,240
Good grief. How dare he...

667
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,373
They are being ridiculous.

668
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,168
They would have locked him up already
if they were in my shoes.

669
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,673
That is right. We would have put him
behind bars immediately.

670
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,966
What I meant was...

671
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,473
That is why

672
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,268
it has to be indisputable.

673
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,023
Of course.

674
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,279
Here.

675
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:10,035
This one. It is
Yangkang High School's uniform.

676
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,871
They actually changed the design
last year. We no longer make this design.

677
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:13,956
Why do you need this?

678
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,083
Did you say Yangkang High School?

679
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,961
Okay. Thank you.

680
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,277
Hey, come down already.

681
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,319
YANGKANG HIGH SCHOOL

682
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,114
Goodness, don't follow me.

683
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,825
Hey, stop. Wait up.

684
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,451
Hey.

685
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,207
You should have been like that too.

686
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,211
I am sorry to interrupt your class.

687
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,717
This student.
You were her homeroom teacher, right?

688
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,385
My goodness, it is Ga-young.

689
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,970
Where did you find her?

690
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,471
Where is she now?

691
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,890
Did she run away from home?

692
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,434
We filed a police report too.

693
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,852
Isn't that why you are here?

694
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,480
She was found unconscious

695
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,774
in Huam-dong early this morning.

696
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,818
Pardon me?

697
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,071
Well. When did she run away from home?

698
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,323
How old was she at the time?

699
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,199
Huam-dong...

700
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,413
I saw it in the news. The incident
happened at Kyung-wan's place.

701
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,456
Is that it?

702
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,417
Kyung-wan? Who is Kyung-wan...

703
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,045
This is my grandson.

704
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,006
I heard you are serving
in the military now.

705
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:50,886
Excuse me for a moment.

706
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,600
Mr. Park sent about five million won
to Min-ah's account every month

707
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,310
until the end of last year.

708
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,607
Min-ah. I mean, Ga-young Kim.

709
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,484
What year was she born?

710
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,362
She was in 12th grade last year, so...

711
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,031
The 12th graders last year were...

712
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,325
She was born in 1998.

713
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,371
I see.

714
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,332
Thank you.

715
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,626
No problem.

716
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,838
I had no idea.

717
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,634
She said she was born in 1993
and even showed me her ID.

718
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,636
How would I know that she was a minor?

719
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,513
When was the last time you saw her?

720
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,682
Three days ago. At work.

721
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,225
Why didn't she work the last two days?

722
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,811
That prosecutor caused a total ruckus.
Of course she couldn't come.

723
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,479
Is that why you gave him her address?

724
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,606
To whom else have you given her address?

725
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,319
I don't know where Min-ah lives.

726
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,238
How can I give anyone information
that I don't have?

727
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,490
Even if I had known her address,

728
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,702
I wouldn't have given it to anyone.

729
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,746
My numbers would drop if my girls
meet up with customers elsewhere.

730
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,000
You must know this man.

731
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,211
I have never seen him before.

732
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,130
Take a good look!

733
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,591
-You know him, don't you?
-I told you. I have never seen him.

734
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,468
I want names of all the places
she has worked.

735
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,513
-She only started a few days ago...
-Write them down!

736
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,454
We were able to prevent organ damage,
but cerebral hemorrhage is the problem.

737
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:26,208
She could have hit her head hard somewhere
or it might be caused by the assault.

738
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,542
There is a pool of blood inside.

739
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,504
We will need to open up her cranium
in order to remove it now.

740
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,672
Her body won't be able to handle it.

741
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,509
It will be better to remove it
using tubing later on, but...

742
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:36,968
But what?

743
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,261
In the worst-case scenario,

744
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,388
her brain may not function afterward.

745
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,520
Well, did you notice additional signs
of assault anywhere else?

746
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,855
No, I didn't see anything else.

747
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,107
Thank you, Doctor.

748
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,748
Goodness, you startled me.

749
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,293
-My apologies.
-It is okay.

750
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,035
Why did it come off?

751
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,121
I would've gotten in big trouble for it.

752
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,880
My daughter, Ga-young. My goodness.

753
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:00,802
Goodness.

754
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,062
Ga-young.

755
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,483
Ga-young.

756
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,660
What should we do?

757
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,454
-It looks like he is in shock.
-Hush.

758
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,041
I have a faith.

759
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,586
I believe that there are two types
of people in this building.

760
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,048
Guardians and criminals.
Barrister's robes and prison uniforms.

761
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,550
No matter what the situation may be,

762
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,219
I believe we are different
from those whom we need to punish.

763
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,347
I firmly trust

764
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,225
that we would never harm others
no matter how lax we become.

765
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,439
Nothing happened.
I admit that I was tempted.

766
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,232
But I told her to leave. Why?

767
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,276
Because I knew that it was a trap.

768
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,205
What should we do?

769
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,498
HANSUNG

770
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:19,130
HANSUNG SEORAK RESORT

771
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,133
FIND JOY IN NATURE
HANSUNG SEORAK RESORT

772
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,518
Yes, hello.

773
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,354
This is Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

774
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,441
How long do you generally keep
the footage from your security cameras?

775
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,279
Yes, right. But don't you
back up the files

776
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,448
or keep copies for internal use?

777
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,367
Right.

778
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,286
Yes.

779
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,707
Yes, it was October 27 of last year.

780
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,460
At 2 p.m. on the tenth floor.

781
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,963
I just need the footage
from the west hallway.

782
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,465
Yes, last year.

783
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,927
Please try to find it. I will send
an official request right away.

784
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,512
Thank you.

785
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,229
-You are home.
-Yes.

786
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:18,982
Dad.

787
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,483
I am home.

788
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,193
-It is late.
-I know.

789
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,487
At this rate, my daughter will be

790
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,823
awarded for being a patient, devoted wife.

791
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,617
If that is the case, Mom should have been
awarded a long time ago.

792
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,537
Just coddle your husband.
Don't lash out at me.

793
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,289
I am hungry.

794
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,708
-Go wash your hands.
-All right.

795
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,421
You and your father talked
behind my back, didn't you? Was it fun?

796
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,216
We have other things to talk about.

797
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,771
-That man sure is something.
-Pardon me?

798
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,773
Didn't your friend tell you?

799
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,610
The actor basically came
on stage on himself.

800
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,989
Are you referring to Si-mok?

801
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,452
When I first heard about it from Woo-gyun,
I was just speechless.

802
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,497
I thought, "There will be
a lot of noise for a while."

803
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,706
But...

804
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,710
Everything just seems
to be falling into place perfectly.

805
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,923
The man who announced on TV that he'd be
sure to catch the killer was the culprit.

806
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,636
All other news or scandals will be buried
because people will be so shocked.

807
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:36,267
If Si-mok is confirmed as the culprit,
everyone will indeed be in utter shock.

808
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,645
He was at the scene when Mr. Park died,
and this time too...

809
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,271
Exactly.

810
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,816
Every time a victim is found, he is there.

811
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,361
People will think that he pushed ahead
with arresting Jin-seob

812
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,905
in order to conceal what he did.

813
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,699
-He hit the bull's-eye.
-But...

814
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,916
The way the girl's body was placed
is quite unusual.

815
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,504
That is true.

816
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,006
If the person who killed Mr. Park
also harmed the girl,

817
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,591
it is not a simple serial case.

818
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,552
He must have a goal.

819
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,470
I don't think murder itself is his goal.

820
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,473
If we make Si-mok or whoever
look like the culprit,

821
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,016
what will we do if it continues...

822
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,185
I don't care even if
there are other victims.

823
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,604
We just have to cut ourselves off
from Mr. Park.

824
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,064
All is good with no connection to him.

825
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,192
Nothing else will happen at that house.

826
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,777
Let's say something happens there.

827
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,779
What is the term "copycat crime" for?

828
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,991
We can say that somebody killed
whom they wanted to kill

829
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,118
and left the body in that house
to avoid getting caught.

830
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,830
If you let such petty worries stop you,
you can never move forward.

831
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,498
Right.

832
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,835
You are not even
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

833
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,045
You are just in the criminal division.

834
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,965
You should be quick to act at least.
When did I tell you to take care of it?

835
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,758
Have you been worrying
about that all this time?

836
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,927
I am sorry.

837
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,263
It is only a matter of time
before people find out

838
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,223
how Mr. Park actually died.

839
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,101
-Get on it.
-Yes, Father.

840
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,062
Goodness, I heated up
everything perfectly.

841
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,607
All right. Let's eat.

842
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,108
Dad.

843
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,944
He acts very quickly
once he sets his mind to do something.

844
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,426
He threatened me by saying
he would kill me and strangled me,

845
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,345
so I had no choice but to give it to him.

846
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,388
I jotted down his license plate number.

847
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,682
I never imagined this would happen.

848
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,310
That psycho is the culprit.

849
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,938
So, did you tell Min-ah about it?

850
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,608
Did you warn her, "A dangerous man
is headed to your place. Run away"?

851
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,486
Then, I would have had to tell her
about giving him her address,

852
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,404
and none of those girls would ride my car.

853
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,948
Car? What car?

854
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,201
Hello? Are you there? Hello?

855
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,830
I can't get over how much
of a douchebag he is.

856
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,999
If only he had called her,
none of this would've happened.

857
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,543
How can he risk a girl's life

858
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,419
to make sure he can continue
earning a living?

859
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,755
We got the plate number.
We must know who it is.

860
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,133
Who is it?
The psycho he was talking about.

861
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,437
Prosecutor Hwang.

862
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,233
Pardon?

863
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,695
Are we really supposed to just sit
around and do nothing about it?

864
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,614
We shouldn't be protecting him
because he is in the prosecution.

865
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,784
Chief told us to wait for now.

866
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,454
Mr. Hwang already told us
that he tried to chase her

867
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,456
from the bar to her place.

868
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,417
He was lying.

869
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,837
He told us that he only figured out
her address,

870
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,088
but it can't be true.

871
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,632
He must have met that girl that night.

872
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,802
I am convinced that is why
he took us there.

873
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,305
He must have wanted
our traces to get mixed

874
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,473
with the traces he left all over there.

875
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,933
How...

876
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,234
Ga-young Kim
Age: 20

877
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,154
Have a look.

878
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,615
I saw it at her place.

879
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,909
Her year of birth is listed as 1993
on her wireless carrier's records.

880
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,617
It was me.

881
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,744
I met up

882
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,288
with Moo-sung Park
the night before he died.

883
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,709
I did it alone.

884
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:22,720
I'm telling you,
Prosecutor Hwang and that girl

885
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,264
must know each other personally.
I am sure of it.

886
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,365
When did he have time to print
these photos?

887
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,828
He didn't take these when he went in there
with Sergeant Kim. He must have had them

888
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,038
since before the incident took place.

889
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,416
Did he sneak into her place

890
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,168
and meet Ga-young there?

891
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,338
What if this isn't a costume,

892
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,549
but her actual high school uniform?

893
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,386
Then, she must have been
a walking time bomb.

894
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,263
To some men, that is.

895
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,142
Wait, was he talking about himself?

896
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,544
STRANGER

897
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,922
Prosecutor Seo will be there soon
to investigate Kyung-wan.

898
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,467
He and Ga-young went
to the same high school.

899
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,969
I'm asking if you've forgotten
what Mr. Park used to call her.

900
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,012
Bell.

901
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,014
Do you think he rang that bell
only for me?

902
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,850
I heard that song when I called that girl.

903
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,311
The man who was in the room
at the corner in the resort...

904
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,438
-Dong-jae Seo.
-It's his ringtone.

905
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:59,609
It must've been your perfume that
I smelled from Prosecutor Dong-jae Seo.

906
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,527
Why did he meet up with you again?

907
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,072
-Let go.
-You let go first.

908
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,409
