1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,087
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,009
They must've read the comments too.

4
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,344
This is their way
of getting their revenge.

5
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,929
They got their revenge.

6
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,682
Are they anxious because of the video
the police uploaded?

7
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,142
I think there's something written here.

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,519
Did you send this to Forensics?

9
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,771
Just make the announcement.

10
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,356
Gather all the reporters
who said a cop did it…

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,486
The blood of Prosecutor Seo from
the Uijeongbu District Prosecutors' Office

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,238
was found along with his vehicle.

13
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,450
Chief Choi's gone too far.

14
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,495
The store he worked at
right after his release

15
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,705
is just 650 meters away
from the crime scene.

16
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,458
On top of that, the store is his uncle's.

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,836
It's a list of all the websites
that Prosecutor Seo accessed

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,048
from March 18 to March 26,
the day he went missing.

19
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:36,137
By any chance, did the driver die
in Geumnam-ri, Namyangju?

20
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,144
What are these articles about
the former chief who died in Namyangju?

21
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,524
EPISODE 10

22
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,901
But it wasn't mentioned
in the report I received.

23
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,612
-About him drinking?
-No, the fact that she made an objection.

24
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,782
-How did you know it was missing?
-Well, as Mr. Park's junior,

25
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,367
I went to his funeral, of course.

26
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,202
I met his wife and heard it from her.

27
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,546
Isn't it strange?

28
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,842
Why did they have to cover up
a common death from an illness?

29
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,222
Prosecutor Seo doggedly searched
articles about his death.

30
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,141
A vacation home area?

31
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,892
Bastards.

32
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,909
Yes, this is everything.
Since he died from an illness.

33
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,163
It could've been worse
since he had a heart attack while driving.

34
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,874
But, thankfully,
it didn't lead to a secondary collision.

35
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,128
Is there usually
not a lot of traffic here?

36
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,755
Yes, it's only busy
during weekends and vacation seasons.

37
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,257
Usually, it's almost empty.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,140
It looks like Prosecutor Seo
visited the scene on March 18.

39
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,017
Does anyone know why he went there?

40
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,986
And the dashcam happened
to be off that day?

41
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,905
Yes. I remember there was footage

42
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,407
up to the day before,
but nothing from that day.

43
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,410
It was a year ago, and you still
remember that? But the thing is,

44
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,663
no one followed through on it.

45
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,960
I understand he died from an illness,
but if footage from that day was missing,

46
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,004
it should've been investigated.

47
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,381
Why did Prosecutor Seo
close the case like this?

48
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,802
Well…

49
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,846
You said you spent
your probation years here.

50
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,932
-Yes.
-You worked on this case, didn't you?

51
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,520
Prosecutor Seo said
I should start with simple cases.

52
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,481
So yes, I took care of the case.

53
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,568
The deceased suffered
from a cardiovascular disease,

54
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,320
and he'd even had a stent put in.

55
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,447
Correct. The cause of death
was clear, so--

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,617
Even with a clear cause of death,
shouldn't the prosecutor in charge

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,161
still know where the driver had been
before his death?

58
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,664
It's even missing the routes
taken by the vehicle.

59
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,832
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,464
He was busy. He only signed the report
because he trusted me.

61
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,174
It wasn't because he was slacking.

62
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,011
This is about you.
Why are you protecting him?

63
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,930
Pardon?

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,892
I just didn't want him
to get in trouble because of me.

65
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,478
Because the driver was
a former chief prosecutor,

66
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,981
it made news shortly at the time.

67
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,401
Other than that,
there was nothing special about this case.

68
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,361
I had totally forgotten about it too.

69
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,531
Prosecutor Seo asked me to dig up
the case report a while back,

70
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,659
and it was only then
that I remembered about this case.

71
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,412
He asked for this case report?

72
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,917
But initially, he let it go even though
it was missing a lot of information.

73
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,585
Why did he ask for it again?

74
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,192
You had that file?

75
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,237
Are there other files?

76
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,906
When Prosecutor Seo asked for this,

77
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,660
he asked for three files in total,
so I photocopied them at the same time.

78
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,079
Including the file on
the chief of Dongducheon Station.

79
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,748
The chief of Dongducheon Station?

80
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,750
The chief of Dongducheon Police Station

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,793
beat up a conscripted officer once.

82
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,421
I know. So when did you give
the files to Prosecutor Seo?

83
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,590
I think…

84
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,300
Was it March 14?

85
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,178
Right?

86
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,388
When I came back with the case report,

87
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,224
I found out that you had eaten
my White Day candies.

88
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,477
Well…

89
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:57,482
When you called and asked us
to look for Mr. Park's case report,

90
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,984
we remembered
putting the files together a while back.

91
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,652
So we looked,

92
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,322
and we only found this one
on Prosecutor Seo's desk.

93
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,867
There are three in total.
One's been here all along,

94
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,994
and Prosecutor Hwang had the second one.

95
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,121
Then where's the one
on the chief of Dongducheon?

96
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,209
Why didn't you tell me?

97
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,378
I stopped by
right after Prosecutor Seo went missing

98
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,131
and asked you to let me know
if there was anything unusual.

99
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,676
He asked you for the reports on the cases
that were closed a long time ago.

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,178
Why didn't you tell me then?

101
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,598
I forgot.

102
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,726
But you remember your candies?

103
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,819
Please excuse me for a moment.

104
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,574
I need the contact number
for Park Gwang-su's family.

105
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,577
Sure, it's… Just a moment, please.

106
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,881
NAMYANGJU STATION
TRAFFIC INVESTIGATION CAPTAIN

107
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,138
NAMYANGJU POLICE STATION
BULLETIN BOARD

108
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,556
TRAFFIC DIVISION

109
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,104
This is the Traffic Investigation Team.

110
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,940
Yes.

111
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,985
Right.

112
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,655
I see.

113
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,412
GOOD HEART LUNCH BOXES

114
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,383
That's the Dongducheon chief's sister.

115
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,634
Kim Su-hang's aunt.

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,348
-Hello.
-Hello, welcome!

117
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,101
We'll get two fritter sets to go.

118
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,144
Sure.

119
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,448
My, it smells delicious.

120
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,867
Doesn't it? We never reuse the oil.

121
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,035
I see.

122
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,747
Don't the neighbors complain
about the smell though?

123
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,957
I heard people fight about that
these days.

124
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,211
The area's sealed off,
so the smell doesn't spread.

125
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,130
It's the same building, but we don't even
share the entrances.

126
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,091
I see, so they're all separated.

127
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,094
-Can I use the washroom?
-Sure.

128
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,141
Here you go.
You can go out through that door.

129
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,559
Okay.

130
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,270
Thank you.

131
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,357
It's at the very end.
Look for the washroom sign.

132
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,274
Got it.

133
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,744
WASHROOM

134
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,500
Where would kidnappers in Korea store…

135
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,627
I mean, keep their victims?

136
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,214
Where would they keep their victims

137
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,591
in a densely populated country like Korea?

138
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,472
So the entire family could lock him up
in their house as revenge.

139
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,977
It does seem like a detached house.

140
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,864
Hello? Is anybody inside?

141
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,751
What?

142
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,337
My gosh.

143
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,423
You took the wrong one!

144
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,216
Oh, it's okay!

145
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,803
No!

146
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,181
My gosh.

147
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,771
Jeez.

148
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,940
Gosh, this is…

149
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,069
What the…

150
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,363
My goodness.

151
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,033
Gosh, what do I do?

152
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,093
-Gosh!
-Damn it!

153
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,594
Oh, no…

154
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,390
Gosh! My goodness.

155
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,065
We don't normally do that.

156
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,858
But our fridge broke down today.

157
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,944
Someone will be here
from the borough office.

158
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,488
Jeez, I can't believe this.

159
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,366
Things happen when you run a business.

160
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,368
Don't act like you never do
anything dirty.

161
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,164
You're making a mistake. Just wait
and see. You'll regret this very soon.

162
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,626
Why? Is someone in your family
a police chief or something?

163
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,587
Right. You should learn to take a hint

164
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,465
and realize that someone has my back.

165
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,927
I guess you're new to the area.

166
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,804
Jeez.

167
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,848
A rat!

168
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,936
What the hell? Gosh.

169
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,568
Hey, it's me.

170
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,611
Was that worth it?

171
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,240
I wish I hadn't seen that.

172
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,076
I know. Gosh, it was so gross.

173
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,872
The lady at the dumpling place
is much older than her,

174
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,040
but she's so clean and organized.

175
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,501
People like her
give all restaurant owners a bad rap.

176
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,003
Gosh, that was disgusting.

177
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,380
You must be satisfied.

178
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,101
I heard over 10,000 people go missing
each year.

179
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,523
That's 30 a day.
All those people never come back.

180
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,192
Right.

181
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,654
If I never knew him,
he'd just be one of those people.

182
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,240
I could just look for him
with that mindset.

183
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,533
Who? Seo Dong-jae?

184
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,329
It would have been better
if I never knew him.

185
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,123
I first saw him when he went nuts
at Han River.

186
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,584
I saw him at the construction site too.

187
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,668
The construction site?

188
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,754
Oh.

189
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,758
You're right. He was there too.

190
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,052
I feel bad for his kids.

191
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,847
His kids and mine
are exactly ten years apart.

192
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,892
He's a father too, you know.

193
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,519
He must miss his kids so much.

194
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,688
How can we really find nothing?

195
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,067
Something usually comes up
when we investigate the surroundings.

196
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,444
It's one or two out of ten people
who are never found.

197
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,281
As for the rest, the police find them
and send them home at all costs.

198
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,952
Also, seeing how so many people hate him,

199
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,330
I'm sure he'll live until
he goes senile and has to wear diapers.

200
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,667
That's right.
He'd better not die before we find him.

201
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,210
-That's right.
-Yes.

202
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,264
Goodbye.

203
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,686
Prosecutor Hwang.

204
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,230
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,524
I looked into the things
you pointed out earlier,

206
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,110
but we can no longer obtain them
as it was too long ago.

207
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,947
I mean the routes taken and his dashcam.

208
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,659
The call records have also been discarded
because the retention period expired.

209
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,787
I'm sorry.
I should've secured them back then.

210
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,330
So you contacted the police?

211
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,999
Who's in charge?

212
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,877
It was the Security and Traffic Division
at Namyangju Station,

213
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,129
but the Traffic Investigation captain
took over.

214
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,046
I see.

215
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,967
Okay, thank you.

216
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,763
I thought about anything else
I could have missed.

217
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:54,351
I remember Prosecutor Seo
strongly empathizing with Mr. Park's case.

218
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,145
Did they know each other before that?

219
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,105
No, I think he felt that…

220
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,706
Mr. Park

221
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,500
served as a chief prosecutor

222
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,419
and even worked at a major law firm.

223
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,257
But even someone like him
was so severely stressed

224
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,885
that he died of a heart attack
on the road.

225
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,473
I guess that's why he started drinking.

226
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,476
You see,

227
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,729
I'm supposed to be promoted next year.

228
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,399
If I don't become a chief here,
I'll be useless out there.

229
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,860
The thing is,

230
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,822
I've even been investigated
by a junior prosecutor.

231
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,116
I'm sure you've heard about it.

232
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,535
I even heard
that someone said I'd learn nothing,

233
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,829
upon finding out I'd been assigned
to his team.

234
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,625
My friend in another office told me,
pretending to be comforting me.

235
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,421
Sighing won't solve any of my problems.

236
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,050
I should figure out a way to survive
before everything collapses.

237
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,679
I'm telling you this
after missing all the important stuff.

238
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,308
But do you think there's a connection
between Mr. Park and his disappearance?

239
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,185
I'm not sure.

240
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,605
Just like Sergeant Song's death,
which seemed like a suicide at first,

241
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:26,026
do you think Mr. Park's death
could have led to Mr. Seo's disappearance?

242
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,486
I don't know.

243
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,365
I'm sorry.
I thought you might have a lead.

244
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,866
It's been five days already.

245
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,703
-Prosecutor Jung Min-ha.
-Yes.

246
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,330
Most prosecutors are reluctant
to contact the police

247
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,166
even when we missed something
if a lot of time has passed

248
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,169
because we'll have to expose our mistakes.

249
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,964
You'll be dealing with them
for your future cases

250
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,800
and lead their investigations.

251
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,178
Yes, I thought it was
more of a collaborative relationship.

252
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,806
Okay.

253
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,933
Keep up the good work.

254
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,936
See you.

255
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,774
Yes, sir.

256
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,194
No, I'm still in Uijeongbu.
I want to ask you something.

257
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,865
When Prosecutor Seo came by
the Supreme Office to see you…

258
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,075
What other case?

259
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,077
I was just wondering if he gave you a file

260
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,413
on anything else
other than Segok Police Station.

261
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,542
Did he mention any other cases
besides the Segok Station case?

262
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,336
No, just the Segok Police Station case.
Nothing else.

263
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,382
I see. I'll update you on everything
when I return to the office.

264
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,770
Do you think he transferred to the
patrol division because of his depression?

265
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,647
From what I've found out,

266
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,732
he used to be a police detective.

267
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,984
But he was suddenly transferred there.

268
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,611
Transfers like this hardly happen.

269
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,323
Didn't Chief Woo tell you?

270
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,117
I made a separate report

271
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,619
on why that decision was made
and submitted it to him.

272
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,579
No, he didn't tell me.

273
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,003
I guess he really liked that story.

274
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,089
I submitted two reports

275
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,841
but he didn't even read one of them.

276
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,684
No, just the Segok Police Station case.
Nothing else.

277
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,761
NAMYANGJU POLICE STATION
BULLETIN BOARD

278
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,932
TRAFFIC DIVISION

279
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,019
Wouldn't he have pulled over to the curb

280
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,271
if he stopped the car
due to the pain in his heart?

281
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,148
Like this.

282
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,942
In this photo,

283
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,653
the wheels are parallel to the centerline.

284
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,572
He didn't turn the car at all.

285
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,325
He wasn't even thinking of pulling over.

286
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,077
He just hit the brakes
while he was driving.

287
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,372
Maybe the pain came all of a sudden.

288
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,624
He must have not had the time
to make a turn.

289
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,501
Then he would've slammed on the brakes.

290
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,378
There was hardly any traffic,

291
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,922
so he must have been
at 60 or 70km per hour at the least.

292
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,049
Have a look at this.

293
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,057
You get marks like this
even at 60km per hour.

294
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,602
Do you think this was just an accident?

295
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:38,690
Oh, this. I think the deceased
called 911 himself.

296
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,526
Just a second.

297
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,448
Here it is.

298
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,201
In the recording of the call,

299
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,245
you hear that he couldn't talk
even though he called 911 himself,

300
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,748
which means he fainted
while calling for help.

301
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,543
But he was still able to make the call,
so the car probably didn't stop abruptly.

302
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,380
Right, because he must've been conscious
when he hit the brakes.

303
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,800
Exactly. And he'd had a few drinks.

304
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,344
He had chest pains
on top of feeling tipsy…

305
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,221
It's possible he was in no condition

306
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,306
to even think that he needed to pull over.

307
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,768
Right, perhaps.

308
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,646
Many people have heart attacks
while driving.

309
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,398
He even had surgery
because of his condition.

310
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,068
To us, nothing seemed
suspicious at that time.

311
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,700
And his navigation system?

312
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,369
What about it?

313
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,084
Do you think he'd taken this road often?

314
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,045
That I don't know.

315
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,216
There was no destination
entered in the navigation system.

316
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,885
Right.

317
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,856
Yes, there's no destination
because he didn't enter any.

318
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,068
He lived and worked in Seoul.

319
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,280
How could he know this route
on the outskirts of Namyangju

320
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,948
that he didn't use navigation?

321
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:15,912
You know, I often use my phone instead of
the navigation system in my car.

322
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,290
If he used his phone often
for navigation purposes,

323
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,167
we'd find a phone holder in his car.

324
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,585
The phone holder should be…

325
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,171
You're right.

326
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,716
Some people rest their phones
on the front window.

327
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,344
And it's also possible that he knew
his way around and didn't need navigation.

328
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,890
Well, I suppose that is possible.

329
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,021
You must know Prosecutor Seo.

330
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,066
Yes, I met him once.

331
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:51,406
He spoke with you on the phone
on March 18.

332
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,616
What did he say?

333
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,367
To me?

334
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,913
Hold on, March 18…

335
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,708
There was a big collision
the previous day.

336
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,168
We probably talked about that.

337
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,794
Why do you ask?

338
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,381
What did he say about
Park Gwang-su's death on this day?

339
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,092
About that case…

340
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,678
It didn't even come up.

341
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,724
But on March 18,

342
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,352
Prosecutor Seo visited the scene
where Mr. Park was found

343
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,979
right after he spoke with you
according to the records.

344
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,065
But he said nothing about it?

345
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,318
If it came up, I'd definitely remember.

346
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,489
Could Prosecutor Seo's disappearance

347
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,951
have anything to do
with this case from a year ago?

348
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,748
I'm not sure
whether there is a connection or not.

349
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,761
His blood-alcohol level was less than
what you'd get from a shot of soju.

350
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,639
If he was sober enough to call 911,

351
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,142
why did he stop in the middle of
a one-lane road without his hazard lights?

352
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,188
All kinds of accidents happen on the road.
Even a deer jumps into your car.

353
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,048
MARCH 17, COLLISION IN NAMYANGJU

354
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,468
2 PEOPLE INJURED AFTER 3-VEHICLE COLLISION
IN FRONT OF NAMYANGJU CITY HALL

355
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,556
8 PEOPLE INJURED IN COLLISION IN NAMYANGJU

356
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,080
Him visiting Namyangju Station
isn't a good sign,

357
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,874
but his questions sound even worse.

358
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,168
I wonder how much he knows.

359
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,880
The detective you're talking about now.
The captain Si-mok met with today.

360
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,214
Isn't he the one?

361
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,760
The one who told Seo Dong-jae
that you gave the orders

362
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,386
to close Mr. Park's case quickly?

363
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,599
That was only a mistake.
I'm not even worried about that today.

364
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,726
The navigation,
the direction of the tires…

365
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,686
He was too busy answering his questions.

366
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,565
Prosecutor Seo might have been better.

367
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,612
I'll remove Prosecutor Hwang
from the investigation.

368
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,113
I shouldn't let him go further.

369
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,865
That would be even more suspicious.

370
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,825
I don't care if it looks suspicious.

371
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,869
He's out if I tell him he's out.

372
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,623
-Oh, sorry.
-What is it?

373
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,501
Someone is here
from Uijeongbu's administration division

374
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,544
regarding the overtime hours.

375
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,088
-All right.
-Okay.

376
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,598
I think I'll be able to remove them
from this case.

377
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,975
I'll call you back.

378
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,668
I have a guest inside, so…

379
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,254
I see. This is fine.

380
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,841
How can I help you?

381
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,178
I'd like to ask you a few things
about your late husband.

382
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,557
Okay, go ahead.

383
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,102
It's about the disappearance case
at the Uijeongbu office.

384
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,520
Oh, I see.

385
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:54,983
Wait, who disappeared?

386
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,488
Do you know why
your late husband was in Namyangju

387
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,907
the day he passed away?

388
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,037
No, I don't.

389
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,417
How long had he been suffering
from myocardial infarction?

390
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,544
For quite a while.

391
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,629
Did he drink often?

392
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,757
He just drank

393
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,301
as much as others.

394
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,221
Did he visit Namyangju often?

395
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,347
No.

396
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,310
He didn't know anyone there.
He didn't know the area at all.

397
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,022
What kind of work did he do
at the law firm?

398
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:40,195
I don't really know.
He rarely talked about work at home.

399
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,115
Did you hear the news
about Prosecutor Seo?

400
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,034
Yes, of course.

401
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,997
How's the investigation going?
Any progress?

402
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,542
I hope he's okay.

403
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,421
I guess you know him well.

404
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,841
No, I just met him once.

405
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,430
Did he visit you after
your late husband's death?

406
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,767
He didn't visit me.
We met at my husband's funeral

407
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,269
when he came to pay his respects.

408
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,898
I'm sure many prosecutors
visited the funeral.

409
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,817
How do you remember him?

410
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,196
He told me he was in charge of the case.

411
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,782
That's how I remember him.

412
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,080
You two must have had a lot to talk about

413
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,707
since he was in charge.

414
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,670
Things were hectic,
and I had a lot of guests.

415
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,716
I guess I was too busy back then.

416
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,802
I don't remember much.

417
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,932
Did your late husband usually
not use a GPS

418
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,851
when he drove?

419
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,435
Pardon?

420
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,104
A GPS device.

421
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,106
A GPS device?

422
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,818
Are you using that car by any chance?

423
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,153
The car he died in?

424
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,740
I sold it, of course.

425
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,996
Was he stressed out
from the work he did at the law firm?

426
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,547
More than when he was at the prosecution.

427
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,717
And the law firm was pretty big.

428
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,344
He was a former chief prosecutor,

429
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,139
so was given a high position,
like a partner.

430
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,855
Why don't you visit the law firm?

431
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,026
His old secretary still works there.

432
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,235
I'm sure

433
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,447
she has more to tell you about it.

434
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,164
PROSECUTOR
HWANG SI-MOK

435
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,005
I believe Mr. Park's case was closed
a long time ago.

436
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,673
Yes, you're right.

437
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,301
What would you like to know?

438
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,555
Did Mr. Park usually
drive his car himself,

439
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,058
or did he have a chauffeur?

440
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,602
He didn't have a personal chauffeur,

441
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,438
but he would request a chauffeur
when he needed one.

442
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,066
-So he mostly drove himself.
-Yes.

443
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,902
Why did he go to Namyangju
on the day he died?

444
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,737
I don't know.

445
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,822
You weren't aware of his schedule?

446
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,160
Well, he took a day off that day.

447
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,705
I took the day off too since he did,

448
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,750
and I was startled to hear
that he passed away.

449
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,294
His wife didn't mention that though.

450
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,424
I'm positive he took the day off.

451
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:52,053
It was his first time taking a day off
since joining the law firm

452
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,388
so I remember it clearly.

453
00:32:55,223 --> 00:33:00,520
Did you know that his dashcam was
turned off only on the day of his death?

454
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,065
I think the police
might have told me then.

455
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,319
It's unusual, but lawyers sometimes
do that when requested by their clients.

456
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,864
Clients ask lawyers to turn off
their dashcams?

457
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,451
It's not because
they don't trust the lawyers.

458
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,413
When they meet in person,

459
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,749
there's a chance that they could be
recorded in the dashcam footage.

460
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:25,878
Some clients don't want
to be filmed in any way.

461
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,219
How did the law firm react
to Mr. Park's death?

462
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,558
Everyone was sad, of course.

463
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,398
So Mr. Park was planning
on meeting a client

464
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,819
who requested that he turn off his dashcam

465
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,196
on the day he died.

466
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,283
He must have been on his way back
since he had alcohol in his body.

467
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,661
If that client was
one of the law firm's clients,

468
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:03,041
would he have needed to take the day off
just to meet him?

469
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:08,296
That's also why you asked to meet me
outside the office, isn't it?

470
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,010
Ms. Kim.

471
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,474
I guess it could have been a VIP.

472
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,018
There were rumors about his client.

473
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,395
You mean the person
Mr. Park met in Namyangju?

474
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,855
What makes you think that?

475
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,609
Mr. Park never drank any alcohol.

476
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,279
He refused even when the CEO of our firm
offered him a drink.

477
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,785
So we were puzzled when we heard
that alcohol was found in his blood.

478
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,413
And even your CEO doesn't know
who he met that day?

479
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,336
So he was working for a law firm

480
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,506
but secretly met with a personal client.

481
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,594
Was he stealing one of the firm's clients?

482
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,763
I'm not sure.

483
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,682
I heard about it after his death,

484
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,728
but it seems Mr. Park
had been financially troubled.

485
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,980
I think his brother's business failed.

486
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,448
Are you reinvestigating the case?
Why is the Supreme Prosecutors' Office…

487
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,871
Do you think we should?

488
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,094
A meeting with a client…

489
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,929
His first-ever day off…

490
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,228
There's only a small chance that
he knew the route well.

491
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,647
Why did he drive in the dark
without the GPS?

492
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,904
He just drank as much as others.

493
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,448
Mr. Park never drank any alcohol.

494
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,965
Things may seem strange
due to a preconception.

495
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,427
I might be trying too hard
to link the case to Prosecutor Seo.

496
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,847
It might be that I'm holding
on to useless pieces.

497
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,853
He could've stopped calmly
even if he suddenly felt pain.

498
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,483
And he could've driven without a GPS

499
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,611
on a secluded highway at night.

500
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,700
Is this all just a coincidence?

501
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:47,038
Plus, the chief of the station in charge
of the case back then was Choi Bit.

502
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,707
Out of more than 200 chiefs in Korea.

503
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,587
What are the odds of such
coincidences occurring in a row?

504
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,423
Everyone says
that it was an ordinary death.

505
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,508
Was that really ordinary?

506
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,762
But the most important thing is…

507
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,013
VICTIM: SEO DONG-JAE

508
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,766
…that this could have nothing to do
with his disappearance.

509
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,102
It's been five days already.

510
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,813
I could be wasting my time
on useless details.

511
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:17,985
What if I'm delaying his rescue
by investigating ineffectively?

512
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,448
You really are his star player,
aren't you?

513
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,076
You should put in a word for me
with Chief Woo.

514
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,661
Yes, Chief.

515
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,621
Yes.

516
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,677
-Did he come back?
-Yes, just a minute ago.

517
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,429
Maybe he's in the bathroom.

518
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,485
-Oh, you're back.
-Yes, sir.

519
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,778
How was it?

520
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,323
I couldn't find anything related
to the missing case.

521
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,244
Didn't you rush out
because it seemed related?

522
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,829
Well, Prosecutor Seo…

523
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,920
There was a lawyer named Park Gwang-su

524
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,589
who was formerly the chief prosecutor
in Daejeon.

525
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,926
I found records of Prosecutor Seo
searching articles on his death.

526
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,722
So I went to check if he was
investigating the case personally

527
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,182
like he did with the Segok station case.

528
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,184
But he wasn't?

529
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,188
I couldn't find any reason
to focus on it right now.

530
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,943
Did someone say Prosecutor Seo
might be locked up in a vacation home?

531
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:42,945
A vacation home?

532
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,032
You said something about a
vacation home area. It's not about that?

533
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,453
Oh, they put a tail
on one of the Segok Station officers,

534
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,414
but they're on patrol,
so it's hard to specify a location.

535
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,833
They patrol from vacation home areas
to the market.

536
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,795
I thought you had something. Darn it.

537
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,591
Were your skills overestimated,
or have you lost your touch?

538
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,302
I thought you found a clue.

539
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:10,056
I'm starting to think I should've chosen
someone else, as Sa-hyun said.

540
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,182
I'm sorry, sir.

541
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:16,020
Never mind. You should be focusing
on something else anyway.

542
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,901
The most important thing
is finding out if Prosecutor Seo

543
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,444
was really kidnapped by a cop.

544
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,573
If the culprit has nothing to do
with the police,

545
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:31,744
then it's just a normal criminal case.
There's no reason for us to get involved.

546
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,538
So keep investigating
the Segok Station officers.

547
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:35,998
Yes, sir.

548
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,086
The late… What was his name?
The one who used to be a Chief Prosecutor?

549
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,213
Lawyer Park Gwang-su.

550
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,800
I'll look into that myself.
It will be much faster.

551
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,804
Should I ask about him
to the Daejeon office?

552
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,055
What should I ask them?

553
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,808
It's been over two years
since he left the Daejeon office.

554
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,644
Then I won't get much from there.
What about his family?

555
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,729
I met his wife.

556
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,774
Already? What did she say?

557
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,983
She doesn't know much.

558
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,579
What are you waiting for?

559
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,228
MOTHER:
ARE YOU BACK IN SEOUL?

560
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,066
YES

561
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,073
DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE ME HEAR THAT
ON THE NEWS FIRST?

562
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,458
I'M SORRY

563
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,671
COME HOME WHEN YOU HAVE TIME

564
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:17,016
I WILL

565
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,162
CHOI BIT

566
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,347
You said you'd look into
the Park Gwang-su case, so…

567
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,893
Prosecutor Seo organized these files.
This is for the Segok Station case.

568
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,605
I know. I gave you that one.

569
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,942
-He told you other things too, right?
-What do you mean?

570
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,111
Didn't Prosecutor Seo mention other things

571
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,531
beside the Segok Station case
when he first met you?

572
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,493
What did I tell you on the phone?

573
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,370
You said he didn't.

574
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,956
Then why are you asking me the same thing?

575
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,000
You said a story about police officers

576
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,087
killing their colleague could be helpful
for us right now,

577
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,173
so I don't think you would've
been upset over the Segok case.

578
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,929
-Was I upset?
-Yes.

579
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,681
Do you think this is a casino?

580
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,601
You yelled at Prosecutor Seo and asked
if he thought he was at a casino.

581
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,359
I'm sorry. I guess I was mistaken.

582
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,199
Where did I put it?

583
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,662
Let's see…

584
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,968
Right. This file.

585
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,803
What is this?

586
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,723
You already know what it is.

587
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,393
It's about the former Dongducheon Station
chief who sent Sergeant Song to Segok.

588
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,606
I see. So that was related, too.

589
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,400
He said something about a chief
abusing authority,

590
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,694
so I forgot about it
because it was so trivial.

591
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,448
Why didn't he give me this file though?

592
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,951
They look like triplets, but he only
gave me two. Or is there more?

593
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,580
Maybe he didn't think the report
on Mr. Park had enough impact

594
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,706
to gain your attention.

595
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,793
If he didn't think
it was good enough to give me…

596
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,962
What did you say before?

597
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,673
You said he was looking
into these cases personally.

598
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,716
I doubt he did much

599
00:43:55,799 --> 00:44:00,804
since his only concern was to catch
my attention, and not to solve any cases.

600
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,765
Right.

601
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,892
You're right.

602
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,977
This won't help you find Prosecutor Seo.

603
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,031
Aren't you going?

604
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,532
Where?

605
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,951
I guess you're not in a hurry.

606
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,917
What's with him?

607
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,933
Who are you?

608
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,101
Come in.

609
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,524
She's hitting it off with the Chief.

610
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,235
Right. And we're the ones
doing all the work.

611
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,497
Long time no see, Chief Choi.

612
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,211
CHOI BIT

613
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,718
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE REFORMATION UNIT
CHIEF CHOI BIT

614
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,211
You know why we called you here, right?

615
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,298
I didn't come because you called.

616
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,300
I came to say what I needed to say.

617
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,012
I was told

618
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,890
that you're faking your overtime
to earn more wages.

619
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,312
Just because you're at HQ,

620
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:59,566
it doesn't mean you can coax
my subordinates to dig up dirt on me.

621
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,152
I thought the Intelligence Bureau
would have had

622
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,655
better things to do.

623
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,955
Do you agree to a voice recording?

624
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,998
Is there any use refusing?

625
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,010
Where were you on March 26,

626
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,346
between 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.?

627
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,889
Don't you have any brain cells?

628
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,140
How dare you say that!

629
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,435
Sit back down!

630
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,834
This was taken at the entrance
of Uijeongbu Station

631
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,669
on March 26 at 7:18 p.m.

632
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,301
And this was taken the same day
at 10:32 p.m.

633
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,640
You know,

634
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,352
our work involves more than
just sitting at a desk all day.

635
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,731
I can do overtime work away from my desk!

636
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,028
How far is it between
Uijeongbu Station and the scene?

637
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,364
Even with traffic, it'd take
about two hours to make a round trip.

638
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,576
Three hours would be enough
to conceal the crime.

639
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,578
-"Conceal the crime"?
-Also,

640
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,080
it's highly likely that he already knew
there weren't any security cameras

641
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,583
from the entrance of the alley
to the scene of the crime.

642
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,376
How would I know that?

643
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:46,214
I heard you made a phone call to
Yongsan Station yourself early this year.

644
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,300
An investigator remembered you calling

645
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,761
and complaining about
how incompetent they were

646
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,763
because of frequent thefts in the area.

647
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,599
The neighborhood where your sister
sells packed meals.

648
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,933
Using your status,

649
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,978
you could cover-up
the terrible hygiene of the store.

650
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,939
Couldn't you do anything about
the lack of security cameras too?

651
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,109
-Now you're bringing up hygiene too?
-We have

652
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,861
witness statements and videos

653
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:12,491
from the Uijeongbu Station
that prove you faked your overtime work

654
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,702
on the evening of March 26.

655
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,538
That means you've given a false alibi
for the day

656
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,334
that Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae from
the Uijeongbu District Prosecutors' Office

657
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,543
went missing.

658
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,176
I met that prosecutor once a few days
before he went missing.

659
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:36,098
He mentioned Sergeant Song's case,
so I didn't even talk to him after that.

660
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,016
He was talking nonsense,

661
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,143
so I did curse him out at the time,

662
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,105
but do you think I'd really kill someone
to protect my nephew?

663
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,191
Maybe you were protecting him,
or maybe you lost your temper

664
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,110
after talking to the prosecutor.

665
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,238
Why don't you bring Su-hang here then?

666
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,948
You're barking up the wrong tree!

667
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,535
I was thinking of meeting
your nephew anyway.

668
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,954
You gave your permission,
so I should hurry.

669
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,082
What is it?

670
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,077
I'M FINALLY MUSTERING UP MY COURAGE
I WAS AT THE SCENE

671
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,917
-Oh, gosh!
-Are you okay?

672
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,419
-What's the hurry?
-A warrant.

673
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,504
-We have a witness.
-What witness?

674
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,761
-A witness who saw Seo Dong-jae?
-Yes.

675
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,642
"I'm finally mustering up my courage.

676
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,729
I was at the scene that day."

677
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,610
Oh, my gosh.

678
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,322
It was around 10 p.m. on the 26th.

679
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,617
I saw someone putting something
in the trunk of a car.

680
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,040
I spotted a person's legs.

681
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,879
I think it was a man.

682
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,102
I saw his face.

683
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,940
He saw the culprit's face.

684
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,740
Detective Jang,
go to the video platform company

685
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,325
and ask for their cooperation.

686
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,868
-Okay.
-Sun-chang and Detective Seo.

687
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,162
Get the warrant from the Supreme
Prosecutors' Office and join him.

688
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,372
Okay.

689
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,336
Thank you.

690
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,426
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,908
Do we have it?

HONGIK INGAN PC CAFE

694
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,402
Right there.

698
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,396
Did they bring a warrant?

699
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,314
Yes.

700
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,236
MEMBER INFORMATION

701
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,113

RESIDENT REGISTRATION NUMBER

704
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,373
-What's his deal?
-What is it?

705
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,250
He went in and out of jail
for gambling and scamming.

706
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,753
-He has a criminal record?
-Yes.

707
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,922
He might run if we approach him.

708
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,133
All right.

709
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,678
No wonder that comment seemed a bit fishy.

710
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,055
How should we approach him then?

00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,402
-Me? I don't know what to do.
-Just do it!

713
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,363
Hello?

714
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,032
Hello. I'm delivering a package.

715
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,617
Are you home, Mr. Jeon Gi-hyeok?

716
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,203
No, I'm outside. What kind of package?

717
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:54,457
Oh, it's from your credit card company.
You have to receive it in person.

718
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,375
What card?

719
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,420
It's not a card.
It's from the card company.

720
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,296
I can't receive it right now.

721
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,008
I have to make sure you get it in person.

722
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,260
What time will you get home?

723
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,721
I'll just receive the package next time.

724
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,557
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

725
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,061
Since he's not home right now,
let's go and wait for him there.

726
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,859
Did you meet the witness?

727
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,363
They didn't find anything
so I'm at the Forensic Service.

728
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,283
Okay. All right.

729
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,163
What?

730
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,707
It's a watch.

731
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,462
They weren't letters.

732
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,214
I was getting my hopes up.

733
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,010
Well, it's not common for
letters to be written on a wall.

734
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,344
I guess not.

735
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,557
But, wait. What's this?

736
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,810
Is that a person?

737
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,067
I think it's a pattern on the watch.

738
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,861
Hang on.

739
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,575
Are they flowers?

740
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,245
Yesterday afternoon,

741
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,080
our investigation team received a photo

742
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,916
that is believed to have been
sent by the culprit.

743
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:04,546
The initial suspect was proven
not to have any motives…

744
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,589
It's urgent. You know why.

745
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,601
NEW MESSAGE
HAN YEO-JIN

746
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,313
What we saw in the photo is not
a ceiling light.

747
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,065
It's a watch.

748
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,618
A police…

749
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,375
watch.

750
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,670
They're heading to the witness' house.

751
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,590
But he has a long list
of criminal records.

752
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,842
What's his resident registration number?

753
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,303
It's 9203…

754
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,057
Hello? Senior Inspector?

755
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,394
Ms. Han.

756
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,646
Let's talk later.

757
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,902
IT'S A WATCH.
A POLICE WATCH.

758
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,197
CAPTAIN CHOI

759
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,703
What do you mean?

760
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,888
I'm going to the National Police Agency.

761
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,981
Are you kidding me?

762
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,657
I'm sorry, sir.

763
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,868
Bring those Segok Station jerks.

764
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,245
Summon them right now!

765
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,899
Where did you hide the prosecutor?

766
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,109
Among the four suspects,

767
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,570
one has no alibi.
That means he's the culprit.

768
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,446
You should be ashamed of yourself!

769
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,241
One of our detectives went to get him.

770
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,868
You made the witness report, right?
It's Yongsan Station.

771
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,870
Please just tell me where he is.

772
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,998
We'll verify this.

773
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,749
The witness is here.

774
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,252
Is he here? Who is it?

775
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,796
You saw him at a gambling house, right?

776
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,174
-I can see you.
-He said he saw the car leaving.

777
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,634
Prepare a resignation letter.

778
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,096
There's something more
I need to know, right?

779
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:05,810
