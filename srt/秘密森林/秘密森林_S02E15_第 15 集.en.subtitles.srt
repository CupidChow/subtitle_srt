1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,087
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,718
"I'm finally mustering up my courage.

4
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,970
I was at the scene that day."

5
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,807
I saw someone putting something
in the trunk of a car.

6
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,434
Who is it?

7
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,228
He came here knowing
that the suspect is a cop.

8
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,980
So he knew who to pick.

9
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,317
You weren't here on the 26th, were you?

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,611
-You didn't see anything, did you?
-Why would you go this far?

11
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,071
What do you mean why?

12
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,405
Here they come!

13
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,492
Why did they cut out a piece of his tie?

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,286
You have connections
with the prosecution, right?

15
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,248
EPISODE 15

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,625
Get that witness right now.

17
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,253
A fake letter and a fake witness report…

18
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,465
They were there for a reason.
This isn't a coincidence.

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,513
This was tied around his wrists.

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,851
-So he's alive.
-Yes.

21
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,106
-Are you going somewhere?
-I'm going home.

22
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,587
I didn't know a place like this existed.
It's cozy.

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,341
Yes, it is nice. Let's talk business.

24
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,886
It took us a year to arrange
the same meeting again,

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,764
and we lost the first trial
during that time.

26
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,935
What are you going to do
about the second trial?

27
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,606
Why are you asking me about Hanjo's trial?

28
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,692
Because you're with us now.

29
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,986
-Am I?
-Yes.

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,445
How much do you want?

31
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,578
Is this making you uneasy?

32
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,997
But I talk about money all the time.
I'm good at it.

33
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,709
Your wife's family is loaded,
so it won't be easy to please you.

34
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,502
How much?

35
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,966
I make enough money.
I do pretty well for myself.

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,219
How admirable.

37
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,515
We've wasted a lot of time.

38
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,147
The plan we had devised back then
completely fell through.

39
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,064
"Back then"?

40
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,529
A year ago, when Mr. Park told me
that he'd be working for Hanjo.

41
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,951
What he told me was that Hanjo had reached
out to him to ask him a favor.

42
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,663
I thought to myself that
they had probably ordered him

43
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,206
to take care of something,

44
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,668
but I didn't point that out
when he told me about it.

45
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,171
Then what did you point out instead?

46
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,717
I told him, "No one will listen to you
when there's nothing in it for them.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,052
Except for me, I guess.

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,139
Childhood friends stay close
through the highs and lows

49
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,975
because they've seen
the worst and the best of each other.

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,727
Do you know why people go drinking

51
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,480
and go to the sauna together?

52
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,360
So that you won't be able to act
high and mighty after you've done that."

53
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,402
So you're saying…

54
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,656
Gathering those people there

55
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,283
was your idea?

56
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,620
Correct, it was me. I organized it.

57
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,831
And not just that day.
I was trying to map out a plan

58
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,127
for who else to invite and how many
more meetings would be needed.

59
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,173
Long before you started talking
about money to my face.

60
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,259
But why?

61
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,846
I want to get into politics.

62
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,849
Politics?

63
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,231
Last year, when the debate
over investigative authority resurfaced,

64
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,985
I wondered who'd be put in charge
of that difficult task.

65
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,695
Then I heard it'd be me.

66
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,949
The prosecution won't get their way
this time.

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,661
Just as I was wondering
if I should just quit,

68
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,957
Mr. Park wanted to meet up
out of the blue, so I asked him why.

69
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,876
I'm never the one
to take orders from someone

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,420
just because they're my seniors.

71
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,630
Then,

72
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,882
he brought up Hanjo.

73
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,720
So I thought,

74
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,514
"There's always a way."

75
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,727
Sponsoring a politician is a lot of work,

76
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,105
but having that connection won't hurt us.

77
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,064
But my question is,

78
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,650
Mr. Park said he did everything himself.

79
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,656
"My junior did all the work.
I only took care of the expenses."

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,158
I wouldn't say that either.

81
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,203
-That's true.
-Even if I step in again,

82
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,164
you can't turn the tables.

83
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,124
That's not what I'm asking.

84
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,251
I want to pay the fine
with Sung-jae's money.

85
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,004
That's only fair. I mean, it's his fault.

86
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,256
Then you will

87
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,092
have to acquire all of his assets first.

88
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,429
And to do that, I need live ammunition.

89
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,391
So you don't want them
to collect his fines.

90
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,311
That's why the eastern office
is such a nuisance.

91
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,520
And that division too.

92
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,649
It looks like the major crime unit
brings up Hanjo whenever they get bored.

93
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,944
We're not committing crimes.
We're just being economically active.

94
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,784
The major crime unit is
at the National Police Agency,

95
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,664
but I see what you mean.

96
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,504
Do you like this place?

97
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,841
Yes, it's nice.

98
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,677
Only a select few get to meet me here.

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,888
Right, of course.

100
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,141
You can meet me here from now on.

101
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,434
Meeting at a hotel

102
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,353
can be a hassle.

103
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,399
Sure, whenever you need me.

104
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,777
Take it easy.

105
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,159
Why did you two fight?

106
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:51,911
Pardon?

107
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,164
Didn't you fight?

108
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,458
Then,

109
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,460
why did he die like that?

110
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,132
We did have a disagreement.

111
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,009
That's why I left before Mr. Park did,

112
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,638
but I had no idea that was the last time
I'd see him.

113
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,687
Anyway, the culprit has been caught.
It's all over now.

114
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,275
And starting tomorrow, Prosecutor Hwang
will be very busy with the committee.

115
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,340
Didn't you fight?

116
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,135
Then, why did he die like that?

117
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,637
KIM SA-HYUN

118
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,892
What is it?

119
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,186
Looks like you haven't heard yet.

120
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,730
Is there something I should know about?
I'm driving.

121
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,064
Turn on the radio.

122
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,821
We've requested
a search and seizure on Jeon Gi-hyeok.

123
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,948
Let's see if they issue the warrant.

124
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,243
Whoever did this knows that the real
culprit could be revealed anytime.

125
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,788
They're going all out,
so we won't have mercy either.

126
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,096
It sounds complicated,

127
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,476
but it comes down to who'd have
the motive to do such a thing.

128
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,395
I mean, the division itself
has nothing to do with it.

129
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,317
The debate over investigative authority
will affect the entire prosecution,

130
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,862
but would a prosecutor
at a local prosecutors' office

131
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,323
suddenly think to sacrifice himself

132
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,451
and send a fake letter and hire someone
to pretend to be a witness?

133
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,498
But clearly, this can't be a random prank
because the victim is a prosecutor.

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,876
If you see here…

135
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,673
A gambler who had been convicted
of forgery in the past sent this

136
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,258
acting as if he was the culprit.

137
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,343
And what did we find?

138
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,305
See this here? They're saying
this is the police emblem.

139
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:24,021
And this was found on the prosecutor
we rescued earlier today.

140
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,481
Can you all see this?

141
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,026
Maybe it's too small
for those of you at the back to see.

142
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,657
You're all busy typing away.

143
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,788
This hardwood floor and this table.

144
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,835
We've verified that it was taken
in the residence of the fake witness

145
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,462
who said he saw a cop
abducting the victim.

146
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,631
That hasn't been confirmed yet.

147
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,466
But we didn't try to weasel out of it.

148
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,219
We arrested the cop
who was pegged as the culprit.

149
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,638
But it was all a lie.

150
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,974
Who could be behind this?

151
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:06,147
Would a police officer assault
and kidnap a prosecutor,

152
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,693
then send a blood-soaked tie?

153
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,778
Who'd benefit from this?

154
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,909
The Criminal Legislation Division did this
to keep the investigative rights.

155
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,120
Proving this would be simple.

156
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,623
We can seize the fake witness's
phone and computer

157
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,500
If the Criminal Legislation Division
is behind this, who could it be?

158
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,588
It doesn't matter
whether it's Woo Tae-ha or Kim Sa-hyun.

159
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,214
As long as it's one of them.

160
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,091
Then we'll win this fight.

161
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,594
If those in the Legislation Division
feel falsely accused,

162
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,137
they should grant us the warrant.

163
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,681
Even as we speak,
we're begging them right now

164
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,850
for a warrant that should be
rightfully issued.

165
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,813
As you just saw,
the National Police Agency

166
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,609
made an official statement regarding
the prosecution's alleged involvement.

167
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,860
They are saying that…

168
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,322
I should tell you about
the Criminal Legislation Division first.

169
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,993
It was formed to protect
the prosecution's investigative authority.

170
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,330
The police are accusing the Criminal
Legislation Division of trying

171
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,708
to diffuse the increasing demands
to redistribute investigative authority

172
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,753
between the police and the prosecution.

173
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,129
It's preposterous.

174
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,841
What prosecutor would collude
with an ex-con and orchestrate this?

175
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,804
The prosecution has done
many nonsensical things.

176
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,056
Before we continue this discussion,

177
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,100
let's take a look at the statement

178
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,144
released by the prosecution this morning
regarding the accusation.

179
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,647
We'll continue
after hearing their rebuttal.

180
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,568
If an ex-con went out of his way

181
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,029
to peg a cop as the culprit,

182
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,866
shouldn't we look into whether
they have had any past involvements

183
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,412
or if he's holding a grudge against him?

184
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,248
How could they accuse us instead?

185
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,874
I mean, it's common sense.

186
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,460
It'll be revealed
as soon as the case is solved.

187
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,504
Why would anyone use such a clumsy trick?

188
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,465
Yet the Senior Superintendent General
went out of his way

189
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,344
to hold a press conference in the middle
of the night to make baseless allegations.

190
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,306
Can we leave public order and security
in the hands of someone like that?

191
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,016
It is such a shame.

192
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:12,481
The prosecutors
of the Criminal Legislation Division

193
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,693
have themselves denied the allegations
raised by the police.

194
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,736
However, we just received news

195
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,074
that has left
even ordinary people like us puzzled.

196
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,993
Yes, the warrant request was denied.

197
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,080
The prosecution rejected
the search and seizure on Jeon Gi-hyeok.

198
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,749
The prosecution mentioned common sense
in their statement.

199
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,711
If they have nothing to hide,
they should investigate it.

200
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,337
That's common sense.

201
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,299
It was the central office
that rejected the warrant.

202
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,884
They didn't reject the warrant.

203
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:44,013
They just asked for more evidence
since it's an important case.

204
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,389
There's no solid evidence,

205
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,933
so the police should investigate
the case further.

206
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,643
That's why they need the warrant.

207
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,063
-Otherwise, why would they need it?
-As for the fake witness,

208
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,940
the central office was always in charge.

209
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,193
You're making it seem as if

210
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,030
the Criminal Legislation Division
told them not to issue the warrant.

211
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,532
-But times have changed.
-Yes, my point exactly.

212
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,416
-Hello?
-Do you have any dirt on Woo Tae-ha?

213
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,460
-Or Kim Sa-hyun.
-Pardon?

214
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,879
You're at the Intelligence Bureau.
Do you have any intel on them?

215
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,841
I'll look into it, sir.

216
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,260
He doesn't look like it,
but he's one sly bastard!

217
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,106
I should have reported it right away.
What if they ask what took so long?

218
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,943
-Just calm down for a moment.
-How can I calm down right now?

219
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,043
Here.

220
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,629
Thank you.

221
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,894
Why so secretive?

222
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,189
It's the warrant. He asked for it
first thing in the morning.

223
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,860
I had no idea
because of all the cameras and reporters.

224
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,948
By the way, it can't be true, right?

225
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,741
I mean, that's insane.

226
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,164
The Prosecutor General will ask us to
disband the special divisions nation-wide

227
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,251
except for three offices
including the central office.

228
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,920
And he'll suggest that
we reinforce the criminal division,

229
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,463
which is our main duty.

230
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,466
They told you that over the phone?

231
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,887
As for you, organize his motions on paper

232
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,808
and categorize the objectives,
the significance and the trajectories.

233
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,435
Yes, sir.

234
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,187
The Criminal Procedure Code
will not be amended.

235
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,481
We must make sure it won't happen
at all costs.

236
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,275
Understood?

237
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,779
We can hold on to our
direct investigative authority, right?

238
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,533
But the police watch was in the photo.
That's a fact.

239
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,912
That means we can still suspect
that the culprit is a cop.

240
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,080
We will protect that no matter what.

241
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,250
Giving that up is like
giving up the whole thing.

242
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,629
And it looks like there won't be
a third council meeting,

243
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,088
judging from the situation.

244
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,758
All right, then…

245
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,056
Yongsan Police Station
let Jeon Gi-hyeok go

246
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,099
because he wouldn't talk.

247
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,019
They wanted to see who he'll try to
contact once he's released.

248
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,689
He won't do that right away
unless he's an idiot.

249
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,736
Idiot or not, he shouldn't have anyone
to contact. Isn't that right?

250
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:50,282
If he was motivated by
a personal grudge against a cop.

251
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,034
Like you said,

252
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,329
it's possible he was holding a grudge
because of his past arrest.

253
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,664
However,

254
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,959
all they know is that a cop was named
a suspect in the case.

255
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,127
Nothing else was mentioned on the news.

256
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,797
So how did Jeon Gi-hyeok know
that it was the cop

257
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,050
he had been harboring a grudge against?

258
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,469
Maybe they have a way
of figuring that out.

259
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,845
Who are "they"?

260
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,645
The witness Jeon Gi-hyeok
was indicted for speculative acts in 2017

261
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,897
by Criminal Division Two
in the Seongnam Office.

262
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,364
I don't even want to ask you

263
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,283
if you remember everything
that happened in your previous jobs.

264
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,743
You're right.

265
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,413
I don't think it was caused by a grudge.

266
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,959
Then why did you say it was?

267
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,129
Why do you think I did that?

268
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,467
Sir, why are you quiet all of a sudden?

269
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,637
Shouldn't you be worked up
about the situation most?

270
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,725
We have to find who it was
that did this to screw us over.

271
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,315
If one of us voluntarily dirtied
their hands

272
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,318
upon realizing that we've reached
the end of the rope

273
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,990
and that we've exhausted
all our resources,

274
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,451
I'll applaud them.

275
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,620
Shouldn't we thank our hero
for his sacrifice?

276
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,540
How could you call him a "hero"?

277
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,753
Our independence fighters were
terrorists in the eyes of the Japanese.

278
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,510
Give us some privacy, Si-mok.

279
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,394
What is it? Why kick him out?

280
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,398
Tae-ha.

281
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,291
I'm going to the bank.

282
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,961
What about Seo Dong-jae?

283
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,217
He'd be dead now
if things went according to your plan.

284
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,136
-Someone's plan.
-Right. Had one of the Segok officers

285
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,222
been pegged as the culprit as planned,

286
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,599
the investigation would have been
focused on him.

287
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,893
He didn't do it,
so he can't even confess to it.

288
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,686
Then Dong-jae would be dead now.

289
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,896
He came back alive,

290
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,899
albeit broken and covered in blood,
but he could have died.

291
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,985
And what about the Segok officer?

292
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,195
The corrupt cop?

293
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,906
If he was charged
with murdering a prosecutor,

294
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,784
and didn't confess or showed any remorse,

295
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,287
any one of us would have given him
the heaviest sentence as revenge.

296
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,207
The person you really need to thank

297
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,418
isn't that "someone" who disgraced
the entire prosecution.

298
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,711
It's Si-mok.

299
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,381
Had he not caught
Jeon Gi-hyeok in a lie, you…

300
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,675
You could have been a murderer.

301
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,927
Two families would have been ruined!

302
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,518
I'm sure that "someone" was also worried

303
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,106
because a prosecutor went missing.

304
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,568
But seeing how
the situation was unfolding…

305
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,611
He must have thought

306
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,323
that this was a rare opportunity
that only comes once in a lifetime.

307
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,119
Do you think he shouldn't have done
anything, knowing that?

308
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,040
Do you think he didn't know
it could cause trouble down the road?

309
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,921
He stepped in despite all of that.

310
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,716
For all of us.

311
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,054
No one died.

312
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,444
He went to the bank.

313
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,490
Jeez.

314
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,098
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

315
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,647
So you need
the deceased's bank statements?

316
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,568
Correct. I just need records
from April 6, 2018 to a month before that.

317
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,487
Give me a moment.

318
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,906
It's not common for us to be contacted

319
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,368
by the prosecution about accessing
a deceased client's account details.

320
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,036
Please give me a moment.

321
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,546
The client's family
has consented to this, right?

322
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,507
-Yes.
-Okay.

323
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,639
Chief Prosecutor Park Gwang-su.

324
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,224
Prosecutor Seo doggedly searched

325
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,226
-articles about his death.
-What? Oh, him…

326
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,519
A vacation home area?

327
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,063
You can go ahead first.
I'll join you later.

328
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,278
He asked for three files in total,
so I photocopied them at the same time.

329
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,406
When Prosecutor Seo came by
the Supreme Office to see you…

330
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,449
I was just wondering if he gave you a file

331
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,743
on anything else
other than Segok Police Station.

332
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,745
-Which case?
-Lawyer Park Gwang-su.

333
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,498
You're right.

334
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,750
This won't help you find Prosecutor Seo.

335
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,172
I heard they found
the Uijeongbu prosecutor.

336
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,676
What brings you by so early?

337
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,221
Why did you mention Uijeongbu?

338
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,892
Last time, you said

339
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,104
it was about that missing prosecutor.

340
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,068
You were expecting me that day,

341
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,404
weren't you?

342
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,616
No.

343
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,411
I showed up unannounced

344
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,872
and started asking you
about your late husband,

345
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,585
and the first thing you said was,
"Okay, go ahead."

346
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,755
"What's it about?
Why are you asking about him now?"

347
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,673
You didn't ask me that.

348
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,550
Didn't I?

349
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,302
No.

350
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,890
That day, someone came to see you
before I did

351
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,061
and told you I'd be coming
to ask about your husband.

352
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,314
That's probably when you heard
that it was about

353
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,524
the Uijeongbu office.

354
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,070
No.

355
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,864
I should go.

356
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,408
Why did you send me
to the secretary at the law firm?

357
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,832
Do you need all the deposits
and withdrawals?

358
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,752
-Yes, please print it for me.
-Sure.

359
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,672
You knew I'd have more questions

360
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,509
once I met with the secretary.

361
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:16,228
You didn't trust the person
who came to see you.

362
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,485
I don't trust him either.

363
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,165
What do you want to know?

364
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,337
Here you go.

365
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,425
BANK STATEMENT
ACCOUNT HOLDER: PARK GWANG-SU

366
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,513
TRANSFER

367
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,227
SHIN SEO-YEON,
YANG YU-BIN, JANG SU-JEONG

368
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,355
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

369
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,609
-The highlighter…
-Sure.

370
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,825
SHIN SEO-YEON,
YANG YU-BIN, JANG SU-JEONG

371
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,966
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

372
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,729
Someone who died after drinking
in the outskirts

373
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,900
wired 2 million won each to three women
two days before his death?

374
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,444
SENIOR INSPECTOR HAN YEO-JIN

375
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,530
HE WOULDN'T HAVE DRANK
OUT ON THE STREETS

376
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,700
This is starting to sound
all too familiar.

377
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,127
He wouldn't have drank out on the streets.

378
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,761
So I was going to visit places
he made transactions with.

379
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,353
We should find those people.

380
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,691
But not now.

381
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,902
My boss is in a bad mood right now.

382
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,115
Same here. Both assistant chiefs.

383
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,492
Oh, dear.

384
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,414
I'll look into it later.

385
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,337
THANKS. I'LL LOOK INTO IT TOO.

386
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,508
OKAY

387
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,152
Hello.

388
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,156
Yes, hello.

389
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,661
Three women who received money
from Park Gwang-su a year ago

390
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,788
all worked at this club at the time.

391
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,915
Yang Yu-bin, Shin Seo-yeon
and Jang Su-jeong.

392
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,292
Remember them?

393
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,962
I'm not sure.

394
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,715
The girls don't use their real names here.

395
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,216
Right, I understand.

396
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,428
But I'm sure you gave Mr. Park
their account information

397
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,054
along with their real names.

398
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,558
He asked you to send some girls over,

399
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,227
so you picked those three.

400
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,230
Then you contacted him
to tell him who was coming

401
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,899
and that he should send them
the money directly.

402
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,817
Detective.

403
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,862
We don't do stuff like that.

404
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,280
But you used to, last year.

405
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,575
All right, ma'am.

406
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,910
I'll ask one more time.

407
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,872
On April 6, 2018,

408
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,751
did you send three girls to Namyangju
as per Lawyer Park Gwang-su's request?

409
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,092
Hold on. They went there as party helpers.

410
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,345
High-paid helpers, I see.

411
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,682
Where did you send them in Namyangju?

412
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,816
You work in Gangnam.

413
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,861
Do you often travel
to the outskirts for a job?

414
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,447
I mean, if you don't remember
visiting Namyangju…

415
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,867
We never leave the lounge.

416
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,598
Only two offices could've known
that I was going to visit you that day.

417
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,308
The Uijeongbu office

418
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,187
and the supreme office.

419
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,152
The Criminal Legislation Division, right?

420
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,278
Chief Woo Tae-ha.

421
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,157
Have you seen this man again
since you saw him a year ago?

422
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,286
How could I remember him
when I only saw him once a year ago?

423
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,871
So you did meet him once.

424
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,791
Ms. Yang Yu-bin.

425
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,461
His bank statement shows
that he sent you money.

426
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,713
You don't need to cover for them.

427
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,298
I'm not covering for them.

428
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,302
I'm sure the duration is preselected,
whether it's a few hours or a day.

429
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,179
And the amount varies depending on it.

430
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,100
If they got two million won…
How many hours is that for?

431
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,061
Why would I send them elsewhere?
I'd make them drink here.

432
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,938
You said you sent the girls.

433
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,944
Yes, Prosecutor Hwang.

434
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,406
She admitted to it?

435
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,616
I see.

436
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,537
Okay, so she went to Namyangju
because their manager told them to.

437
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,456
Got it.

438
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,501
My order? Who said that?

439
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,921
She said they called a cab and went
to the address you gave them together.

440
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:23,595
From time to time, we receive
such requests from our regulars.

441
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,263
"Send some girls over."

442
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,558
They need someone to sing
and stuff at parties, you know.

443
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,353
Our girls are very good. Some of them
even competed in the Campus Song Festival.

444
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,980
What? That's ancient.

445
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:34,898
What do you mean?

446
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,901
It was around until 2012.
Even I participated in it.

447
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:41,738
You haven't deleted the message
that you received then, right?

448
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,949
He's dead. Why would I still have it?

449
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,660
As soon as the girls told me
what happened, I…

450
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,537
They told you?

451
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,168
What did you hear?

452
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,587
It was like a vacation villa.

453
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,340
This man was waiting for us,

454
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,342
and he arrived soon after.

455
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,262
And there was another person
who arrived last.

456
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,807
There was someone else? Who?

457
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,809
How would I know that?

458
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,663
And they were addressed as…

459
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,206
Honey or sir, usually.

460
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,708
No, how did they address each other?

461
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,087
That I really don't remember.

462
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,464
I only saw them briefly a year ago.

463
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,633
How would I remember
what they said or did?

464
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,386
Why only briefly?

465
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,806
I'm sure you spent
a good few hours with them.

466
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,810
How long did you stay there?

467
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,396
What time did you arrive and leave?
Approximately.

468
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,148
We left quickly.

469
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,818
Did they ask you to leave?

470
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,821
Did they refuse to spend time with you?

471
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,286
His hands got so busy
the moment we sat down.

472
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,297
Ms. Yang.

473
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,756
When you were leaving,

474
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,467
how was this man doing?

475
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,313
Fine. Since it's not what we were told
to keep to ourselves…

476
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,112
Sir!

477
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,406
Mr. Park!

478
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,407
Sir!

479
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,682
The girls looked really shook up
since they saw a person die so suddenly.

480
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,518
He asked for some antacids
and all of a sudden…

481
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,979
It didn't even take a minute.

482
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,774
But the next day,
all the articles said he died on the road.

483
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,568
We thought we had seen it all
at the vacation home,

484
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,612
but what happened after…

485
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,406
It was beyond our imagination.

486
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,577
Jang Su-jeong said something similar.

487
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,850
She said Chief Woo addressed
the man who died as "sir,"

488
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,687
and she doesn't remember
the person who got there last

489
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,232
because it happened
right after that person arrived.

490
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,272
RECENT DESTINATIONS

491
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,191
DELETE

492
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,068
DELETED

493
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,290
He abandoned the body,

494
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,127
and even used the dead man's fingers
to call 911.

495
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,423
What Jang Su-jeong remembered
the most clearly

496
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,885
was how Chief Woo told them
to clean up the table

497
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,262
without leaving a single trace.

498
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,266
So it seems he wasn't planning
on moving the body at first.

499
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,727
If he moved the body
and told them to keep quiet,

500
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,605
the vacation home
wouldn't even have been investigated.

501
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,026
Chief Woo was thinking of calling
an ambulance at first,

502
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,986
so he told them to clean everything up.

503
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,572
And then he told the women
to leave the scene too.

504
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,950
They said the person who arrived
after Chief Woo

505
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,621
took them in his car and dropped them off
somewhere far away.

506
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,623
Then would Jang Su-jeong

507
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,126
-remember the plate number?
-That would probably be impossible.

508
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,840
And could I ask you another favor?

509
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,468
I need someone else's help.

510
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,677
Who?

511
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,806
I need someone who's never met
Chief Woo before.

512
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,724
Someone who doesn't know his face.

513
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,710
…with people from
the Korean Bar Association.

514
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,879
Yes, 12 people in total.

515
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,968
Yes, just the ones who've answered.

516
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,973
Yes.

517
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,646
Sir, could I look into it
and call you back later?

518
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,482
All right. I'll call you right away.

519
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,320
Where are your manners?

520
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,532
You're getting cockier day by day.

521
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,910
Hey!

522
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,998
Did you know that Hanjo was the one
that arranged the meeting?

523
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,670
Or did Park Gwang-su's heart stop

524
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,964
before you could talk about Hanjo?

525
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,097
You're not asking why I'm talking
about Park Gwang-su

526
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,849
and Hanjo together.

527
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,559
What's there to ask?

528
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,227
What are you on about?

529
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,105
I confirmed that you met Park Gwang-su
and someone else

530
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,734
at a vacation home in Namyangju
on April 6, 2018

531
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,279
when you were the Chief of the
Fair Trade Investigation Department.

532
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,324
I heard your hands were very busy.

533
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,869
-Hey.
-Yes.

534
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,829
What excuse are you going to make up now?

535
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,170
You should be grateful
that I've put up with you until now.

536
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,506
I could get rid of you in an instant.

537
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:03,054
Everyone accepts drinks sometimes.
Where and what I drink

538
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,348
is none of your business!

539
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,517
You and the other two people

540
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,270
who were at that gathering are suspected

541
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,813
of prostitution…

542
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,151
What is it this time?

543
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,375
If you think the charage
for prostitution is unfair,

544
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,545
-then how about abandoning a corpse?
-It wasn't me.

545
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,130
Did Mr. Park die on the spot?

546
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,716
Or did you wait until he was dead

547
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,304
because your identities would have been
revealed if you called an ambulance?

548
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,395
I can see why Lee Chang-jun died.

549
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,107
Did you do the same thing to him?

550
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,362
Did you throw accusations at him
and drive him to the point of suicide?

551
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,574
Did you tell him to die
because he was doomed anyway?

552
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,245
What a scary person you are.

553
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,955
No one should get on your bad side.

554
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,251
Comparing yourself to him
won't make you innocent.

555
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,752
I didn't kill anyone.

556
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,255
He just happened to die in front of me.

557
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,552
Things like that should just be
thought of as an unlucky incident

558
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,761
and be forgotten.

559
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,514
If you hadn't gone there,
you wouldn't have been unlucky.

560
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,183
You knew it wasn't just
a normal gathering, right?

561
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,019
Why did you go all the way there?

562
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,229
Anyone in that situation

563
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,816
would have done what I did! Okay?

564
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,276
Anyone!

565
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,654
No. Your duty is to serve justice.

566
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,074
You should never hide
behind the word "anyone."

567
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,827
But you keep denying what you did.

568
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,163
Then did Mr. Park's body walk by itself

569
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,540
to that location?

570
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,168
Did his finger press 911 after he passed?

571
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,419
I told you it wasn't me!

572
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,129
I didn't make that call!

573
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,465
Who was the third man

574
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,009
at the vacation home?

575
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,513
Where are you going?

576
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,517
I should get them out of here.

577
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,728
It'll take over an hour for a cab
to arrive.

578
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,773
Then it'll look like we hung out
with them for several hours.

579
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,483
We'll be screwed for sure.

580
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,570
I'll take them in my car

581
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,740
and drop them off somewhere far away
and come straight back.

582
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,825
Just stay here for a while.

583
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,369
Come with me.

584
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,167
Who's the man who arrived later?

585
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,753
That cheap jerk.

586
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,925
The Intelligence Bureau Director,
Kim Myeong-han.

587
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,844
From the police?

588
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,644
I'll charge those involved
and make the investigation official.

589
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,853
Hey!

590
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,028
A vacation home area?

591
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,827
Hanjo? Why did you go there?

592
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,007
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

593
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,888
The Intelligence Bureau Director?

594
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,516
At the Southern Seoul
Detention Center. Why?

595
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,607
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

596
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,947
MY DOCUMENTS

597
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,916
RESEARCH INFORMATION

598
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,380
I heard your hands were very busy.

599
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,259
PERSONAL INFO

600
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,017
PERSONAL DETAILS

601
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,435
NAME: YANG YU-BIN

602
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,202
Yes?

603
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,378
I'm sorry, sir!

604
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:53,219
A prosecutor in the Criminal Legislation
Division found out about Park Gwang-su.

605
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,639
I can take care of things on my own,

606
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,976
but I thought I should still let you know.
That's why I came to visit you.

607
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,686
I'm sorry, sir.

608
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,149
Do you remember the incident
about that lawyer last year?

609
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,534
DEPUTY PROSECUTOR GENERAL
SHIN DONG-UN

610
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,621
You fool. Why did you have to
mess with a dead body?

611
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,250
-Back then--
-Why do you look so serious?

612
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,043
You really startled me.

613
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,714
-Is that it?
-Yes. That's all, sir.

614
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,216
A prosecutor in your division…

615
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,594
Is it him?
The one from the Western Office?

616
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,221
Yes. It's Hwang Si-mok.

617
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,142
Kids like that are acting out
because of your poor judgement.

618
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,895
What's the problem?
Move him somewhere else

619
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,605
-or just fire him.
-Yes, sir.

620
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,900
And make sure everyone keeps quiet.

621
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,612
Chief Woo. Do I really have to take care
of every little thing in my position?

622
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,284
I'm sorry, sir. I'll take care
of everything and report back to you.

623
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,349
VISITATION APPLICATION

624
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,995
CELL PHONE STORAGE LOCKER

625
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,336
I'm telling you, I really didn't know!

626
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,088
I found out on the news the next day.

627
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,591
Moving his body and all that

628
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,344
had nothing to do with me.

629
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:03,557
I just confirmed everything with the woman
who was sitting next to you that day.

630
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,810
She told me that the third man
to arrive at the vacation home

631
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,395
was you.

632
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,816
Ms. Han. Didn't you hear what I said?

633
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,527
I told you, I admit that I went there.

634
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,614
An old colleague of mine
begged me to come, so I went there.

635
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,909
I regret going there.

636
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,828
But still… Right.

637
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,955
You met those girls.

638
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,250
You must have heard that
I took them and left the scene first.

639
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,297
Thinking about going back
to where Gwang-su's body was

640
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,591
made me not want to go back.

641
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,687
I wasn't planning
on running away at first.

642
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,608
But the thought of going back there was…

643
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,112
So you just went back to Seoul?

644
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,782
Then that means Chief Woo
was left there all alone.

645
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,536
If he later realized you'd betrayed him

646
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,081
and moved the body so he wouldn't
take all the blame,

647
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,877
he would've had to drive two cars
by himself at the same time.

648
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,796
Mr. Park's car and his own.

649
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,844
The car was found at least
a 15-minute drive away.

650
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,306
If Chief Woo did it alone,
he would've left Mr. Park's car there

651
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,808
and walked back to the vacation home.

652
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:13,145
A 15-minute drive
is about 2 hours on foot.

653
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,272
And he couldn't call for a cab there.

654
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,733
Would he have walked back alone
for two hours?

655
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,988
No. There were two drivers.

656
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,324
I don't know what happened after I left!

657
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,619
So you let a prosecutor
take care of everything?

658
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,537
Who knows what he would have done?

659
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,166
You must have known
that he could have pinned this on you.

660
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,210
-I--
-You went back, didn't you?

661
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,545
You went back after dropping off the girls

662
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,130
and moved the body, right?

663
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,550
Chief Woo is claiming that you're the one
who called 911.

664
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,261
I told you,
I only found out about it later.

665
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,973
Are you saying Chief Woo actually told you
what he did after you left?

666
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,399
It seems like there was someone else.
Who was it?

667
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,527
I…

668
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,908
I told one of my people
to go and take care of things.

669
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,582
I didn't give them any specific orders.

670
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:20,462
I really didn't do anything to anyone
that day at the vacation home,

671
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,549
and I didn't receive any bribes
or anything.

672
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,926
And the last time I saw Gwang-su,

673
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,011
he was lying where he died.

674
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,724
So I didn't do anything wrong that day.

675
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,519
So who did you send
to take care of things?

676
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,523
They just went there
because I asked for help.

677
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,276
I didn't give them any details.

678
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,488
I just asked them to go there
because someone died.

679
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,532
Was it our Chief?

680
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,874
Was it Chief Choi Bit?

681
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,338
Just think about it.
For me, it was the obvious choice.

682
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,383
The body would be reported no matter what,

683
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,177
and it'd go straight to Chief Choi.

684
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,013
She was the Chief there after all.

685
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,015
Is that why

686
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,476
she was promoted from being
the chief of a rural station

687
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,978
to working for the Intelligence Bureau?

688
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,188
She got her position

689
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,734
for cleaning up the Intelligence Bureau
Director's mess?

690
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,529
Well, who wouldn't?

691
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,331
You don't know what it's really like
to be dragged into things.

692
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,333
What you've experienced is nothing at all.

693
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,340
What will you do, Inspector Han?

694
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,968
If they take me,
will you just wait and see?

695
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,904
CELL PHONE STORAGE LOCKER

696
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,698
Come to my office.

697
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,245
HIDDEN CONTENT

698
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,040
HAN YEO-JIN

699
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,636
COME TO MY OFFICE.

700
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,682
Why would Chief Woo want to see me?

701
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,809
You too?

702
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,866
Does everyone get off work this early?

703
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,686
Ms. Han Yeo-jin.

704
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,898
Did you cover up the crime
of an assemblyman's son?

705
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,608
It was a narcotics case.

706
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,988
I'll show you what it means
to have the authority to indict.

707
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,490
I'll indict you.

708
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,993
You'll be sentenced

709
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,455
and I'll make you a corrupt cop
and a convict.

710
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,332
Even if I lose my job,

711
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,668
I can destroy you
without even lifting a finger.

712
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,421
Are you happy now?

713
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,179
Ms. Han, you shouldn't glare at me
like that right now.

714
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,931
I'm trying to save Chief Choi.

715
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,892
You went to the detention center.

716
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:06,104
He ran away and ordered his junior
to take care of the mess he made.

717
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,231
I doubt he would have tried
to protect her.

718
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,068
She's the one who suggested
moving the body.

719
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,446
Chief Choi's the one

720
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:18,658
who came up with the idea of moving
the body and calling 911 with his phone.

721
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,954
If you don't believe me, ask her yourself.

722
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,540
"That cheap jerk."

723
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,458
You…

724
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,044
Did you want to have
revenge on the director

725
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,545
because he ran off without you?

726
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,756
Did you get him arrested because of that?

727
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,257
He's guilty.

728
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,553
He's going to be a convict,
I might as well make use of that.

729
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,433
Ms. Han. Do you really have to drag
Chief Choi into this?

730
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,519
Do you have to bring her down?

731
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,857
Did you discuss this with Chief Choi too?

732
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,694
Did she agree to this?

733
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,656
Don't disappoint her, Ms. Han.

734
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,157
Don't you want to protect her?

735
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,995
My junior doesn't seem to want
to protect me at all,

736
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,664
but I'm willing to protect you.

737
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,792
And Prosecutor Hwang,
I won't blame you for insubordination.

738
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,585
I'll send you to Gangwon Province.

739
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,421
All right. Prosecutor Hwang
can protect Ms. Han,

740
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,216
Ms. Han can protect her boss,

741
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,010
and I can protect myself.
How beautiful is that?

742
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,223
You two just have to keep quiet about it.

743
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,979
It wasn't some terrible homicide
or a huge corruption case.

744
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:34,234
It's just a matter of
where a sick man ended up dying.

745
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,697
You don't need to ruin so many
people's lives over such a petty thing.

746
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,740
And even if you do,

747
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,785
this might sound like I'm bragging,

748
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,288
but I'm the chief
of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

749
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,832
Even if I quit,
companies will line up to hire me.

750
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,626
If that's the case,

751
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,295
why are you telling us this now?

752
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,629
Because I can do it.

753
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,007
I can ruin

754
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,050
the both of you.

755
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,097
Okay. From now on, I won't try
to persuade you kindly anymore.

756
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,392
Here you go.

757
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,451
Were you worried you'd be recorded
if you made a phone call?

758
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,371
We were actually worried
you'd tell us over the phone.

759
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,624
Haven't you learned anything so far?

760
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,751
We're all on the same team.

761
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,753
How dare you spy on your colleague?

762
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,632
It's obvious, but you seem so surprised.

763
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,427
I wonder how things have been until now.

764
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,147
So you don't care what will happen?

765
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,402
Fine.

766
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:48,076
He really meant it when he said
he'd make you a convict.

767
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,664
I know. And I know he's capable.

768
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,377
And I know he can't decide by himself

769
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,713
when and where to transfer me.

770
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,550
I guess the higher-ups agreed to it.

771
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,836
You're pretty late.

772
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,346
I heard you left the office a while ago.

773
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,351
I was only going to drink
until you arrived,

774
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,020
but you got here late.

775
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,899
I had to meet someone.

776
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,902
Then you must've heard

777
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,822
everything from Chief Woo already.

778
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,617
Are you here to blame me?

779
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,371
Since Chief Woo has leverage

780
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,207
because I told you to keep quiet
about Nam Jae-ik's son then?

781
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,918
I shouldn't have done it.

782
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,796
I should have pushed forward with it.

783
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,966
I don't blame you.

784
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,680
Back then,
I really thought you were right.

785
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,641
I thought I should be flexible

786
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,145
and I shouldn't be so stubborn
about the rules.

787
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,110
But I won't do that ever again.

788
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,947
So you're going to

789
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,577
follow the rules for this
even when I'm involved?

790
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,289
Moving the body

791
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,499
and calling 911…

792
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,462
Was it really your idea?

793
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,800
Yes, it was.

794
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,148
Didn't it occur to you before?

795
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,901
This time,

796
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,238
it's your turn. Just like it was
between me and the director before.

797
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,158
Maybe I can hold your hand
and pull you up--

798
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,952
Why? Why are you doing this?

799
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,246
Why are you underestimating yourself?

800
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,628
Even if you didn't hold his hand,
you would've earned a great position.

801
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,755
You would've achieved
everything you wanted.

802
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,132
You got there a few years earlier,

803
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:35,094
but it's made you think
that you didn't earn it yourself.

804
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,430
Darn it.

805
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,479
Even if the incident goes public,

806
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,689
things could just fizzle out.

807
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:50,443
But if you end up suffering
because of that incident,

808
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,654
it'll be something I've never expected.

809
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,991
I never imagined I'd be ruining
the career of the first person

810
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,994
I sincerely respected
after I became a cop.

811
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,917
You don't know me well.

812
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,963
You'll never end me with your own hands.

813
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,683
I should end it here.

814
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,978
I'm starting to get scared

815
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,439
that you might make a scene at the end

816
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,484
like someone I saw.

817
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,314
He's not picking up!

818
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,400
He ran away. Of course he won't pick up!

819
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,655
I should've reported it right away.
What if they ask what took so long?

820
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,160
What did he say?
You're in on this, aren't you?

821
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:25,997
I told you, I thought he was here too!
I thought he was calling from here.

822
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,041
We can't let him get away with this!

823
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,709
That's not the problem right now.

824
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,462
Should we leave him here?
Someone will find him.

825
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,673
Oh, his call history.
The last call would probably be me.

826
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,216
Just calm down for a moment.

827
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,093
How can I calm down right now?

828
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,679
The plate. 7524. Is that your car?

829
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,599
-Why?
-The dashcam was off.

830
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,933
I saw it on the way here.

831
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,227
The dashcam was turned off.

832
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,271
Is that yours?

833
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,649
No.

834
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:54,984
So?

835
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:03,701
Calling 911 at the end
made it seem more real.

836
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,871
I didn't do it to make it seem more real.

837
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,706
Then why?

838
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,793
So he'd be found soon.

839
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,629
So he won't

840
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,466
stay like that on the road for long.

841
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,387
I'm now standing in front
of the vacation home

842
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:09,559
where a lawyer died from a heart attack
one year ago, in April, 2018.

843
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,104
It has been revealed that members
of the police and prosecution

844
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,231
moved his body to hide traces

845
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,359
of the secret gathering
that took place here.

846
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,195
In addition, it was revealed
that they stopped an investigation

847
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,408
even after finding out that the son
of an assemblyman had been using drugs.

848
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:28,161
These scandals are causing a huge stir.

849
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,496
You should have reported it
before revealing that.

850
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,622
What were you thinking?

851
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,503
I'm sorry. But I did report it.

852
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,964
You only reported to Chief Choi.

853
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,883
You should have waited for my approval!

854
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,803
I'll say it was a false announcement

855
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,389
and say the prosecution is dragging her
into their mess,

856
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,766
so you tell them that too.

857
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,394
No, just don't say anything.
Don't talk to anyone about it.

858
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,484
This is exactly why I had to do it

859
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,654
without your approval.

860
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,240
Do as I say, Inspector Han.

861
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,580
I'm sorry, sir.

862
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,421
Yes, sir.

863
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,014
I, Woo Tae-ha,

864
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,559
did not even know the existence
of the vacation home in Namyangju.

865
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,520
So I want to make it clear

866
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,523
that the prosecutor mentioned
in the press is not me.

867
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:41,192
The prosecution found out
before the press did

868
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,362
that the police had closed
the investigation

869
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:48,032
on the assemblyman's son
even when they knew he was guilty.

870
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:53,037
The prosecution was already investigating
the possibility

871
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,207
that the police were using that
to gain the assemblyman's favor.

872
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,875
We weren't covering it up.

873
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,720
How could you bring Chief Woo's
arrest warrant to me?

874
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,431
Should I bring it to Chief Woo then?

875
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,143
Didn't you just hear what he said?
What do you expect me to do?

876
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:21,274
To just do your job. You already have
the authority to approve it.

877
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:26,028
Let's not go this far, all right?

878
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,615
He committed a serious crime,

879
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,451
and there's enough evidence
for him to get arrested.

880
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,495
He already tried
to get rid of the evidence.

881
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,916
This isn't something
I can decide by myself.

882
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,881
I'll find someone
who can make that decision.

883
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,051
He's unbelievable.

884
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,061
I'll get going, then.

885
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,378
PRESS ROOM

886
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,173
-She's here!
-She's here!

887
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,850
As a public official whose duty
is to uphold the law…

888
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,852
We must bring Chief Woo down…

889
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,271
Do you want a chance
to screw over your boss?

890
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,818
Who will your colleagues side with
in the end?

891
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:31,612
How can you call them a partner
after what you just heard?

892
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:35,116
What kind of an organization
is affected by a single person?

893
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,869
Because you can choose
how this is going to end, Chief Choi.

894
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:40,997
You're the only one left.

895
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,667
No, it's not over.
Not while I'm still alive.

896
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:50,589
