1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,052
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:58,433
As you can see, the patient's brain is
more developed than the normal brain.

4
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,561
Therefore, he is suffering
from even the smallest sound.

5
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,940
There's also a very sensitive area
that controls emotions.

6
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,155
We have got some results here
from the tests that have already come in.

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,199
We still got some more tests to do.

8
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,453
Now, there might be a small chance
of complications, but I realize that...

9
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,248
To relieve his pain, the only solution
is to perform partial lobotomy.

10
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,917
As a post-surgical after effect,

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,670
he may suffer from extreme pain
or may not feel any emotions at all.

12
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,050
Si-mok, do your ears hurt
even after the brain surgery?

13
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,009
No.

14
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,180
Have you felt angry or upset recently?

15
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,348
No.

16
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,726
Then, what about feeling happy
or laughing out loud?

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,729
No.

18
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,733
What kind of food do you crave
the most these days? What do you like?

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,528
I don't like anything.

20
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,030
How was it before?

21
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,032
Did you not have any likes
or dislikes even back then?

22
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,293
What was it like before the surgery?

23
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,088
Were things very different
compared to now?

24
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,641
Si-mok is hardly able
to feel any emotions.

25
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,102
We'll have to keep
monitoring his progress,

26
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,897
but there may be occurrences
of other post-surgery side effects.

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,763
-Move your car!
-What are you doing?

28
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,265
-I'm in a rush!
-What's your problem?

29
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,766
-What on earth are you doing?
-Move!

30
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,727
-Hey, move!
-Hurry up and move the car!

31
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,645
-What are you doing now?
-I said, move the car!

32
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,311
I'm Moo-sung Park.

33
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,938
It's very nice to meet you.

34
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,065
SANGHWA CONSTRUCTION
CEO MOO-SUNG PARK

35
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,821
Just come over to my place.
There are things we have to discuss.

36
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,394
That is 75-4.

37
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,313
This is 74-5.

38
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,859
Here is 76.

39
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,870
Excuse me. Do you know where 75-3 is?

40
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,346
-Why are you following me?
-Mr. Park is home, right?

41
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,723
I don't know who that is.

42
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,474
You live there, 75-3.

43
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,851
No, it is not. Please leave.

44
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,607
Goodness, what a waste.
I brought them for Moo-sung.

45
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,531
I'm not a creditor.

46
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,617
What are you talking about?
Why would I be scared of creditors?

47
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,998
Your house will also get seized
in the near future.

48
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,002
Let's go.

49
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,466
You are really not here
because of money, right?

50
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,969
No one owes me any money.
In fact, I have a ton of debt myself too.

51
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,516
Did you go to school with Moo-sung?

52
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,060
No, I didn't.

53
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,148
My family had a party.

54
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,693
I thought all the food would be gone
if I waited until the end,

55
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,028
so I quickly brought a few things.

56
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,573
Moo-sung doesn't eat anything
when I'm not home.

57
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,576
This is it.

58
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,582
You are really not a creditor, right?

59
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,417
We now have no money whatsoever.

60
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,805
Goodness, he must be sleeping.

61
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,351
He hasn't been getting much sleep
at night these days.

62
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,923
Why is this open?

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,319
Please wait outside.

64
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,216
Moo-sung.

65
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,650
The knife brushed against his arm
and left a shallow wound on his side.

66
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,361
His neck. This is the fatal wound.

67
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,156
Three stab wounds.
Someone who is right-handed.

68
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,909
It must have been someone
who was holding grudges.

69
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,411
Was it a spur-of-the-moment thing?

70
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,378
Don't underestimate me. Your lives
are in my hands. Do you know that?

71
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,421
I have nothing to lose now.

72
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,798
Go tell the deputy chief prosecutor.

73
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,009
If I open my mouth, he might get
buried alive in a matter of seconds.

74
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,344
I will never die alone.

75
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,000
The killer used the knife that was here.

76
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,170
The fact that the culprit
came in here without a weapon...

77
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,108
I'm calling to report a murder incident.

78
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,737
It's 75-3 Saebit-ro, Huam-dong.

79
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,281
A forensic unit is required on the scene,
and the victim is dead.

80
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,951
There's an elderly woman in her 70s too,
so please send an ambulance as well.

81
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,453
Could you identify yourself?

00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,798

This is 75-3 Huam-dong.

86
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,678
Did you get a repair request
from Moo-sung Park?

87
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,304
Are you Mr. Park?

88
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,098
What time is the technician
scheduled to arrive?

89
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,683
Just a second, please.

90
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,893
He was supposed to arrive
at 2 p.m. Is he not there yet?

91
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,190
I would like his name and address, please.

92
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,776
Sir, we will get in touch
with the technician and...

93
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,028
I'm a prosecutor
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

94
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,238
His name and address, please.

95
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,282
-Pardon me?
-He's a murder suspect.

96
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,450
I need his name and address.

97
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,411
Hold on, please.
His name is Jin-seob Kang.

98
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,745
His address is...

99
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,789
It is 61 Saechang-ro.

100
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,375
Please send a photo of him to this number.

101
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,889
Is he dead...

102
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,932
He is dead.

103
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,854
Guys,

104
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,606
-check around the house.
-Yes, sir.

105
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,153
Hello?

106
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,531
This is the police. Is anyone inside?

107
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,658
Hello?

108
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,704
Hello?

109
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,166
-You called, right? We are the police.
-Please take her.

110
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,460
-Okay.
-Okay.

111
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,505
There is a body in the living room.
There is a murder weapon as well.

112
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,256
-Sorry? Who are you?
-Ma'am, are you okay?

113
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,091
-I'm from the Prosecutors' Office.
-Ma'am!

114
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,344
-Where is the forensic unit?
-The Prosecutors' Office?

115
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,012
-Then, are you a prosecutor...
-Ma'am!

116
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,726
Ma'am. Are you all right?

117
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,144
Ma'am.

118
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,563
Excuse me.

119
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,982
Wait!

120
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,901
Excuse me.

121
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,570
Wait! Sir!

122
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,030
Sir, wait!

123
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,823
-He is from...
-What is the matter? Who is he?

124
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,741
He is a...

125
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,785
Just get him! Make sure you get him!

126
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,503
I said, stop right there.
Can't you hear me?

127
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,465
Hey!

128
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:05,886
Damn it.

129
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,523
Good. There you are. Then I'll just...

130
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,863
You jerk.
I won't let you get away like that.

131
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,211
Come in.

132
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,969
This is Mr. Park. He is a friend of mine.

133
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,722
I'm Moo-sung Park.

134
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,141
It is very nice to meet you,
Mr. Si-mok Hwang.

135
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,726
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

136
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,644
Have a seat.

137
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,688
I said great things about you to him,

138
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,481
so he has been dying to meet you.

139
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,734
Mr. Seo told me a lot about you.

140
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,946
I have to make a quick call.

141
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,537
I have been wanting
to meet you for a long time.

142
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:14,955
I see.

I'm Prosecutor Hwang
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

152
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,685
Why would a prosecutor run away?

153
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,522
Name, Jin-seob Kang. He is the suspect.

154
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,399
How do you know?

155
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,235
Can you turn off the siren?
He will run away.

156
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,236
I'm asking how you know.

157
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,613
Are you the victim's family member?
Where are you heading to?

158
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,116
To 61 Saechang-ro.

159
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,867
Turn off the siren, please.

-Move.
-Hey!

163
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,602
-Get out of my way.
-Goodness!

164
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,646
Shit.

165
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,536
What the...

166
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,287
What the hell?

167
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,220
Get lost!

168
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,019
Shit!

169
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,231
Shit.

176
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,466
Is that it? That is everything
he sold you?

177
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,426
Yes, this is it.

178
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,722
By the way, I paid him.
What will happen to my money?

179
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,350
We will give it back to you later on.

180
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,895
Wait, where are you going?
Where are you going now?

181
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,438
Wait! Goodness.

182
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,065
When will you give me back my money...

183
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,819
Goodness, this guy.

184
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,112
Where is...

185
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,326
Hey!

186
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,600
This hurts.

187
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,367
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

188
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,707
Goodness.

189
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,125
You let him take the suspect?

190
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,460
I'm sorry, sir.

191
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,754
What can you do?
He's a prosecutor after all.

192
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,797
It is not an important case anyway.

193
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,966
You should have seen
the mess in that house.

194
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,135
I wonder how he found and stole them.

195
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,803
Did he spot them
when he was fixing their TV?

196
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,140
By the way, why did the prosecutor
happen to be there at that time?

197
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,434
I will go there now and find out, okay?

198
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,769
I need to see the suspect too.

199
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,771
-All right. Get going.
-Yes, sir.

200
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,107
Goodness, can someone take
some of my cases off my plate?

201
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,985
It is going to take forever
to work on all of these cases.

202
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,320
You lazy ass.

203
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,288
Hello?

204
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,084
The laptop?

205
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,882
Hey, I heard a prosecutor beat you.

206
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,885
Who dared to mess with you,
Lieutenant Han?

207
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,388
This jerk.

208
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,474
-I'm heading out to get back at him.
-Goodness.

209
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,851
Is he a prosecutor or a brutal criminal?

210
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,436
That drawing is a little...

211
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,772
Hey!

212
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,650
He said you should go
to the hospital first.

213
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,026
Did Chief say that?

214
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,611
Why? Did the victim's mother wake up?

215
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,740
Yes. Well...
I will go to the Prosecutors' Office.

216
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,117
No, it's okay. I will go.

217
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,868
It's all right. I will take care of it.

218
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,997
You joined our team two months ago,
yet he still calls you "hey."

219
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,583
Will his tongue split
if he addresses you respectfully?

220
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,127
Detective Jang,

221
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,003
I will be back soon.

222
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,841
My goodness. Please take
your time, Lieutenant Han.

223
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,426
-See you.
-See you. Good luck.

224
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,538
My goodness. Mr. Hwang, your face looks...

225
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,498
What happened? Did that jerk do it?

226
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,584
Are you okay?
We should have some ointment around.

227
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,377
I'm all right. Ms. Young, later.

228
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,837
-I need you in here.
-Sure.

229
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,941
You have been informed of your right
to remain silent.

230
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,821
I found them in the yard.

231
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,156
I didn't even go into the house.

232
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,325
Feet up, please.

233
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,709
Are we good now?

234
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,795
God, what are you doing now?

235
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,758
It is not me. I didn't do it!

236
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,223
Had you planned it in advance,
you would have prepared a weapon

237
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,766
and kept your shoes on as well.

238
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,727
You went there because of their TV,
and he happened to be home alone.

239
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,646
Then, you saw a knife within your reach.

240
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,817
You lost it momentarily, didn't you?
A spur-of-the-moment murder.

241
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,945
Goodness, no.
He was already dead when I got there.

242
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,034
I was about to run out of there
as I was so shocked. Then,

243
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,412
I saw necklaces and so on
right beside him.

244
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,164
I know I shouldn't have done it.

245
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,666
I must have been out of my mind.

246
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,794
But that is really all that happened.
I did not kill him.

247
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,338
How did you get into the house?

248
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,174
Someone let me in. Somebody opened
the door for me from inside.

249
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,259
-Who?
-How would I know?

250
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,137
He was already there when you got there,
and no one else was home.

251
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,930
That's what you told me a few seconds ago.

252
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,059
His son and mother
are his only family members.

253
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,937
His son is serving in the military now,
and his mother wasn't home.

254
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,731
He was home alone and was found dead.

255
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,149
Then, who opened the door for you?

256
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,067
Was it a ghost?

257
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,155
I rang the doorbell,
and someone let me in.

258
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,241
That person must be the killer.
Whoever that was inside.

259
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,492
Shouldn't you catch him?

260
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,328
You think a killer
would kindly let someone in

261
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,038
immediately after killing someone?

262
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,415
He obviously wanted to frame me
for what he did.

263
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,625
But you didn't go in.
You said you found them in the yard.

264
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,669
I only said that because I knew
you wouldn't trust me.

265
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,839
When an ex-convict purposely
picks a job that allows him

266
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,090
to visit people's homes...

267
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,508
Goodness, this is driving me nuts.

268
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,178
Do you think all ex-convicts
kill people for no reason?

269
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,139
The entire house was already a total mess
when I got there.

270
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,807
Please believe me!

271
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,977
What's this?

272
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,982
He is not caught off guard.

273
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,442
He is confused.

274
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,115
What is this?

275
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,244
He is not acting like he doesn't know.

276
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,621
He hasn't seen them before.

277
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,139
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR
CHANG-JUN LEE

278
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,071
Is there a problem?

279
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,450
Moo-sung Park.

280
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,578
My apologies. I keep digging,
but I haven't...

281
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,205
He is dead.

282
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,873
Pardon me?

283
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,542
Mr. Park is dead.

284
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,336
When?

285
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,046
How?

286
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,589
Robbery murder.

287
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,008
Sorry?

288
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,302
The suspect is here now.

289
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,347
The suspect has already been caught?

290
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,310
Congratulations, sir.

291
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,396
Watch your mouth.

292
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,647
I'm sorry.

293
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,484
Don't you think
a robbery-murder case is perfect though?

294
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,739
Si-mok is the one who found the body first
and arrested the suspect.

295
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,576
-What a coincidence.
-It's certainly not a coincidence.

296
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,078
They must have been in league.

297
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,663
If he wasn't killed,

298
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,208
we would be getting prosecuted
by Si-mok instead of that suspect.

299
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,045
What if Mr. Park told him everything
before he died?

300
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,881
What is there to tell?

301
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,926
It is not like we asked him
for cars or houses like others do.

302
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,263
We just went out for a few meals
with him, that's all.

303
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,986
Dead men tell no tales.

304
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,032
And the most important piece
of the puzzle is gone.

305
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,410
No matter how capable Si-mok is,

306
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,205
he can't play this
without the one who holds the key.

307
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,208
You obviously don't know him well enough.

308
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,376
He is like a venomous snake.

309
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,171
He will use this case
in order to dig deeper.

310
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,467
Sir, let me handle this case. I will...

311
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,052
Let Eun-soo take care of it.

312
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,221
You mean the trainee in Si-mok's office?

313
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,807
She will turn it into a bigger deal.

314
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,353
It's about time she took on a real case.

315
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,773
Also, she will be a lot easier
to handle than Si-mok.

316
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,152
Keep a watchful eye
on how everything goes, please.

317
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,196
It's too obvious.

318
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,491
Si-mok will certainly sense
that we are trying to exclude him.

319
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,909
We have already made it obvious.

320
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,163
He might try to make us
give up our prosecutor's badges.

321
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,415
That's why I should take it on and...

322
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,875
Do you think Si-mok is an idiot?

323
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,378
Do you think he will leave
a mouse in a cat's hands?

324
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,340
Why am I a cat?

325
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,509
Don't you dare act like you don't know.

326
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,887
We both know
whom Mr. Park resented the most.

327
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,881
They were looking for someone
who wants a family-like work environment.

328
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,635
Ex-convicts need
to sustain themselves too.

329
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,721
I only did it to earn a living.

330
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,015
I should have been honest
about my criminal record,

331
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,184
but they said they would
treat me like family.

332
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,561
But family, my ass.

333
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,898
I don't even have time to take a piss,
let alone eat anything.

334
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,151
I even had to write an apology for getting
a low customer satisfaction rate.

335
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,779
They keep harassing me
if I take a little longer at one location.

336
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,156
I'm required to sell too.
I don't even have weekends off.

337
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,991
I have to work my ass off
on weekends as well.

338
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,410
Do you know how much they pay me a month
for working like a dog?

339
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,538
Why do you think I'm behind on my rent?

340
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,583
The fact that you are behind on rent
means you must have debts as well.

341
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,293
You sure have a motive.

342
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,837
Sir, I...

343
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,840
I really wanted to start afresh
and work hard, okay?

344
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm a dad.

345
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,259
Sir, I...

346
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,844
I have a kid.

347
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,680
My wife. She is...

348
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,848
She's clueless even though she's a mom.

349
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,851
I have to look after my kid.
No one else would do it.

350
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,812
I'm telling you.

351
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,439
I really want to be a good dad.

352
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,274
I want my kid to grow
into a wonderful person.

353
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,859
I swear, I really wanted to start afresh.

354
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,654
Yes, I shouldn't have let my greed

355
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,864
get the best of me
even though I saw the dead body.

356
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,283
But I didn't do it.

357
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,202
I really didn't do it.

358
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,706
How can anyone with a heart kill someone?

359
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,548
Send him to the detention center.

360
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,674
Sir!

361
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,259
What are his charges?

362
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,386
We will fill it in later on.

363
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,804
I'm innocent!

364
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,015
I told you I didn't do it.
Why don't you believe me?

365
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,267
Innocent?

366
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,020
Even if your claim is true,

367
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,190
you saw the dead man covered in blood

368
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,151
and grabbed his money first.

369
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,236
Can you call that innocent?

370
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,613
Do you think anyone can do that?

371
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,825
I have stolen things,
but I would never kill anyone!

372
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,535
Goodness, I...

373
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,203
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

374
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,872
I'm saying I didn't do it! No!

375
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,457
Sir, I really didn't do it!

376
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,083
It wasn't me!

377
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,566
I see.

378
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,235
Sure, okay.

379
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,030
Thank you. I will do my best.

380
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,116
Congratulations.

381
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,787
Goodness, suspects never admit
to what they did.

382
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,954
Not a single one of them.

383
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,040
Later on, all of them turn out
to be the culprits.

384
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:44,957
-Sir.
-Yes.

385
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,876
Ms. Young's probation is over as of today.

386
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,087
Has it already been six months?

387
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,963
Goodness, time does fly.

388
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,215
Congratulations.

389
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,634
Prosecutor Young.

390
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,719
It's thanks to all of you.

391
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,723
Request a DNA analysis
and register it as evidence.

392
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,309
I guess this will be the last time.

393
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,436
Call them and get the suspect's
social security number.

394
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,646
Please track his bank accounts.

395
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,730
The last time?

396
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,734
She's been appointed as a prosecutor
for a criminal trial.

397
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,069
Really?

398
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,153
Congratulations.

399
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,155
The first case is very important.
What did you get?

400
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,158
I have been told not to worry
about economic or political offenders

401
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,536
and start with the criminal cases
that came in today.

402
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,205
What? Then you will start with that guy
who was just here.

403
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,082
Shall I write a report first?

404
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,668
No, you can't.

405
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,338
Pardon?

406
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,381
Do not touch that case.

407
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,091
-I'm stepping out.
-Okay.

408
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,551
Mr. Hwang.

409
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,724
Mr. Hwang, why can't I work on it?

410
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,851
You just can't.

411
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,352
Don't you trust me?

412
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,020
No.

413
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,325
What's wrong? Is it because
of the murder from earlier today?

414
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,578
I heard a man named
Moo-sung Park or whatever died.

415
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,622
I have told you before.

416
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,083
You ended up with the fussiest mentor.

417
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,460
He's so greedy too.

418
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,671
He won't let you handle the case, right?

419
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,716
I actually haven't heard anything
about the case yet.

420
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,467
I guess it's a murder case.

421
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,221
Let's have some tea. Come to my office.

422
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,109
Prosecutor Hwang.

423
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,071
We meet again. I'm Su-chan Kim
from Yongsan Police Station.

424
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,115
-Hello.
-Just a second.

425
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,826
You did that earlier too.
I won't let you do it twice.

426
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,453
Are you here to see me?

427
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,581
Yes. We, police officers, have to write
reports too, you know. So...

428
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,874
Please go on.

429
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,297
You chased him.
How did you know he would be a suspect?

430
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,383
I saw a technician, who was supposed to

431
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,094
repair the victim's TV,
running away near the scene.

432
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,054
Then,

433
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:07,058
how did you know that he was supposed
to come to fix the victim's TV?

434
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,644
I saw that the victim,
an unemployed man in his 50s,

435
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,522
was reading a book he found in his son's
room and thought he must have been bored.

436
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,234
I tried turning on the TV just in case,
and it wasn't working.

437
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,111
Then why did you go there to begin with?

438
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,281
I personally know the victim.

439
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,452
What's your relationship
with the victim, Mr. Moo-sung Park?

440
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,872
I said I know him personally.

441
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,215
What was your first impression
of him like?

442
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,677
Pardon me? His first impression?

443
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,680
He's dead. Why do you ask?

444
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,850
You can call me
if you have additional questions.

445
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,732
-Will you charge the suspect?
-I should.

446
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,526
Sure, you should.

447
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,611
The issue is what he will be charged with.

448
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,703
No. He was already dead when I got there.

449
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,816
Who is it?

450
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,236
You piece of...

451
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,029
You stay right there.

452
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,745
What do you think you are doing? You jerk.

453
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,081
Thank you for cooperating
with my investigation.

454
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,417
I haven't gone out,

455
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,586
so it's been here the whole time,

456
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,630
but it will just have images
of the street.

457
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,757
-You won't find anything.
-I see. Thank you.

458
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,718
It will cost me quite a bit
to buy a new one.

459
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,138
I will give it back right away.
Just a minute, please.

460
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,515
The memory card...

461
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:17,975
My memory card!

462
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,854
Give me back my memory card!
That son of...

463
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,023
Damn it.

464
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,774
Great job today.

465
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,026
Great job.

466
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,624
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

467
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,713
CASE REPORT ON MOO-SUNG PARK MURDER

468
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,022
We received a police report
on the case, so I took a peek at...

469
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:48,857
I apologize.

470
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,748
Will you be able to do it?

471
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,461
Yes, please entrust me with it.

472
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,048
How are you going to win?

473
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,761
Will I have to attend
the trial myself as well?

474
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,223
Of course, you will have to.
Is that even a question?

475
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,276
The evidence is very clear.

476
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,696
The stolen jewelry pieces have been
confirmed to be the victim's mother's.

477
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,364
The bloodstain on the sock

478
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,199
also matches the victim's DNA profile.

479
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,826
Any fingerprints on the weapon?

480
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,079
We have only found
his mother's fingerprints.

481
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,916
The suspect, Jin-seob Kang, is insisting
that he didn't kill the victim.

482
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:52,379
He said he arrived on the scene after
the murder and just stole the jewelry.

483
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,465
He actually received a repair request
from the victim.

484
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,967
It obviously doesn't look
like it was premeditated.

485
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,553
How will you refute his claim?

486
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,057
Even if he received a repair request,

487
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,101
the fact that he broke
into the victim's house must mean

488
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,895
that he had an intention
of committing a crime.

489
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,313
Who says he broke in?

490
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,360
According to the victim's mother,

491
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,737
the victim was alone
on the scene at the time.

492
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,073
They always kept the door locked
because of creditors.

493
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,449
How else do you think he got in?

494
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:24,036
He insists that the real killer
must have let him in on purpose

495
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,162
to frame him for the murder.

496
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,330
That's complete nonsense.

497
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,999
Will you say that
in front of the presiding judge?

498
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,004
Can you please not do that
with your tongue?

499
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,382
I'm sorry.

500
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,760
Can you think of a counterclaim
that can refute everything at one blow?

501
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,431
Conclusive evidence

502
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,934
we can use to prove that the victim
was alive at that time.

503
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,104
Will something like that exist though?

504
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,648
It's not like they have security cameras
inside the house.

505
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,692
What's that?

506
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,740
Where did you get this?

507
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,962
This does show that he didn't
break into the house.

508
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,090
However, this can't serve as evidence
that the victim was still

509
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,049
alive at that time.

510
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,592
Why not?

511
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,387
The suspect's claim that the real killer
let him in on purpose

512
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,722
to dump everything on him
is certainly believable.

513
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,683
You said it's nonsense.

514
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,935
The suspect's attorney
will go on about it.

515
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,603
Right.

516
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,737
Have a look at this.

517
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,793
When you are used to being harassed
by creditors, the first thing you do

518
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,628
when you hear the doorbell is to peep out.

519
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,764
The suspect

520
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,349
is the killer, then.

522
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,061
Mr. Hwang.

523
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,730
Yes, you should get going.

524
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,237
Why? I need it for the trial.
It's crucial evidence.

525
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,280
Tomorrow.

526
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,204
You have to give it to me tomorrow.

527
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,258
In 2 minutes and 35 seconds.

528
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,634
But I didn't do it.

529
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,344
I really didn't do it.

530
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,138
How can anyone with a heart kill someone?

531
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,322
I have stolen things,
but I would never kill anyone!

532
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,049
Yes, this is the criminal division
on the fourth floor.

533
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,717
This is Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang.

534
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,261
I will send a video clip to you now.

535
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,763
Please run an analysis on it.

536
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,974
The analysis must be completed by now.
It's the original file, right?

537
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,375
I heard you are prosecuting
the Huam-dong case.

538
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,794
It must be stressful
to debut with a homicide case.

539
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,463
I know for a fact
that I will win the trial.

540
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,882
What's that?

541
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,552
A key piece of evidence
that will get the suspect.

542
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,554
I just need to get it
on the evidence list.

543
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,557
Eun-soo.

544
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,060
It will be your one and only debut trial,
so you need to make it spectacular.

545
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,689
Shall I help you completely outdo
and beat his attorney?

546
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,987
The evidence list? Why would you want
to list something like this?

547
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,531
You owe me big time for this.

548
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,996
Hey, you should only go there

549
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,999
if you are struggling to catch the culprit
and want to try fishing for something.

550
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,667
-Do you want free food or what?
-Goodness.

551
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,502
It won't even take five minutes.

552
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,296
Yes, sir.

553
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,933
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer, my God, to thee

554
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,645
-Nearer to thee
-Nearer to thee

555
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,776
-Even though it be a cross
-Even though it be a cross

556
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,613
-That raises me
-That raises me

557
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,700
-Still all my song shall be
-Still all my song shall be

558
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:23,246
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer, my God, to thee

559
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,501
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer, my God, to thee

560
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,546
-Nearer to thee
-Nearer to thee

561
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,843
-Amen
-Amen

562
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,527
You don't have to get up.

563
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,126
Thank you.

564
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,758
This is my grandson.

565
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,263
I heard you are serving
in the military now.

566
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,723
It must be tough.

567
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,559
Yes.

568
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,032
Well, I should get going.

TODAY'S TRIALS
COURTROOM 407

571
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,833
I went to the jewelry store

572
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,919
and collected evidence.

573
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,089
Then I confirmed that the jewelry pieces
the suspect stole...

574
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,215
WITNESS STAND

575
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,510
It indeed belonged to the victim's mother.

576
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,136
The fact that he stole something

577
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,931
doesn't mean he killed the victim, right?

578
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,058
But on the scene...

579
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,893
Please answer yes or no.

580
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,062
Does stealing something make you a killer?

581
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,442
-No.
-Thank you.

582
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,278
No more questions, Your Honor.

583
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,656
The witness may go back to her seat.

584
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,620
I think we will win.

00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,788
COUNSEL

586
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,877
PROSECUTOR

587
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,514
-Who is he?
-I think he's a prosecutor.

588
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,816
Just remember what I said, okay?
Everything is there.

589
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,532
Your Honor, I would like to submit
this newly acquired piece of evidence.

590
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,701
We weren't notified of this in advance.

591
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,995
We just finished confirming its validity.

592
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,706
However, it's a very crucial piece
of evidence which will have

593
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,416
a profound effect on this case.

594
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,753
Both parties, please come forward.

595
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,128
Throughout the process of the trial,

596
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,923
the defendant has been denying
the charges, claiming that he arrived

597
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,091
on the scene after the murder.

598
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,428
Your Honor, please watch this video clip.

599
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,682
It's dashboard camera footage

600
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,393
we obtained last night from a vehicle
that was parked nearby.

601
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,603
Last night?

602
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:42,232
This shows the defendant arriving
on the scene on the day of the incident.

603
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,528
Yes, that is me.

604
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,667
While he's waiting for someone

605
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,461
to open the door
after pressing the doorbell...

606
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,505
Right here.

607
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,758
Please look here.

608
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,014
-What happened?
-What is that?

609
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,015
He was definitely killed.

610
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:16,933
As you can see here,

611
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,561
the victim was clearly alive

612
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,938
before the defendant entered the scene.

613
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,482
My goodness, he was alive indeed.

614
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,027
In order to check the possibility
of a third party's involvement,

615
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,321
we went through 12 hours of footage
prior to the estimated time

616
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,656
of the victim's death,

617
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,741
but the defendant

618
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,453
was the only one who was caught
on camera entering the scene.

619
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,416
We couldn't submit it in advance
as we were still checking it.

620
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,251
I apologize.

621
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,465
Defense counsel,
do you have anything to add?

622
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,216
No, no. Please.

623
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,430
-No, Your Honor.
-No. I didn't do it.

624
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,681
No, no! That's a total lie.

625
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,851
It's all fake. I didn't do it.
Please believe me!

626
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,478
-Please be quiet.
-I didn't do it.

627
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,687
I didn't kill him.

628
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,856
That must be fake. Why are you lying?

629
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,816
He was already dead when I got there!

630
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,318
I'm serious. Please believe me.

631
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,278
Your Honor, please tell them. Please.

632
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,822
Jung-eun, I didn't kill him.
I didn't do it!

633
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,283
I really didn't do it.
Why are you doing this to me?

634
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,659
I did not kill him.

635
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,953
I didn't kill him, Your Honor.

636
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,499
It wasn't me.
Why are you all doing this to me?

637
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,833
I did not kill him.

638
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,377
I really didn't kill him, Your Honor.

639
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,838
The defendant is denying clear evidence

640
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,217
and is not showing any interest
in reflecting on what he did.

641
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,513
Therefore, I hereby sentence
the defendant to 22 years in prison.

642
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,520
Ma'am, did you come alone?

643
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,774
Where is your grandson?
Why didn't you come with him?

644
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,445
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second. Yes.

645
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,280
Yes, it's done.

646
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,285
Where? Another one?

647
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,539
No, it's okay. I will go. Sure.

648
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:03,873
Goodness.

649
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,267
By any chance...

650
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,185
Are you...

651
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,610
Yes, Si-mok Hwang. That's right, Si-mok.

652
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,029
It's so nice to run into you like this.

653
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,491
Hey, how long has it been?

654
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,535
About 20 years?

655
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,996
At the time, you suddenly...

656
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,543
Look at you. You have become a prosecutor.

657
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,879
Right, you used to get such good grades.

658
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,716
It looks like you work in this field too.

659
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,927
I just work as an office manager
at a small firm.

660
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,846
-Mr. Kim.
-My apologies.

661
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:01,806
I have to go.

662
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,434
I'm sorry. I will call you.
Let's catch up soon.

663
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,689
Hey, it was really nice running into you.

664
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,448
"Your Honor, I would like to submit
this newly acquired piece of evidence."

665
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,325
You were good.

666
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,369
I'm glad I listened to you
and brought it out at the end.

667
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,579
That's called a skill.

668
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,456
Storytelling is important even at trials.

669
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,168
What, when and how. How will you make
your arguments more impactful?

670
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,253
I will be sure to repay you for your help.

671
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,715
Mr. Hwang.

672
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,889
Are you not capable
of giving compliments or what?

673
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,474
Your mentee won her first case.

674
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,851
How dare he walk away when I'm talking?

675
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,231
Goodness, that piece of...

676
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,069
Mr. Seo helped me a lot

677
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,904
saying that the first trial
is very important.

678
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,864
I had such firm evidence,

679
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,616
so I only got a little bit
of advice from him.

680
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,868
You shouldn't learn those things first.

681
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,162
Isn't winning all that matters?

682
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,956
It's not like I fabricated the evidence,
and I won the case anyway.

683
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:10,833
Anyway.

684
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,478
Jin-seob!

685
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,480
-Jin-seob, my goodness...
-Honey, honey!

686
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:35,108
-Jin-seob, just a second.
-Jung-eun. Honey, honey!

687
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,486
-Wait, just a second.
-Min-jae, Min-jae!

688
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,155
Let go! Let go of me, please.

689
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,573
-Let him see his baby.
-Let go, please.

690
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,867
-Let him see his son just once.
-For just a second, please.

691
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,119
-Honey.
-Jin-seob, Jin-seob.

692
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,287
Honey. Min-jae.

693
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,747
Daddy is so sorry.

694
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,583
Daddy is so sorry.
Daddy is sorry for everything.

695
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,169
-Just a second, please.
-Daddy is so sorry. Just a second!

696
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,004
Honey, Min-jae.

697
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,857
-Honey, Min-jae!
-What should I do now?

698
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,942
-Min-jae!
-Jin-seob!

699
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:20,862
Jin-seob.

700
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,239
What should I do? What am I
supposed to do now, Jin-seob?

701
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,824
Jin-seob.

702
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,827
Jin-seob.

703
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,537
Jin-seob!

704
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,804
I miss him.

705
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,480
He must have been terrified.

706
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,150
It must have been so painful.

707
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,114
I should have stayed by his side.

708
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,492
I want to go with him.

709
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,497
I should have died with him.

710
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,459
Come with me, Si-mok.

711
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,672
ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AWARD
CLASS TWO, GRADE THREE, SI-MOK HWANG

712
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,766
Let's die together.

713
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:34,852
Mommy

714
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:37,563
and you.

715
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,691
Let's just...

716
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,694
Mommy, it's all my fault. Please, Mommy.

717
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,906
I will never do that again, Mommy.

718
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:54,705
I can't do this anymore.

719
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,541
Mommy.

720
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,502
Mommy.

721
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,504
I'm sorry.

722
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,048
I'm sorry, Mommy.

723
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,051
Mommy.

724
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,027
Right.

725
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,863
Was that a friend of yours?

726
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,532
Yes, from middle school.

727
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:31,367
I see.

728
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,250
CASE REPORT ON MOO-SUNG PARK MURDER

729
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,339
They say that
the rich never go flat broke.

730
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,383
She has clearly been holding
onto her jewelry.

731
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,760
It will obviously tempt thieves.

732
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,014
Those were the only pieces she had left
after selling everything.

733
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,307
How heartbreaking.

734
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,685
Why did you go there that day?

735
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,440
Are you asking me that question just now?

736
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,528
Tell me.

737
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,409
The victim, Moo-sung Park,
used all of his connections

738
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:14,911
in order to avoid bankruptcy.

739
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,330
Soon enough, he realized

740
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:20,499
that his connections which he built
with money vanished along with his money.

741
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,335
He must have been convinced

742
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,421
that he'd be able to rise up again
if he could avoid embezzlement charges.

743
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,923
That arrogance is the reason he failed.

744
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,176
How dare he think of us prosecutors
as a safety net to fall back on?

745
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,513
Don't you think
he had a reason to think that?

746
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:37,725
What's your conclusion?

747
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,314
This is my conclusion.

748
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,777
A simple robbery murder
committed by a third party.

749
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,782
A third party.

750
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,577
It sounds like you think
there is a second party involved as well.

751
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:01,374
Something that could completely ruin
someone's life if he revealed it.

752
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,917
Go tell the deputy chief prosecutor.

753
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:06,128
If I open my mouth, he might get
buried alive in a matter of seconds.

754
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,217
Someone was being threatened.

755
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,428
Mr. Park,
who failed to reap what he sowed,

756
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,555
threatened someone that he would

757
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:20,017
disclose all the evidence of the bribes
and entertainment he had been providing.

758
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,316
Did you want to destroy that second party?

759
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,568
Is that why you joined hands
with Mr. Park?

760
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,571
To oust all of your corrupt colleagues?

761
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,700
I mean, you think you are the only one
with integrity.

762
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,161
What's rotten can be cut out.

763
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,455
But the same spot ends up rotting again

764
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,499
no matter how many times we cut it out.

765
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,877
I have been witnessing it every single day
for the last eight years.

766
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,631
No organization in this country
would be willing

767
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,175
to cut off its right arm with a knife
in its left hand.

768
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,511
Only those who were hopeful get hurt.

769
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,140
You are saying that's why Mr. Park died.

770
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:03,269
The person whom he was threatening
hired the ex-convict to kill him.

771
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,442
Si-mok, I'm disappointed.

772
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,819
You used to be pretty bright
back in the days.

773
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,447
Breaking a TV at someone's house

774
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,199
and finding a repair technician
who is an ex-convict.

775
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,453
That person isn't that clumsy.

776
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,373
Then what would that person do?

777
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,377
Jin-seob Kang's claim
that Mr. Park was already dead...

778
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,755
I thought it could be true.

779
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,174
The real killer could be someone else.

780
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:35,342
After killing Mr. Park,

781
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,054
the killer might have tried
to get rid of all the evidence.

782
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,389
He probably went through
every nook and cranny in the house,

783
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,350
so the jewelry might have naturally
ended up on the floor.

784
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,228
But the person who killed
that hypothesis is you.

785
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,356
Yes, that's correct.

786
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,824
Nicely done.

787
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:00,868
You sure are capable.

788
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:05,956
You must be upset.

789
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,251
Go get a soothing bowl
of soup for yourself.

790
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,936
Thank you.

791
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:33,609
Mr. Park told me himself.

792
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,614
That he joined hands with you.

793
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,493
He said you are ruthless and heartless,

794
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:45,287
so I'd better help him with his problem
before you do anything.

795
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,166
Si-mok,

796
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,544
don't get the wrong idea.

797
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,045
He didn't trust you.

798
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,881
He wanted to show me.

799
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,886
But you still asked me
why I went there that day.

800
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,473
Isn't it because you are curious
about how much I know?

801
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,144
The thing Mr. Park threatened you with.

802
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,605
The thing that can bury you alive
in a matter of seconds.

803
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:14,024
What that thing is

804
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:16,944
and whether I know it or not.

805
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:21,448
So?

806
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,955
I will go enjoy that bowl of soup.

807
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,668
Is this neighborhood cursed or what?

808
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:20,633
Goodness, poor thing.

809
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,760
It looks like it happened a while ago.

810
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,095
I feel so bad for Happy, but...

811
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:29,225
We thought Happy ran away from home, but

812
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,101
look at what happened.

813
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,937
Someone might have killed him
because he barked.

814
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,188
What if it was a thief's doing?

815
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:35,689
A thief?

816
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,066
Is anything missing?

817
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,192
Did anyone get hurt?

818
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:39,526
I'm not saying we had a thief.

819
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,028
A few months ago...

820
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,030
Do you see that house over there?

821
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:44,698
Someone died there.

822
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,243
Come to think of it,

823
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,495
I think Happy disappeared that day.

824
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,253
Hold on. Just a minute, please.

825
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,507
Goodness, what kind of scum did this?

826
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,843
This tiny dog couldn't possibly
have barked that loudly.

827
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:09,223
Goodness, we had no idea
and just assumed that he ran away.

828
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,685
My poor Happy.

829
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,835
So? Do you want to get it analyzed?

830
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,047
Just in case, you know.
I just want to make sure.

831
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,258
Give it to me. I'm on my way
to the National Forensic Service now.

832
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:27,676
It's okay. I will go.

833
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:31,055
I'm going there anyway,
but you can go if you want.

834
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,058
Well, all right.

835
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:36,769
Please take it to them.

836
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:38,479
Thank you.

837
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:59,249
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

838
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,528
Yes, please locate Jin-seob Kang's
whereabouts immediately.

839
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,196
He cannot be left alone.

840
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,366
This is so unfair.

841
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,494
Being wrongly accused like this
is driving me crazy.

842
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:19,580
I did not kill him.

843
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:21,665
It's all a lie.

844
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,625
It's nothing but a big fraud.

845
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,712
I'm innocent.

846
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:30,632
No one else might know the truth,
but I do.

847
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:32,843
I did not kill anyone.

848
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:38,056
The prosecutor altered the evidence

849
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,726
and turned me into a murderer.

850
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,896
I shouted to the point
that my throat bled,

851
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:46,648
but no one even listened to me

852
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,444
because I have no power,
connections or money.

853
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,086
Why do I have to be locked up

854
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,172
for the rest of my life
for something I didn't even do?

855
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,884
Why does my son have
to become a murderer's child?

856
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:18,847
I can't even die in peace
because of my child who will be

857
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,475
belittled and bullied all his life.

858
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,282
That prosecutor who treated me
like a worthless animal.

859
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,662
Inmate 36085!

860
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:49,920
I would like to report that prosecutor
who disgraced and tortured me

861
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,005
through my death.

862
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,466
I plead my innocence through my death.

863
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:55,968
I...

864
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:58,762
I did not kill him.

865
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,821
STRANGER

866
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,532
You killed him. You killed Jin-seob!

867
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,450
What made him so convinced?

868
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,995
That wouldn't have been
captured if the angle was a little off.

Are you sure you don't want
to hear about what I've found out?

870
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,666
Now, it's your turn.
What have you found out?

871
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,793
The prosecutors fabricated
the evidence, right?

872
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:31,169
Anyhow, have you found anything yet?

873
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,213
I'll find her soon.
Please give me more time.

874
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,173
Do you now realize what you have done?

875
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,927
-Where did you find the bloodstain?
-Jin-seob Kang didn't even go there.

876
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,679
Someone else must've left
the bloodstain there.

877
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,973
-The culprit is someone else.
-Who are you?
