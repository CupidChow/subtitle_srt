1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,087
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,635
There are 3,400 intelligence police
officers in this small country.

4
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,431
And intel they gather every day
all goes to Choi Bit.

5
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,308
This February,

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,144
Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency
apprehended a drug dealer.

7
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,855
Could Assemblyman Nam's son
have been one of them?

8
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,816
So you probably weren't aware of

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,819
how the Police HQ would deal
with an assemblyman

10
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,905
suspected of bribery for illegal hiring.

11
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,406
You said you didn't look inside.

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,992
You knew I'd look.

13
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,203
Why did you drag me into this?

14
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,205
You said it's an investment.

15
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,831
Then it has to be profitable.

16
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,125
I want you to treat me as an entrepreneur.

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,294
What about Seo Dong-jae?

18
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,755
He's looking for a former officer
from Segok Police Station.

19
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,633
He believes he could be the prime suspect,
and not the Captain.

20
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,260
There's nothing else.
This is all we could find.

21
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,721
Captain. You know,
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

22
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,017
SEO DONG-JAE
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

23
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,857
EPISODE 7

24
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,685
It's over, so just let it go.

25
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,897
Nam Jae-ik has been bashed,
and his son quit his job at the bank.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,441
Why do you have to dig it up again?

27
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,319
-Why does there have to be a reason?
-Hey.

28
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,197
"The goal line has to be fair
so that those who work hard can catch up

29
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,116
even if the starting line isn't the same."

30
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,034
That's what Assemblyman Nam said

31
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,662
when he made a pledge
to secure enough jobs for young people.

32
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,832
But he used his influence
to get his son a job at the bank.

33
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,501
And that year alone,
2,800 people applied for a job there.

34
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,546
The bank was hiring for 15 positions,
and 2,800 people applied.

35
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,673
That still wouldn't have changed anything

36
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,300
for those who didn't get hired.

37
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,386
Will you say the same thing
if someone who failed the bar exam

38
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,680
becomes a prosecutor
because his father is an assemblyman?

39
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,808
It's not "over."
Everyone is just keeping quiet about it.

40
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,561
This will also affect your boss,
Chief Woo.

41
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,149
My boss? I don't operate like that.

42
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,364
I guess you're not expecting
anything from me either.

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,541
Even a politician who abused his power
to get his brother hired

44
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,587
as a non-executive director
was never prosecuted.

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,298
Instead, he sued the prosecutor in charge
for defamation,

46
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,592
violation of the Protection of
Communications Secrets Act,

47
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,844
and divulgence of official secrets.

48
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,933
But do you know what was brought up
at the prosecution's council meeting?

49
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,144
That they should perhaps reprimand
the prosecutor who was sued.

50
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,855
It won't be different for you.

51
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,440
You can't handle this.

52
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,026
Don't reach out to me for help later on.

53
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,404
I gave up on that
when you asked me to come see you.

54
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,489
Hey!

55
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,622
You're old enough now.

56
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,041
And with all your experience,
you really should know better.

57
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,627
Why do you have to be so stubborn
and bother those around you?

58
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,671
Is this fun for you?

59
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,261
I guess I've been bothering you.

60
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,684
-Did you feel the same way in the past?
-Back then…

61
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,605
We're in a different position now.
Both of us.

62
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,483
I'll probably never

63
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,236
understand the things

64
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,655
that I should know by a certain age.

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,618
You see, I don't enjoy this either.

66
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,496
Then don't do it. Just don't go that way.

67
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,296
You should get going.

68
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,457
Then don't do it. Just don't go that way.

69
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,670
I'll probably never understand the things

70
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,590
that I should know by a certain age.

71
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,037
Thanks.

72
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,794
You asked me to treat you
as an entrepreneur.

73
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,005
You told me to choose
what would benefit me more.

74
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,758
That's all this is about.
It's not about you.

PERSONAL INFORMATION RECORD
NAME: CHOI BIT

79
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,218
Good morning, sir.

80
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,053
Hey. What's with that guy?

81
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,139
Is Seo Dong-jae always like that?

82
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,557
He pestered me for a meeting

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,684
so I made time for him,
but he stood me up.

84
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,311
He didn't show up?

85
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,189
No. And I couldn't get a hold of him.
He didn't even answer my calls.

86
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,524
Unbelievable.

87
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,321
Who's calling so early?

88
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,032
Hello?

89
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,202
Detective Jang Geon?

90
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,413
It's me, Woo Tae-ha.

91
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,582
You didn't know this was my number?

92
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,542
Seo Dong-jae?

93
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,337
Yes, I spoke to him on the phone
yesterday. Why are you asking me?

94
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,925
What do you mean?

95
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,470
How could…

96
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,682
Are you sure he's missing?

97
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,021
-Hi.
-Are you busy?

98
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,607
The next meeting has been scheduled.

99
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,443
Hold on. I'm on the other line.
I'll call you back.

100
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,111
Sorry, I caught you at a bad time.

101
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,655
No, Prosecutor Seo has gone missing.
I'll call you back.

102
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,240
What?

103
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,383
Maybe it's not the Prosecutor Seo I know.

104
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,304
I have a meeting,

105
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,264
so don't call me before 3 p.m.

106
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,017
-Yes, ma'am!
-Have a good meeting.

107
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,066
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE
REFORMATION UNIT

108
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,370
What the hell has he been up to?

109
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,622
Sir, you know everything that I know.

110
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,374
I've told you everything.

111
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,085
Then where is he? It's not like
he'd get lost. He's not a kid.

112
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,674
I never thought you'd actually
put in a word for me.

113
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,217
Yes, I spoke to him on
the phone yesterday.

114
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,512
You said you were supposed to see him.
What was it about?

115
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,397
I probably drink more coffee
than anyone else in Korea.

116
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,815
-Hello, sir
-Good morning, sir.

117
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,071
Hey, what's going on?

118
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,247
Didn't you notice anything unusual?

119
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,331
No, nothing.

120
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,417
Did he ever mention anything
about receiving threats

121
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,252
or having specific concerns?

122
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,714
-No, sir.
-Could it be because of one of his cases?

123
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,090
He's in the criminal division,

124
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,260
so I'm sure he has to deal with
all sorts of con men and hoodlums.

125
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,804
Why were you trying
to meet Prosecutor Seo?

126
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,848
I told you already.
He begged me to see him.

127
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,975
No, sir. This time,
you reached out to him first.

128
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,935
-What was it about?
-Hey.

129
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,812
Are you interrogating me?

130
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,107
If that were the case,
I'd first try to verify your claim

131
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,943
that you never saw him last night.
What was it about, sir?

132
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,740
-You know something, don't you?
-Me?

133
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,992
Your colleague that you've been
investigating with until yesterday

134
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,952
has disappeared,
leaving behind a single bloodstain.

135
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,078
But you don't seem worried.

136
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,663
You'd be more worried for some dog.

137
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,124
You can't react like this
unless you already knew about it.

138
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,168
Did you two plan this together?

139
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,587
What time and where
were you two supposed to meet?

140
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,005
Seriously?

141
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,300
At ten o'clock, near Yeouido.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,261
I have you two keep me
in the loop on different stuff.

143
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,221
Did you think I'd only listen to you?

144
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,683
I'm sure you called him multiple times
around 10 p.m. when he didn't show up.

145
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,518
Did he not answer? Or was his phone off?

146
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,234
His phone was off
from when I first called him.

147
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,404
As you've mentioned,

148
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,365
the Uijeongbu office could be
where it all began.

149
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,993
It may have nothing to do with him
investigating the Segok case.

150
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,206
Go to the Uijeongbu office immediately.

151
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,042
But I do not have the authority
to pry into their cases, sir.

152
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,045
You said the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
doesn't investigate any cases.

153
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,381
Jeez, seriously. Can you just do as I say?

154
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,924
Yes, sir.

155
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,306
Is the deputy prosecutor general in?

156
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,433
Let him know

157
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,560
that something's happened
to a district prosecutor

158
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,437
and it looks like we should oversee it.

159
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,651
Find someone better suited for the job.
Why have Prosecutor Hwang handle it?

160
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,568
What?

161
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,950
Sir, may I come up to see you now?

162
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,745
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE

163
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,705
Captain Baek accepted the bribes too.

164
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,749
I checked with the business owners myself.

165
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,629
Officer Kim's uncle is the former chief
of Dongducheon Police Station.

166
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,797
We must get him first.

167
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,925
Just wait and see
who finds him first, okay?

168
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,844
This is Hwang Si-mok.
We met the other day.

169
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,761
I'm on my way to…

170
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,765
Yes, I heard. I'm on my way there now.

171
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,977
I'll need a list of all the cases
Prosecutor Seo has worked on this year

172
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,354
as well as all the files
on Segok Police Station.

173
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,356
Make sure I can get into
his computer right away.

174
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,319
DETECTIVE JANG GEON

175
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,949
Hello, Detective Jang.
It's me, Hwang Si-mok.

176
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,243
Please send all information

177
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,371
regarding Prosecutor Seo's disappearance
to the Criminal Legislation Division.

178
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,249
Yes, we'll be taking the case.

179
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,127
Everything you've found out so far.

180
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,045
Okay.

181
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,885
When a married couple who owns a pub
in the area came home after midnight,

182
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,303
the car was parked there.

183
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,556
Who parked their car like this
in front of our house?

184
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,141
Isn't there a phone number up front?

185
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,477
I don't see it at the back either.

186
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,522
Honey.

187
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,649
What is it?

188
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,701
We have to check
if it's your husband's blood.

189
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,661
We don't have any other samples
to check against.

190
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,749
I brought my husband's stuff.

191
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,542
You could've used those instead.

192
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,586
My son must be scared.

193
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,923
Maybe she's hardened
because she's a prosecutor's wife.

194
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,758
Her husband had gone missing,

195
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,635
but she seemed more worried about her son.

196
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,303
-Anything out of the ordinary?
-No.

197
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,555
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.

198
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,977
But he usually kept to himself
according to his colleagues.

199
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,729
Geon, we got his call logs.

200
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,064
Okay.

201
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,862
CALL HISTORY

202
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,455
Hello, I'm calling
from Yongsan Police Station.

203
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,332
I wanted to ask you a few questions.

204
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,875
You know Mr. Seo Dong-jae, right?

205
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,920
-Yesterday--
-Detective Jang Geon?

206
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,631
Yes, that's me.

207
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,427
-Who is this?
-It's me, Woo Tae-ha.

208
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
Chief Woo?

209
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,185
The number on the top of the call history
belonged to Chief Woo.

210
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,771
Right, Woo Tae-ha from the council.

211
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,606
Yes, the one who acts all serious.

212
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,110
-Prosecutor Seo stood him up last night.
-Yes, Seo Dong-jae.

213
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,153
-Didn't you speak with him yesterday?
-At 10 p.m.

214
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,114
Hold on a second.

215
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,241
This is Yongsan Police Station.

216
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,076
Yes, speaking.

217
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,580
You got the results?
Is it Seo Dong-jae's blood?

218
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,083
Senior Inspector Han, the analysis shows
that it is Prosecutor Seo's blood.

219
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,961
You have photos of the scene, right?
Can I see them?

220
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,800
The thing is, you're technically
not on the team anymore, but…

221
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,510
I'll have them photocopied for you.

222
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,304
Thank you. I'll head over there now.

223
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,392
I said I don't know anything.

224
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,519
I didn't see anything.
Stop ringing the doorbell.

225
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,146
I just managed to put my kid to sleep.

226
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,592
MOMO MARKET

227
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,903
His blood was found at the scene,
which means it started here.

228
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,658
Maybe it happened elsewhere,
and this is just like a cover-up spot?

229
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,953
Would he still be in this area?

230
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,038
But there were no drag marks.

231
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457
Did they use something to carry him?

232
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,169
Maybe they carried him with an accomplice.

233
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,296
Considering his physique,

234
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,465
it wouldn't have been easy
to carry him alone.

235
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,427
Would the culprit still be in the area
or did he already run away?

236
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,389
Jeez, we couldn't even find
a single strand of hair.

237
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,599
In a way, that's a good thing.

238
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,559
If it was murder,
we would have found his body somewhere.

239
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,978
But nothing's turned up yet.

240
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,773
Right, but the fact
that his phone was turned off…

241
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,902
-What time did that happen?
-At 8:50 p.m.

242
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,655
He left the office just before seven,

243
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,825
so it took an hour and 50 minutes until
the phone was turned off in Bogwang-dong.

244
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,580
He was supposed to meet a prosecutor from
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office at ten.

245
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,040
What was he doing in this area?

246
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,420
Gosh,
talk about taking a shot in the dark.

247
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,923
It's not like we can get warrants
to all the houses in the area.

248
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,803
Hey, let's head out.

249
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,014
We have nothing else to rely on
but the scene.

250
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,559
Sun-chang, track his car and find out
his exact route from Uijeongbu.

251
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,685
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,146
Damn it.

253
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,980
CALL HISTORY

254
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,280
This is the overpass. And Uijeongbu…

255
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,074
-Hey, Sun-chang.
-Oh, hello.

256
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,076
Which one is Prosecutor Seo's car?
This one?

257
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,327
This is…

258
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,038
Wait. Does this mean you're back?

259
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,374
If you see here…

260
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,253
I've tracked his car from Uijeongbu
District Prosecutors' Office to here.

261
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,755
After this, I have no idea.

262
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,508
What about the area
where the vehicle was found?

263
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,842
I'm going to look into it now.

264
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,262
From the main road, there are
three alleyways that lead to the scene.

265
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,931
But there are no CCTV cameras.

266
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,516
Damn it.

267
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,353
CHIEF CHOI BIT

268
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,813
What? It's already three o'clock?

269
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,690
Yes, Chief.

270
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,859
Right. Now?

271
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,862
Give me five minutes…
No, I'll be there in ten.

272
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,863
Bye.

273
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,076
-Could we check the area near the scene?
-Sure.

274
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,160
Where Bogwang-dong begins.

275
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,456
UIJEONGBU DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

276
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,503
Prosecutor Hwang Si-mok, right?

277
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,713
Hello, I'm Jung Min-ha
from Criminal Division 1.

278
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,340
I got a call from the Supreme Office.

279
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,472
Our chief prosecutor is deeply concerned.

280
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,225
-First, you should meet--
-No, later.

281
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,520
What was the last thing Prosecutor Seo did
before leaving the office yesterday?

282
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,647
"You're so freaking annoying.

283
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,358
Are you proud
that your family is on welfare?

284
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,195
You're making it so obvious
that your family is dirt-poor."

285
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,781
That was just a joke.

286
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,201
Then what about locking him
in the girls' restroom naked?

287
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,120
Would he also think of it as a joke?

288
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,830
But all the other kids did it too.

289
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,750
If all the others did it too,
why are you the only one who's here now?

290
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,463
Do you really think it's okay
to do these things to another human being?

291
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,175
You told everyone
that his family is on welfare

292
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,552
and that they live
in a community housing building.

293
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,055
But he does live
in a community housing building.

294
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,313
Anyway, I'm too young to be prosecuted.
When can I leave?

295
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,772
What?

296
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,025
Do you want to go home?

297
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,860
No, I have to go to the academy.

298
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,739
Who told you that you're too young
to be prosecuted? Your parents?

299
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,199
I learned it at the law camp.

300
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,243
They said anyone under the age of 14
cannot be prosecuted.

301
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,206
Look at this.

302
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,044
This boy is half your size,
yet you beat him up for 50 minutes.

303
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,963
Let me ask you one thing.

304
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,049
Did you enjoy beating him up?

305
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,719
Do you really enjoy feeling someone else's
flesh against your fist and shoes

306
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,346
and watching that person in pain?

307
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,017
He's a total idiot, though.

308
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,393
What?

309
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,437
What about you?

310
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,105
-Pardon?
-What?

311
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:35,817
Fine.

312
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,529
Leave. Go to your academy.

313
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,117
But let me teach you one thing
before you leave.

314
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,787
The court can order protective detention
for kids like you.

315
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,039
You may be put on probation or be ordered

316
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,667
to attend lectures, do community service,
or go to the juvie.

317
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,544
If the judge thinks
you should be sent to the juvie,

318
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,421
you'll end up there.

319
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,966
Can I attend the lecture then?

320
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,138
That's only up to 100 hours, isn't it?

321
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,224
I guess I'm right.

322
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,408
I keep seeing more kids like him
these days.

323
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,119
Jeez. Now I'm afraid to
send my boy to school.

324
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,414
Oh, right.
Did you find out where he lives?

325
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,375
Well, I did find an address
registered under the name Kim Su-hang--

326
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,211
I have the address. I told you
that he doesn't seem to live there.

327
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,088
Right, that's why I'm still looking.

328
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,965
Forget it. I'll ask myself.

329
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,637
I have to leave. I have an appointment.

330
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,848
-Okay.
-Have a good evening.

331
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,266
What a rude little punk.

332
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,186
That's what he did
right before leaving the office.

333
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,732
Who was he going to ask
about Kim Su-hang's address?

334
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,067
He didn't tell us.

335
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,194
What time did he leave the office?

336
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,448
Just before 7 p.m.

337
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,661
Oh, I contacted our IT department
right after you called.

338
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,748
But it's taking a while
because we don't know his password.

339
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,086
All these reports on Segok were written
by Prosecutor Seo's predecessor.

340
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,505
Are there any new ones
written after he took on the case?

341
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,551
Technically, we can't really say
he took on the case

342
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,304
because it's not like
we officially reopened the case.

343
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:31,391
When our chief prosecutor heard about him
looking into the suicide case again,

344
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,437
he said we shouldn't tell the police
anything until we find concrete evidence.

345
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,148
That's why we didn't say anything
about the Segok case

346
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,692
to the officer from Yongsan Police Station
who was here earlier.

347
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,113
Do you think Prosecutor Seo went missing
because of that case?

348
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,949
If you have any other suspicions,
please tell me.

349
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,369
No, that's not what I meant.

350
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,625
-Oh, it worked? You got in?
-Yes.

351
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,335
-You got in?
-Yes, you can use it now.

352
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,295
-Thank you very much.
-No problem.

353
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,304
KOREA INFORMATION SYSTEM
OF CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SERVICES

354
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,598
Most of these are pages on KICS.

355
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,184
They're all for the cases he's working on.
Other than these…

356
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,770
What's this?
Did he watch a video or something?

357
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,396
Yes, this was yesterday afternoon.

358
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,276
YONGSAN STATION UNIT 3 CAPTAIN

359
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,238
-Hello?
-This is Choi Yun-soo from Yongsan.

360
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,449
-Do you have a moment to talk?
-Yes.

361
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,911
I just got a call
from one of the detectives on my team.

362
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,539
He said one of the numbers
on Prosecutor Seo's call history

363
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,416
-seems to be yours.
-I don't know who that is.

364
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,754
Do you happen to remember
what you two spoke about?

365
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,217
Hello?

366
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,886
Hello?

367
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,474
I asked you to send all the case files
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

368
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,143
Have you sent them over yet?

369
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,357
Well, no one on the team is
in the office at the moment.

370
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,442
I'll send them over as soon as I'm back.

371
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,653
No need. I'll just go
to Yongsan Police Station myself.

372
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,197
What? You're going to stop by?

373
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,866
Yes, I'll see you there.

374
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,413
Please check every web page he accessed
until the moment he left the office.

375
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,081
Look through the cookies as well.

376
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,167
I'll go over those when I come back.

377
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,211
Also, I want information
on the six officers from Segok

378
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,921
who were charged with bribery.

379
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:25,922
And find out if anyone

380
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,258
around Prosecutor Seo
has any relation to the scene.

381
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,469
It's Bogwang-dong in Yongsan. A relative
who used to live there for example.

382
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,682
I heard Sergeant Baek
has been on vacation the past few days.

383
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,187
Summon him.

384
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,567
Are you going to request a warrant?

385
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,278
-What kind of warrant?
-A search warrant.

386
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,864
They think Prosecutor Seo was moved
from the scene in a car.

387
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,074
We should conduct
a search and seizure to see

388
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,743
if a Segok officer is connected to it.

389
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,203
Go through all the dashcam footage

390
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,456
or see if we can find his DNA
in Sergeant Baek's car.

391
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,291
But we haven't pinned down a suspect yet.

392
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,043
Right. I mean, to do that.

393
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,796
We can request one, but I doubt
the court will issue the warrant.

394
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,383
They'll say they do not see
why a search and seizure is necessary.

395
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,469
But a prosecutor has gone missing.

396
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,638
Won't the court take that
into consideration?

397
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,725
Let's say a cop went missing
while investigating a prosecutor.

398
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,061
And the police are asking us to get them

399
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,521
a search and seizure warrant
for that prosecutor.

400
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,858
Do you think you'll request a warrant
when there's insufficient evidence?

401
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,736
I'll ask for additional evidence.

402
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,702
Is the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
only taking the Segok case?

403
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,455
Or does it also include
looking for Prosecutor Seo?

404
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,373
I'd say both.

405
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,918
I'm relieved
that we don't have to investigate this.

406
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:47,963
Are you swamped?

407
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,507
No, that's not what I meant.

408
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,883
If we were to take it on,

409
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,761
Dongducheon Police Station would end up
investigating the case.

410
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,305
As you know,
Segok Police Station is their substation.

411
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,141
That would be like having the fox
guard the hen house.

412
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,687
Even if we transfer the case
to a different precinct,

413
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,023
it won't be any different because
they're the same organization after all.

414
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,984
We'll figure out
which precinct should handle it.

415
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,528
Prosecutor Seo trained me.

416
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,738
I spent my probation period in his office.

417
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,283
Me too.

418
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,467
Hey, what's up?

419
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,511
Captain, I think we've found the weapon.

420
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,806
What is it? Where did you find it?

421
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,144
I clearly remember seeing four of them
when I was heading out yesterday morning.

422
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,895
I didn't notice it last night,

423
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,857
but I've realized
that there are only three now.

424
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,567
The actual weapon hasn't turned up,

425
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,569
but it may be one of the bricks
from the scene.

426
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,070
Any chance you're just confused?

427
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,406
I move these everyday
after my husband drives off.

428
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,615
How could I be confused?

429
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,578
There were always four of them,
but one is missing now.

430
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,622
I suppose he was struck with a brick.

431
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,249
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE
REFORMATION UNIT

432
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,635
You look as if you were caught
while slacking off.

433
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,180
-Did you go somewhere far again?
-May I have a word with you?

434
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,406
-Chief.
-Is it a kidnapping?

435
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,283
It seems like it.

436
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,161
-And he was attacked?
-Yes.

437
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,998
The blood found at the scene
belongs to the owner of the vehicle.

438
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,006
CALL HISTORY

439
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,059
It's a crazy world, you know.

440
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,312
Some lunatic can randomly chase you
for no reason.

441
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,147
Right.

442
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,732
And people get mugged.

443
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,820
It doesn't matter if he's a prosecutor.

444
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,740
But it's unlikely, right?

445
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,159
You never know.

446
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,872
What if the prosecution orchestrated it
to trap us?

447
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,795
It's far-fetched, right?

448
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,175
-Ms. Han.
-Yes, ma'am.

449
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,262
I want you to prove
that the police have nothing to do

450
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,556
with Sergeant Song's death
and this disappearance case.

451
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,684
I hope it's unrelated,
but what if that isn't the case?

452
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,770
-If we catch them--
-I'm not asking you to catch anyone.

453
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,689
I don't expect you to find the
missing man.

454
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,607
That's the detectives' job. You'll--

455
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,193
Hold on.

456
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,071
Hello?

457
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,699
Yes, sir.

458
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,246
Why postpone the council meeting?
It's already been scheduled.

459
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,417
What does a missing prosecutor
have to do with the council meeting?

460
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,711
Is that what Chief Woo said?

461
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,965
I'll tell them we should stick
to the schedule and can't postpone it.

462
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,092
Yes, sir.

463
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,930
What a lame excuse.
He's trying to wiggle out of it.

464
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,642
We can't do what we did last time even if
things don't turn out in our favor.

465
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,603
What "last time"?

466
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,981
Even if Segok had something to do
with Prosecutor Seo's disappearance,

467
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,984
we can't wait until the meeting is over
to catch the culprit

468
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,904
or put off the investigation until after
we gain investigative authority.

469
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,822
Ms. Han.

470
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,786
If I ever talk such bullshit,

471
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,871
just go ahead and report me.

472
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,124
People who mess with things
that could cost lives

473
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,043
don't deserve to be treated with respect.

474
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,463
I'm sorry, ma'am.

475
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,381
Find out the truth.

476
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,383
Yes, ma'am.

477
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,650
Chief Woo, it's me.

478
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,944
I heard you wanted to postpone the meeting

479
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,571
because of a missing prosecutor. That's…

480
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,789
When?

481
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,663
Prosecutor Hwang!

482
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,500
Hello. It's been a while
since we last met.

483
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,795
-Right.
-I heard you were back in Seoul.

484
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,338
It's too bad we're meeting like this.

485
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,593
I hope nothing will happen this time.

486
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,553
Could it…

487
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,431
It won't happen again, right?

488
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,600
Right.

489
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,199
I sent Prosecutor Seo's computer records
to your email address.

490
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,285
My goodness.

491
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,413
Oh, right. Coffee.

492
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,539
It's fine.

493
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,084
You haven't come here in a while, though.

494
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,252
Anyway…

495
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,466
This is all the info we gathered so far.

496
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,260
We're interviewing the residents there
individually right now

497
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,638
to see if anyone's connected to
Prosecutor Seo.

498
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,110
The culprit would have had his car keys.

499
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,239
If they lived in the neighborhood,
they would've gotten rid of the car first.

500
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,116
If the car hadn't been found,

501
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,410
the neighborhood wouldn't have
been involved.

502
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,704
I guess so.

503
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,665
But this neighborhood

504
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,751
has the least security cameras
within our jurisdiction.

505
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,796
They haven't been installed since
there were rumors of redevelopment.

506
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,548
There's been reports of thefts in the area
a few months ago,

507
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,550
but it was tough
since there were no cameras.

508
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,470
If they chose that place intentionally,

509
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,597
they must know the neighborhood.

510
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,933
But more importantly…

511
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,852
"More importantly"?
Is there something else?

512
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,690
No, it's just that
we can't find any clues.

513
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,235
We need to find the missing person,
but all we can do is search the scene.

514
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,988
So…

515
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,199
I called you

516
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,828
because your number

517
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,664
was on his call history.

518
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,293
PROSECUTOR WOO TAE-HA

519
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,088
What time and where
were you two supposed to meet?

520
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,716
At ten o'clock, near Yeouido.

521
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,594
The phone you have called
is currently turned off.

522
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,846
-You will be directed to voicemail…
-Jeez.

523
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,223
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE

524
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,561
Prosecutor Seo and I discussed matters

525
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,646
regarding the Uijeongbu District
Prosecutors' Office.

526
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,314
What kind of things?

527
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,151
Things related to adjusting
investigative rights.

528
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,196
I see.

529
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,034
Did he bring up anything unusual?

530
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,119
Or perhaps he acted strangely?

531
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,209
He said it was tough
being transferred too often

532
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,628
and that he doesn't get to spend time
with his kids.

533
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,756
Things like that.

534
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,180
What's this?

535
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,098
Tongyeong?

536
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,268
Oh, that? Well, two university students
drowned in Tongyeong

537
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,353
at the beginning of March.

538
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,938
I know. I was stationed there.

539
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,440
Oh, right.

540
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,192
He's the student that survived.

541
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,569
One of the three students
who were at the beach.

542
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,905
And Prosecutor Seo called him?

543
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,157
According to him,

544
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,035
it wasn't the first time
that Prosecutor Seo called him.

545
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,163
He said that at first, he thought,

546
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,999
"I feel so bad that my friends drowned.

547
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,460
I'll never drink again."

548
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,214
Then he heard that some people had
gotten rid of the restriction line

549
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,509
and that they were released because of
special treatment in the prosecution.

550
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,513
So he realized it wasn't just an accident
and that his friends were victims.

551
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:03,226
A prosecutor from the Uijeongbu District
Prosecutors' Office suddenly called me

552
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,936
and talked about the incident,

553
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,648
so I first thought he was
just trying to offer me help.

554
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,358
When did he first call you?

555
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,444
It was around the time there was news

556
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,197
about the prosecution not doing
their work properly.

557
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,118
But he just kept talking nonsense
as our conversation carried on.

558
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,702
What nonsense?

559
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,580
He made excuses, saying that
it wasn't the prosecution's fault

560
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,290
that his friends died,

561
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,585
and then asked if an officer
named Choi Bit visited him.

562
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,633
So you're saying Prosecutor Seo
called him just to say that?

563
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,009
Wasn't there anything else?

564
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,225
Well…

565
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,977
Why would a prosecutor say that to a kid?

566
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,729
He wasn't trying to sue
the prosecution or anything.

567
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,690
The kid wasn't the only one he called.

568
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,152
He even called one of the victims' fathers

569
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,071
and asked if Choi Bit said anything bad

570
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,158
about the prosecution during her visit.

571
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,452
He even asked if she pressured him
into doing an interview,

572
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,538
and stuff like that.

573
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,833
I checked his call history
and he did call the victim's house.

574
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,503
Jeez. He was probably trying
to dig up dirt on Chief Choi.

575
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,799
He called the house of one of the victims
and said the same thing.

576
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,801
-He called the victim's family too?
-Yes.

577
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:24,432
Hang on.
I'm sure it's on his call history too.

578
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,562
Anyway, the survivor from the Tongyeong
incident said he remembered

579
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,274
deciding never to answer
Prosecutor Seo's calls again.

580
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,443
He hesitated a bit
before answering his call yesterday,

581
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,945
and Prosecutor Seo
said the same thing again.

582
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,072
So he just hung up after a while.

583
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,499
CALL TIME
2 MINUTES 21 SECONDS

584
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,294
POLICE VISITS FAMILY OF TONGYEONG
DROWNING VICTIM

585
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,299
Chief Choi is representing the police

586
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,509
in our fight for investigative rights.

587
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,679
If he reveals that she secretly
talked the victims' families

588
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,473
into criticizing the prosecution,

589
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,850
she'd be disgraced for sure.

590
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,896
Why would he dig into
such a petty thing like that?

591
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,481
That cheap bastard.

592
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,818
-But…
-You can curse him after we find him.

593
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,946
Sir…

594
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,616
What?

595
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:30,456
If Prosecutor Seo went missing
while digging up dirt on Chief Choi,

596
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,043
would she really be unrelated
to this case?

597
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,336
Are you serious?

598
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,755
Would a superintendent general
really hit and kidnap someone

599
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,590
just for trying to dig up dirt on them?

600
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,511
If that was the case, there would be
no prosecutors left alive by now.

601
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,639
They arrested former commissioner generals

602
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,058
every time we talked
about investigative rights.

603
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,062
If what you said was true,
why would they have gotten arrested?

604
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,730
Right. If that were true,

605
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,400
those people would've all killed
the prosecutors investigating them.

606
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,152
Hey, I'm going to tell
Chief Choi about you.

607
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,363
I was just thinking out loud.

608
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,949
Never mind.

609
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,044
By the way…

610
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,882
Are you in contact with Hanjo Group
by any chance?

611
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,346
Besides this one,

612
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,851
he made multiple calls to Hanjo Group
a week ago.

613
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,646
Sometimes he called them,
and sometimes Hanjo Group called him.

614
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,189
But we can't check anything.

615
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,358
Hanjo Group is rejecting our calls.

616
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,737
-I'll look into it.
-That's good.

617
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,239
If you get anything, please tell us.

618
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,658
Sure.

619
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,411
Oh, right. One more thing.

620
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,705
Here.

621
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,836
We got a list of Prosecutor Seo's recent
destinations from the GPS in his car.

622
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,588
But there aren't any from yesterday.

623
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,590
We can't tell if he didn't use it

624
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,051
or if the culprit deleted the history.

625
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,058
Wait. I'll give you a copy of that.

626
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,354
We didn't have time to make a copy yet.
This is the original file.

627
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,875
SUN-CHANG
I'M WATCHING YOU

628
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,796
Dongducheon Police Station would end up
investigating the case.

629
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,715
That would be like having the fox
guard the hen house.

630
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,469
It won't be any different because
they're the same organization after all.

631
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,057
Oh, right. We didn't get it filed yet,

632
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,517
but I think we found the weapon.

633
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,352
What was the weapon?

634
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,118
Does Prosecutor Seo
always park this terribly?

635
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,456
No, he cared a lot about his car,
his belongings,

636
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,916
and the things he wore.

637
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,336
If he had enough time, he would've
parked his car properly.

638
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,090
Then he must've stopped in a hurry
before getting out.

639
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,969
And his blood was found in a small alley…

640
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,849
Maybe he wasn't visiting
one of the houses here.

641
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,517
Maybe he saw someone in this alley.

642
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,784
The weapon…

643
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,454
Was he facing the culprit?

644
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,838
You asshole! Have you lost your mind?

645
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,179
Unless the culprit was really big…

646
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,474
Prosecutor Seo is well-built himself.

647
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,851
But we only found his blood on the scene.

648
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,282
He showed his back to the culprit,

649
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,244
and the culprit hadn't prepared
the weapon in advance…

650
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,635
The blood was spilled behind the car,

651
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,305
and the car came from over there to here.

652
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,143
If he saw the culprit standing here…

653
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,193
If he met the culprit here by coincidence,

654
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,571
that would mean
that the culprit lives nearby.

655
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,781
Then they would have
gotten rid of his car first.

656
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,366
They wouldn't have just left it there.

657
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,288
If they weren't a resident here,

658
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,872
they would have lured him here.

659
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,458
If the culprit wanted to lure
someone in a car,

660
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,127
they would have used their car too…

661
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,713
No.

662
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,052
What if Prosecutor Seo gave the culprit
a ride and dropped them off here?

663
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,555
If that was the case,

664
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,224
he would've parked his car properly.

665
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,894
What if he was arguing with the culprit
and suddenly stopped because he got angry?

666
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,189
Did they find signs of anyone
sitting in the passenger seat?

667
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,735
It seemed like they were working on it.
But it'll take some time.

668
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,863
There are so many things
to analyze in a car.

669
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,782
Then…

670
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,286
if Prosecutor Seo and the culprit
shared a ride here together,

671
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,081
what would the culprit have done
after attacking him?

672
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,917
They would have moved his body first
before anyone saw it.

673
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,923
They would have moved him
using Prosecutor Seo's car,

674
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,219
unless they were going to carry him
to a house nearby.

675
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,724
What if they did? If they moved him
to one of the houses here,

676
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,726
then they would've come out right after

677
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,312
and moved his car somewhere else.

678
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,147
But…

679
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,983
if there was an accomplice,

680
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,445
then any one of those scenarios
would be possible.

681
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,245
We have to find him soon.
It's almost been a whole day.

682
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:30,834
Do you know where the former chief
of Dongducheon Station is?

683
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:35,381
Prosecutor Seo could have met him
just before he went missing.

MS. HAN

688
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,177
Why would Prosecutor Seo meet
the former chief of Dongducheon Station?

689
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,637
An employee in Seo's office said

690
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,516
that he mentioned asking
Officer Kim's whereabouts himself.

691
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,977
So of course, he'd ask the Chief.

692
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,022
He found out that they're connected.

693
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,648
Let's go.

694
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,951
I'm not going to come back here though.

695
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,164
-I'll take a cab on my way back then.
-What?

696
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,708
It'll cost a lot to catch a cab
from Dongducheon to here.

697
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,045
I didn't know we were going
to Dongducheon.

698
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,254
Oh, really?

699
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,590
Well, Chief Choi

700
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:45,511
mentioned that he moved
to somewhere nearby.

701
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,803
Where?

702
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,597
That's what I'm about to ask.

703
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,770
The number you have dialed…

704
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,147
Oh, I guess she must be busy.

705
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,400
Was it Chief Choi who told you
that Officer Kim was related

706
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,611
to the former chief
of Dongducheon Station?

707
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,779
Yes.

708
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,074
I guess she really does get info quickly.

709
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,700
Of course.

710
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,620
She's one of the highest ranked
intelligence officers.

711
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,913
A while ago, she even…

MOBILE PHONE CALL HISTORY

713
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,889
This is Officer Kim's address.

714
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,475
You found him already?

715
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,234
That must be it.

716
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,862
If he was going to meet the former chief,
he would've called him beforehand.

717
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,658
-Those are the case files, right?
-Yes.

718
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,452
Look at the calls from his office phone,
not his mobile.

719
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,454
Do you see Uijeongbu Station?

720
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,044
Yes, it's here.

721
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,130
I think it's there.

722
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,757
The station where the former chief
was transferred.

723
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,094
"Administration Division."

UIJEONGBU POLICE STATION

725
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,946
When I called a while ago,

726
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,866
you definitely said the chairwoman
would be back soon.

727
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,495
No, you told me she'd be back
after the meeting.

728
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,164
You told me so yourself.

729
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,209
All right.

730
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,799
It must be impossible to meet
the chairwoman of Hanjo Group.

731
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,385
I should just visit her office tomorrow.

732
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,928
Will they even let you in?

733
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,889
They'll just stop you at the lobby.

734
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,186
Is it you two?

735
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,692
Did you ask to see me?

736
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,029
Are you Mr. Jeon Seung-pyo?

737
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:12,908
I'm Han Yeo-jin.

738
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,498
The Reformation Unit?

739
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,628
I'm Hwang Si-mok from the prosecution.

740
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:30,342
We have a few questions
regarding your nephew, Kim Su-hang.

741
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:37,933
Come with me.

742
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,856
-With that build…
-Right.

743
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,067
What?

744
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,124
I told you it wasn't me.
I'm not the one who sent him.

745
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,711
Why are you bringing up Song Gi-hyeon now?
That was years ago.

746
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:09,297
I'm not the one who sent him
to Segok Station.

747
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,261
Did you say that to Prosecutor Seo too?

748
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,724
-Who?
-There was someone else who brought up

749
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,059
what happened years ago, right?

750
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,311
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae
from the Uijeongbu Office.

751
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:26,440
You talked to him on the phone
two days ago. What did you talk about?

752
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,066
What are you talking about?

753
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,819
I have about 100 phone calls a day.
I don't remember.

754
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:31,987
What did you two talk about?

755
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,990
Aren't you listening to me?
I don't remember!

756
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,700
Do you know how busy we are?

757
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,786
We make calls regarding budgets and…
You know, planning!

758
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,623
We do all kinds of work. We're busy.

759
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,084
We get dozens of calls a day too.

760
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,712
But I don't think your division

761
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,132
would receive that many direct calls
from prosecutors.

762
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,386
And I've heard you were demoted.

763
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,389
-Even within the Administration Division.
-Damn it!

764
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,353
Fine. You're right about the demotion.

765
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,774
But hey.

766
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,443
I'm still a higher rank than you,
got that?

767
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,236
You shouldn't be doing this…

768
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,450
to a fellow police officer.

769
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,535
I…

770
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,830
Why don't we go to Headquarters
if you have any problems?

771
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,458
Headquarters? Are you showing off?

772
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,506
I get it. You learned this from her.

773
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,965
Hey!

774
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,843
You work for Choi Bit, right?

775
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:41,932
Damn it. Let's not address her by name
and step out of line.

776
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,558
What?

777
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,730
We both used to be Chiefs
and I can't even call her name?

778
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,190
Chief my ass.

779
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,984
You're not even a Senior Superintendent
because you assaulted someone.

780
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,195
And Chief Choi
is a Superintendent General now.

781
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,365
If you don't mind your manners,
I'll just call you by your full name too.

782
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,368
You saw the news, right?

783
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,080
Prosecutor Seo is missing,
and we think he may have been kidnapped.

784
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,297
Jeez. This is unbelievable.

785
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,758
So you're saying…

786
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,970
I'm at a loss for words right now.

787
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,598
So are you implying that I did something
to that prosecutor?

788
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,810
You came here to accuse me of kidnapping
just because of the call?

789
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,311
You said you didn't talk to him.

790
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,356
Why would I do that to someone I've never
met before? Do you think I'm crazy?

791
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,774
Why would I kidnap him?

792
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,987
I'm still a part of the police force.

793
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,240
You sent Officer Song
to Segok Station, didn't you?

794
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,577
And you knew he was being bullied
and suffering from depression, right?

795
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,706
We were talking about some prosecutor,
and now Segok Station?

796
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,835
I had my doubts
about you being the culprit.

797
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,671
What doubts?

798
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,591
He did get disciplined
because of Sergeant Song,

799
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,926
but could it really be a motive
for murder?

800
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,889
Would he really have ordered
his nephew to kill Sergeant Song

801
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,432
when he was chief of police?

802
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,393
It's not enough of a motive
for him to commit murder.

803
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,812
I did think that the possibility
of him being the culprit

804
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,398
was lower than Sergeant Song's
team members.

805
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,985
But what if something unexpected happened?

806
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,487
Even as his uncle,

807
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,950
he didn't know his nephew was
taking bribes from local bars and clubs.

808
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,995
But Sergeant Song,
whom he sent there to be bullied,

809
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,705
found out about his nephew

810
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,459
and then was killed by his nephew
while investigating the bribes.

811
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,629
And what's worse,
a prosecutor comes to him two years later,

812
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,632
wanting to dig up dirt about the case.

813
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,552
If he knew
that his nephew was the culprit,

814
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,179
he would've been startled.

815
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,556
Because he was worried
either about his nephew

816
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,768
or about being caught
for being the one who ordered it.

817
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,082
Where were you last night?

818
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,545
I'll bring it, so just wait here.

819
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,466
And get ready to apologize to me!

820
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,934
He's bringing his alibi?

821
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,853
He's well-prepared.

822
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,436
-So you think he's alive?
-He'd better be.

823
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,523
I heard about the golden hour principle.

824
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:31,693
Why do you think the kidnapper
isn't demanding a ransom?

825
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,319
He might still be bleeding

826
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,114
somewhere even as we speak.
Let's find him.

827
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,866
Your brain's trying to squeeze out lies,

828
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,828
so it's taking blood
from the tips of your fingers.

829
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,832
If he locked him up somewhere,
he'd check up on him at least once.

830
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,627
-Are you investigating it?
-What were they about?

831
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,047
They'd do anything to cover it up even if
they had to be up against a prosecutor.

832
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,259
Is Detective Jang meeting Officer Kim?

833
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:01,472
