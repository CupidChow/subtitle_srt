1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,261
STRANGER

3
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,307
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACE NAMES
AND CASES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,772
Thank you for your help.

5
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,607
Not a problem at all.

6
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,318
How did we run into each other
right there?

7
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,527
By the way,

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,947
has Eun-soo been craving gangjeong again?

9
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,451
She's been talking about it
for a few days,

10
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,495
but I didn't really pay any attention.

11
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,039
I should be more attentive
to my one and only child.

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,459
She only likes dishes
that require a lot of work.

13
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,130
This year must be a lucky year for us.

14
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,966
You finally got to clear yourself
of the false accusation.

15
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,510
Goodness.

16
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,014
Now, I just hope that things
go well for Eun-soo.

17
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,308
She's doing great.

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,353
She should meet someone.

19
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,856
I really want to find her a nice guy.

20
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,109
That's all I wish for.

21
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,695
What are you talking about?
Times have changed.

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,656
My gosh, look at you.

23
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,032
She's too good for anyone, right?

24
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,162
You're such a doting dad.

25
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,289
You know expressions like that?

26
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,584
Of course I do. I'm still young.

27
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,294
And you're old.

28
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,294
I came here just in case
Ga-young might be here,

29
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,006
but it didn't look like anyone was inside.

30
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,799
As I was leaving,

31
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,636
I ran into the tenant

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,221
on the stairs.

33
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,267
At the time, I didn't know who she was,

34
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,562
so I was just going to leave,

35
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,483
but I heard a scream coming
from downstairs all of a sudden.

36
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,278
So I came in and...

37
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,939
Judging from the murder weapon,
it looks like the same killer's doing.

38
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,565
Have you found any belongings
of the victim?

39
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,364
No, nothing.

40
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,282
Neither her purse nor her phone
has been found.

41
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,203
Ms. Young must have a transit pass.

42
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,664
Please go through the usage history
and find out where she's been.

43
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,792
Will you go to the autopsy room?

44
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,670
You have to track down where Ga-young is.

45
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,799
How can he be like that?

46
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,717
Even I feel sick to my stomach.

47
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,552
Did he actually work with her?

48
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,264
He didn't even hesitate
to call her a victim.

49
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,240
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

50
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,788
-There's blood. Please don't step on it.
-Okay.

51
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,583
Are you saying it's been
diluted with water?

52
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,211
Was it dropped
after he tried to wash it off?

53
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,111
You need to tell us what you saw.

54
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,530
Please stop crying and tell us, okay?

55
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,233
I heard there's some
at the stairway as well.

56
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,870
Don't you think it's a bit odd?

57
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,790
He must've been in a big rush this time.

58
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,500
Or...

59
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,380
Stop touching that, please!

60
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,341
What is the matter with you?
You know that he's in complete shock now.

61
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,512
Mr. Yoon, I'll take you home.

62
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,013
It's okay.

63
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:13,975
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,730
You two are such loyal friends.

65
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,024
Don't you think it's strange?

66
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,571
How can he touch the body
when he works in the prosecution?

67
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,114
He must've been stunned.

68
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,492
Wouldn't you do the same
if you found me dead on the floor?

69
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,244
What?

70
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,539
Gosh.

71
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,668
God, he completely ruined the damn scene.

72
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,424
What should we do
to catch that son of a bitch?

73
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,548
We're ready.

74
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,570
You said she was your colleague.
Will you be all right?

75
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,490
Please begin.

76
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,450
Okay.

77
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,205
No...

78
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,551
Not now.

79
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,845
Please...

80
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,312
-Brief me.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,440
The first person who found
the body is the new tenant who is

82
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,233
renting the apartment
Ga-young used to live.

83
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,111
It looks like the victim was already dead
when she was found.

84
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,864
Getting stabbed
in the stomach and neck must be

85
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,033
the cause of death.

86
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,869
Have a look at this too. A contusion
was found on the back of her head.

87
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,456
That looks similar
to the wound Ga-young had.

88
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,501
Did he hit her head and make her pass out
before stabbing her?

89
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,962
Judging from the dent,
she was probably unconscious.

90
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,173
If she was conscious and resisted,

91
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,759
the blood spatter would look
a lot more irregular.

92
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,763
And this kitchen knife has
the same flower motif

93
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,808
as the ones found on the scenes
of Moo-sung Park and Ga-young Kim's cases.

94
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,603
-Do you think there's seriality?
-The consistency of the murder weapon

95
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,562
and the crime scene.

96
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,066
Ga-young was found at the previous victim
Moo-sung Park's house.

97
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,193
The same goes for Ms. Young.

98
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,320
She was found where Ga-young used to live.

99
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,073
But the scene obviously wasn't cleaned up

100
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,783
like the other two were.

101
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,036
Blood was splattered all over the place,

102
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,289
and a significant amount of the victim's
blood was found in the bathroom as well.

103
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,960
The blood trail from the bathroom
to the stairway was mixed with water.

104
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,381
The killer must've tried to wash the blood
off in the bathroom and left the trail

105
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,966
on his way out.

106
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,760
The towel we found in the bathroom

107
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,303
had no blood stain on it.

108
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,264
If the killer didn't use the towel

109
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,767
after washing blood off of himself,
some water could've dripped from him.

110
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,811
Don't you think this case is too different

111
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,273
from the other two
to assume that it's serial?

112
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,693
What about the autopsy?

113
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,865
The contusion on her head
wasn't the primary cause of death.

114
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,908
Other than that, there were
no signs of resistance.

115
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,454
The cause of death is excessive blood loss
due to a severed carotid artery.

116
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,957
The time of death is presumed to be
about four to five hours

117
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,709
prior to the time of autopsy.

118
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,712
-Then it must've been between 5 and 7 p.m.
-That's right.

119
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,550
I got the victim's transit pass
usage history.

120
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,720
She always commuted to work by subway.

121
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,145
Only the day before and the day
of the incident seem out of ordinary.

122
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,647
The rest shows her traveling home

123
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,025
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
and vice versa.

124
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,236
The day before the incident, she came
to my place from Mr. Hwang's place,

125
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
then went home.

126
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,074
She must've walked to his place
from her office.

127
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,912
Why did she go to his place
and your place?

128
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,706
That day, she stopped by his place

129
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,541
to drop off mails for him.

130
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,753
-And we had a team dinner at my place.
-Ms. Young!

131
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,797
-Welcome.
-Hello.

132
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,467
What we need to focus on

133
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,594
is the fact

134
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,555
that Ms. Young saw this man

135
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,641
who sneaked into Mr. Hwang's place.

136
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,102
Who's this guy?

137
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,604
We don't know yet.

138
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,233
If he's the one who killed her,

139
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,278
he probably assumed that she saw his face.

140
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,532
Why did he sneak
into the prosecutor's place?

141
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,950
Did he steal something?

142
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,244
No, nothing was stolen.

143
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,954
It was more like a warning.

144
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,249
Well, Mr. Hwang was the one

145
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,000
that stopped the weapon import.

146
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,669
What?

147
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,173
Are you saying the special investigation
team was behind that?

148
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,716
Yes, sir.

149
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,594
Does that mean Hanjo, The Bahn
or the Ministry of National Defense

150
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,221
gave him a warning?

151
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,639
Watch your mouth.

152
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,808
Don't make risky assumptions.

153
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,940
The last thing I see here from the day
of the incident is that she took a taxi.

154
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,152
At 4:47 p.m.,
she got off at Haengdang-dong.

155
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,321
Anything else after this?

156
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,948
She lives in Haengdang-dong.

157
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,242
Was she killed there
and moved to the scene after?

158
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,702
The culprit must have

159
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,537
abducted her around her place.

160
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,709
All right, everyone.
A prosecutor has been killed.

161
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,670
Whether this is a copycat murder
or a serial case, all of you must know

162
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,005
what kind of stir it will cause.

163
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,966
-Yes, sir.
-You must find something before dawn.

164
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,926
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

165
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,886
Understood, sir.

166
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,846
PROSECUTOR EUN-SOO YOUNG

167
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,595
Thank you for your hard work.

168
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,513
I'm sorry that this happened

169
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,515
immediately after your promotion.

170
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,477
Please do your best.

171
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,355
See you later.

172
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,690
I need to talk to you.

173
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,241
What is it?

174
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,952
Have you seen Si-mok?

175
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,497
He went straight to the autopsy room
from the scene.

176
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,085
The autopsy was completed hours ago.
Why can't I get a hold of him?

177
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,046
I'll try calling him now.

178
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:17,935
He's not picking up.

179
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,940
Okay, thank you.

180
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,678
I really don't want to see
things like this anymore.

181
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,393
His medical history shows that he had
insular cortex surgery. Did you know?

182
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,186
Insular cortex?

183
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,732
It's a part of the brain
that activates emotions.

184
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,152
Simply put, it enables us to be human.

185
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,656
It controls things such as desires,
likes and dislikes.

186
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,577
So what did they do to his insular cortex?

187
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,623
It looks like a part of it was removed.

188
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,834
It must've been because of pain.

189
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,919
Those with an overactive insular cortex

190
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,338
often can't tolerate stress
caused by external stimuli.

191
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,553
Does that mean he fainted
because of a recurrence?

192
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,180
No, that's not the case.

193
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,601
Insular cortex removal can make
the person look apathetic.

194
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,480
There are also other mental side effects
such as personality changes.

195
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,023
On the other hand,

196
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,985
relieving insular cortex
from pain can activate it

197
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,112
and significantly enhance
cognitive abilities.

198
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,824
I think what happened was
a side effect of some sort.

199
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,870
Has he been in an extremely
stressful situation lately?

200
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,208
No one can be
completely devoid of emotion.

201
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,168
When you can't express your emotions,

202
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,462
they pile up inside of you
without you even realizing it.

203
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,380
Then they explode like this
once in a while.

204
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,145
Excuse me. Please call me
when this patient wakes up.

205
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,105
Sure.

206
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,438
Eun-soo.

207
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,524
Hey, Eun-soo!

208
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,359
Eun-soo!

209
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,902
Gosh.

210
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,573
Are you all right?

211
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,325
You really didn't do it, right?

212
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,205
You didn't kill him, right?

213
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,458
That foolish girl.

214
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,886
MS. YANG

215
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,138
Mr. Chief Secretary is looking for you.

216
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,227
-You thought your ex-boss was the killer.
-Have you seen

217
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
this man?

218
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,772
Now, you have to serve him again.

219
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,525
Don't you want to know?

220
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,321
It's no longer about whether I want
to know or not.

221
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,718
DEPUTY CHIEF OF INVESTIGATION
SE-WON YOON

222
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,346
Se-won Yoon

223
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,044
Letter of resignation

224
00:20:54,628 --> 00:21:01,343
PROSECUTION SERVICE
SE-WON YOON

225
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,095
Can you lend me some clothes?

226
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,145
I can pull off any clothes, can't I?

227
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,522
See you tomorrow.

228
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,775
Why can't I be part
of the special investigation team?

229
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,862
Do you think we're here to help you
get your revenge?

230
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,409
Mr. Hwang, why can't I work on it?

231
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,827
Do you not trust me?

232
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,704
No.

233
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,873
Will you be able to do it?

234
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,084
Yes, please entrust me with it.

235
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,253
Are you not capable
of giving compliments or what?

236
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,671
Your mentee won her first case.

237
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,259
Excuse me. Could I get another glass?

238
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,930
The killer must be caught
for me to get out of this.

239
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,523
Teach me.

240
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,446
The guy who delivered the cash
to my dad. Tae-gyun Kim.

241
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,615
I didn't want to let him get away,
so I got on.

242
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,742
-What was this about?
-I had to do something.

243
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,120
-You're working so hard to...
-Do you think I'm doing this for you?

244
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,581
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

245
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,665
No! It's not like that.

246
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,677
Thank you for the sweater.

247
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,726
Ms. Young!

248
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,927
REST IN PEACE

249
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,847
FROM JEJU PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

250
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,351
When is Mr. Yoon coming?

251
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,102
I can't even get a hold of him.

252
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,772
He'll probably come with his colleagues.

253
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,610
Does going through things like this often

254
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,112
make you become numb to them?

255
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,490
I thought it would.

256
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,825
I thought I had become like that.

257
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,454
I mean, both you and I don't really know

258
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,122
Ms. Young well.

259
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,957
But...

260
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,628
Even two days ago, all of us drank
and hung out together.

261
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,631
How can something like this happen?

262
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,718
She got killed by the prick
we've been after,

263
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,637
the murderer we haven't caught.

264
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,683
Gosh. And why have her parents
lost so much weight?

265
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,311
Even catching the killer

266
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,730
won't erase their wound
from this, will it?

267
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,319
Let's go.

268
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,072
How could they do that?

269
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,535
Where have you been?

270
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,465
I asked you to protect my daughter!

271
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,553
I asked you to keep Eun-soo safe.
What is this?

272
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,513
-What is this mess?
-Sir.

273
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,062
You scum.

274
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,482
How dare you set foot in here?

275
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,900
Get out, you scumbag!

276
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,989
Sir, I don't think now is a good time.

277
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,615
You killed her.

278
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,452
-You killed my daughter.
-Why have you been just spectating?

279
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,835
Why didn't you fight?

280
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,045
Why did you do nothing

281
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,339
but hide for all these years?

282
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,841
Si-mok, shut up.

283
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,843
You taught us to use the law to fight.

284
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,178
What have you been doing?

285
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,932
Do you think you did it for your family?

286
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,684
Not because you were scared?

287
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,311
-Be quiet!
-Enough!

288
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,772
Please stop.

289
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,601
Sir, we should leave for now.

290
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,064
Dong-jae.

291
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,067
Do not act up ever again.

292
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,487
I apologize, sir.

293
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,490
Are your shoulders made of steel or what?

294
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,035
Don't do that ever again.

295
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,400
That's from 4:48 p.m. yesterday.

296
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,031
Ms. Young got into a taxi at 4:06 p.m.

297
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,116
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office

298
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,577
and got off in front of her place
at 4:47 p.m.

299
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,956
She was caught walking into her place
on the camera at 4:48 p.m.

300
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,333
Then she left home again at 4:55 p.m.

301
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,712
She left seven minutes
after she entered home.

302
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,051
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

303
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,927
Mr. Hwang, do you have some time now?

304
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,348
That was the last time she was seen.

305
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,520
-Yes, see you.
-When we showed her those photos.

306
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,314
You should get back to work.

307
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,607
The last time.

308
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,525
Go on.

309
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,278
She went straight home after that.

310
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,576
We're investigating this area now,

311
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,955
but her family has no idea
why she came home at that hour.

312
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,499
Aside from that day,

313
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,542
she had never come home
during her work hours.

314
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,045
Except for the day
she came over to my place,

315
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,464
she didn't even go anywhere else recently.

316
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,050
She always went straight to work
from home and never strayed.

317
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,719
And the knife we found that day

318
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,514
isn't from the scene. It looks like
the killer bought it recently.

319
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,891
We're trying to track down
where it was bought.

320
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,357
What do you think?

321
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,818
Do you think it's the same guy's doing?

322
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,533
How's your head by the way?

323
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,960
We found Ga-young.

324
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,004
Her mom moved her to keep her safe.

325
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,665
PROSECUTOR YOUNG, 4:53 P.M.

326
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,085
She disappeared
after leaving home at 4:55 p.m.

327
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,337
PROSECUTOR YOUNG

328
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,799
-What's up?
-Mr. Hwang, do you have some time now?

329
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,092
Is it urgent?

330
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,635
I want to talk to you briefly.

331
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,596
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT
GA-YOUNG KIM

332
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,972
I'll call you back in a bit.

333
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,687
Yes, okay.

334
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:30,897
All right.

335
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,198
He's not in a good mood right now.
Give it to me. I'll get his approval...

336
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,282
I can't give this to you.

337
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,539
"I can't give this to you"?

338
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,589
Ma'am, an attempt was made
to check on your assets,

339
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,760
everything from your stocks
to real estate properties and art pieces.

340
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,180
I traced it thinking that it must've been
about taxes, but the request

341
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,098
was made by your husband,

342
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,850
Chief Secretary Chang-jun Lee.

343
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,519
HUSBAND

344
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,481
HUSBAND

345
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,663
Did I notice anything strange
the last time I saw her?

346
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,667
I don't know if I can say it was strange,

347
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,543
but that day,

348
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,005
I actually saw Ms. Young

349
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,634
standing in front of your door
for a few seconds before going in.

350
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,432
She seemed to eavesdrop
on your conversation inside your office.

351
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,270
I know that he has something
that can greatly threaten Yun-beom Lee.

352
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,189
He's just been sitting on it
for three years though.

353
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,858
What does Mr. Young have?

354
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,948
Hello.

355
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,741
Are you saying she overheard
our conversation?

356
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,830
Is that why she went home?

357
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,708
Was that the reason she suddenly
went home at that hour?

358
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,085
Was it because of me?

359
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,046
Well...

360
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,551
The two of us were left alone
inside my place for a few minutes,

361
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,470
but she didn't say anything special.

362
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,140
She spilled some juice.

363
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,977
It splashed onto Mr. Yoon's shirt,
so we didn't really have time to talk.

364
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
Oh, god.

365
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,275
She heard me asking you
what Mr. Young has.

366
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,070
If she went home because of it
and met the killer on the way...

367
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,448
Ms. Kim, are you inside?

368
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,870
I was getting home from my part-time job.

369
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,830
Ms. Kim.

370
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,582
Are you inside?

371
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,585
Ms. Kim, are you there?

372
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,670
-Is anyone inside?
-He wasn't looking for me,

373
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,466
so I didn't think I needed to answer.

374
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,317
I went there just in case.

375
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,279
That was the only place I knew.

376
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,036
But...

377
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,802
Ms. Young.

378
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,805
Ms. Young...

379
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,435
Ms. Young?

380
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,022
Ms. Young.

381
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,150
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

382
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,656
Please make sure that her parents

383
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,701
don't see her body.

384
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,040
If they see it,
the rest of their lives will be...

385
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,495
-I'm not asking about the color.
-Yes, I know that there are many.

386
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,707
-Yes, a knife with a rose motif.
-We want to find a company that made it.

387
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,625
-No.
-The motif is on the blade.

388
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,544
-The blade.
-No, the manufacturer.

389
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,628
-Yes, rose.
-Thank you.

390
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,130
-Regular kitchen knife.
-Right.

391
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,340
-It's black.
-You make them? Hold on, please.

392
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,217
No, it's black.

393
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,510
-Black.
-It's not this big.

394
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,970
-Black...
-Only black ones?

395
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,638
-It's soot black.
-Yes, hello.

396
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,807
-I'm the one who sent the photos earlier.
-That's right.

397
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,517
-I don't see it.
-We're looking for the knife.

398
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,811
-Yes.
-Gosh, how can it be...

399
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,271
Is it the same one?

400
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,943
What if the killer had the knife
prepared in advance?

401
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,945
It's possible that we got
the perimeter wrong.

402
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,031
Then we should widen our search.

403
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,616
We'll search the entire city.

404
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,827
Hello, I'm with the police.

405
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,789
We're just wondering
if you've seen this lady.

406
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,583
I didn't work that day.

407
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,878
Is there a security camera
that overlooks this spot?

408
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,713
-That must be it.
-Yes, that's right.

409
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,632
Is there any camera on that side?

410
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,050
Hello, we're from the police.

411
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,218
-I've never seen her.
-Okay.

412
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,886
-I'm not sure.
-We're the police.

413
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,013
Hello. I've never seen her.

414
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,097
Excuse me. Hello.

415
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,516
-No.
-I've never seen her.

416
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,559
-I see. Thank you.
-No problem.

417
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,697
I heard you found the manufacturer.

418
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,492
Yes, but from this apartment complex
to the scene,

419
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,118
there are over 100 stores
they supply it to.

420
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,329
Everyone is visiting the stores
at the moment

421
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,748
to find out if anyone bought
the knife in the last few days.

422
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,502
Right, we're talking about
from Seongdong-gu to Yongsan-gu.

423
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,504
There must be a ton of stores.

424
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,266
Excuse me. I'm from the police.

425
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,059
Do you happen to know this person?

426
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,334
You should leave now, sir.
The car is ready.

427
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,169
All right.

428
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,433
Ms. Lee.

429
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,283
Are you preparing to divorce me?

430
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,664
Are you trying to calculate how much
you can make through our divorce?

431
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,592
Have you had a change of heart
now that the girl woke up?

432
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,843
You're making a move right away.

433
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:04,975
Tell me.

434
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,810
What are you sorry for?

435
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,396
I'm sorry.

436
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,028
I know you're sorry, but for what?

437
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,448
Yeon-jae.

438
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,117
There's no other woman in my life.

439
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,495
I'm not being like this out of jealousy.

440
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:30,376
We're not the type to quibble
and get divorced like other couples do.

441
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,212
We should at least try to hide
our ugly sides from each other.

442
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,383
I've never cheated on you.

443
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,432
Then why are you sorry?

444
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,521
You shouldn't have come that day.

445
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,942
Your brother's trial.

446
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,570
The first time we met.

447
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,739
Or...

448
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,451
I should've listened to your father.

449
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,413
Whether he's a total rogue or not,

450
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,041
had I let the corporate heir go,

451
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,964
you wouldn't have been interested in me.

452
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,593
Are you saying our relationship
was wrong from the start?

453
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,890
Why are you being like this?
What on earth are you...

454
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,520
What are you thinking?

455
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,023
I'll be late.

456
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,276
Father must be waiting.

457
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,862
You know how much he values punctuality.

458
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:45,993
Let's talk at home.

459
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,077
The flight ticket.

460
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,163
Are you preparing to divorce me?

461
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,669
I tidied everything up already.

462
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,254
You should take a break.

463
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,497
-Hi.
-Excuse me, sir.

464
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,465
-I don't see Mr. Woo.
-He's away on a business trip.

465
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,593
Does he travel for work?

466
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,012
Do you need something from him?

467
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,055
No, I don't.

468
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,807
-Where's everyone else?
-They'll be here soon.

469
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,561
We began investing in the savings bank.
The word will spread

470
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,145
in the market by tomorrow.

471
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,065
We made it look like the investment
was made from a foreign fund in Hong Kong,

472
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,526
so we just have to wait
for the stock price to go up.

473
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,072
-When will you withdraw the investment?
-As quickly as possible.

474
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,367
We just need to sell it
when they're still distracted.

475
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,161
Don't you think they'll complain later

476
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,872
about it being sold to foreign capital?
Even the last time...

477
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,458
When it comes to business,
I'll handle everything. You just need

478
00:47:59,001 --> 00:47:59,960
to show your face.

479
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,962
Understood.

480
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,505
I need to use the washroom.

481
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,890
They're here, sir.

482
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,400
My gosh.

483
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,319
Oh, my.

484
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,821
Thank you for coming.

485
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:28,864
How have you been?

486
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,990
It's been a long time.

487
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,325
I haven't seen you in so long.

488
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,622
My gosh. I didn't know
that you'd be here, Mr. Chief Secretary.

489
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,498
I wanted to be part
of this meaningful meeting.

490
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,918
It sounds like those he serves are
also very interested in this matter.

491
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,420
-Is that right?
-Have a seat.

492
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,630
Sure.

493
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,006
Please excuse me, sir.

494
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,061
I'm sorry we couldn't meet sooner.

495
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,521
I'm the CEO of W Savings Bank, Ki-ho Song.

496
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,190
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

497
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,193
Have you met the Director
of the Financial Supervisory Service?

498
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,611
Yes, we met once after I took office.

499
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,324
Mr. Song, you'll need to become
pluckier now.

500
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,328
Rumors about your bank being insolvent
and that it'll be bought out soon

501
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,288
will spread thanks to
the media's groundwork.

502
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,248
Please don't be taken aback by it.

503
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,834
Yes, I shall follow your advice.

504
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:29,174
When the bank is faltering, JR Holdings
will come into the picture like a savior,

505
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,593
looking like they're buying it
with grudging reluctance.

506
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:35,263
When that's happening, all you need to do
is keep your eyes closed.

507
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,850
-Like this?
-You'll need to close them more tightly.

508
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,268
Is this better?

509
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,562
-Like this?
-Yes, that's perfect.

510
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,576
What's missing?

511
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,162
They took it.

512
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,081
Those scums.

513
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,419
Chang-jun and Yun-beom.

514
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,422
When?

515
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,174
I was out of it earlier,

516
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,595
but I wanted to check it after hearing
what you said at the funeral.

517
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,223
It was here yesterday.

518
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,104
It's evidence of tax evasion
Yun-beom Lee committed.

519
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,857
It's about the money

520
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,986
he turned into stocks and gave
to his children illegally.

521
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,780
Had he paid taxes on it properly,

522
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,491
it would've been 200 billion won.

523
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,368
Taxes alone.

524
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,706
Is that why you were framed for bribery

525
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,125
three years ago?

526
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,420
I checked it after you left yesterday.

527
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,632
I opened it after you asked me
to give it to you,

528
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,050
and everything was intact.

529
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,637
Was there a time
no one was home after that?

530
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,267
Yesterday. Only briefly in the afternoon.

531
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,686
Was it around 4:40 p.m.?

532
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:11,026
Ms. Young was the only one captured
on security cameras around that time.

533
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,864
Eun-soo?

534
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,408
She probably took it.

535
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,244
Is that why...

536
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,247
Because she had it...

537
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,833
Is that why those scums...

538
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,547
She was...

539
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,467
She was killed because of me.

540
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,907
I know that he has something
that can greatly threaten Yun-beom Lee.

541
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,160
But he's just been sitting on it
for three years.

542
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,454
Mr. Hwang, do you have some time now?

543
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,122
I want to talk to you briefly.

544
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,381
Hello, Lieutenant Han.
I'm calling to report a theft.

545
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,280
What are you looking for?

546
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,366
I asked you what you're looking for.

547
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,869
I don't know either.

548
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,332
It must be the police.

549
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,353
What's been stolen?

550
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,287
This...

551
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,956
Zero and seven?

552
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,385
This wasn't drawn at once.

553
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,722
I see repetitions of similar lines.
She must've corrected it many times.

554
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,550
She used a pen for all other pages.

555
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:08,430
It looks like she used a pencil
for this torn-out page on purpose,

556
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,392
to draw the shape she wanted.

557
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,145
I bet it's not a shape that she imagined.

558
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,939
It must mean that she saw something.

559
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,692
She must've wanted to draw what she saw.

560
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,611
That's why she kept correcting it.

561
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,782
Are we sure that these are numbers though?
Why do they look like this?

562
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,950
Lieutenant Han!

563
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,786
Where did she see this? And how?

564
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,039
-Lieutenant Han!
-Yes, sir.

565
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:57,103
Go check if it's possible to jump up onto
the hallway from outside of the building.

566
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,229
Yes, sir.

567
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,900
His daughter was the only one caught
on the cameras around that time.

568
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:06,112
The only way the thief could've gotten in
without passing by the security office

569
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:10,075
is through the balcony window
or by jumping up onto the hallway.

570
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,877
It's almost impossible.

571
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,004
There's nowhere to tie anything.

572
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,884
She left seven minutes
after she entered home.

573
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,054
Would it have been possible
to draw it in seven minutes?

574
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,019
Where did she see this? And how?

575
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,397
Here, the office,

576
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,776
my place and Lieutenant Han's place.

577
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,529
His clothes look similar.

578
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,824
I couldn't see his face,
but I think it was this umbrella.

579
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,034
The umbrella.

580
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,290
Where and how did she see this?

581
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,252
Except for the day
she came over to my place,

582
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,462
she didn't even go anywhere else recently.

583
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,881
She always went straight to work
from home and never strayed.

584
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,134
There's no overlap at all.

585
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,012
Zero and seven? What is that?

586
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,472
Ga-young said those words.

587
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,267
It might be what she saw
during the abduction

588
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,894
or something related to the culprit.

589
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,148
She saw those two numbers? Zero and seven?

590
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,608
Zero and seven.

591
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,194
Zero and seven?

592
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,245
Are we sure that these are numbers though?
Why do they look like this?

593
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:40,999
T.

594
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,212
D.

595
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,423
T.

596
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,140
I'll go bring some fruit.

597
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,898
The two of us were left alone
inside my place for a few minutes,

598
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,442
but she didn't say anything special.

599
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,402
She spilled some juice.

600
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,739
It splashed onto Mr. Yoon's shirt,
so we didn't really have time to talk.

601
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,417
I'm a lightweight.

602
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,753
How can you be a lightweight?
You said you were a Marine.

603
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,339
Didn't you say you served
in the Special Forces?

604
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,634
I don't think the thief got in
through elsewhere.

605
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,637
All this time, he's been around...

606
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,639
What did you say?

607
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,433
I know who the killer is.

608
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,019
Who is it?

609
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,997
Track his location immediately.

610
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,842
Ms. Young heard about the zero and seven
for the first time

611
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,971
on the rooftop at your place two days ago.
Then she was killed last night.

612
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,767
In that one day, the only time
she could've sat down at her desk

613
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,562
and drawn it was when she got home
from your place two nights ago.

614
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:29,190
When she stopped by her place
yesterday afternoon right before she died,

615
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,192
she only had seven minutes.

616
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,826
He's on the Yeongjong Bridge.
He must be headed to the airport.

617
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,953
And had Ga-young

618
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:45,373
seen those numbers in the basement
or while she was being dragged somewhere,

619
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,959
Ms. Young, whose trail doesn't overlap
with Ga-young's at all,

620
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,211
wouldn't have been able
to see the numbers.

621
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,047
Have you gotten in?

622
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,634
I guess you'll take off soon.

623
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:01,889
Don't call me until I contact you.

624
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,854
If she didn't see it at a specific place,
it must be a person.

625
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,856
She must've seen it on someone.

626
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,858
Like Ga-young, Ms. Young

627
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,360
also saw the killer.

628
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,200
Then how did they see numbers on a person?

629
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:22,952
On clothes or belongings?

630
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,871
Whether they're numbers or not,

631
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,081
how can they be on someone's body?

632
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,668
It must be a tattoo.

633
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,254
Where is he? Where did he go?

634
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,465
Number three. I'll go to number three.

635
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,973
-Hey, is Detective Jang here too?
-Hurry up.

636
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,391
-He's here.
-Hey, you made it.

637
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,226
Guys, listen up.

638
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,519
Tune into Channel Three.

639
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,190
-Team One should search the floor below.
-Yes, sir.

640
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,900
Geon, you should go that way and...

641
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,693
From the time she first heard
about the numbers

642
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,236
to the time she drew the tattoo at home,

643
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,988
-The rest should follow me.
-she only saw

644
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,365
-Move!
-those of us at your place.

645
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,909
It means that the killer
is one of the people

646
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,619
who were there that night.

647
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,415
INTEGRATED CONTROL CENTER

648
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,761
Had Ms. Young seen the tattoo
when she was with me,

649
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,554
I would've seen it too.

650
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,932
There are three people who were

651
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,559
left alone with her
on the rooftop that night.

652
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,145
Lieutenant Han, Detective Jang

653
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,106
and Mr. Yoon.

654
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,906
Lieutenant Han and Detective Jang
can't have any tattoos.

655
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:45,451
Had they had tattoos, they wouldn't have
been able to become police officers.

656
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,705
I'm sorry.

657
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,518
The person Ms. Young saw

658
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,812
is Mr. Yoon.

659
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,258
Just a second, please.
We'll need to inspect you.

660
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:45,928
Stop right there!

661
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,431
Hey! We found him!

662
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,641
-He's going to the second floor.
-Stop right there!

663
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,331
We found the suspect!
Moving to the transportation center!

664
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:19,837
Stop!

665
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,132
Stop right there!

666
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,093
Gosh, what's going on?

667
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,892
ALL EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

668
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,987
STRANGER

669
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,949
-Why did you kill him?
-Because I had to.

670
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,117
Why at the airport of all places?
Is it a coincidence?

671
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,412
Is 80 billion won going to be donated

672
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,830
-to my foundation?
-By whose order?

673
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,166
It'll be brought to trial soon.

674
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,168
It can't be brought up by anyone.

675
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,711
What is he up to?

676
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,171
Why did you kill Eun-soo Young?

677
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,297
Who is that son of bitch?

678
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,175
It'd be meaningless
to take down just a tip of the iceberg.

679
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,928
On the day Eun-soo was killed,
the file disappeared.

680
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:17,848
If she was killed while possessing it...
Si-mok, is this really a coincidence?

681
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,895
