YONGNAM BEACH DROWNING CASE

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,052
MARCH 7, 2019 AT APPROXIMATELY 20:00
YONGNAM BEACH, TONGYEONG

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,596
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

6
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,601
TAKEN AT 19:47 ON MARCH 7, 2019

7
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,397
TAKEN AT 19:53 ON MARCH 7, 2019

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,526
TAKEN AT 19:53 ON MARCH 7, 2019

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,488
TAKEN AT 19:47 ON MARCH 7, 2019

10
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,281
TAKEN AT 19:55 ON MARCH 7, 2019

11
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,994
TAKEN AT 19:55 ON MARCH 7, 2019

12
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,704
The owner lives in an apartment building.

13
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,498
This is an old house,

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,624
but it's a guesthouse now.

15
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,167
The owner used to live here,

16
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,002
but now they just rent the place out.

17
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,506
Had the owners lived here,

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,633
they would've heard
those students going out.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,095
It gets quite busy here
during the peak season.

20
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,890
But it was cold that day,

21
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,518
and there's no witness because of the fog.

22
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,145
Thank goodness someone heard them.

23
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,439
-We should be grateful for that.
-Where was that?

24
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,777
An elderly lady lives alone
in that house over there.

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,570
She heard them talking outside

26
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,490
when her favorite show was about to start
at around eight o'clock.

27
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,368
They probably shouted
something like, "Let's go to the beach!"

28
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,329
Did you write that in your report?

29
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,413
Of course, I did.

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,165
What else would I write about?

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,167
TAKEN AT 19:55 ON MARCH 7, 2019

32
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,129
According to the broadcasting station,

33
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,465
the evening drama
began at 8:06 p.m. on March 7,

34
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,301
which means those students
went to the beach

35
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,555
after the couple from Seoul
cut the restriction line.

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,099
It only takes about
two to three minutes by foot

37
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,018
from the guest house to the beach.

38
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,395
ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH
19:00-20:30

39
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,115
Yes, this is the Tongyeong Branch Office.
I called earlier.

40
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,825
Is Prosecutor Ryu Si-yeong not in yet?

41
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,081
I was told he would be in today
even though today is a holiday.

42
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,711
I'm sorry,

43
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,629
but could you give me Mr. Ryu's number?

44
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,926
Then could you give him my number instead?

45
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,053
Yes, this number.

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,724
Please pass it along right away.

47
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,817
-This looks so good.
-The institutional investors

48
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,486
will attend the general meeting
of shareholders

49
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,864
to vote against the reappointment
of Chairman Choi.

50
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,616
Moving on to the next story.

51
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,243
The identity of the high-ranking
police officer

52
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,078
who leaked information about a case

53
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,955
the prosecution was investigating

54
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,749
has been revealed as
Director Kim Myeong-han,

55
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,251
the Senior Superintendent General
of the Intelligence Bureau.

56
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,295
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
disclosed his name

57
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,839
at the press briefing
which took place just now

58
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,133
and stated that an investigation
will be launched.

59
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,888
INTELLIGENCE BUREAU

60
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,858
Did you just get here?

61
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,902
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,280
Did something happen
at the Reformation Unit?

63
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,490
No. I don't think anyone is there now.

64
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,409
Then what's the matter?

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,329
I wanted to ask you if you were okay,

66
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,707
but how could you be?

67
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,675
The Director of
the Intelligence Bureau at HQ

68
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,260
is the commander of all commanders.

69
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,472
It's the most important position that
a senior superintendent general can hold.

70
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,601
-Right.
-Only one person in the Blue House

71
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,271
can open the sealed reports
submitted by him,

72
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,815
making it easy for the prosecution
to target him.

73
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,236
But the people who took him
weren't from the prosecution.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,863
They work on the same floor as we do.

75
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,656
They were from the Investigation Bureau.

76
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,076
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office said
that he'd be summoned.

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,745
So why did our bureau…

78
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,496
The Director told me this story
a while ago.

79
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,876
It was 2011, and the police and
the prosecution were fighting as always.

80
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,089
A young prosecutor said this to him
as soon as he sat down at a meeting.

81
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,800
"You sure have it good now, don't you?"

82
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,805
I know that was a long time ago.

83
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,601
Young prosecutors these days
are polite and courteous.

84
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,772
But we still can't let them
take the Director away.

85
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,526
From what I know,
that has nothing to do with his summons.

86
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,988
Everything is connected.

87
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,702
What will you do, Inspector Han?

88
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,705
-Pardon me?
-If they take me,

89
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,457
will you just wait and see?

90
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,420
I probably won't do anything.

91
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,383
Who'd take you?
Unless they have a death wish.

92
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,974
-I have business to take care of here.
-Yes, ma'am.

93
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,186
As for the Reformation Unit,
keep me updated on every little detail.

94
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,104
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,781
ASSISTANT CHIEF WOO TAE-HA

96
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,329
Hello, Assistant Chief Woo.

97
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,834
Since you're not having a good day,

98
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,710
I'll take some work off your plate.

99
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,547
You won't be seeing
the Director for a while.

100
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,342
What do you mean we snatched him?

101
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,678
We, the police,
want to rectify our own mistakes

102
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,638
by finding out what actually happened.

103
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,811
Anyway, you've been informed.

104
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:18,896
Bye, then.

105
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,953
Prosecutor…

106
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,164
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

107
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,418
What's up?

108
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,006
Non-prosecution? Already?

109
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,800
Yes. They can charge them with
damaging public property,

110
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,302
but there was no way to prove that

111
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,554
the actions of the accused directly
caused the accident.

112
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,390
He's quite the miracle worker, isn't he?

113
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,684
Do you know someone named Oh Ju-seon?

114
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,395
He was formerly a presiding judge
at the High Court.

115
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,066
-Is he their lawyer?
-Well…

116
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,195
I get that it's hard to prove.

117
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,363
And they can decide
not to prosecute the case.

118
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,491
But how could they make
the decision in just a day?

119
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,117
Unless they had nothing else to do.

120
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,245
In most cases, it takes them
at least three months to process anything.

121
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,830
SENIOR INSPECTOR HAN YEO-JIN

122
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,458
Detective Jang was right.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,668
He said they'd get special treatment.

124
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,005
I should file a complaint.

125
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,216
Don't. It'll only irritate the higher-ups.

126
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,760
It can't get any worse than this.

127
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,845
I have to go.

128
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,640
"It can't get any worse than this"?

129
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,185
I guess he's even fallen
out of favor with the people there too.

130
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,531
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS NOW?

131
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,617
STUPID PIGS BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE

132
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,702
Gosh, these jerks…

133
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,710
I can't believe the prosecution gave them
special treatment. How dare they?

134
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,714
As for the Reformation Unit,
keep me updated on every little detail.

135
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,552
Special treatment…

136
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,556
Special treatment…

137
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,990
How did you hear about this?

138
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,326
When did you discover that
there could have been an assailant?

139
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,703
We shouldn't call them that.

140
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,080
They were never indicted after all.

141
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,165
Do you think the prosecution
made the right decision?

142
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,919
This is a residential area.

143
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,005
Please try not to inconvenience
the residents.

144
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,925
I'll answer your questions
after I meet with the bereaved.

145
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,144
I'm so sorry for your loss.

146
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,274
Did you not hear

147
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,944
that someone had removed
the restriction line?

148
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,572
Didn't anyone tell you?

149
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,618
-You see…
-Yes, sir.

150
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,537
I couldn't buy him these shoes.

151
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm his father, but I couldn't even…

152
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,380
But he said it was okay
and that he'd just get a part-time job.

153
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,758
He only got to wear these for a few days…

154
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,803
I'm truly sorry that the prosecution

155
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,222
didn't try harder
to solve your son's case.

156
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,226
Did my son really die
because of those people?

157
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,064
If the prosecution's initial investigation
was inadequate,

158
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,191
can't you get them to reinvestigate it?

159
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,777
The police apprehended the suspects,

160
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,028
but the prosecution…

161
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,948
I'm sorry, but it won't be easy
to get them to revoke their decision.

162
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,956
This is from that afternoon.

163
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,625
Look, my son was alive and healthy.

164
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,922
He was on a trip.

165
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,049
He left the house
saying he was going on a trip.

166
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,176
So why hasn't he come home?

167
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,435
Sir, I'm sorry,

168
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,356
but may I take a look
at the photos of your son?

169
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,513
He was a good son
who sent photos to his family

170
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,889
until his final moments.

171
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,434
But people have criticized him
saying that his death

172
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,102
was caused by his own recklessness.

173
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,020
The bereaved was not even aware

174
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,022
that someone had removed
the restriction line.

175
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:16,110
By disclosing the photos sent by
one of the victims before his death,

176
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,320
the police have implied that
the prosecution

177
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,490
should be held accountable
as they have the authority to close cases.

178
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,702
Though the prosecutor
who first dealt with the case

179
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:28,205
filed a complaint pointing out
the unfairness of the decision,

180
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,833
the case was closed
only a few days after a lawyer

181
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,294
who used to be a judge took the case.

182
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,380
This is the reality of the Prosecution's
service to this country.

183
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,966
Do you think the prosecution conducted
a hasty investigation?

184
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,845
If no change is made to
the prosecution's investigative authority,

185
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,096
such special treatment

186
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,514
will continue to be given

187
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,185
-to its former and current officials.
-This case has reignited the debate

188
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,229
over reform of the police
and prosecution's investigative authority.

189
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,939
Commissioner General Song Jin-gyu

190
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,066
met with Justice Minister Lee Jong-han
earlier today

191
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,943
and suggested
that the prosecution and the police

192
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,112
work together to discuss the issue.

193
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,531
Meanwhile, Chief Prosecutor Kang Won-chul

194
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,158
of the Seoul Eastern District Office

195
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,701
denied the allegations.

196
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,037
Removal of the restriction line
did not cause the accident.

197
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,873
The accident simply took place after that.

198
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,375
If the bereaved decides
to make a motion to revoke

199
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,336
our decision not to prosecute the case,

200
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,546
we will do our best
to help them resolve their concern.

201
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,381
A prosecutor in Tongyeong

202
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,842
filed a complaint regarding
the unfairness of the decision.

203
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,636
We receive such complaints occasionally.

204
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,803
This isn't the first time.

205
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,182
That prosecutor
isn't even in charge of the case.

206
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,227
Also, he did not file a complaint.

207
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,312
All he did was make an inquiry
about the procedures.

208
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,773
What high-ranking officer
visits the bereaved in person?

209
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,027
I bet she was the one who called
all the reporters there.

210
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,278
She's putting on an act.

211
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,113
Yes, it's so obvious.

212
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,075
It's not like they pushed them
into the water.

213
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,786
By that logic,
we should arrest everyone who drives.

214
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,372
-Who knows when they'll cause an accident?
-Exactly.

215
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,634
The interview with the bereaved

216
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,052
is already all over the news.

217
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,555
Everyone is criticizing the prosecution.

218
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,057
"Who is Hwang Si-mok, the prosecutor

219
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,976
who filed a complaint
about the Tongyeong case?"

220
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,603
Hwang Si-mok, that prick…

221
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,607
Do you have the branch chief's number?

222
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,025
Yes, I'll give you his number.

223
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,152
TONGYEONG BRANCH CHIEF

224
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,617

226
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,991
MR. LEE

227
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,456
-Yes, Mr. Lee.
-Mr. Hwang, where are you?

228
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,874
You're not there yet, right?

229
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,835
I'm almost there. Why do you ask?

230
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,254
It looks like you should kill some time.

231
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,964
Pardon?

232
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,717
I was told to tell you
to go to Wonju later.

233
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,094
So I'm staying in Tongyeong?

234
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,474
No. I don't think you need to come back,
but…

235
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,225
Why did you have to file the complaint?

236
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,354
Perhaps you'd like to speak
with the branch chief yourself?

237
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,564
Okay, I will.

238
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,119
CHUNGJU SERVICE AREA

239
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,205
I've never dealt
with something like this before.

240
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,624
I'm looking into it, so give me some time.

241
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,835
They'll probably let me know
by the end of the day.

242
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,505
I'll call you as soon as I hear from them,

243
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,631
so just go home for now.

244
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,842
Well, it's nice that you get to go home.

245
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,760
Yes, sir.

246
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,465
Be careful!

247
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,260
-Gosh.
-What?

248
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,970
Come on. Let's go!

WOO TAE-HA

251
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,118
Woo Tae-ha.

252
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,043
Hello?

253
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,587
-Is this the prosecutor Hwang Si-mok?
-Yes, speaking.

254
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,922
You saw my business card, right?

255
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,257
-Yes, I did.
-Can we meet now?

256
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,428
It'll take me about two hours
to get there.

257
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,055
Come to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

258
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,516
Yes, sir.

259
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,363
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

260
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,533
I'm here to see Chief Woo Tae-ha.

261
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,493
You must be prosecutor Hwang Si-mok.

262
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,412
Come on in. He's waiting for you.

264
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,542
Hello, you must be tired
from the long drive.

265
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,503
I'll take your ID card.

266
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,172
I'll register you for the door.

267
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,008
Is that necessary?

268
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,926
Pardon?

269
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,430
You're here. Come in.

270
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,354
CRIMINAL LEGISLATION DIVISION
CHIEF WOO TAE-HA

271
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,858
Hello, sir. I'm Hwang Si-mok.

272
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,777
"Sir"? Please. Just call me chief.

273
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,737
Yes, Chief.

274
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,574
Do you want some coffee?
Did you have dinner?

275
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,242
I actually already had coffee.

276
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,122
You must've heard.

277
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
The council meeting
is right around the corner,

278
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,417
so we made a rushed decision.

279
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,296
-No, I didn't hear anything about it.
-Really?

280
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,381
A decision about what?

281
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,508
Do you know what we do here?

282
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,137
The Criminal Legislation Division…

283
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,058
A temporary organization that
conducts studies on prosecution reform

284
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,352
and reports directly
to the Prosecutor General.

285
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,145
-Yes.
-It's a temporary organization,

286
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,064
but it's been around for nine years,

287
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,108
which is well over
the maximum lifespan of five years.

288
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,444
That tells you
how important this division is.

289
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,821
Why did you want to meet with me?

290
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,616
A Police-Prosecution Council
will be formed soon

291
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,619
at the suggestion
of the Commissioner General.

292
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,162
We can no longer put it off.

293
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,414
The prosecution has been overseeing

294
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,584
police investigations fairly
from the moment we were established,

295
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,504
but the police have been protesting it.

296
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,173
Each time a new administration
takes over, they complain about it.

297
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,050
For us,
it wasn't even worth talking about.

298
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,886
It's like a turf war.

299
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,264
This is our territory,
and we have full control over it,

300
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,765
so we could ignore their complaints.

301
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,726
But this time, it's a little different.

302
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,812
As you know, their voice is
too loud to be ignored.

303
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,731
They're demanding that our authority
and influence should be curtailed.

304
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,860
Hasn't the government already
proposed a bill for the reformation?

305
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,405
Why would we hold
a separate meeting over this?

306
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,074
Then should we just accept
that ridiculous reform bill?

307
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,535
You have a hard time accepting
other things,

308
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,161
but not that?

309
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,918
Will I be joining
the Police-Prosecution Council then?

310
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,672
You were supposed to transfer
to the Wonju Branch Office, right?

311
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,631
Yes.

312
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,633
How about
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office instead?

313
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,219
It's a promotion
that others only dream about.

314
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,597
But why am I suddenly being promoted?

315
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,224
I wonder that myself.

316
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,602
Some were even strongly against it
when your name came up.

317
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,648
So you'd better do a good job,
Mr. Hwang Si-mok.

318
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,192
Understood, sir.

319
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,154
The first meeting is just around
the corner. Get ready.

320
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,415
I know this is sudden.
Do you have a place to stay?

321
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,375
-Where's your family?
-In Seoul.

322
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,754
Great. Then you can go visit your mother.
I'm sure it's been a while.

323
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:20,881
Yes, sir.

324
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,811
See you tomorrow.

325
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,646
See you.

I wonder that myself.

331
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,663
Some were even strongly against it

-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

335
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,727
I'm sorry, but could you
make us some coffee?

336
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,271
It's okay, sir.
I just came by to say hello.

337
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,273
All right.

338
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,239
Have a seat.

339
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,409
So you've managed to return to Seoul.

CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG WON-CHUL

341
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,080
No, actually…

342
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,749
It's the Supreme Prosecutors' Office,
congratulations are in order.

343
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,001
So many prosecutors dream of working there

344
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,463
but struggle to even
get a foot in the door.

345
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,633
Is that why you were against me joining

346
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,718
the Police-Prosecution Council?

347
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,221
That's refreshing.

348
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,889
Because I'm jealous that you'll be

349
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,809
working at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
when I never had the chance to?

350
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,061
No. I know you'd never think that,

351
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,939
but I wasn't sure why you were against it.

352
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,691
Do you know why you were chosen?

353
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,900
Sit down.

354
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,028
The police picked you.

355
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,075
They wanted to bring you in as an advisor.

356
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,412
They recommended you as someone

357
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,913
who'd turn the council's proposal

358
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,582
into a bill before submitting it
to the National Assembly.

359
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,960
The Chief of the Intelligence Bureau,

360
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,545
I'm sure you know her. Choi Bit.

361
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,505
The woman who visited the bereaved

362
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,048
with the reporters and put on a show.

363
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,675
I bet it was her who recommended you.

364
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,844
But instead of just serving as an advisor,

365
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,722
I've become a member
of the Criminal Legislation Division.

366
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,641
An eye for an eye.
If they intercept, we'll do the same.

367
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,229
Why do you think the police chose you?

368
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,481
You're not a good fit for the council.

369
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,734
We need someone

370
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,820
who will protect our authority
at all costs.

371
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,450
This is the fourth time the police
and prosecution are butting heads

372
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,953
over the right of criminal procedure.
And not once have we let the police

373
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,873
take any of our rights away from us.

374
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,793
So if you join the council
and let them walk all over you,

375
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,796
you'll be the biggest disgrace

376
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,715
in the prosecution's 70-year history.

377
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,260
But we handed over the rights to initiate

378
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,596
-and conduct investigations in 2011.
-Goodness.

379
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,557
You can't think like that
if you want to win this fight.

380
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,684
Think about what happened back then.

381
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,644
This is just between us,

382
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,356
but the police have to initiate
and carry out investigations anyway.

383
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,441
The reform we agreed to in 2011?

384
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,943
All we did was turn the law into reality.

385
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,529
Even so,
many of us were strongly against it.

386
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,699
The chiefs and even the Prosecutor General
wrote resignation letters to protest.

387
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,828
But this time, the police are demanding
the right to close all cases.

388
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,705
And they don't want to be
under our command.

389
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,834
If the Criminal Legislation Division
fails to do their job,

390
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,921
they're going to have to resign.

391
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,843
Assistant Chief Woo
obviously thinks you're a good fit

392
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,221
because of all your accomplishments

393
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,931
and stellar recommendations.

394
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,016
You look like the perfect employee.

395
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,146
But you know how it'll end, Hwang Si-mok.

396
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,860
You're a sharp knife
that should only be used for tough jobs.

397
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,488
They'll swing the knife
until the blade is chipped

398
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,031
and when they end up with a cut,

399
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,326
they'll say that the knife is dangerous
and shove it back into the drawer.

400
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,371
You've been through it already.

401
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,540
However,

402
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,876
I can't stay inside the drawer forever.

403
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,670
And I may find the answer this time.

404
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,880
The answer to what?

405
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,760
What is your question?

406
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,637
More importantly,

407
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,682
was it special treatment?

408
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,101
Are you done saying hello?

409
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,729
Was it because he used to be
a presiding judge?

410
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,565
You're not as sharp as you used to be,
are you?

411
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,276
Had we indicted them,
it would have been overkill.

412
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,570
But how do you know that?

413
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,697
Did you have time to review everything
in just a day?

414
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,575
What would change
if I reviewed the case for three months?

415
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,494
Yes, so they did remove
the restriction line.

416
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,955
But is that a crime equal to murder?

417
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,583
In order to prosecute this case,

418
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,918
we have to prove that the removal
of the restriction line

419
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,378
directly caused the drowning.

420
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,504
But how would we do that?

421
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,006
How would we prove

422
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,509
that they damaged the line
to lure specific individuals to the beach

423
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,887
so that they would drown?

424
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,723
We can't prove that
unless we distort the facts.

425
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,975
They're not some brutal criminals.

426
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:32,353
If we indict them for something
as childish as this,

427
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,939
isn't that an abuse of power
and an infringement of human rights?

428
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,776
My question isn't about
the non-prosecution decision.

429
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,155
"The process doesn't matter
if the outcome is the same."

430
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,740
I know that's not how you think,

431
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,910
so why was the process completely ignored?

432
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,206
And you're right.
They're not heinous criminals.

433
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,374
Like you said,
they're just an immature couple.

434
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,502
For people like that,

435
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:59,088
don't you think there's a huge difference
between three months and just a day?

436
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,134
Are you trying to say that I gave them
some kind of preferential treatment?

437
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,553
You're saying the same thing
as the police.

438
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,264
No, I'm trying to say that
you robbed them of an opportunity?

439
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,392
An opportunity to reflect on what they did
and what kind of outcome

440
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,770
their childish prank could cause

441
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,732
during a prolonged investigation.
A chance to feel remorse, shall I say?

442
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,693
Now, they probably think

443
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,779
that they can get away with anything.

444
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,324
You, of all people, know that similar
accidents are very likely to occur again

445
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,535
in cases like this.

446
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,837
It looks like you'll need a good lawyer.

447
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,217
Oh, dear.

448
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,601
It says that you colluded
with the deceased

449
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,937
and glorified a murderer

450
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,981
in return for information
on Hanjo's corrupt deeds.

451
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,863
Criminal Lee Chang-jun who had no way out

452
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,323
had no choice but to take his own life.

453
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,783
INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE FAMILY ALONE

454
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,579
And you cut him a deal,
knowing that his life was at stake

455
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,581
just to make a contribution.

456
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,344
How could those bastards
insult the deceased like this?

457
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,013
You just watch.

458
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,182
I'll take Hanjo down first.

459
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,310
Sungmoon will be next.

460
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,978
Why continue to deal with Hanjo yourself?

461
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,980
Why not hand them over
to the central office?

462
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,316
What kind of a question is that?

463
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,401
All offices are free
to investigate corporations.

464
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,862
The Hanjo HQ is under our jurisdiction.

465
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,655
I've done so much work for it.

466
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,241
Also, don't you think this is unfair?

467
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,871
Sungmoon's CEO
obviously hasn't learned his lesson.

468
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,292
It's my first day of work

469
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,754
so I'll get going.

470
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,505
Alright.

471
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,927
Woo Tae-ha has a pretty big mouth.

472
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,887
How could he tell you that I opposed?

473
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,973
He didn't tell me who it was.

474
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,809
Whatever the opinion, it had to be someone
who knows me.

475
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,104
And the only person
who could say anything to influence

476
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,190
an assistant chief
in the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

477
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,942
is you.

478
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,413
Of course, I can say something.

479
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,708
The problem is that
he's so high and mighty

480
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,919
so he won't listen to me.

481
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,253
LEE CHANG-JUN'S DEATH
GLORIFIED BY HIS PROSECUTOR COLLEAGUE

482
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,636
Getting someone from the Direct Tax
Department is the most urgent issue.

483
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,888
We can get a former auditor
of the National Tax Service.

484
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,181
Why would we do that?

485
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,934
Because we're about to go to court
for canceling additional fees.

486
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,521
Mr. Yoo was the most influential
in the Direct Tax department

487
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,439
when it comes to corporate taxes.

488
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:07,360
Ms. Lee, the Direct Tax Department is
just a part of the National Tax Service.

489
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,779
Power is what matters
when it comes to non-executive positions.

490
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,698
Mr. Yoo is an expert

491
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,325
when it comes to tax exemption.

492
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:21,207
Bringing either of them is illegal, right?

493
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,461
We'll be violating
the Public Service Ethics Act

494
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,797
whichever one we hire, won't we?

495
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,966
Yes, that's right.
They were both higher than grade 4

496
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,093
and their former jobs are connected
to our company.

497
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,471
So we can only hire them when it's been
three years since their retirement.

498
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,724
-Don't be stupid!
-Pardon?

499
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,686
Who would hire anyone
who's been retired for three years?

500
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,230
Don't you know why companies prefer
former public officials?

501
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,190
Just bring them both in.

502
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,401
-Yes, ma'am.
-Understood.

503
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,073
The lawyer who got special treatment at
the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office,

504
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,116
what was his name?

505
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,535
It's Oh Ju-seon.

506
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,371
He was a Presiding Judge
at the Seoul High Court

507
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,624
so his work is connected to the trial
of the former Chairman Lee Yun-beom.

508
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,128
So bringing any one of them is a violation
of the Public Service Ethics Act?

509
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,506
Yes. If you announce bringing all three
at the stockholders' meeting,

510
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,050
it'll cause a problem.

511
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,218
Isn't there anyone we can use out there?

512
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,803
We need a lawyer.

513
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,680
The Eastern District Prosecutors' Office

514
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,767
is out to get us. We need someone who can
overpower their chief prosecutor.

515
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,936
Then how about bringing Mr. Oh first?

516
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,773
-We can bring the others--
-Preparing for the lawsuit comes first.

517
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,317
There's over 100 billion won
to account for.

518
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,321
-And Hanjo Distribution?
-They decided to side with Lee Sung-jae.

519
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,244
Call the president of Hanjo Distribution.

520
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,330
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,414
Good work, everyone.

522
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,571
Yes?

523
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,450
This article was released
just before the meeting.

524
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,666
The last article was about how you used
your husband

525
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,877
to get rid of the former Chairman
and your half-brother.

526
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,546
This is the second article.

527
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,382
And I heard that the president
of Sungmoon Daily

528
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,510
and Lee Sung-jae met yesterday.

529
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,304
Are they

530
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,599
still outside the door?

531
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,268
They all left.

532
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,603
Those idiots!

533
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,355
Is this the piece of trash article

534
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,400
the best those idiots can come up with?

535
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,778
They're company presidents,
but all they can do

536
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,573
is talk behind people's backs, drink,
backstab, and get jealous.

537
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,576
Once I secure my share,
I'm going to get rid of them all!

538
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,207
You could meet with the president
of Sungmoon Daily…

539
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,921
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee. But…

540
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,591
You should think about it.

541
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,680
Instead…

542
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,892
Yes?

543
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,313
Contact the Chief Prosecutor of
the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

544
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,065
He already refused

545
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,111
but I'll ask again.

546
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,755
LEE CHANG-JUN'S DEATH
GLORIFIED BY HIS PROSECUTOR COLLEGE

547
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,384
DID CHAIRWOMAN LEE YEON-JAE
REALLY NOT KNOW?

548
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,911
SEO DONG-JAE

549
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,796
Prosecutor Seo.
It's our first time meeting, right?

550
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,714
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

551
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,343
I'm Seo Dong-jae from the
Uijeongbu District Prosecutors' Office.

552
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,137
There's nothing nice about meeting
for the first time.

553
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,722
You called me out of the blue and said

554
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,432
I'd be interested in something.
What is it?

555
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,393
Well, I'll get straight to the point.

556
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,687
It's about Chief Choi Bit of the police.

557
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,649
Sir, I came all the way here.

558
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,526
Why would I beat around the bush?

559
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,111
I'll tell you everything.

560
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,530
Among us prosecutors,

561
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,949
no one believes that the police
brought up the Tongyeong case

562
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,284
because they were sympathetic.

563
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,828
There are thousands
of drowning accidents a year.

564
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,622
I belong to the Criminal Division One
at the Uijeongbu office.

565
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,582
And the Namyangju Police Station

566
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,459
is within our jurisdiction.

567
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,420
And Choi Bit

568
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,171
was the Chief there until a year ago.

569
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,718
-Is that so?
-Yes. And, Sir,

570
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,137
do you remember the name, Park Gwang-su?

571
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,015
He was the Chief Prosecutor of
the office in Daejeon.

572
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,154
Park Gwang-su…

573
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,614
Why is that name so familiar?

574
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,409
Because he died.

575
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,414
In a remote road in Namyangju

576
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,916
in April 2018 to be exact.

577
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,420
He was someone who couldn't drink
a drop of alcohol.

578
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,965
When I was at my former office, he gave
a lecture on narcotics-related crime.

579
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,051
We had a gathering after,
but he didn't drink at all.

580
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,095
He said his body can't break down alcohol,

581
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,722
and that he can't tolerate any alcohol.

582
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,723
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

583
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,475
But he died from a heart attack.

584
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,728
They said he died suddenly
while drinking and driving.

585
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,481
So it wasn't a DUI accident?

586
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,942
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

587
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,820
No, they found alcohol in his body,
but it was only a small amount.

588
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,157
And it wasn't a car accident. The autopsy
revealed that it was a heart attack.

589
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,242
He was already a bit ill.

590
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,869
Are you saying he was

591
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,789
having an affair with Choi Bit
or something?

592
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,998
Of course not.

593
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,542
Then what does that have to do
with Chief Choi?

594
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,670
The late Park Gwang-su's wife
made an objection.

595
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,881
A death from an illness
isn't even a real case.

596
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,925
So Namyangju Police Station
closed it quickly.

597
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,468
But Mr. Park's wife

598
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,012
made an objection,
saying her husband would never

599
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:50,971
drink and drive.

600
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,390
Well, she was his wife.

601
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,476
But it wasn't mentioned
in the report I received.

602
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,936
-About him drinking?
-No,

603
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,687
the fact that she made an objection.

604
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,856
Not only did they not conduct
further investigations,

605
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,942
but they also left out the part
about the objection

606
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,652
in their report on the case.

607
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,153
How did you know that it was missing

608
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,863
when they didn't report it?

609
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,990
Well, as Mr. Park's junior,

610
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,784
I went to his funeral, of course.

611
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,494
I met his wife and heard it from her.

612
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,162
So as the prosecutor in charge,

613
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,248
I questioned the Namyangju Police Station

614
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,333
-about what they did.
-I see.

615
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,962
So this is where Chief Choi comes in.

616
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,964
Did she use her authority to manipulate

617
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,841
something within the station?

618
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,384
You're really amazing.

619
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:32,513
Yes, she was the one behind it all.

620
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,392
Isn't it strange?

621
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,521
Why did they have to cover up
a common death from an illness?

622
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,190
Why did a police chief cover up

623
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,942
the death of a former chief prosecutor?

624
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,538
So?

625
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,250
If you want,

626
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,794
I can find

627
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,421
the truth.

628
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,883
What do you mean? You didn't
find out when it happened?

629
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,510
It's how I was able to even step
into your office

630
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,803
at the perfect moment.

631
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,680
If I'd revealed everything then,

632
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,765
we wouldn't have any cards to play
against Chief Choi

633
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,226
at a time like this
when she's vocally criticizing us.

634
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,024
-"Cards"?
-Yes.

635
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,527
Don't be ridiculous.

636
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,404
Sir, these are the resumes.

637
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,740
-You'll need these--
-Do you think this is a casino?

638
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,993
Who's in there?

639
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,953
I'm not sure.

640
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,084
If this were a gamble,

641
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,961
I wouldn't have come.

642
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,757
The media's been flooded with news
about prosecutors

643
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,259
causing issues these days.
Do you think this is a coincidence?

644
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,179
The police are using the media
to discredit us.

645
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,556
Do you think your juniors
and all the young prosecutors

646
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,725
can feel any kind of motivation
with that going on?

647
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,809
The police are doing this

648
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,687
because they know.
This is the perfect chance.

649
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,398
The prosecution is being criticized
more than ever now.

650
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,567
So they're risking everything
to grab the opportunity

651
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,610
to overpower us.

652
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,654
I'm sorry sir,

653
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,658
but you're at a bigger disadvantage
than any other authority so far

654
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,369
when it comes to suppressing the police.

655
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,871
Don't get me wrong.
It's not because of you.

656
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,790
It's the situation we're in now.

657
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,002
If this were a gamble, I wouldn't be here.

658
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,921
I would go somewhere that needs me.

659
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,422
Why would I waste my time elsewhere?

660
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,800
But the Criminal Legislation Division
needs me.

661
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,760
You need me.

662
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,262
I'll hold the cards for you

663
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,888
and deal them out.

664
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,557
I'm sure it won't happen,

665
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,184
but if my actions cause trouble,

666
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,436
then I'll take full responsibility.

667
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,106
Everything will end with me

668
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,025
and I'll make sure no one knows
that we even met.

669
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,612
Why use the same tactics as the police

670
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,281
and stick to exposing petty mistakes?

671
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,534
The citizens hate the prosecution,
but they distrust the police even more.

672
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,787
We need dirt on them
that will inflate that distrust.

673
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,502
Are you positive Mr. Park died
from an illness?

674
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,380
Yes. The cause of death
was really a heart attack.

675
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,049
And he already had symptoms
prior to his death.

676
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,467
How is that "corruption"?

677
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,720
A middle-aged man just died
from an illness.

678
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,930
But Chief Choi was the one

679
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,434
who criticized us for ending a case
because a senior was involved.

680
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,769
Hasn't she done the same?

681
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,530
In 2017, a police sergeant
committed suicide in Dongducheon.

682
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,115
They said he had depression.

683
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,785
But the station where he worked
was later busted

684
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,121
for being lenient on an illegal brothel.

685
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,415
And rumors say that the only one

686
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,626
who wasn't in on that was
the officer who died.

687
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,752
So maybe…

688
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,468
A victim's family submitted a petition,
revealing how

689
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,638
a certain chief of a police station
abused their authority.

690
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,556
This case clearly shows that citizens

691
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,601
will be treated unfairly if the police
gain individual investigation rights.

692
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,188
Is digging dirt all you do at work?

693
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:13,400
Well, I see stuff like this all the time
even if I don't look for them.

694
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,319
So, should I look into it?

695
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,530
Leave Chief Choi out of this.

696
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,449
Why?

697
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,077
Do you think we're fooling around here?
Don't bother us.

698
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,537
Why bother with the chief
when we should go after their director?

699
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,375
Then the recent scandal about the director
of the Intelligence Bureau was…

700
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,752
You really are the real deal.

701
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,216
I'll have a look at these.

702
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,261
Oh, thank you.

703
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,639
I'll continue to send you updates.

704
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,437
Alright, then.

705
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,611
Thank you for your time.

706
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,446
I'll visit you again, sir.

707
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,791
What are you doing here?

708
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,878
Hello.

709
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:16,839
Right.

710
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,132
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

711
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,222
It's been a while, hasn't it?

712
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,724
-How long have you been here?
-Not long.

713
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,601
Right. This is great.

714
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,478
It must have been rough in Tongyeong.

715
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,733
Well, I'm a bit busy. I'll call you.

716
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,534
Why is he working here?

717
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,454
People are desperate for a chance
to work here.

718
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,498
He's one lucky bastard.

719
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,296
Let's begin.

720
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,310
It's been confirmed. The council's
meeting this Thursday.

721
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,562
Finally. We've waited two years.

722
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,898
But I guess we're the only ones

723
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,276
who were looking forward to it.

724
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,360
Is something wrong?

725
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,738
No, not really.

726
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,615
But the size and the members
aren't that great.

727
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,241
What about the size?

728
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,369
Less than ten people.
Just three or four from each side.

729
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,830
There are dozens on our team.
That's way too small.

730
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,168
I guess they're worried that a fight will
break out if there are too many people.

731
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,880
It's better than things getting heated
and losing our chance like last time.

732
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,633
The bigger problem is the members
that were elected for the council.

733
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,385
Members of the
Criminal Legislation Division

734
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,305
and the Investigative Procedure
Reformation Unit can't join the council.

735
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,224
What? Then…

736
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,520
We're the teams that are dealing
with investigative rights.

737
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,855
Does that mean we won't be able to
join the council?

738
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,690
-No.
-That's ridiculous.

739
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,860
We worked on this for years,
and now we can't participate?

740
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,781
Ms. Han.

741
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,825
You're still an officer with
the Yongsan Station, right?

742
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,910
Pardon?

743
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,705
Yes, I was dispatched
from the Yongsan Police Station.

744
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,505
But it's the same for you.

745
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,507
You're the Chief of this team,

746
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,759
but you're also a Chief
in the Intelligence Bureau.

747
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,719
Yes, that's actually my main role.

748
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,223
Both Ms. Han and I are not members
of the Reformation Unit.

749
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,352
Chief, then what about us?

750
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,313
You'll be giving us support.

751
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,783
Sir.

752
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,036
Sir.

753
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,080
Right.

754
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,168
The teams dealing with
investigation rights are banned

755
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,422
from joining the council to ensure
everyone acts in good faith.

756
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,882
What? Then are you not joining, sir?

757
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,301
Of course, I'm joining.

758
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,844
I have a lot of titles, you know.

759
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,972
You too, Mr. Hwang.
We'll say you're from the Wonju office.

760
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,473
No, you really do belong there.

761
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,601
Alright.

762
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,353
A fight is inevitable
whenever there's reform.

763
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,063
If they didn't want us to fight,

764
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,732
they shouldn't have started this.

765
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,985
Anyway, we need another member.

766
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,487
Me, Mr. Hwang, and one more.

767
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,865
Someone not on this team.

768
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,827
Are only three people from the prosecution
allowed in the council?

769
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,537
I'm sure the police will send four.

770
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,789
We don't need more people.

771
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,084
They'll send in high-ranking prosecutors
to join the council.

772
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,713
They're pretending not to be concerned,
but they're at the edge of a cliff too.

773
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,257
Assistant Chief Woo is sure to attend.

774
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,301
He thinks nothing goes right without him.

775
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,345
So we need at least

776
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,513
a superintendent general
to match the ranks.

777
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,432
Has it been decided, then?

778
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,310
The Director of the Investigation Bureau.

779
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,312
You, me, him, and one more.

780
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,566
Who's going to be the fourth member then?

781
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,905
Well, they shouldn't be from
the Police University,

782
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,325
but they shouldn't be low-ranking either.

783
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,785
You know why, right?

784
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:19,456
And it should be an officer who works
in the field, not at headquarters.

785
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,542
And lastly, I don't want them
to be too old.

786
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,462
Up to late-30s is alright.

787
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,048
I don't think there are many officers
who fit those conditions.

788
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,675
You can bring one, right?

789
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,259
You want me to do that?

790
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,429
You know lots of officers in the field.
Get someone like yourself.

791
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,890
-But I'm a Police University graduate--
-Except that part.

792
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,268
We already came up with everything
we need to say,

793
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,770
and we don't need new people.

794
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,148
We just have to show that we care
about officers in the field too.

795
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,066
Alright?

796
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,987
LEE CHUNG-HYEON
KANG GI-HEON

797
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,114
CHOI SANG-MUK
PARK HYE-SU

798
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,324
Prosecutor Park Jae-yeon from Daegu.

799
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,619
Are you going to summon her from Daegu
whenever there's a meeting?

800
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,745
PARK J

801
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,123
How about Prosecutor Ko Won-jun?

802
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,958
Can't you find anyone better?

803
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,970
Assistant Chief Prosecutor Kim Sa-hyun.

804
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,140
Dispatched from
the Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

805
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,602
KIM SA-HYUN

806
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,023
He works with the National Assembly,
so he'll know a lot of members there.

807
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,608
Even if the council reaches an agreement,

808
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,569
the National Assembly has the final say.

809
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,488
So if he joins us in the council,

810
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,699
we'll have an advantage. Don't you agree?

811
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,702
Alright, then.

812
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,037
Sir, wasn't the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee

813
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,373
involved in a lobbying scandal?

814
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,500
Members of the National Assembly
contacted them

815
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,335
to ask the prosecution for favors.

816
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,590
Blame the ones who made the requests.
Mr. Kim had nothing to do with it.

817
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,635
A dispatched judge accepted a request
through the committee

818
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,053
and manipulated a trial,

819
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,097
so that particular dispatch system
was abolished,

820
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,643
and I heard the same will happen
with prosecutors soon…

821
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,569
Ask the Deputy Prosecutor General
for an approval

822
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,945
to have Kim Sa-hyun transferred

823
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,739
Yes, sir.

824
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,994
We can discuss what to say
at the council meeting

825
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,497
when Mr. Kim joins us.

826
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:29,544
We can all agree that we need a unit
for the corruption of senior officials.

827
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:33,465
JUDICIAL RESEARCH AND TRAINING INSTITUTE
28TH CLASS

828
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,053
Where will the council meet?

829
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,598
-We'll probably meet here.
-We'll meet here, of course.

830
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,436
We called for the council first,
and they accepted.

831
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,854
So it's obvious that we meet here.

832
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,318
-Hello.
-Are you done?

833
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,903
Yes. Good work, everyone.

834
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,488
We'll go, then.

835
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,625
It looks as if your director
can't avoid getting arrested.

836
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,003
The prosecution isn't backing down?

837
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,716
It's strange though.
Why are they overreacting

838
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,593
about leaking a little information?

839
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,888
They're just trying to intimidate us

840
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,307
by making us seem corrupt.

841
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,979
No. A while ago, a judge was caught

842
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,355
showing case files to his wife.

843
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,316
His wife was a lawyer.
They were only reprimanded for it.

844
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,570
And the prosecutor who leaked
statement records only paid a fine.

845
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,865
Seeing how they obsess over the director
of the Intelligence Bureau,

846
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,324
it's as if they don't care
what he's charged with.

847
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,079
Someone in the prosecution
must have a personal vendetta against him.

848
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,541
Do you know anything about that?

849
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,130
They're probably just trying to find fault
with anyone they can.

850
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,259
Gosh, those assholes…

851
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,849
Mr. Hwang.

852
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:06,766
Yes?

853
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,227
Are you close with Seo Dong-jae?

854
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,439
I worked with him at
the Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

855
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,276
Is he a reliable person?

856
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,365
It depends on what kind of work it is…

857
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,743
I see.

858
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,829
He seemed rather fishy to me as well.

859
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,337
CASE REPORT

860
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,258
What kind of work
were you thinking of giving him?

861
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:42,928
You can go now.

862
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,804
Yes, sir.

863
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,269
If this works, it's going to give us
a huge advantage.

864
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,319
SUICIDE OF A POLICE SERGEANT
AT SEGOK POLICE STATION

865
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,044
SEGOK POLICE STATION

866
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,476
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE REFORM UNIT

867
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,355
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

868
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:39,109
Hey, Gangwon Province prosecutor.
How are you settling?

869
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,278
What? You're in Seocho-dong?

870
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,239
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

871
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,165
HIGH-RANKING OFFICER VISITS
FAMILY OF TONGYEONG DROWNING VICTIM

872
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,917
Leave Chief Choi out of this.

873
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,839
I'll have a look at these.

874
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:09,180
PROSECUTOR SEO DONG-JAE

875
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,598
ASSISTANT CHIEF WOO TAE-HA

876
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,691
Hello, sir. This is Seo Dong-jae.

877
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,404
Yes, of course.

878
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,614
All right.

879
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:40,795
Yes!

880
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,186
Alright. I'll see you tomorrow.

881
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,812
Chief, can you sign this?

882
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,275
Mr. Hwang applied for a room
in the dormitory.

883
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,736
If you write a statement for him,

884
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,821
he'll be able to get a room sooner.

885
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,573
He wants to live in the dormitory?

886
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,659
But isn't that place for investigators.

887
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,245
I don't think Mr. Hwang

888
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,247
has a place to stay.

889
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,043
He needs a statement for it?
When can he get a room?

890
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,796
I'm not sure.
The waiting list there is pretty long.

891
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,217
Then where did he sleep last night?

892
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,134
Bye.

893
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,977
I thought we'd have to wait forever.

894
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,022
My goodness.

895
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,109
-What about Mr. Kim?
-Drink up.

896
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,777
Come on.

897
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,404
That's ridiculous.

898
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,366
Who would even do something like that?

899
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,119
That doesn't make any sense.

900
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,328
Welcome back.

901
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,164
What's with you?

902
00:56:58,873 --> 00:56:59,874
When…

903
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,006
A pop-up bar would have been better.

904
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:08,758
It's gone now.

905
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,927
How did you know?

906
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,304
Did you move back to your house
in Gongdeok-dong then?

907
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,974
No, it's still being leased right now.

908
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,643
I noticed that the bar was gone
when I came by earlier.

909
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,105
Can we have a bottle of coke and…

910
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,649
Stir-fried octopus or hot pot?

911
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,611
-Stir-fried.
-Stir-fried octopus, please.

912
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,779
Stir-fried octopus!

913
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,416
You're working at the Investigative
Procedure Reformation Unit, right?

914
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:45,253
Yes. What kind of work are you doing
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

915
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,921
Which team is it?

916
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,923
The Criminal Legislation Division.

917
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,098
They're pretending not to be concerned,

918
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,100
but they're at the edge of a cliff too.

919
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,394
Mr. Hwang,

920
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,690
are you joining
the Police-Prosecution Council?

921
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,692
Yes.

922
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,695
A young prosecutor said this to him

923
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,780
as soon as he sat down at a meeting.

924
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,783
"You sure have it good now, don't you?"

925
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,454
You must be the youngest
among the prosecutors there.

926
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:21,998
Yes.

927
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,044
-Come on!
-My gosh!

928
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,463
-Hey!
-Come on.

929
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,048
Goodness.

930
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,768
It seems like the Tongyeong case
is going to stay closed.

931
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,646
Yes, Detective Jang told me

932
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,649
that the family of the victims
wanted the case closed.

933
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,985
I guess they decided that it'll be hard
to overturn the ruling.

934
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,238
Or maybe they received settlement money.

935
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,823
Did the families receive money

936
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,408
from the ones who cut the line?

937
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,078
Considering there were two victims

938
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,539
from separate families, the case
was closed very quickly.

939
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,706
They very well could have.

940
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:08,169
The families didn't seem to be
wealthy from what I saw in the news.

941
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,296
Oh, the one with our team chief?

942
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,761
I reported it.

943
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,429
The special treatment
in the Eastern Office.

944
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,934
You didn't make anything up.
I did file a complaint after all.

945
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,270
Right…

946
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,983
Well, I…

947
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,904
Your food is ready now.

948
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,784
What?

949
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,122
Let's eat.

950
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,712
Do you know anything about
the Segok Police Station?

951
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:51,629
Segok?

952
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,424
Yes. In the shower there…

953
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,262
Hang on.

954
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:02,849
Yes, Chief.

955
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,062
No, I haven't met Assistant Chief Kim.

956
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,818
Well, I'm actually…

957
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:20,366
-Oh, are you two there together right now?
-Is he asking for you? Go ahead.

958
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,284
One moment, sir.

959
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,496
Go. I'm going to eat all of this
by myself.

960
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,209
Yes, I'll be there right away.

961
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:34,839
I'm sorry.

962
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,761
I have a feeling that we'll be seeing
more of each other from now on.

963
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,222
Right.

964
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,559
-Well, then.
-Alright.

965
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,331
Excuse me!

966
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,208
-Could I have some rice?
-Okay.

967
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:57,922
Sit.

968
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,022
Sir, are you…

969
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:19,110
If you want Si-mok and me
to work on this together…

970
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,611
I mean, I'll do fine alone.

971
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,615
You brought it to our office,
so we should take care of it.

972
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,789
Let's say a police officer
murdered his colleague.

973
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,291
If that were true,
what do you think is going to happen?

974
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,836
I saw him kill himself

975
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,255
with my own eyes!

976
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,800
Did Sergeant Song get along well
with the rest of the team?

977
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,261
One of the people involved in the case
is still in the field.

978
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,555
Transfers like this hardly happen.

979
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,976
Using him like that could cause trouble.

980
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,561
You have to use him wisely.

981
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:40,608
A possibility of homicide
wasn't suggested at the time,

982
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:43,820
so why is it brought up now? And how?

983
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:51,828
