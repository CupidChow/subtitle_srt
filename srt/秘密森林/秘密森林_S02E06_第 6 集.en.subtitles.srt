-Oh, really?
-Go to Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial

00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,635
-Hey!
-Police Agency immediately.

5
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,471
They will give you a file.

6
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,139
And don't open it.

7
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,726
She asked why you chose this place
as your next stop.

8
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,729
It's under seven percent.
Must we be whipped around like this?

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,148
Mr. Lee has notified us
of a bylaw amendment.

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,568
I think you should meet
the CEO of Sungmoon Daily.

11
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,571
How dare he sue me?

12
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,406
It'll only take a minute.

13
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,326
I'm certain she's not here on her own.

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,287
Whether it's for the director
or for Choi Bit, she brought something.

15
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,372
Find out what it is.

16
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,167
You were directly involved in covering up
Assemblyman Nam's corruption.

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,212
That's why you had to run here yourself,

18
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,547
while the director who was sued didn't.

Just bring it, all right?

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,120
-You peeked inside the envelope, right?
-No.

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,708
But why aren't you asking any questions?

28

56
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,963
Hello.

57
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,381
So she wasn't running away.

58
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,010
-Pardon?
-Han Yeo-jin asked me earlier today

59
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,387
why I thought I should visit
Anyang Correctional Institution next.

60
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,639
What do you think she meant?

61
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,974
You mean Officer Kim Su-hang?

62
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,145
Hello?

63
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,023
Hey, how did you know?

64
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,986
If we shouldn't have visited Anyang
after seeing Captain Baek,

65
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,406
it would mean there was someone else
who holds the key to the case.

66
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,453
And that was after
we met with Captain Baek,

67
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,331
so the only person
who can be that crucial in the case

68
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,292
is Officer Kim, the guy
who first found Sergeant Song dead.

69
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,002
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

70
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,755
Officer Kim's uncle is the former chief
of Dongducheon Police Station.

71
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,175
We must get him first. But there's
no address, which is even more suspicious.

72
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,346
Wouldn't the police be able
to track him down faster?

73
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,682
Han Yeo-jin can't beat us to it again.

74
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,018
Just wait and see
who finds him first, okay?

77
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,547
Yes, sir.

78
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,675
Mr. Seo, can you meet me now?

79
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,927
Of course! Where are you, sir?

80
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm at a karaoke lounge now.

81
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,683
I need you to come.
You didn't drink, right?

82
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,853
Even if I did, I'd be more than happy
to drink more with you, sir.

83
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,897
I'm not calling you for a drink.

84
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,693
I'm at the reunion. They want
to go for another round of drinks.

85
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,071
Most of the guys from the office are here,

86
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,282
and none of them is sober enough to drive.

87
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,783
So you need me to drive?

88
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,455
Sure. No problem, sir.
I'll be there right away.

89
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,314
Damn it.

90
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,499
This place is usually busy.

91
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,876
I had them empty the place.

92
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,548
How have you been?

93
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,385
You know how I've been doing.

94
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,763
Or shall I say,
"I'm sure you've heard everything"?

95
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,144
Why did you ask to meet me
when you clearly know who my source is?

96
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,023
I was curious when it was that you
completely lost your business ethics.

97
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,902
You're not supposed to
buy out your competitor's shares.

98
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,322
-What's your ulterior motive?
-There's no ulterior motive.

99
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,075
It's just an investment.

100
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,787
As you know, Hanjo's stock prices
hit rock bottom a while back.

101
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,623
But I knew it'd never go belly up
as it was still a leading company.

102
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,377
And I was right.
The stock prices keep going up,

103
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,754
and it's not like
I'm in urgent need of cash.

104
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,048
That's why I haven't sold them.

105
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,385
Do you think I didn't buy Sungmoon's stock
because I have no money?

106
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,471
That's what I've been hearing.

107
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,477
Of course, I'm sure your funds
haven't actually dried up.

108
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,397
You're suing the government saying
that you can't afford to pay the fines.

109
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,233
So if you spend a fortune
just to protect your management rights,

110
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,236
the government
will want to audit you again.

111
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,409
I'm sure it's tough
to act like you're financially struggling.

112
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,180
Let's just drink. It's been a while.

113
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,598
Okay, let's drink first.

114
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,823
What do you want me to do?

115
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,535
What do you mean?

116
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,204
How much longer
are you going to side with Sung-jae?

117
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,706
Sung-jae and I were always close.

118
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,793
And even if we weren't,
I'd try to befriend him

119
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,045
because he'll soon become
the chairman of Hanjo.

120
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,550
-What about me?
-What about you?

121
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,182
How about you tell me
what you want me to do?

122
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,936
I want you to treat me as an entrepreneur.

123
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,438
Like you said,
the company had hit rock bottom.

124
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,358
I'm not just talking about
Hanjo's stock prices or public image.

125
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,569
The actual numbers plunged
after my father was arrested.

126
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,737
Our profits dropped to a third
of what they used to be,

127
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:28,325
and it was hard to secure liquidity,
but I revived the company.

128
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,744
-And look where it is now.
-I know.

129
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,372
The first quarter's total operating profit
was 4.32 trillion won.

130
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,874
It's the highest since Q2 of 2015,

131
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,543
including the years
when my father was at the company.

132
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,544
Chairwoman Lee.

133
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,588
"That bitch needs a lesson

134
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,173
so that she won't hurt the dignity
of other chairwomen."

135
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,926
"She got the position out of pity
because her husband died

136
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,429
and her father is in prison,
so she'd better know her place."

137
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,641
"She must love to watch dramas,
so she thinks running a company is easy.

138
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,186
What's next? Dating an executive director
who's younger than her?"

139
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,105
-Enough.
-"I don't get it.

140
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,232
Must we side with her
just because she's a woman?"

141
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,526
"Resign before the foreign investors
laugh at you

142
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,320
and you ruin the country's reputation."

143
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,780
I said, enough.
Why read those useless comments?

144
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,866
They were posted under your articles!

145
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,203
Under the article about how
I colluded with my husband

146
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,997
to oust my father
and take over the company.

147
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,084
It's just nonsense spewed
by clueless idiots. Why let it get to you?

148
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,052
You said it's an investment.

149
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,304
Then it has to be profitable.

150
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,307
Treat me as an entrepreneur
and evaluate my ability as one

151
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,101
to decide whether Sungmoon Daily
should join hands with me

152
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,187
or continue to side with Sung-jae.

153
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,441
Make a wise decision
as the CEO of a company.

154
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,619
As an entrepreneur,
I'd say your lips are too red.

155
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,500
Tell me about my father's condition.

156
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,798
Tell me about his condition.

157
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,854
Just leave the car there.
I'll drive Ms. Lee home.

158
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,566
Do you want to go back?

159
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,031
To the time

160
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,867
when all you had to do
was be there for your husband.

161
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,914
There's a moment

162
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,417
I want to go back to.

163
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,754
When is it?

164
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,877
I've heard that my father

165
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,504
has anger issues.

166
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,095
Caused by a mix of depression
and misanthropic tendencies,

167
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,472
he can't control his anger.

168
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,642
He used to be good at
keeping his composure.

169
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:50,647
I guess he felt that his arrest
was extremely unfair.

170
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,361
What can we do to make people see that?

171
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,366
If we want to reveal to others
that he's not well…

172
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,036
Should we provoke him?

173
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,414
I feel bad.

174
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,959
Take pictures of how my father is doing.

175
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,588
Him throwing and breaking things
or swearing at people.

176
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,340
It'd be best to capture a moment

177
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,300
when he's furious
while Sung-jae is present.

178
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,928
I'm sure he goes out once in a while.

179
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,930
I want to know which doctor
is visiting him

180
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,432
and what prescriptions he's receiving.
Find out everything.

181
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,602
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:37,236
An investigation that was conducted fairly
is being used as a political tool

183
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,072
just because of the current conflict
over investigative authority.

184
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:44,910
The acquittal means that the prosecution
agrees with Assembly Nam Jae-ik's claim

185
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,205
that the police had conducted
a biased investigation.

186
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,459
Is the prosecution really capable
of making a reasoned judgment?

187
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,086
Due to these allegations,

188
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,838
-Assemblyman Nam Jae-ik…
-What's with him? Why is he going bonkers?

189
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,174
It's all for show.

190
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,177
I guess Chief Choi
gave Nam Jae-ik a good beating.

191
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,720
With what, though?

192
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,600
What intel could someone like
Prosecutor Hwang get from the police?

193
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,103
He won't even be able to say a thing.

194
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,272
Give me a break.

195
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,692
Hey, he gave me an earful
at the National Assembly earlier.

196
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,443
You should've seen it.

197
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,363
He practically scolded me.

198
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,241
Right, I know
he's good at lecturing people.

199
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,495
Han Yeo-jin would be betraying her boss
and leaking police intel if she helped,

200
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,455
so he'll have to beg her.

201
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,415
Even to a friend…

202
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,084
No. It's not something you'd tell anyone,
even your spouse.

203
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,465
What's taking him so long?

204
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,262
SUWON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

205
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,683
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

206
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,686
I was told that someone from the Supreme
Prosecutors' Office showed up

207
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,646
despite not receiving any notices
electronically.

208
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,732
That's why I asked to see you.

209
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,609
Yes. Since I didn't need any copies
of the documents,

210
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,278
I thought it'd be okay to skip that.

211
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,238
I just need to check a few things
in there.

212
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,284
You wouldn't be here at this hour
if it were actually that simple.

213
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,619
Should I call the prosecutor in charge?

214
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,080
No, it's okay.
I just need to check a few records.

215
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,293
We need to inform him that the Supreme
Prosecutors' Office viewed his reports.

216
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,796
Let me put you through to him.
What's it about?

217
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,507
Well, there are 19 cases in total.

218
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,468
You said "a few things."

219
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,513
Right. It's 12 cases
by Criminal Division One,

220
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,767
and three cases by Division Two and Three,
including real estate and arson cases.

221
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,685
And four cases handled by the divisions

222
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,146
in charge of major financial crimes
and industrial crimes.

223
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,940
That's the list I got from
looking up the court's decisions.

224
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,735
I may have to view some of the reports
that predate these.

225
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,403
What is it that you're looking for?

226
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,239
I'll tell you when I find it, sir.

227
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,702
Go to the fourth floor
of the other building.

228
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,454
The room where they
store the trial records.

229
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,540
No, it's likely that
the cases didn't go to trial.

230
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,465
Who's your chief again?

231
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,467
It's Chief Woo Tae-ha, sir.

232
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,553
ASSISTANT CHIEF PROSECUTOR
KIM WON-TAE

233
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,139
Hello? I'm calling from
the Suwon District Prosecutors' Office.

234
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,809
Is Chief Woo Tae-ha in the office
at the moment?

235
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,436
Yes, please.

236
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,108
Hello. I'm Kim Won-tae
from Criminal Division One

237
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,859
at Suwon Prosecutors' Office.

238
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,196
Prosecutor Hwang Si-mok is here now.

239
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,906
He wants to view our case reports.

240
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,243
Please let him know that
it's for what he mentioned earlier today.

241
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,703
Apparently, it's for something
you mentioned earlier today.

242
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,373
But he won't even tell me what it's about.

243
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,383
Okay.

244
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,260
Got it.

245
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,976
Go to the archive storage.

246
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,770
I'll let the staff know.

247
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,647
Thank you, sir.

248
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,081
Could you find these ones here?
I'll look for the rest.

249
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,945
2018, CASE NUMBER 938

250
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,850
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

251
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,200
Hello, Mr. Hwang.

252
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,328
Hello, Ms. Han. Can we meet now?

253
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,456
Where are you?

254
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,333
You said you now live near Namsan,

255
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,876
so I'm headed there now.

256
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,338
Are you busy tomorrow morning?

257
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,883
If you can't meet me now,

258
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,135
we can just talk over the phone.

259
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,852
I'll text you my address.

260
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,938
COPYING FILES

261
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,926
Last summer, five men in their 20s
were charged

262
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:02,013
with illegally filming people
in a changing room at a vacation spot.

263
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,854
Just after this past New Year's Day,

264
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,775
they conducted a crackdown on DUI's
in accident-prone areas

265
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,277
and arrested 37 people in total.

266
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,571
Is it one of them?

267
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,740
Which precinct?

268
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,826
Gyeonggi Nambu Police Agency.

269
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,625
Or is it this?

270
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,962
This February,
Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency

271
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,922
apprehended a drug dealer.

272
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,008
Thanks to his tips, a number of people

273
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,262
including office workers and instructors
were arrested for using illicit drugs.

274
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,811
If Nambu Police Agency had handled a case

275
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,523
that was big enough to pressure someone
who's currently serving as an assemblyman,

276
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,734
it would've been all over the news, right?

277
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,945
It's a case that hardly made any news.

278
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,614
A case that never went to trial
and was quickly forgotten about.

279
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
As for the five men
who partook in illegal filming,

280
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,746
Nambu Provincial Police Agency
only wanted to indict two of them

281
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,123
despite clear evidence
and sent the rest of them

282
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,585
to Suwon District Prosecutors' Office,
exempting them from indictment.

283
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,382
Could Assemblyman Nam's son
have been one of them?

284
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,927
But if you think about it,

285
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,014
even if Assemblyman Nam's son
was exempted from indictment,

286
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:30,101
his name had to be included
in the police report,

287
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,188
so it'd be impossible for the prosecution
to not know about it.

288
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,065
Perhaps Assemblyman Nam was caught
during the DUI crackdown.

289
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,486
In that case, the police could've
removed his name from their report.

290
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,364
But would an assemblyman
who is also the chairman

291
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,534
of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee
feel threatened by a DUI charge?

292
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,412
When an assemblyman is threatening to sue

293
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,123
the Police Intelligence Bureau's director
of all people.

294
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,751
Do you think a DUI charge is big enough?

295
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,962
What if his son was involved?

296
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,884
His illegal employment
had already stirred up controversy,

297
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,260
but what if he also did drugs?

298
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,888
The dealer who was arrested

299
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,390
had multiple drug smuggling charges
prior to his arrest.

300
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,770
But the people who were arrested
following his confession have all been

301
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,105
"insurance," shall I say?

302
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,985
They were all small fish who could
easily be sold off to the detectives.

303
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,612
No VIPs.

304
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,742
I didn't know about those cases.

305
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,703
So it's not one of those cases?

306
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,293
I guess I should do another search.

307
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,921
I've only made it to last year's reports.

308
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,798
I'll do another search.

309
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,302
How far back are you planning to search?

310
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,388
I don't know.

311
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,935
Why did you come to me?

312
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,355
You should've gone to see your boss.

313
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,734
Nam Jae-ik clearly committed the crime
of bribery to get his son the job.

314
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,071
And the police didn't cover it up for him.

315
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,198
So why was he acquitted?

316
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:11,160
You should've met with your boss
and asked him about it first.

317
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,872
I did ask him about it.

318
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,790
I didn't.

319
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,835
I didn't ask her about today,

320
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,503
and I won't ask her tomorrow.

321
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,636
You don't draw these days?

322
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,652
When I saw that the restriction line
was gone,

323
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,240
I thought an accident might happen.

324
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,827
But I just drove by that spot,

325
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,038
without doing anything about it.

326
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,624
Why?

327
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,877
It was very foggy and dark.

328
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,631
I thought, "Only those who want to die
would go into the water on a day like this

329
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,383
and even the restriction line
wouldn't stop them."

330
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,345
I remember thinking that for a moment.

331
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,351
Didn't that thought make you think
you should do something about it?

332
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,147
I can't prevent every suicide.

333
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,778
But it turned out it wasn't suicide.

334
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,695
Right.

335
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,658
I knew that something had gone wrong.

336
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,619
I could see something was wrong,

337
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,413
but I did nothing.

338
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,048
Are you trying to say

339
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,636
that it is our duty
to keep an eye on those restriction lines?

340
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,598
I guess you could say that.

341
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,064
No matter how hard you look,
you can't stop a fog.

342
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,818
And no matter how many criminals
you catch, they never disappear.

343
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,446
If I catch one here,

344
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,657
two others pop up in a different place.

345
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,997
Is that why you left
the Violent Crimes Division?

346
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,836
I didn't leave. My desk is still there.

347
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,923
Right.

348
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,635
Mr. Hwang.

349
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,600
You already have the answer.

350
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,053
I should go to bed.

351
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,638
Staying up won't change anything.

352
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,901
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

353
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,249
DIRECTOR KIM MYEONG-HAN

354
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,377
Was a new director appointed?

355
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,130
Do you need to talk to the new Director?

356
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,970
You weren't here yet

357
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,598
a year and a half ago, right?

358
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,767
Why are you asking about
a year and a half ago?

359
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,604
Assemblyman Nam's son failed
the screening test,

360
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:10,608
but he was hired at a bank
when the competition rate was 193 to 1.

361
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,570
That's before you became a Chief
of the Intelligence Bureau.

362
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,991
Yes, I was at Namyangju Police Station.

363
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,913
Yes. So you probably
weren't aware of how the Police HQ

364
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,874
would deal with an assemblyman

365
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,210
suspected of bribery for illegal hiring.

366
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,005
But you were here
on February 7th this year.

367
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,466
This is where all the intel
from police investigations ends up.

368
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,885
February 7th.

369
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,223
Are you asking if I knew
about the drug dealer?

370
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,474
Yes.

371
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,024
You said you didn't look.

372
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,610
You said you didn't look inside.

373
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,071
I hadn't when you asked me yesterday.

374
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,241
I believed I had to get it to you quickly,

375
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,367
so I didn't stall.

376
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,496
You made a copy.

377
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,916
So you saw it after we left?

378
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,172
You wanted me to see it.

379
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,759
That's not how I remember it.

380
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,220
It was just a USB flash drive.

381
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,723
If there was some sort of a document,

382
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,808
your words would've made sense.

383
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,437
Because I could have read
some kind of confidential info.

384
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,480
But it was a flash drive.

385
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,274
I could have just brought in my hand.

386
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,152
-And don't open it.
-"Don't open it."

387
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,738
-Just bring it, alright?
-"Just bring it."

388
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,866
You said those words on purpose.

389
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,577
You told me not to do something
when you didn't need to

390
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,873
because you knew I'd look.

391
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,710
Then why did you do as I intended?

392
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,337
Why did you drag me into this?

393
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,339
You were closest to
the Gyeonggi Nambu station.

394
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,548
You were in Anyang.

395
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,766
The reformation unit is
just a temporary team.

396
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,562
It will disband as soon as we gain
independent investigative rights.

397
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,566
Ms. Han. Have you thought about
what would happen after that?

398
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,655
Even after the reformation unit disbands,

399
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,992
I'll still be here.

400
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,955
Where would you be?

401
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,584
At a crime scene.

402
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,878
Ms. Han.

403
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,131
In my time, we didn't have
many opportunities.

404
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,967
But what I find more unfortunate is

405
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,053
how capable people lack ambitions.

406
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,514
You know too many people
are in line for promotions.

407
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,184
And is this your way of
solving those problems?

408
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,603
By giving me preferential treatment?

409
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,231
Is committing crimes
considered being ambitious?

410
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,649
What was I supposed to do?

411
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,652
The prosecution's bossed us around
for 70 years.

412
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,903
We were about to be freed,

413
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,406
but then a former prosecutor
became the committee chairman.

414
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,993
No bill can be forwarded without
the consent of the committee chairman.

415
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,619
There's no point in fighting for us

416
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,955
if they can just refuse to consent
on forwarding the bill.

417
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,041
Our higher-ups tried so hard
to place someone on our side there.

418
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,626
Wouldn't they have done the same?

419
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,338
Do you think they put someone under
investigation for bribes on that seat

420
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,465
because they were stupid?

421
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,051
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
was sending a message

422
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,304
to both Nam Jae-ik and the police.

423
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,763
To Nam Jae-ik,

424
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,141
"We'll protect you, so do as we say."

425
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,935
And to us, "There's no point
investigating him.

426
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,271
We're not charging him."
That's what they told us.

427
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,273
But if we didn't charge him,

428
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,776
we would have been the ones to receive
criticism because the investigation began

429
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,653
because of a public outrage.

430
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,948
Then we got a call from
the Gyeonggi Nambu station.

431
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,081
That a drug dealer who was arrested

432
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,208
mentioned Nam Jae-ik's son.

433
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,592
What would you have done
if you were in my place?

434
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,386
I would've had him arrested.

435
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,431
That won't remove him from the position.

436
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,268
We'd only become his sworn enemies

437
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,564
and we'd never be able to gain
independent investigative rights.

438
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,694
I was working at Yongsan Police Station.

439
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,990
Itaewon is in our jurisdiction, so we deal
with the most drug crimes in the nation.

440
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:33,579
The drug dealers never reveal
the name's of their VIP's.

441
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,122
It's an unspoken rule.

442
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,792
The drug dealers
give away the small fries,

443
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,919
and the police get performance records,

444
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:44,548
and the VIP's pay the dealers
for their time served and their lawyers.

445
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,469
An assemblyman's son would be a VIP.

446
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,347
Are you sure the dealer
gave his name voluntarily?

447
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,601
Do you think we've lied to falsely accuse
the assemblyman's son?

448
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,521
Nam Jae-ik's son had already
been doing drugs,

449
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,523
and the Intelligence Bureau knew that.

450
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,442
Right after Nam Jae-ik was chosen
as the chairman,

451
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,027
Nambu Station arrested the dealer.

452
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,905
And you're saying the police
kept quiet about it?

453
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,367
That's right. So what?

454
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,207
Are you going to blow the whistle?
What then?

455
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,460
Are you going to let him go?

456
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:25,339
So this job-stealing meth addict
is going to remain untouchable?

457
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,007
Who said I'm just letting him go?

458
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,677
You know that no one stops doing drugs
after the first time.

459
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,303
The chair changes in six months.

460
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,264
You can catch him
once Nam Jae-ik steps down.

461
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,224
Will you ruin something
we've waited 70 years for

462
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,851
because you can't wait a few months?

463
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,527
If your conscience
is really bothering you,

464
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,070
and if you feel that distressed,

465
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,948
go ahead and blow the whistle.

466
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,784
I can't stop you from doing
what you think is right.

467
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,578
Go for it.

468
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,050
Intelligence police reports
are confidential.

469
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,137
Whoever the new Director is,
I have to act as one until they come.

470
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,103
In several years,

471
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,440
you could be the one sitting here.

472
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,111
I thought I had finally found
the right person…

473
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,368
I wasn't dragging you into this.

474
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,663
I was trying to guide you.

475
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,296
Set your own goals.

476
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,724
Why do you have to read the reports
in this room?

477
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,061
You can read them at your desk
since you know the password.

478
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,275
You don't know what it's really like
to be dragged into things.

479
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,946
What you've experienced is nothing at all.

480
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,401
His lousy son just had to do drugs.

481
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,820
He's on the police's side now.

482
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,115
What else did Ms. Han say?

483
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,701
She didn't give me any info.

484
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,413
Not officially, of course.
I won't tell Chief Choi. Don't worry.

485
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,832
No, I started the research
at the Nambu station.

486
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,333
She didn't tell me about it.

487
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,252
How did you know that?

488
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,796
It said Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial
Police Agency on the envelope.

489
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,304
Oh, right. What about Seo Dong-jae?

490
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,889
He's looking for a former officer
from Segok Police Station.

491
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,392
He believes he could be the prime suspect,
and not the Captain.

492
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,937
The second council meeting's set
for next Thursday.

493
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,981
The location and members are the same.
Be prepared.

494
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,528
-What?
-Nothing, sir.

495
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,904
I'll get ready for the meeting.

496
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,721
I never thought you'd actually
put in a word for me.

497
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,805
Thanks.

498
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,267
Prosecutor Hwang.

499
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,481
Do you have hidden connections?

500
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:11,940
Pardon?

501
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,779
Tell me if you do. I should make sure
I don't step on something I shouldn't.

502
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,405
I don't.

503
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,491
Whose car was that, then?

504
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:21,909
What car?

505
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,162
I didn't tell Chief Woo,

506
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,622
but I saw you.

507
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,790
Saw what?

508
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,709
You, getting into a luxury sedan
in front of our office. Who was it?

509
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,503
There was even an attendant.

510
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:36,590
Well, that was someone
I don't need to tell you about.

511
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,511
You shouldn't act like that already.

512
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,681
What are you talking about?

513
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,015
You really don't know?

514
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,226
Don't you know why we picked you?

515
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,228
We picked you for your image.

516
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,731
You just said "we."

517
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,692
What do you mean?

518
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,988
I mean, you were picked after I came
to the Criminal Legislation Division.

519
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,075
And you were chosen
among several candidates.

520
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,577
But you just said "we," so…

521
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,166
I guess you were already decided
as a member beforehand

522
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,168
since you two were in the same class.

523
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,882
So what? What if I was?

524
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,344
Anyway, you can report it to Chief Woo.

525
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,098
Why are you staring at me like that?

526
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,266
Do you have a problem?

527
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,773
Well… Aren't you going to go inside?

528
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:51,915
What's wrong with him?

529
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,085
Who? Did someone tell you off at lunch?

530
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,087
Who would even do that?

531
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,755
We were there to help each other out.

532
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,591
I heard Son Gi-hyeok didn't come.

533
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,843
He sent me a text
saying he couldn't make it.

534
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,011
It doesn't matter.

535
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,472
It's not like he'd go against us
during the monthly meeting.

536
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,308
Oh, and the eastern office
agreed to keep pace with us

537
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,143
regarding the investigation on Hanjo.

538
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,603
Did Kang Won-chul agree?

539
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,105
I said that it's nice to have
performance records

540
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,609
for investigating the wealthy,
but we need to let people see us

541
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:22,154
taking care of political issues.
I suggested taking our time on the case,

542
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,572
so they'll realize the prosecution

543
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,784
should keep investigative rights.
I think they got the idea.

544
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,329
-Why are you upset, then?
-Because of Kang Won-chul.

545
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,916
I could see
why you aren't that fond of him.

546
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,417
He's a bit stiff, isn't he?

547
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,754
Well, yes…

548
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,006
Are they all like that?

549
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,966
What do you mean, "they"?

550
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,468
The people from the western office.

551
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,726
How's Prosecutor Hwang doing?

552
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,685
Pardon?

553
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,437
Oh, yes.

554
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,439
He's not just there
for your team's image, right?

555
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,443
Using him like that could cause trouble.

556
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,738
I'll make sure
he won't get in any trouble.

557
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,617
I mean it'll cause trouble for the ones
using him for his image.

558
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,661
You have to use him wisely.

559
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:17,000
Why would we be troubled
because of a mere prosecutor?

560
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,966
If that's what you think, then…

561
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,472
I don't know why,
but he's kind of annoying.

562
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,560
But I thought about what he said,

563
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,230
and it could be that Prosecutor Hwang
has some hidden connections.

564
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,481
That's ridiculous.

565
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,527
Well, he does whatever he wants
without thinking about the higher-ups.

566
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,155
He might have really special connections.
So I asked him if he did, and…

567
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,866
You asked that to his face?
So what did he say?

568
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,952
He could just say no
if he doesn't have any.

569
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,289
In my day, we had to be on our hands
and knees whenever a Chief was around.

570
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,499
He talked back to me
from beginning to end.

571
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,043
I know young prosecutors these days
are different from us,

572
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,296
but he's especially strange.

573
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,547
You didn't know?

574
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,591
I noticed that when he went on TV before.

575
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,760
-Why did you bring him then?
-I thought he enjoyed getting attention.

576
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,722
I thought, "Maybe he wants to be
a politician later.

577
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,516
Okay, I'll let you have the press.
Give us your image in return."

578
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,809
I wanted to use him like that.

579
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,020
It's not that easy
to become an assemblyman.

580
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:21,690
In the old days, if a senior brought
a junior to work at the Supreme Office,

581
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,442
they'd be thanking their senior non-stop.

582
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,237
Do you like having your juniors
suck up to you?

583
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,239
Well, not really.

584
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,076
But you know what's funny?

585
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,787
If one junior is standing stiff

586
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,248
while all the others are bowing,

587
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,792
I admit that it gets on my nerves.

588
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,921
I'm sure he doesn't have
any great connections though.

589
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,008
I guess not then.

590
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,677
I feel like I'm serving two bosses.

591
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,191
It's me, Assemblyman Nam.

592
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,943
Did things settle down a bit?

593
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,488
Should I come and see you now?

594
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,721
I found the doctor,

595
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,265
but he refused to cooperate.

596
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,518
I hacked into the hospital records

597
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,021
and found that the former chairman
has intermittent explosive disorder.

598
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,191
"Intermittent"?

599
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,361
How intermittent would it be?

600
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,990
We'd have to make him explode to find out.

601
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,581
Make an announcement

602
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,168
that I will attend
the shareholders' meeting

603
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,463
if Sung-jae and my father
attend the meeting in person as well.

604
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,757
That I will welcome them myself.

605
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,384
And…

606
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,723
What else…

607
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,144
I need protesters.

608
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,981
Before the shareholders' meeting?
Where should I place them?

609
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,150
There. In front of this building.

610
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,528
I don't care if they shout or fight.

611
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,240
Let's welcome my father with them.

612
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,493
I'll place the protesters.

613
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:24,039
"It has been revealed that the former
chairman of Hanjo Group, Lee Yun-beom,

614
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,957
currently has anger management issues,

615
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,960
having difficulty in controlling
his emotions."

616
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,712
What condition is my father in?

617
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,424
Did you call me to ask that?

618
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,180
Is his depression that severe?

619
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,811
Did Sung-jae tell you
that he has depression?

620
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,979
He won't tell me anything.

621
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,983
I can't visit him,
but I have ears, you know.

622
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,657
I thought maybe you would've visited him
after he was released.

623
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,039
Anger issues.

624
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,878
He has trouble controlling his anger.

625
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,339
"Anger issues"?

626
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,175
He sometimes bursts out in anger

627
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,761
and throws things.

628
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,558
I heard he can't control his emotions.

629
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,184
And he has mood swings too.

630
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,397
"According to a source close to him,

631
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,566
he displays violent behaviors

632
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,277
by throwing things
or bursting out in anger."

633
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,988
"A source close to him"?

634
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:42,200
"Between the siblings, Lee Sung-jae seems
to have the upper hand

635
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,286
with the former chairman on his back,

636
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:50,834
but since there are suspicions that
Lee Yun-beom lacks the mental capacity,

637
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,169
it is unclear as to
who will become the chairperson

638
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,255
-of Hanjo Group."
-A criminal becoming the chairman?

639
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,257
-A criminal should not
-A criminal should not

640
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,384
-return to the company!
-return to the company!

641
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,304
We demand that Hanjo does what's right!

642
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,055
-We demand that Hanjo
-We demand that Hanjo

643
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,433
-does what's right!
-does what's right!

644
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,269
A criminal should not
return to the company!

645
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,062
A criminal should not

646
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,273
-return to the company!
-What is all this?

647
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,483
-We demand that Hanjo does what's right!
-Someone is here!

648
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,488
-Is it not him?
-I don't think it's him.

649
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,532
-Let's gather and continue!
-Jeez.

650
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,618
-Hello.
-I'm attending the meeting.

651
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,829
I'm sorry, sir. But you have to
get out of your car for safety reasons.

652
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,039
What do you mean?

653
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,833
The protesters tried to
sneak into the parking lot

654
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,460
so we had to close it off.

655
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,670
If you give us your key,
we'll park it for you.

656
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,589
-Here.
-Thank you.

657
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,801
He evaded taxes, embezzled money,

658
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,970
-and went to prison for it!
-"Safety reasons"?

659
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,556
She's just trying to humiliate
her father in public.

660
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,391
It's typical of someone who's wealthy.

661
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,852
A criminal should not return
to the company!

662
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,229
-A criminal should not…
-A criminal should not…

663
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,814
Someone's here!

664
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:55,899
It must be him!

665
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,442
Is it him?

666
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,444
Is it Lee Yun-beom?

667
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,697
A criminal shouldn't run the company!

668
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,409
A criminal shouldn't return
to the company!

669
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,496
Stay out of Hanjo Group!

670
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,748
The former chairman and Mr. Lee Sung-jae

671
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,876
both announced they'll send
their representatives.

672
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,089
Mr. Lee's candidate turned out to be

673
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,592
the former chairman Lee Yun-beom
as expected.

674
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,600
Tell the protesters to be quiet.

675
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:35,146
Hanjo Engineering's vice-president,
Park Yong-bok.

676
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,273
HANJO GROUP
GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

677
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,733
The meeting just started.

678
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,071
Hanjo Group Planning
and Coordination Office,

679
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,614
executive director Jang In-tae.

680
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,533
HANJO MOTORS
REPRESENTATIVE

681
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,748
Next is Sungmoon Daily's representative,

682
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,667
-lawyer Jeon Ji-won.
-Kim Byung-hyun of Sungmoon

683
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,252
also sent a representative.

684
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,801
For the first agenda, we will present

685
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,221
Hanjo Motors shareholder Lee Sung-jae's
bylaw amendment.

686
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,144
I have something to say about the agenda.

687
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,772
HANJO MOTORS SHAREHOLDER
LEE SUNG-JAE'S BYLAW AMENDMENT

688
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:27,157
The amendment won't help us or the group.
He just notified us without even asking--

689
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,452
Hey! What are you talking about?

690
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,705
I'm talking right now.
I have the right to speak!

691
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:37,042
Please be quiet.
We'll let you all speak in turn.

692
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,960
So please wait for your turn.

693
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,212
I was just given the right to speak.

694
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,506
This is exactly what the chairman wanted!

695
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,052
-How the hell would you know?
-What did you just say?

696
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,845
-Hey! Stop that!
-Shut up!

697
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,939
We'll take a 10-minute break.

698
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,818
This is unbelievable!

699
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,489
There will be a vote on whether to elect
a new chairperson,

700
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,157
and if it's approved,

701
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,285
the new chairperson
will be elected right away.

702
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,203
Okay.

703
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,163
If the former chairman is going to attend,

704
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,707
-Yes.
-he'll come after it's approved.

705
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,169
-If the amendment is rejected,
-Okay.

706
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,963
it could be humiliating for him.

707
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,972
You have to decide now, sir.

708
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,352
The key will be where
Sungmoon Daily's seven percent,

709
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,647
his 12.11 million shares, will go.

710
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,023
What do you want me to do?

711
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,794
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING
FIRST AGENDA

712
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:10,802
SHAREHOLDER: KIM BYUNG-HYUN

713
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,518
SERIAL NUMBER

714
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,561
Ms. Lee, I'm sure there will be good news.
I'm rooting for you!

715
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,855
Call me anytime when things
have calmed down.

716
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,649
There was one more.

717
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,661
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JAE-IK

718
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,957
Chief Choi Bit must've sat here.

719
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,085
And Ms. Han here.

720
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,339
And the file they got from Nambu Station

721
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,757
would've been here.

722
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,428
I believe it happened in early February.

723
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,014
Chief Choi's brought in something fresh.

724
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,813
Do you really think the police
let the children from rich families go

725
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,650
because they can't investigate properly?

726
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,363
We've kept an eye on your son
for a long time,

727
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,447
so we have plenty of evidence.

728
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,243
But I didn't think I'd be seeing you
this soon.

729
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,955
I was planning on visiting you
around the time the committee is held.

730
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,626
Are you talking about my son?
That's nonsense.

731
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,879
She's outside. Ask her to come in.

732
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,551
Since you're our senior,
and I know you're an unwavering person,

733
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:18,263
so I'm sure the committee won't fall
into the police's hands because of it.

734
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,350
But I've become so worrisome as I aged.

735
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,521
Chief Woo.

736
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,232
Yes, sir.

737
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,361
It was the same for you.
It was your wife, wasn't it?

738
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,321
You have nothing to do with it, right?

739
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,366
What do you mean, sir?

740
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,036
You mentioned early February,
so I just remembered something.

741
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,373
Rumors spread about
cryptocurrency exchanges being closed

742
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,041
back then.

743
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,753
No, wait.

744
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,881
People in our field knew
about it beforehand.

745
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,468
All the insiders knew a long time
before it was on the news.

746
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,013
We knew the Ministry of Justice
was planning

747
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,557
on closing them, and that
cryptocurrency values would plummet.

748
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,437
So you withdrew beforehand.

749
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,188
Did you sell everything?

750
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,401
Of course,
I'm sure you've covered up all the traces.

751
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:17,405
A prosecutor can't be caught
for cryptocurrency speculation.

752
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,324
But the thing is,

753
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:23,620
regular folks who lost all their money
because they didn't know about it,

754
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,623
if they find out that a chief
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

755
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,792
used his wife to pull out
because of inside intel,

756
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,712
will they forgive you?

757
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,883
What will happen
if people who lost everything find out?

758
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,094
They will stone you.

759
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:47,185
You shouldn't think that
all us assemblymen do is waste taxes.

760
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,063
Isn't it only fair
that I let the police know

761
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,566
what we've talked about in here
since you've found out

762
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,485
what they were here for?

763
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,280
I should tell them about
the cryptocurrency exchange

764
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,116
for it to be fair for both sides.

765
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,666
A prosecutor involved in speculation?

766
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,044
Nothing like that's ever happened, sir.

767
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,590
That's right.

768
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,785
Sir, Prosecutor Ryu got a call

769
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,495
about Assemblyman Nam.

770
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,580
From where? The police?

771
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,542
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office.
Prosecutor Hwang.

772
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,420
Why is that name popping up again?

773
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,630
He asked if Prosecutor Ryu was the one

774
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,591
in charge of Assemblyman Nam's
hiring bribe case

775
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,176
at the Seongnam Branch Office,

776
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,678
then said he'd come in person.

777
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,596
Hey, no. Tell him not to come.

778
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,390
You told him not to, right?

779
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,434
Well, I did,

780
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,395
but Prosecutor Ryu said
it didn't seem like he'd listen.

781
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,273
Jeez.

782
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,984
Alright. I'll take care of it.

783
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,569
Yes, sir.

784
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,620
When will he ever change?

785
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,994
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

786
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,370
Are you at work or at home?

787
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,207
I'm at the dormitory.

788
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,334
The dorm? Why would you…

789
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,170
Anyway, I need to see you for a moment.

790
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,757
-Right now?
-We're not going to drink, so just come.

791
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,883
I'll send you the address.

792
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,260
Yes, sir.

793
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,371
It seems pretty recent.

794
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,249
There's nothing else.
This is all we could find.

795
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,709
-Run the plate number.
-Yes, sir.

796
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,712
My goodness.

797
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,422
Can you run a plate number for me?

798
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,592
It's 43 J 5827.

799
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,428
What's this?

800
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:20,982
What?

801
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,903
-Hey, isn't this…
-Yes, sir?

802
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,531
-Is the owner…
-Captain.

803
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,950
I think this is his car.

804
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,452
-Is it really his?
-Yes.

805
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,538
What is it? Whose is it?

806
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,958
You know, Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

807
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,853
SEO DONG-JAE
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

808
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,626
What do you mean?
Are you sure he's missing?

809
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,253
-Is it a kidnapping?
-It seems like it.

810
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,881
If they chose that place intentionally,

811
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,507
they must know the neighborhood.

812
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,843
Maybe she's hardened
because she's a prosecutor's wife.

813
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,762
Why were you trying
to meet Prosecutor Seo?

814
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:35,640
-Did he not answer? Or was his phone off?
-Are you interrogating me?

815
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,351
One of the numbers

816
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,269
on his call history seemed to be yours.

817
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,438
It doesn't matter if he's a prosecutor.

818
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,982
Are you in contact with Hanjo Group
by any chance?

819
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,401
Where were you last night?

820
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,946
The Uijeongbu office
could be where it all began.

821
