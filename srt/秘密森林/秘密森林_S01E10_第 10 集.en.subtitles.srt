1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,303
STRANGER

3
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,312
Hey, when did she wake up?

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,897
What?

5
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,740
Ms. Kim.

6
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,326
Ga-young.

7
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,745
Can you hear me?

8
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,502
Ga-young, can you hear me?

9
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,296
Ga-young.

10
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,384
Ga-young.

11
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,845
How is she?

12
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,306
She's not all there
due to the head injury.

13
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,017
She's not even aware
of what kind of condition she's in.

14
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,228
The doctor said this may last for months.

15
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,355
Ga-young.

16
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,190
Ga-young.

17
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,984
-Ga-young.
-Wait, Captain.

18
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,528
Hold on. Just a second, please.

19
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,030
Give me a moment with her.

20
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,744
Ga-young.

21
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,205
It's okay. We're police officers.

22
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,290
You're at a hospital now.

23
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,251
Everything is okay now.

24
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,144
Yes, you can talk.

25
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,856
Mom...

26
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,610
Mom...

27
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,071
Mom?

28
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,865
Do you mean your mom?

29
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,325
Mom...

30
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,665
Ga-young. It's me.

31
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,834
I'm here now.

32
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,379
You're okay now.

33
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,589
Everything is all right.

34
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,468
Thank you.

35
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,930
Gosh, my daughter...

36
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,562
-Gosh...
-Yes, Chief.

37
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,196
She can't really talk coherently yet.

38
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,033
Oh, I see.

39
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,329
Great, thank you. Okay.

40
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,793
Hey, Chief will send Sergeant Kim here.

41
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,922
He said we should go get some sleep.
Let's get some rest.

42
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,299
-Yes, sir.
-Gosh, my eyes are exhausted.

43
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,843
I'll go get everyone something to drink.

44
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,846
-All right. Thank you.
-Do you have some change on you?

45
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,942
Chief must be anxious now that Ga-young
has regained her consciousness.

46
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,027
He must be wondering
how he can shut her up.

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,445
We should move her.

48
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,030
Yes, I'll find a quiet place.

49
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,283
-Can Ms. Choi...
-Just a second.

50
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,744
Hey, what's up?

51
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,372
Mr. Hwang, I think Tae-gyun Kim
is trying to flee.

52
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,123
What?

53
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,959
The guy who delivered the cash to my dad.

54
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,378
Tae-gyun Kim. He's running away now.

55
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,302
I didn't want to let him get away,
so I followed him.

56
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,638
Where are you now? Are you...

57
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,765
MR. YOON

58
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,851
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

59
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,854
Hello, Mr. Hwang.
I'm following her. I can see her.

60
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,357
Please come to Bupyeong.

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,987
Okay. Please send me the location.

62
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,823
It sounds urgent.
You should leave right away.

63
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,117
I'll take care of moving her
to a different hospital.

64
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,493
I'm sorry. I'll leave this to you.

65
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,549
What's going on?

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,593
What is the matter with him? Goodness.

67
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,098
What is happening?

68
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,725
Gosh, that little...

69
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,769
What are you doing there?

70
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,194
Gosh, this is crazy.

71
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,446
Tae-gyun Kim!

72
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,531
-Hey.
-Wait, why are you...

73
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,077
Why are you doing this to me?

74
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,206
Hold on. Who are you?

75
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,750
Who on earth are you?

76
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,336
Who's that girl?

77
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,671
All right, fine.

78
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,590
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay.

79
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,220
How's Detective Jang and everyone else?
I hope it's not too stressful.

80
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,473
It's just like what I used to do
every day.

81
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,560
If Moo-sung Park was like a sponsor,

82
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,563
doesn't it mean he was a pimp?

83
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,735
I bet he wasn't just a customer.
He must've used those girls as bribes.

84
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,904
Maybe.

85
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,158
Those men at Western Seoul
Prosecutors' Office must know her.

86
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,703
Our job is to find out who knows how much.

87
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,416
There might be other organizations
that were associated with it too.

88
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,753
The fact that it's not just one
or two people is...

89
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,632
The culprit must be getting
extremely anxious too.

90
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,718
Soon, he'll find out that she has regained
her consciousness.

91
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,138
By the way,
what's happening with Kyung-wan?

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,390
Gosh, I don't know.

93
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,435
It'll take forever if
the human rights commission gets involved.

94
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,065
Don't worry about it though.

95
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,609
Okay.

96
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,245
I got this for you.

97
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,287
Thank you.

98
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,623
Have some water.

99
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,171
We have to move her
to a different hospital.

100
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,467
You can't tell anyone about it.

101
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,514
You absolutely shouldn't.

102
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,315
-I'll get going, Captain.
-All right.

103
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,775
-See you.
-Don't work too hard.

104
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,693
Bye.

105
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,825
Figuring out who was involved with her
will be the key to solving this case.

106
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,800
That girl woke up.

107
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,597
Are you there?

108
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,308
Yes.

109
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,820
Soo-jung must have gotten even prettier.

110
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,406
You must be excited too.
It's been too long.

111
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,184
Do you...

112
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,980
Do you know whom I saw there
yesterday, sir?

113
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,235
I'm not sure. Who could it be?

114
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,322
His wife.

115
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,492
Mr. Il-jae Young's wife.

116
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,707
I was so surprised.
I never thought I'd see her there.

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,337
It clearly said "Special Investigation
for Bribery Case Involving Prosecutors"

118
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,713
right by the door.

119
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,050
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw
the former minister's wife going in there.

120
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,854
Sir, do you know a prosecutor
named Si-mok Hwang by any chance?

121
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,940
He's in charge
of the special investigation,

122
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,569
and he proposed a deal to me.

123
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,405
What kind of deal?

124
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,242
He said he's investigating
a case from three years ago.

125
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,371
He told me that he'd go easy
on me if I tell him what I know.

126
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,375
I've been very torn about what to do.

127
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,794
I've been thinking so hard
about whether I should accept it.

128
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,504
That's why I fell down the stairs.

129
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,258
So?

130
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,220
I should be straightforward with you.

131
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,722
Sir.

132
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,434
Please help me.

133
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,687
Please stop them from arresting me.

134
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,523
Am I the President or what?

135
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,233
If it was something he could do,

136
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,527
I wouldn't be taking up
your precious time like this.

137
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,031
I know how busy you are with sustaining
this country's economy.

138
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,117
I'm a businessman.

139
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,039
What will you sell to me
if I'm willing to buy from you?

140
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,668
I spent over three hours
at the central district office yesterday.

141
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,671
It's nothing to brag about,
but I'll have to make more trips there.

142
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,883
I'll find out
what the special investigation team

143
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,385
is trying to dig up in detail.

144
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,722
Why would that information
be of any use for me?

145
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,516
I don't care about
what they're trying to dig up.

146
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,436
Pardon?

147
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,318
I sincerely apologize. I am gravely sorry.

148
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,694
Why are you apologizing?

149
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,904
I was mistaken.

150
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,492
-You said that Chang-jun didn't tell me...
-That was just a slip of the tongue.

151
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,701
I apologize.

152
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,666
Are you changing
your strategy now or what?

153
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,544
Are you trying to make me believe
that you wouldn't betray me easily?

154
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,587
I apologize, sir.

155
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,346
I'm truly sorry.
I sincerely apologize, sir.

156
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,807
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,237
I've cleared one hurdle.

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,446
Where's Chang-jun now?

159
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,367
He'll arrive in Tokyo shortly.

160
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,119
-Tell him to come back.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,205
I'm trying to track down those related
to the Il-jae Young case,

162
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,707
and only the delivery guy,
Tae-gyun Kim, is nowhere to be found.

163
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,963
Also,

164
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,881
I heard that girl

165
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,967
has regained her consciousness.

166
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,639
Mr. Woo, it looks like you have

167
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,225
more things to take care of now.

168
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,727
Understood, sir.

169
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,735
HANJO GROUP
CHAIRMAN YUN-BEOM LEE

170
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,737
Captain Yun-soo Choi, please come
to Administration...

171
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,156
Who's looking for me?

172
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,741
Please come to the second floor
upon hearing this announcement.

173
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,999
Great. Please do it
as quickly as possible.

174
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,001
-What's going on?
-Please hurry.

175
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,086
Where are you going? Lieutenant Han.

176
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,087
Gosh, let go.

177
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,882
-Where are you taking her?
-Please keep it down.

178
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,425
What's going on?

179
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,470
We need to transfer her.
This is strictly confidential.

180
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,971
Her life depends on you.

181
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:44,930
On me?

182
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,640
Well, does Captain know about this?

183
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,351
You trust me, don't you?

184
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,316
Detective.

185
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,029
Sergeant Kim!

186
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,823
It's here. Let's go in.

187
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,992
What took you so long? Let's go.

188
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,661
We have to hurry.

189
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,546
-Yes.
-This patient...

190
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,426
At the time, I thought
it was just a convulsion.

191
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,388
I remembered something after you told me
that her life is in danger.

192
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,435
What is it?

193
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,731
That day, she had severe convulsions.

194
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,902
I tried to remember,
but that had never happened before.

195
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,907
Go ahead without me.
I'll follow you shortly.

196
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,710
Where can I check
the security camera footage?

197
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,422
He just took it.

198
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,175
Kim... What did he say his name was?

199
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,802
Anyway, I gave it to that police officer.

200
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,262
Do you have the original file?

201
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,764
Because he kept rushing us,

202
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,475
we didn't have time to make a copy.
He took the hard drive.

203
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,144
What?

204
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,271
How can you let him take the hard drive?

205
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,857
I obviously couldn't say no
because he's a police officer.

206
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,450
-Where's Sergeant Kim?
-Hey, Ga-young is gone.

207
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,618
Where is Sergeant Kim?

208
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,037
Who cares where he is?
The witness has vanished into thin air.

209
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,331
He's not there!

210
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,667
Gosh, seriously. This whole thing
is driving me insane.

211
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,086
You told me to go
and talk to Moo-sung Park.

212
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,256
You clearly said to me
that you only delivered the cash.

213
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,383
I already told you
that I've never seen you before.

214
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,761
I don't know Moo-sung Park
or whatever his name is.

215
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,680
-Are you really going to be like this?
-What do you want?

216
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,934
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

217
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,894
I'm leaving.

218
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,689
Gosh, why are you so strong?

219
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,120
She's been after him since yesterday.

220
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,040
I think Ms. Young was
just trying to help us.

221
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,541
Mr. Tae-gyun Kim.

222
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,544
We met once three years ago, didn't we?

223
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,255
You know that I've already paid
for what I did.

224
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,966
That was for siphoning off US dollars.

225
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,426
There's time left on the statute
of limitations for perjury.

226
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,847
Just lock me up if you'd like. That's
better than getting stabbed to death.

227
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,100
So you did commit perjury, didn't you?

228
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,268
You framed my dad, didn't you?

229
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,776
Do you think you can avoid getting stabbed
by claiming that you know nothing?

230
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,112
Aren't you the prosecutor who was on TV?

231
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,908
You said that the culprit
disguised himself to look like Moo-sung.

232
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,869
Do you think he'd leave me alone
if I open my mouth?

233
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,329
You'll die if you don't.

234
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,872
What?

235
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,917
The culprit wants things
about Moo-sung Park to be exposed.

236
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,878
He also doesn't want those who have sinned
to go unpunished.

237
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,299
You might have to pay the price
if you continue to keep your silence.

238
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,012
-What do you mean...
-You can leave if you can't trust me.

239
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,639
I'm also curious to see how you'll end up.

240
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,683
Mr. Kim, please help us out
just this once.

241
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,728
We can let go of your perjury charges
if your contribution is significant.

242
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,563
Did he say he'd let
the US dollar thing slide

243
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
if you deliver cash for him?

244
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,649
Please admit that my dad
returned the money to you.

245
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,568
-What are we waiting for?
-Let's go.

246
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,153
Mr. Yoon.

247
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,155
Please admit it. Please?

248
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,409
You know what happened to that girl
who was found at his place, right?

249
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,827
Do you want to end up like her?

250
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,039
Since this already happened,
let's not bother taking you to our office.

251
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,253
Gosh, you people are driving me nuts.

252
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,761
Do you admit that Mr. Il-jae Young
returned 800 million won to you

253
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,264
and that you're giving this statement
under no duress?

254
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,309
Yes, I do.

255
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,817
Mr. Kim, please go to
the central district office with him.

256
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,488
-You'll be investigated for perjury.
-That's not what you said.

257
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,781
That will be the safest for you.

258
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,991
You must be fully exposed
so that no one can bother you.

259
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,786
Ms. Young, you should come with us...

260
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,120
Mr. Hwang.

261
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,917
Thank you so much.

262
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,504
Have you lost your mind or what?

263
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,255
What was this about?

264
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,633
I had to do something.

265
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,761
-You're working so hard to...
-Do you think I'm doing this for you?

266
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,222
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

267
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,890
No! It's not like that.

268
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,939
What you're doing now isn't normal.

269
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,233
You're right.
I'm not in my right mind now.

270
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,401
How can I be?

271
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,987
We've been desperately waiting
for this day.

272
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,033
My parents who did nothing wrong have been
living like sinners for three years.

273
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,082
But you solved our problem.

274
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,585
I sincerely thank you.

275
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,212
ASSISTANT CHIEF PROSECUTOR

276
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,134
-Hello?
-How much longer should I wait for you?

277
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,096
-My apologies.
-Do you now think everyone is under you?

278
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,140
Get yourself here immediately.

279
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,901
You can drop me off on the way.

280
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,291
The woman you said you saw here that day.

281
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,334
Was this her?

282
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,754
Yes, it was her.

283
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,716
Can you please tell me again
about what happened that day?

284
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,265
It was for a very short period
of time, but...

285
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,578
Her pillow was on the floor?

286
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,040
She's been getting
severe convulsions today.

287
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,501
Has she ever convulsed to the point that
she got disconnected from her ventilator?

288
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,170
No.

289
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,796
Excuse me. Are you her guardian?

290
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,131
Not once.

291
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,679
I'm certain that Mr. Lee's wife was here.

292
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,265
I'll go and check
the security camera footage now.

293
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,100
They said Sergeant Kim took
the whole thing.

294
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,144
If he has watched the footage,

295
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,688
he must've figured out who took
Ga-young by now.

296
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,148
I have no choice.

297
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,192
I knew that Chief would go through

298
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,444
the footage first as soon
as he finds out that she's gone.

299
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,238
Okay, then.

300
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,371
What is that?

301
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,082
Why was she there?

302
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,962
She must've gone there
to see her husband's woman.

303
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,928
DELETE

304
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,656
Officer Park knows. He's one of them.

305
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,867
I'm telling you the truth.

306
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,121
I thought Captain knew
about the transfer too.

307
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,415
Don't you know how important
she is as a witness?

308
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,583
Where is she? Where did they take her?

309
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,876
I really don't know.

310
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,006
Hey, Yeo-jin and that prosecutor,
Si-mok Hwang or whatever his name is...

311
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,757
She's that jerk's minion.
Don't you know that?

312
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,969
It takes one to know one.

313
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,972
This is actually great.

314
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,102
Why are you staring at me
like that? Get out.

315
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,315
Give me the footage.

316
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,191
First things first.

317
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,403
Where did you move Ga-young Kim to?

318
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,947
I'll give you the footage
if you tell me where she is.

319
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,198
That's a win-win situation.

320
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,451
Just make a copy of it.

321
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,662
Try all you want. I won't give it to you
until you tell me where she is.

322
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,290
I won't tell you even if you ask me
a hundred times.

323
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,211
Look at that. She's running away
because she knows she can't win.

324
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,346
When did you get back...

325
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,639
What are you doing?

326
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,852
What are you looking for?
It's not your desk.

327
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,687
-Evidence.
-Just ask him for it.

328
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,813
He's not giving it to me.

329
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,766
My apologies.

330
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:19,064
Have you notified me of the reason
you're late for this interview?

331
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,442
No. I apologize again.

332
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,446
Explain why you made me wait
for almost two hours.

333
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,031
If the reason isn't good enough,

334
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,701
your office will be gone when you're done
with the special investigation.

335
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,578
Yes, sir.

336
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,789
Mr. Kang.

337
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,667
The second victim, Ga-young Kim,
has regained her consciousness.

338
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,003
-So who's the culprit?
-She can't really talk yet.

339
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,423
-I'm sure she can write.
-She can barely open her eyes.

340
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,137
Well... That is a good enough reason.

341
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,770
There are many things I want
to ask you as well, but first off...

342
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,647
I did have a few meals with Mr. Park.

343
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,900
Yes, I'm aware of that.

344
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,324
Here.

345
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,705
You wrote it when you were
at the eastern office three years ago.

346
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,331
You remember it, right?

347
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,461
CASE REPORT, 14GA3541

348
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,850
Are you going to investigate this?

349
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,643
I started the special investigation

350
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,645
to catch all those who bribed
and were bribed.

351
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,149
Who do you think is the one
that has bribed the most in this country?

352
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,944
The prick who was bribed the most.

353
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,749
I haven't seen Tae-gyun for a long time.

354
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,546
What do you think should have been
addressed back then?

355
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,882
The fact that Mr. Young's place

356
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,051
was on the first floor of the building.

357
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,180
You're pretty good.

358
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,434
It was an old apartment building
that was expected to be rebuilt.

359
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,603
There was no security camera
in the hallways.

360
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,440
Tae-gyun, who was about to be arrested
for violating the Foreign Exchange Act,

361
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,110
delivered the box that had 800 million won
to Mr. Young's apartment in the afternoon.

362
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,948
Mr. Young opened it when he got home late
and was very surprised.

363
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,951
He called the number on the business card
on the box, and Tae-gyun came again.

364
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,372
Ten hours had already passed
since his wife accepted the box,

365
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,831
so he didn't report it to the police.

366
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,875
That's why he called Tae-gyun
and returned it to him.

367
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,380
However, Tae-gyun was empty-handed
when he was leaving the building

368
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,174
as seen in the security camera footage
from the entrance.

369
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,510
He also said that Mr. Young
never returned it to him.

370
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,642
But what if...

371
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,359
It's no longer a what-if scenario.

372
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,278
Tae-gyun Kim's statement

373
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,696
matches what you just said.

374
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,533
-What statement?
-I met him before coming here.

375
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,995
Hey, why didn't you tell me about it
from the beginning?

376
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,246
What did he say?

377
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,166
He admitted that Mr. Young
returned the money to him.

378
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,795
Hey, then we should...

379
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,258
-You will announce it, right?
-Yes.

380
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,138
Good work. Great job.

381
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,141
Being falsely accused
must've been so devastating.

382
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,352
We've been criticizing and bashing
an innocent man.

383
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,522
I knew he'd never do such a thing.

384
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,361
How could you be so sure and convinced
that he'd never?

385
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,323
Why are you changing your attitude
all of a sudden?

386
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,283
You just said yourself that he's innocent.

387
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,494
I found out about it today
because Tae-gyun Kim admitted it.

388
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,663
Back then, you had no idea

389
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,874
whether he accepted the money or not.

390
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,250
The result tells it all.

391
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,252
What do you mean?

392
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,171
A minister was suspected
to have accepted a bribe.

393
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,131
It should have been
a special prosecution case.

394
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,008
Since it happened under our jurisdiction,

395
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,718
we took care
of the preliminary investigation,

396
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,137
but I thought a special investigation
would follow right away.

397
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,388
What happened though?

398
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,767
No special investigation team was formed,
and the case was closed in two days.

399
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,980
Are you saying someone pressured us
to conclude it as bribery

400
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,066
and close the case?

401
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,567
What else could it be?

402
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,236
Why do you think those who worked
on the case got scattered?

403
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,655
I was put in charge of trials
out of the blue.

404
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,534
Plus, you only went there on the first day
during the search but got sent to...

405
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,495
-Where was it?
-Cheongju.

406
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,872
Right. You were transferred to Cheongju.

407
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,917
The same goes for the rest. All of them
were transferred to the outskirts.

408
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,088
Someone dragged down a minister
and disbanded an investigation team.

409
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,091
Who could have the power
to do such a thing?

410
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,511
Don't you really know why it happened

411
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,388
and who did it?

412
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,811
Why are you trying to dig this up?

413
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,938
It has nothing to do
with your investigation.

414
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,607
That was when Moo-sung Park started
visiting our office as he pleased

415
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,692
with tacit approval of Mr. Chang-jun Lee.

416
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,070
It was immediately after Mr. Young
was pushed out.

417
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,030
That's when everything began.

418
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,827
I was still young three years ago.

419
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,330
If I get pushed out once again this time,

420
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,541
I won't be able to recover from it.

421
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,504
The fact that you're afraid of retaliation

422
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,966
must mean you know something.

423
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,263
It's getting late.

424
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,890
You're the one who wasted our time.

425
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,184
Even though the team only lasted
for two days,

426
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,229
you continued with the investigation
by yourself, didn't you?

427
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,860
-Mr. Kang.
-Give me some time.

428
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,571
-I need to sort things out too.
-How much time do you need?

429
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,740
It won't take long.
There isn't much to sort out.

430
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,743
Where's Dong-jae now?
Is he still at the hospital?

431
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,203
He's still one of my men.
Shall I visit him?

432
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,414
You'll see him soon
even if you don't visit him.

433
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,918
Isn't it odd?

434
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,546
When we got disbanded like that
at the eastern office,

435
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,548
I didn't think we'd work
together again elsewhere.

436
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,010
Also, it happens to be...

437
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,060
Is it odd?

438
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,609
It is odd.

439
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,082
Thank you.

440
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,839
Gosh, it's so weird.

441
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,801
Nothing matches up. This is...

442
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,303
This place only accepts credit cards
for parking fees.

443
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,265
Look. This day and this day.

444
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,518
Where did it go? Here.

445
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,396
This too. All the reservations were
made under Min-ah Kwon's name.

446
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,858
But none of the credit cards
on their records is a match.

447
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,279
Did he pay for parking monthly?

448
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,198
Do you really think he would've been
that thorough?

449
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,908
Is he an NIS agent or what?

450
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,701
Or it's possible
that he never brought his car.

451
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,248
What if he used
a different credit card every time?

452
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:38,878
He mustn't be an ordinary man
if he has that many credit cards. Right?

453
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,672
The man must be someone
who's quite powerful.

454
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,841
He did say the guy must be
someone with power.

455
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,636
Was it back in the summer?
I saw her using the phone in the lobby.

456
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,890
Why did she use the phone in the lobby?

457
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,476
The lobby?

458
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,311
GUEST HISTORY

459
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,022
After booking a room at the hotel,

460
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,817
she must've told the man
the room number right away, right?

461
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,740
Then why did she need to call him
after arriving here?

462
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:13,955
Excuse me. Was there a time when Room 510
suddenly became unusable last summer?

463
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,164
Or the entire fifth floor.

464
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,875
Suddenly?

465
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,085
Yes. It must've been fine
at the time of booking.

466
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,171
But some problem suddenly occurred
after the room was ready?

467
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,631
Was it that time?

468
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,633
When?

469
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,345
The air conditioning didn't work
on our fourth and fifth floors,

470
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,472
so we had to change our guests' rooms.

471
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,225
Please find out exactly when that was.

472
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,186
I also need a call history of the phone
in the lobby from that day. Thank you.

473
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,027
MIRAE HOSPITAL

474
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,200
Ga-young.

475
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,078
I'm a police officer.

476
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,417
Some people may feel safe
and supported when they see us

477
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,502
at times of danger or difficulty,

478
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,214
but I should

479
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,926
apologize to you.

480
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:27,487
You remember the man who used
to call you on your days off, right?

481
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,283
I don't know what you were thinking
when you went to meet with him.

482
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,538
But, whether you wanted it or not,

483
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,042
I do want to apologize.

484
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,131
Did you see the culprit by any chance?

485
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,970
Is it the man you used
to spend time with every Monday?

486
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,933
Ms. Kim.

487
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,145
It's okay. He's on our side.
You can trust him.

488
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,066
Ms. Kim.

489
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,777
I'm a prosecutor.

490
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,946
Is the culprit a prosecutor?

491
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,991
Did you hear or remember anything?

492
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,539
You asked the man you used to meet
for money, didn't you?

493
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,960
Who's the man you used to
spend time with every Monday?

494
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,632
It's Chief.

495
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,676
My chief.

496
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,973
The police did something
they should never do.

497
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,398
Who uses phones
in hotel lobbies these days?

498
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,233
There were only three calls made that day.

499
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,778
There was a call made immediately
after her check-in time, so I...

500
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,999
CALL HISTORY

501
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,339
CHIEF

502
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,595
She's young enough to be his daughter.

503
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,432
I couldn't find
the security camera footage.

504
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,268
Nurses in the ICU have to help patients
with their toileting needs

505
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,020
as well as with getting changed and so on,

506
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,646
so there are no security cameras there.

507
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,609
There's one in the hallway
by the entrance, but it won't tell us

508
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,277
anything that happened inside.

509
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,654
I think I should meet with Mr. Lee's wife.

510
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,241
Yes. There's one more thing.

511
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,535
Would your chief's driver

512
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,289
be able to confirm dropping him off
at the hotel every Monday?

513
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,834
The records show that the bookings
were made until the end of last year.

514
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,673
Yes, Detective Jang.

515
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,884
You're friends with Chief's driver, right?

516
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,263
Please find out if Chief was
dropped off at the hotel,

517
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,975
where Ga-young used to meet men,
on Mondays.

518
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,604
Yes. I'm talking about our chief,
of course.

519
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,773
Indoor golf lounge?

520
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,652
I see. That's where he went
every Monday last year.

521
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,238
Yes, I thought so.

522
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,283
No, it's nothing. Thank you. All right.

523
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,372
How can she be suspicious of him?

524
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,289
LIEUTENANT HAN

525
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:35,383
REAL INDOOR GOLF LOUNGE

526
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,813
Hey, it's me again.

527
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,774
About the golf lounge
where you used to drop Chief off...

528
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,318
Where is it?

529
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,784
JUNG-BON KIM
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

530
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,331
Thank you all for coming
at this late hour.

531
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:13,629
Now, we will begin the official briefing

532
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,341
on the special investigation
of the bribery case involving prosecutors.

533
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,564
I will update you all on the findings
of the investigation so far.

534
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,482
First of all,

535
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,484
we confirmed
that the bribery charges given

536
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,114
in February 2014 to Mr. Il-jae Young who
was the Minister of Justice at the time,

537
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,784
should be ruled inadmissible.

538
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,331
A statement that serves
as evidence for this

539
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,083
will be shared with you all
after this briefing.

540
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,505
Secondly, our special investigation team
has secured evidence

541
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,675
that proves the man whom
the second victim, Ms. Ga-young Kim,

542
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,012
met through her backer,
the late Moo-sung Park,

543
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,723
was Chief Woo-gyun Kim

544
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,976
at Yongsan Police Station in Seoul.

545
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,775
More information on the evidence
will be shared with all of you

546
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,735
after Mr. Kim's summons tomorrow.

547
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,365
Thirdly, I would like to let you all know
that we're currently investigating

548
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,326
a number of prosecutors at the western
office on top of one prosecutor

549
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,453
for whom we're waiting
on an arrest warrant.

550
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,413
That'd be all. Any questions?

551
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,290
Mr. Hwang, I have a question.

552
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,169
Did the victim state that she provided
sexual favors to Chief Kim?

553
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,421
The victim hasn't fully regained
her consciousness yet,

554
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,548
but we have secured firm evidence
that proves it.

555
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,425
-Mr. Hwang!
-I have a question.

556
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,263
Please tell us the name of the prosecutor
who is about to be arrested.

557
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,139
The investigation is still ongoing.

558
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,850
We will share the details with you
at a later date.

559
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,686
Here. I have a question.

560
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,688
What will happen to Mr. Il-jae Young?

561
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,108
I think that will depend
on how he will respond to the situation.

562
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,195
The follow-up actions will vary
according to his response.

563
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,366
-I have a question too.
-Mr. Hwang!

564
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,493
I have a question!

565
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,828
-Mr. Hwang, here!
-Wait!

566
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,372
What's prosecution's evidence
behind the allegations about Chief Kim?

567
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,748
Will you put in a request tomorrow

568
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,709
for an arrest warrant
after Chief Kim's summons?

569
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,252
I have a question too!

570
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,594
Things will get messy.

571
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,984
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

572
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,610
There he is!

573
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,446
-He's coming out.
-There he is.

574
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,737
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
SI-MOK HWANG

575
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,947
No matter how capable you are,

576
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:31,285
you won't be able to find out
everything Mr. Lee is up to.

577
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,622
Hey.

578
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,126
Do you think he left the prosecution
because he felt that life is futile?

579
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,338
He'll do something at Hanjo Group.
You won't be able to do this alone.

580
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,091
Those big corporations are harder
to get through than the Blue House.

581
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,474
I'm saying I'll pay for what I did.

582
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,727
Let me help you.

583
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,104
I'll get you intel on them.

584
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,775
While figuring out which side
you should take?

585
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,527
If I can get out of this
by siding with you,

586
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,778
I'll give you my everything.

587
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,949
What? Don't you want to survive this?

588
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,785
Hey, I'd still be alive even if
I have to roll on a field of dog shit.

589
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,537
That's precisely why you need me.

590
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,622
You're too straightforward. You need more.

591
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,666
You'll end up losing it.

592
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,668
I'll help you out.

593
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,169
What can I do?

594
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,380
What do you need?

595
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,316
Dad.

596
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:49,947
Dad.

597
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,993
Are you interested in doing
a newspaper interview by any chance?

598
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,580
I'd reject it if the request
was from elsewhere,

599
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,457
but it's from Sungmoon Daily.

600
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,084
They're no different.

601
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,588
We could be where we are now
because they exposed it.

602
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,840
Do you think they did it
because they wanted to help me?

603
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,759
It's all because of politics.

604
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,013
Are you talking about Sungmoon Daily?

605
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,432
What exactly do you mean by that?

606
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,976
Anyhow, I'm not interested.

607
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,146
By the way, what's your mom doing?

608
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,608
She said she can't sleep.

609
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,776
She must be over the moon.

610
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,278
So are you, right?

611
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,321
Goodness.

612
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,032
I'm tired.

613
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,047
Have a good sleep.

614
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,981
We're home.

615
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,700
WOO-GYUN KIM

616
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,494
-Is it you two?
-Yes, we're home.

617
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,371
Yes, we're back.
We couldn't even see Soo-jung.

618
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,580
I didn't tell you to come back.

619
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,458
You shouldn't have asked him to come back.
He hasn't gone to Japan for...

620
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,585
Then he shouldn't have given me
the reason to do so!

621
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,421
You must be tired.

622
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,640
I apologize.

623
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,686
Thank you. You can go.

624
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,649
I'm sorry.

625
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,152
I had no idea that Si-mok would try
to dig up things about that case.

626
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,946
He started with the hit-and-run accident,

627
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,074
so I thought he'd just dig up some dirt
on his colleagues at prosecution.

628
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,785
I had no idea he'd make
such a move either.

629
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,745
He's protesting to make me
unbury the truth.

630
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,206
He intentionally got my wife involved

631
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,625
to make me disclose what I know.

632
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,545
I can't believe

633
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,881
that he had the nerve to have dinner
at my house the day before.

634
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,927
Even Il-jae couldn't do anything about it
as the Minister of Justice.

635
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,137
What will a mere prosecutor do?

636
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,347
Plus, it's over now anyway
as three years have passed.

637
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,849
That is true.

638
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,561
It'd be a different story if Il-jae Young
is holding an unknown card, but...

639
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,938
Please don't worry.

640
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,108
There's nothing but wrinkles
on that old man's hands.

641
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,612
I'm not worried. I just can't believe
how impudent those pricks are.

642
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,948
I've cleared the chessboard for you.
It'll be announced tomorrow.

643
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,659
It wasn't easy, even for me.

644
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,412
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

645
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,040
Thank you. I will do my very best to...

646
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,551
It's not exactly how I wanted it to be.

647
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,555
It should've been announced
a little later.

648
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,350
You must know why I'm rushing it.

649
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,395
Yes, I do. I'll end
the special investigation.

650
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,112
Are you sure she woke up?

651
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,326
How incompetent are you?
How can you not know where she is?

652
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,037
Forget it.

653
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,456
Just do the other job well.

654
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,048
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

655
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,525
Isn't that his car?

656
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,529
Take the picture!

657
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,199
We're here.

658
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,992
-Are you in there?
-Please, come out.

659
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,808
-Are the allegations true?
-Did it really happen?

660
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,060
It's not true at all.
All of it is a fabricated lie!

661
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,146
The prosecutor

662
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,398
made up the story

663
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,567
because he felt pressured
to deliver results.

664
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,610
I'm completely innocent.

665
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,738
I absolutely will not let it slide.

666
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,657
That's ridiculous.

667
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,996
Will you be okay? He is your superior.

668
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,330
He's not just a superior.

669
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,915
She's practically attacking her big boss.

670
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,422
Work is work.

671
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:05,137
I'll go to Hannam-dong to meet Mr. Lee's
wife right after I'm done with Chief here.

672
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,388
Okay.

673
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,809
This is on the chief of Division One.

674
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,853
There's a number
of suspicious transactions.

675
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,983
-We should follow the protocol, right?
-Yes.

676
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,610
Please make necessary arrangements.

677
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:23,489
We must keep it from the office
until we request an arrest warrant.

678
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,991
-Got it.
-Moo-sung Park has a bunch of them too.

679
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,161
I think that briber
accepted bribes as well.

680
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,246
He received big chunks of money
from several companies.

681
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,582
-Please check with the companies.
-Sure.

682
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,167
Let's work hard, everyone.

683
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,419
-Of course. See you.
-See you.

684
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,843
Lieutenant.

685
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,347
Do you know if any of your colleagues
witnessed Kyung-wan

686
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,932
getting abused?

687
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,684
Is the human rights commission saying
it'll be hard?

688
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,103
I'm afraid Kyung-wan might end up
looking like a crazy guy.

689
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,772
With those photos alone,

690
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,399
we can't refute their claim that he got
those bruises during the arrest.

691
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,153
How can you ask her for such a favor
in this situation?

692
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,822
Do you want her to be ostracized
when she's back at the station?

693
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,116
It's not like this investigation
will go on forever.

694
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,701
That is true.

695
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,249
Forget what I said.
Please don't worry about it.

696
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,628
-I'll see you later.
-See you.

697
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,051
By the way, it's strange.

698
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,471
Ms. Choi would never miss work
because of family matters.

699
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,056
Do you miss her?

700
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,724
Cut it out.

701
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,019
Gosh, no way.

702
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,046
Please go ahead if there's anything
you'd like to say.

703
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,470
How did you and Moo-sung Park meet?

704
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,975
When was the last time you saw him?

705
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,812
You said I can say what I want to say.

706
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,193
Whether her name is Min-ah Kwon
or Ga-young Kim, I don't know her.

707
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,320
I've never seen her.

708
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,197
Please sit down.

709
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,784
Did Moo-sung Park ever threaten you?

710
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,036
Why do you keep talking
about that dead man?

711
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,412
Because he's dead.

712
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,790
Sit down, please.

713
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,921
Did you

714
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,007
summon me to dump everything on me?

715
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,260
Will you accuse me of killing him
because you don't have

716
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,096
enough evidence to link me with that girl?

717
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,847
Shall I list my alibis?

718
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,559
Detective Jang saw you at the station
when Moo-sung Park was killed.

719
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,436
With the Ga-young Kim case,

720
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,647
your driver confirmed dropping you off
at your place.

721
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,357
Why did you snoop around
and check my alibis?

722
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,111
Do you realize what you have done?

723
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,239
I'm a husband and a father.

724
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,575
Because of what you have done,

725
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,246
I'm like a dead person
to my wife and children.

726
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,874
You're also accusing me
of killing someone now?

727
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,377
You think I'm a murderer?

728
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,505
We're okay here.

729
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,053
This is all you need to hear from me.

730
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,514
Listen up.

731
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,475
I don't know that girl who was found

732
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,519
at Moo-sung Park's house.

733
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,896
I've never even touched her.

734
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,427
If you continue to deny it,

735
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,306
we'll have no choice
but to disclose all of these photos.

736
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,809
Please admit it

737
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,312
and apologize.

738
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,691
That's the last thing I can do for...

739
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,875
That is

740
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,753
the last thing you can do

741
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,297
for the democratic

742
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,091
and civilian police

743
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,930
as well as for our colleagues
at Yongsan Police Station.

744
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,229
Please do it for us, sir.

745
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,702
Please come with us.

746
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,991
The washroom.

747
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,951
Pardon me?

748
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,204
I need to use the washroom.

749
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,500
Oh, sure. This way, please.

750
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,515
I'll wait outside, sir.
When you're done...

751
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,101
I need to ask you for a favor.

752
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,270
What... What is this about?

753
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,484
These are fake, right?

754
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,070
These must've been manipulated.
Did Prosecutor Hwang give you these?

755
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,087
They must be
from the security camera footage.

756
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,133
I'm not asking you to steal it
or to delete the file for me.

757
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,677
Please. Just get me a copy.

758
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,682
No one will find out.

759
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,687
Forget it. I don't want to watch it.

760
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,985
Good call. You don't need to watch it
with your own eyes.

761
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,114
I have to go to Hannam-dong.

762
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,997
Wait, Lieutenant.

763
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,147
I haven't seen you two together
in quite a while.

764
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,401
Both troublemakers
of the division are here.

765
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,612
You would've been the perfect trio
with Eun-soo here.

766
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,240
Gosh, you're hurting my feelings here.

767
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,284
Please don't count yourself out.
You're one of us troublemakers too.

768
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,245
Do you ever get disheartened?

769
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,372
Being on TV like that
must've been mortifying.

770
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,666
Your face was on TV too.

771
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,501
Don't forget, we were both investigated.

772
00:54:56,584 --> 00:55:00,296
There were so many comments
about my handsome face though.

773
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,048
Good for you.

774
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,717
Tell us what you know.

775
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,138
There are things that I heard
directly from Mr. Park.

776
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,099
The 800 million won was his money.

777
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,517
We know that.

778
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,060
Mr. Young returned the money.

779
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,353
We know that too.

780
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,441
He told me that Chairman Lee
asked him to do it.

781
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,574
Do you know what Mr. Park did
to lure Mr. Lee out?

782
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,121
He wanted to get jobs
from Hanjo Construction

783
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,581
but had no funds to circulate.

784
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,874
So he ended up...

785
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,503
Keep it short. So what happened?

786
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,714
Chairman Lee's executive assistant,

787
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:45,467
Mr. Woo, got in touch with him.

788
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,101
To a chairman of such a conglomerate,
800 million won must be nothing.

789
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,520
Why did he have to use Mr. Park?

790
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,690
He must've wanted to get
Mr. Park involved. It's obvious.

791
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,653
He knew everything
about what his son-in-law was up to,

792
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,280
and he used it to hit his Achilles' heel.

793
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,122
Mr. Lee was able to have some fun
behind his wife's back thanks to Mr. Park,

794
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,415
and Chairman Lee knew everything.

795
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,126
I'm not sure why, but Chairman Lee

796
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:23,505
wanted to push out Mr. Young,
and he needed Mr. Lee on his side.

797
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,674
The man who knew exactly what kind of fun
he had been having

798
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,636
was right beside his father-in-law
who intimidates him.

799
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,014
So are you saying Mr. Lee had to listen
to his father-in-law

800
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:36,518
and strike against Mr. Young
because of that weakness of his?

801
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,023
Mr. Young was like a father to Mr. Lee.

802
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:48,029
Are you sure Moo-sung Park
provided Mr. Lee with women?

803
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,864
Of course. Is that even a question?

804
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,783
Do I have to see it to know that?

805
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,284
If that's true,

806
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,371
why did Yun-beom Lee
have to get rid of Mr. Young

807
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,915
and why did he have to use
his son-in-law to do that?

808
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,459
Mr. Kang.

809
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,670
You must know something.

810
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,214
No, I don't. Don't pressure me.

811
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,221
Hanjo Distribution.
You've heard of it, right?

812
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,472
Oh, that company.

813
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,225
Mr. Park invested everything he had
in that company's stocks,

814
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,227
and that became tens of billions of won.

815
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,021
Mr. Park spent 1.4 billion won
on the company's stocks.

816
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:26,067
But that turned into 19 billion won
overnight after the company went public.

817
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,485
He must've been thrilled, right?

818
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,696
But the Financial Supervisory Service
ruined his excitement.

819
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,322
"You jerk, isn't this illegal?

820
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,284
You must've bought the stocks with a loan
as you knew about them going public."

821
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,328
Saying things like that,
they tried to make him talk.

822
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,748
That was when
he was getting jobs from Hanjo,

823
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,750
so it was clearly an insider trading.

824
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,503
-So did Mr. Park disclose anything?
-No.

825
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,509
I sound like a financial expert right now,
so don't butt in.

826
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,011
Everyone knows this story.

827
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,598
What about this one?

828
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,225
Hanjo Group protected Mr. Park
from FSS back then.

829
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,853
No, that's not what happened.

830
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,689
Mr. Park said he won all public officials
over to his side.

831
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,401
Hey, do you think those at FSS
are some clueless punks?

832
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,445
Mr. Park wouldn't have been able
to influence them.

833
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,572
I bet you don't know this either.

834
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:16,034
Yun-beom Lee's children also owned
a lot of the company's stocks.

835
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,038
Is the information on how much
Mr. Lee's wife invested also available?

836
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,332
No, but I acquired it.

837
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,585
She invested 1.5 billion won,

838
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,587
and her half-brother invested
3.5 billion won.

839
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,175
MOO-SUNG PARK OWNS STOCK OF 19 BILLION WON
FROM HANJO CONSTRUCTION.

840
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,432
But how is this connected
to Mr. Young's bribery case?

841
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,768
I don't know that either.

842
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,103
Mr. Park never told me about it,
which I thought was strange.

843
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,814
Mr. Kang, did you hear anything
from Mr. Young?

844
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,485
He must've been framed like that
because he knows something.

845
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,697
He didn't tell me anything.

846
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,911
But they only invested 3.5
and 1.5 billion won when their father

847
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,288
is the chairman of one of the biggest
conglomerates in Korea.

848
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,831
How petty.

849
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,502
Gosh, it's five billion won together.
Do you think that's petty?

850
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,170
How freehanded are you?

851
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,386
Yes.

852
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,846
Go where?

853
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,649
Breaking news.

854
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,609
Former chief prosecutor, Chang-jun Lee,

855
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,612
has been appointed
as the president's chief secretary.

856
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,865
The Blue House just held a briefing
at Choonchoogwan

857
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,827
to announce the appointment
of the new president's chief secretary,

858
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,870
Chang-jun Lee,
who is the former chief prosecutor

859
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,414
of Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

860
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,625
Until just recently, Chang-jun Lee
used to be the deputy chief prosecutor

861
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,461
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office...

862
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,380
I didn't expect this at all.

863
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,091
How can it unfold like this?

864
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,136
Yes, I'll leave now.

865
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,182
The entire criminal division is going
to see him to congratulate him.

866
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,894
-I'll do it another time.
-Why?

867
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,230
I have to take care of something.

868
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,190
All right. Get going.

869
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,997
FORMER CHIEF PROSECUTOR CHANG-JUN LEE

870
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,249
Former Chief Prosecutor Lee
Appointed as Chief Secretary

871
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,793
Can you trust him?

872
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,087
I have no choice.

873
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,633
I won't stop at a tip of the iceberg
like Moo-sung Park.

874
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,969
I'm not married to a rich family,
so I don't know anyone

875
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:44,432
other than Mr. Seo
whom I can send to Hanjo.

876
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,937
What if he's just saying he spoke
to Chairman Lee? Do you buy it?

877
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,650
He went straight to Hanjo
from the hospital.

878
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,652
He was there for a while,
so I think he met him.

879
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,615
Even the President can't control
Chairman Lee.

880
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,867
Am I supposed to stop you or support you?

881
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,455
Please hold off on firing Mr. Seo
for the time being.

882
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,332
He should be dismissed
from the entire prosecution.

883
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,669
He'll be arrested.
Please hold it off until then.

884
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:19,425
Let's go. Everyone is already
at the parking lot.

885
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,680
Mr. Kang.

886
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,935
Don't you think Yun-beom Lee
must've first heard about Moo-sung Park

887
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,312
when he invested in the company's stocks?

888
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,649
Moo-sung Park was the biggest
shareholder after his children.

889
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,819
I'll look into it more.

890
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,697
You're so determined.
I should give you that much support.

891
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,500
-Mr. Yoon is doing a good job, right?
-Yes.

892
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,335
Treat him well. He's a nice guy.

893
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,839
What should I do to treat him well?

894
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,013
Had someone else asked me that question,
I would've assumed he was acting up.

895
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,600
The way you say it sounds like
you really want to treat him well.

896
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,602
Just treat him like that.

897
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,188
Wanting to treat him well
will help you figure out how to do it.

898
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,773
Okay.

899
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,985
You should treat me well too, you jerk.

900
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,195
Yes, sir.

901
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,991
Gosh, people are so quick to act
at times like this.

902
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,868
His letter of appointment just got printed

903
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,828
and look at the fuss they make
on congratulating him.

904
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,132
Ma'am.

905
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,218
Someone from the police is here.
What should I do?

906
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,485
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT,
CHANG-JUN LEE

907
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,623
CHIEF WOO-GYUN KIM

908
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,836
BLOCK THE NUMBER

909
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:09,971
Come in.

910
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,062
Congratulations, Mr. Lee.
I'm honored to serve you again.

911
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:21,774
Thank you for trusting me
and following me here.

912
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,860
I'm the one who should thank you.

913
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,071
This is from the Head of State Affairs.

914
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:30,241
This is a gift from Chief Woo-gyun Kim
at Yongsan Police Station.

915
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:34,370
Those from the Western Seoul
Prosecutors' Office are at the main gate.

916
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,746
Thank you.

917
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,157
This is from the original footage.

918
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,618
Shall I expose who was in the room
where the girl came out of

919
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,703
with the reservation records
from the hotel,

920
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,371
Mr. Chief Secretary?

921
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:27,840
Congratulations, Mr. Chief Secretary.

922
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,008
Thank you.

923
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,135
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

924
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,556
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

925
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,479
Congratulations.

926
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,232
Thank you.

927
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:46,651
Thank you.

928
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,491
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

929
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:36,993
STRANGER

930
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,953
You won't be able to go abroad
for a while.

931
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,372
It's a request from the prosecution.
Please confirm, sir.

932
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:43,916
-Tell them that's not going to happen.
-Prohibition of departure?

933
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,961
Nobody would've known
if it weren't for that scum.

934
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,921
His wife is charged with murder.

935
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,258
But, he's not curious about
who she might've killed and why?

936
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,552
-Come work for me.
-It's working itself out.

937
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,220
Chairman Lee is up to something.

938
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,681
Please try to recall.
Anything would be great.

939
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,516
You need to remember as soon as possible.

940
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,226
Zero...

941
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:04,979
Seven...

942
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,694
