1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,087
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,801
-So you think he's alive?
-He'd better be.

4
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,720
Shouldn't you find out who that was,

5
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,348
and what else they told him first?

6
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,434
Senior Inspector Han Yeo-jin
will be in charge.

7
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:03,396
And the second team will investigate
Segok Police Station with me.

8
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,732
What? A cop?

9
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,069
Well, this and this…
These two cases are connected… Ma'am?

10
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,863
Our Captain even told me
to leave Sergeant Song alone.

11
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,448
Song Gi-hyeon committed suicide.

12
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,991
"Let's sacrifice one member

13
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,994
and save the whole team."
Is that what you thought?

14
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,082
Our children are waiting
for their father to come back.

15
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,169
Any small detail is important to us.

16
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,170
You got what?

17
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,006
Someone must've leaked that info
with certain intentions.

18
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,925
-Nothing's been confirmed.
-No, it isn't.

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,807
If Seo Dong-jae is really found dead…

20
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,518
And let's say the police did it.

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,939
What if we're told to hand over
the investigative authority despite that?

22
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,150
It'll be an all-out war.

23
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,153
Yes. The feud between
the prosecution and the police

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,239
will turn into a war
between us and the government.

25
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,617
All the prosecutors who've been
holding back due to social discourse

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,369
will rise up to protest against it.

27
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,912
But the thing is,

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,456
the government won't do that.

29
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,711
Even this administration won't be able to
mess with our investigative authority.

30
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,971
I'm not saying I think
Prosecutor Seo will be found dead.

31
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,146
Chief Woo refused
to shoot straight with me.

32
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,692
I asked him if he had been trying to dig
up dirt on Choi Bit, but he didn't answer.

33
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,444
You asked him that?

34
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,238
Isn't that why you asked me about it?

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,159
You asked me if I thought
Chief Woo would try to dig up dirt on her

36
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,452
because you wanted me
to ask him out for you.

37
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,373
-Was it that obvious?
-Do you think I'm an idiot?

38
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,125
I'm sorry, sir.

39
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,002
You're apologizing?

40
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,754
-So you thought I was an idiot?
-No, sir.

41
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,090
Hey, that sounded very insincere.

42
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,261
I also thought it'd be better for me
to ask him personally

43
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,972
if I wanted to find out
what's really going on.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,767
But he seemed to be on edge about it.

45
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,104
-You mean, Chief Woo?
-Is it because he's worried?

46
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,357
His junior went missing without
a trace except for a single bloodstain

47
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,236
while working on something
that was assigned by him.

48
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,282
Do you think
Chief Woo is reacting like that

49
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,160
purely because he's worried?

50
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,079
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

51
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,165
I mean, look at you.

52
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,833
You and him were close,

53
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,629
but you're managing to keep your cool
despite how worried you are.

54
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
We aren't that close.

55
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,006
What?

56
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,302
Then do you think
that Chief Woo is just worried?

57
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,762
You see…

58
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,681
How are you meant to act
when you're worried?

59
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,184
-What?
-I need to know what the signs

60
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,562
and symptoms are to figure out
whether or not someone is worried.

61
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,648
How do people behave when they're worried?

62
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,609
What kind of question is that?
They just worry.

63
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,777
We're back!

64
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,074
Here's some food for everyone.

65
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,079
Thank you.

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,216
SENIOR INSPECTOR HAN YEO-JIN

67
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,134
Yes, Senior Inspector Han.

68
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,728
We received a message.

69
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,814
A message from the culprit.

70
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,154
2 HOURS AGO

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,326
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THEY'D KIDNAP A PROSECUTOR?

72
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,122
THE PROSECUTOR IS HANDSOME
I HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT

73
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,207
I wish they'd post something useful.

74
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,601
I WASHED THE DISHES
TOO LATE

75
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,784
This is…

76
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,955
The color of the blood…

77
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,334
Maybe it's because this photo is too dark.

78
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,670
I don't think this is too old.
The blood doesn't look that dark.

79
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,339
Is that the floor?

80
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,591
Did they put it on a
table to take the photo?

81
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,927
-Couldn't they have taken a better photo?
-It's too dark.

82
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,638
Was it taken at night?
It doesn't look like natural light.

83
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,433
And it just looks like
a regular hardwood floor.

84
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,268
We can't tell with this photo.

85
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,438
But the tie is soaked in blood.
Dried blood won't do that.

86
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,690
-This has to be fresh blood.
-Looks like it.

87
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,109
-So he's alive?
-That's what I'm thinking.

88
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,487
The color of the blood
hasn't changed that much.

89
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,240
But what if the photo was taken
by the culprit much earlier

90
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,575
and he sent it to us now?

91
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,120
If that's the case,
why send us these today, of all days?

92
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,247
Maybe he didn't know where to send them

93
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,584
until we posted the video
with Sun-chang's phone number?

94
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,671
If these were taken
on the day that he was kidnapped,

95
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,382
there's no telling if he's dead or alive.

96
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,472
Did you check
the sender's name and location?

97
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,517
The culprit probably didn't use
their own number,

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,268
-but I'm looking into it.
-Okay.

99
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,979
Detective Jang, get the locations
of the Segok officers.

100
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,564
-Sure.
-When we get the GPS info,

101
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,235
we'll compare it with those officers'
whereabouts and see if there's an overlap.

102
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:46,864
Okay. But since they're cops,
they'll know they can be tracked.

103
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,449
If the culprit is one of them,

104
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,911
I'm sure they placed their phone
somewhere else when sending this photo.

105
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,872
Yes. It would've been too obvious
if their phone was turned off.

106
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,959
-We should still look into it.
-Yes.

107
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,505
Do you think the victim is with
the culprit, whether he's alive or not?

108
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:07,093
Let's say the culprit already buried
or tossed Prosecutor Seo somewhere.

109
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,223
Then why did they cut out
a piece of his tie and send it to us?

110
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,892
-Maybe they took the tie before that.
-That's right.

111
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,936
Maybe this was his plan from the get-go.

112
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,438
Maybe it's for shock value.

113
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,232
They purposely sent us
a part of the blood-soaked tie.

114
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,483
I doubt they're normal.

115
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,069
They're practically out of their mind.

116
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,115
Most culprits don't send us
photos like this to show off.

117
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,243
They must really have it in for the victim
to call it "dishwashing."

118
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,830
Is one of the people Prosecutor Seo
put behind bars trying to get back at him?

119
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,084
Why does he keep coming here?

120
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,213
Were there many comments
criticizing the culprit?

121
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,800
Yes. There are no tips
but everyone's cursing the culprit out.

122
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,720
It means that the culprit
watched the video,

123
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,973
judging by how these were sent to you
as soon as the video was posted.

124
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,726
Given what they did,
they must be watching everything

125
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,603
to see who's talking about them.

126
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,063
They must've read the comments too.

127
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,649
This is their way
of getting their revenge.

128
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,443
They're cleaning out the "filth."

129
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,403
Whether it was because of a grudge

130
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,199
or something that Prosecutor Seo did
that caused the culprit harm.

131
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,160
But everyone's posting
berating comments about them.

132
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,455
Do people like them get upset
by malicious comments online too?

133
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,582
Is he angry?

134
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:24,420
If that's the case, he must have
taken the photo after he saw the video.

135
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,591
Then does this mean
that Prosecutor Seo could still be alive?

136
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,556
What should we tell his family?

137
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,434
Should we show them the photo?

138
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,903
"I did it.

139
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,863
Too late."

140
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,658
Short, simple sentences.

141
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,662
Everything else is straightforward,
so why use a metaphor?

142
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,332
To show off?
Or does it mean the grudge runs that deep?

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,668
Why did he send us this?

144
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,188
I WASHED THE DISHES
TOO LATE

145
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,903
"I'm a victim too.

146
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,157
The prosecutor brought it upon himself."
Is this what they're trying to say?

147
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,493
But why?

148
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,751
They got their revenge.

149
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,170
Why the explanation?

150
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,506
Because what others think matters?

151
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,300
Or just out of anger?

152
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,762
Because people think that the victim
is a good man and a good prosecutor?

153
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,020
Are they anxious because of the video
the police uploaded?

154
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,563
And why the necktie?

155
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,150
If they wanted to prove
that they're the kidnapper…

156
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,779
Prosecutor Hwang.

157
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,491
Where can I see the prosecution's
personnel transfer records?

158
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,201
At the Ministry of Justice.

159
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,412
Hold on.
Why are you asking him about that?

160
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,206
Do you want a list of every office
the victim's worked in?

161
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,125
Well, the victim is a prosecutor.

162
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,252
If the culprit is holding a grudge,

163
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,880
we should go through
everyone he put behind bars

164
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,548
to obtain a lead of any kind.

165
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,592
There will be way too many.

166
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,219
It's not just the convicts.
What about their families?

167
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,139
Exactly. He worked in the prosecution
for over a decade.

168
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,184
How can we comb through
every case he's ever worked on?

169
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:47,021
Honestly speaking,
what if it's related to bribery?

170
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,107
"I gave you money. How dare you
not keep your end of the bargain?"

171
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,069
If that's what started this,
it wouldn't be on the records.

172
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,029
We know he accepted bribes before.

173
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,657
Even if we had more time
and weren't short-staffed,

174
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,493
-we won't be able to do that.
-That's right.

175
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,203
To narrow down the suspects,

176
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,789
we'll have to comb through
all the cases he's worked on.

177
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,333
Do you think the prosecution
will just hand them over?

178
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,505
Exactly. We'll keep searching the scene
and interviewing the people around him.

179
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,133
And the prosecution should look
into the rest themselves.

180
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,763
Can you send me the photo?

181
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,431
Sure.

182
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,476
-Nice one.
-Well said. Thank goodness.

183
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,852
-Right?
-Totally.

184
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,149
What do you think this message means?

185
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,276
"You can't catch me.

186
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,986
I have something to say.

187
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,364
Here's my message, smeared with blood.
So listen."

188
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,034
This message shows that the culprit
thinks the police are a joke.

189
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,077
How dare they?

190
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,748
Are you not outraged that
some lunatic's treating us like this?

191
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,171
Between people saying that
all cops should drop dead and this,

192
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,548
I can't tell which is worse.

193
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,635
Who in the police force
would say the culprit is a cop?

194
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,514
I doubt the prosecutors would
try to look for us if we went missing.

195
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,352
This means that the culprit
isn't one of the officers from Segok.

196
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,979
It's up to us to prove it.

197
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,150
I've sent you the photo.

198
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,202
Officer Park Sun-chang, well done.

199
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,120
Pardon?

200
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,539
Without that video,
we wouldn't have received this.

201
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,626
We've obtained an invaluable clue,
regardless of the culprit's intentions.

202
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,836
Great job.

203
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,216
I have to say,
the young ones are sharp-witted.

204
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
He's not just young.
He's practically a kid.

205
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,179
-Thank you.
-Good work.

206
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,638
-I'm impressed.
-Good job.

207
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,520
This is the Criminal Legislation Division.
Is the deputy chief there?

208
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,355
Okay, thank you.

209
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,440
He's in the office.

210
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,735
Request a full list of every office
Seo Dong-jae's ever worked in.

211
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,111
Tell them I need it.

212
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,154
Yes, sir.

213
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,333
How dare they mess with us?

214
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
What did he say?

215
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,014
He asked me to get
Prosecutor Seo's wife's call logs.

216
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,766
Is he on to something?

217
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,685
Yesterday, he asked his wife
why she thinks

218
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,438
the kidnapper hasn't demanded
a ransom yet.

219
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,440
That's possible
if the wife is the culprit.

220
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,151
If she wanted,
she could have forged a ransom note

221
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,611
to evade suspicion.

222
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,571
They don't usually go that far.

223
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,951
Though I've seen a husband crying at his
wife's funeral turn out to be the culprit.

224
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,161
We happened to receive that photo today,

225
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,497
so Prosecutor Hwang is suspecting

226
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,874
if the photo was sent by the wife
to evade suspicion.

227
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,460
But she said she was at home,
with her kids.

228
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,463
I should go over
their children's statements again.

229
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,881
Hey, come with me.

230
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,424
We'll stop by their place first.

231
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,968
-All right, guys.
-See you later.

232
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,052
Okay.

233
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,848
If she had a male accomplice,

234
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,310
she'd intentionally stay home, right?
To make it look like she's unrelated?

235
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,189
Jeez, this is why
missing-person cases are so awful.

236
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,776
It's utterly devastating for those
who are closest to the victim,

237
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,653
yet they end up becoming the suspect.

238
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,700
If we have to keep an eye on the victim's
residence, we'll have so much to do.

239
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,203
But Ms. Han helped us
take a huge weight off our shoulders.

240
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,541
People really listen to her
now that she's moved on to a bigger pond.

241
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,668
-What do you mean?
-You know, earlier.

242
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,713
Because she said we won't be able
to go through all the records,

243
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,756
the job ended up going to the prosecution.

244
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,633
That's not what she said, you fool.

245
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,931
Then…

246
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,267
The prosecution won't
hand over the records

247
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,144
so we won't ask for them.

248
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,438
"Since you love to exert
investigative authority,

249
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,815
you should take care of this. But…

250
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,942
we as police should be embarrassed

251
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,862
that we complained
about getting more work."

252
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,364
That's the gist of what she said earlier.

253
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,951
Didn't you feel it
when she complimented you?

254
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,288
She wasn't complimenting you
as your colleague.

255
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,790
That was a compliment
someone higher up would give.

256
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,834
I thought she was Chief Choi for a moment.

257
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,796
She's now in the policy development team.

258
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,549
I've learned a lot
since joining our team two years ago,

259
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,260
so she must've also learned a lot from…

260
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,597
From all the experience, right?

261
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,015
My goodness.

262
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,853
-You put me to shame.
-Yes, I know.

263
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,899
Well, to tell you the truth…

264
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,945
When she called me
"Officer Park Sun-chang,"

265
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,988
that's the only thing… You know?

266
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,282
I guess you're right.

267
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,504
TOO LATE

268
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,059
I WASHED THE DISHES
TOO LATE

269
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,525
TOO LATE

270
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,111
"Too late."

271
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,285
"It's too late to find him"?

272
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,122
"You are too late"?

273
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,208
TOO LATE

274
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,710
I WASHED THE DISHES
TOO LATE

275
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,633
Which is it?

276
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,681
We received a message,
which is believed to be from the culprit.

277
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,101
It was sent to the tip-off line posted
by a detective at Yongsan Station.

278
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,689
If this is true,

279
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,526
they must have held a grudge
against him for a long time.

280
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,779
Right, which means
it's not one of the Segok officers.

281
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,448
Everything fits together,

282
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
but we cannot overlook the risk.

283
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,911
I'll just go public with this.
I have to give an interim briefing anyway.

284
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,497
No, let's hold off on that.
This could be fake.

285
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,375
We'll find out anyway
when we catch the culprit.

286
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,127
We'll figure something out then.

287
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,213
The entire police force is facing
severe criticism right now.

288
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,966
What if one of the Segok officers did this

289
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,218
to make it seem as if he was
kidnapped because of a grudge

290
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,012
because we're closing in on him?

291
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,723
Your biggest concern is
investigative authority,

292
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,475
but I'm responsible for this case.

293
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,166
Finally.

294
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,587
There will be a lot of stone hurling.

295
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,381
Is someone hurling stones? At you?

296
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,899
The Segok officers' written statements.

297
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,194
No, older ones are fine too.
As long as they're handwritten.

298
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,153
Also…

299
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,155
Rumors?

300
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,951
What kinds of rumors?

301
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,246
Have you heard anyone say
that Prosecutor Seo had a sponsor?

302
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,581
Or is there anything you saw
while working under him?

303
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,208
No.

304
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,753
Did he give anyone special treatment
or ever give unreasonable orders?

305
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,213
What about his private life?

306
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,715
His private life?

307
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,926
With the opposite sex.

308
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,262
Did he?

309
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,681
No, she said he never did.

310
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,809
Was she trying to protect her mentor?

311
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,769
It could be true.

312
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,606
I saw him three times
after moving back to Seoul,

313
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,402
and he was always wearing the same watch.
And the same shoes too, two times.

314
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,488
Considering how he used to be…

315
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,740
It's not like him.

316
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,455
Did he look dejected by any chance?

317
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,499
"Dejected"?

318
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,127
The chief of the western office called.

319
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,171
An order came
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

320
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,548
They wanted him to compile a list

321
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,217
of all the cases where Dong-jae
had problems with the defendants

322
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,719
and reinvestigate them.

323
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,056
The current chief
doesn't know Dong-jae that well,

324
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,642
so he called to ask
why he got such an order.

325
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,645
That got taken care of quickly.

326
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,442
Did you request to have this collected?
All the troubles he's caused?

327
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,401
Yes.

328
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,486
-All the offices he's ever worked in?
-Yes.

329
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,493
He'll have to be a lawyer.

330
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,413
He'll be good at it
because he's a smooth talker.

331
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,876
He's worked at six or seven offices,
at the very least.

332
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:15,547
They'll comb through every case
he's ever worked on.

333
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,717
Even saints have a flaw or two.

334
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,427
And in Dong-jae's case…

335
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,388
Since it's Seo Dong-jae,

336
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,517
his reputation will hit rock bottom
if they dig up his past conducts.

337
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,229
No office will want to work with him.

338
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,733
Are you saying I should have taken
his reputation into account?

339
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,568
All I'm saying is,

340
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,112
his reputation doesn't matter
if he returns safe and sound.

341
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,324
If we can save him
before it's too late, that is.

342
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,372
Jeez.

343
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,590
He wanted to stop by,
but I told him not to.

344
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,428
I told him, "What for? Why bother?"

345
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,474
When was that?

346
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,227
When did he say he wanted to stop by?

347
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,106
I don't know. A little while ago, I guess.

348
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,403
He was just trying to be friendly.
He must have been embarrassed.

349
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,990
I cut him off right away.

350
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,285
Prosecutor Seo said he'd look into it.

351
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,829
That was what our last phone call
was about.

352
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,872
He said he needed more time

353
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,417
and that he hadn't had a chance
to meet the chief yet.

354
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,131
You said you had a question for me.
You must be busy, so go ahead and ask.

355
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,718
I had asked him a favor a while back.

356
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,885
Hey.

357
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,430
Ask away so you can go look for him.

358
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,349
If there's anything we should know
about the eastern district office.

359
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,976
How was Prosecutor Seo…

360
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,604
Because you wanted to see
if there was something you could use

361
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,897
to attack the eastern office?

362
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,567
…after I transferred to Tongyeong?

363
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,403
Did he cause trouble
that you don't know about?

364
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,405
Yes.

365
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,868
I'm not sure.

366
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,664
I ended up transferring him
to Juvenile Investigations.

367
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,250
And I must say,
he did a pretty good job there.

368
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,170
Dealing with child abuse and bullying is

369
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,880
a whole different ball game.

370
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,008
Some of the cases had him fuming mad.

371
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,468
I see.

372
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,262
Thank you for your time, sir.

373
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,307
You're done?
You came all the way here for that?

374
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,475
It's not that far.

375
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,311
It took me 30 minutes to get here.

376
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,645
All right.

377
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,774
You said you interviewed a suspect,
the cop.

378
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,734
Why not interrogate him more?

379
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,903
Like you said, he's still just a suspect.

380
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,363
Woo Tae-ha must be thrilled.

381
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:49,159
Even everyone here is saying they won't
let it go if the police orchestrated it.

382
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,497
All right.

383
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,967
I may sound a bit subjective
coming from me,

384
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,887
but Chief Choi Bit seemed
rather favorable to me

385
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,056
when I met her this morning.

386
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:15,560
So what did she say
she'll do about Park Gwang-su?

387
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,982
Figuring that out
is just a matter of time now, ma'am.

388
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,985
I was afraid she might put her guard up.

389
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,445
She is a cop, after all.

390
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,698
But I'll find out soon, ma'am.

391
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,577
They must be on alert
because the culprit might be a cop.

392
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,914
I'm surprised to hear
that she was favorable to you.

393
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,584
Oh, ma'am. Did I tell you?

394
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,379
I'm also meeting with the chief
of the eastern office today.

395
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,466
I should take care of the issues
surrounding Hanjo's lawsuit as well.

396
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,011
That's good news.
I'll have Mr. Park fill me in on that.

397
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,266
Yes, ma'am. I'll call him
as soon as the meeting is over.

398
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,726
Have a good day, ma'am.

399
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,710
The second trial for the fines
has been scheduled.

400
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,503
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT
NOTICE OF TRIAL

401
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,922
Seoul High Court's Division 3
is handling it.

402
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,885
It's never-ending.

403
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,805
Tell them we need to submit
additional documents and postpone it.

404
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,723
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,394
And I found out why Mr. Lee has been quiet
since the shareholders' meeting.

406
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,606
It looks like Hanjo Engineering
will be audited soon.

407
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,068
I heard the lights from floor twelve
and up have been on all night.

408
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,197
They'll be audited?

409
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,491
Did someone rat on them,
or did they get caught?

410
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,785
The eastern office
started the investigation

411
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,996
and handed it over to the FSC.

412
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,083
Is the Eastern Prosecutors' Office
out to get Hanjo?

413
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,877
Isn't our accounting team on floor eight?

414
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,794
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,714
They'll have to pull all-nighters too.

416
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,512
I'll get our accounting team ready
so we can avoid further audits.

417
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,933
I say one word, and you know
exactly what needs to be done.

418
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,567
Is this your husband's necktie?

419
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,463
Please find my husband.

420
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,590
Yes, we're doing our best.

421
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,260
Save him. Please help him.

422
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,221
I know you have a suspect,
and you've already interviewed him.

423
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,016
Why isn't my husband back yet?

424
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,855
YOON SIN-YEONG SOLO PRACTICE
EUMPA PIANO ACADEMY

425
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,778
I'm sorry, but could you write a statement

426
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,073
stating that you've seen the photo
and verified your husband's necktie?

427
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,700
We need the statement. I'm sorry.

428
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,465
Are you at home?

429
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,553
A detective came by just now.

430
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,060
March 29, 14:01.

431
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,520
YONGSAN POLICE STATION, TEAM 3

432
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,481
FIND OUT WHO THE WIFE SPOKE TO
AT 14:01 ON MARCH 29

433
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,943
Hey, what about the CCTV footage?

434
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,362
-You should see this.
-Why? Do you think she lied?

435
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,449
No, we've confirmed with the kids
that she was home all day.

436
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,537
She did come home around 7 p.m.
on the day of the incident.

437
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,749
But if you see this…

438
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,586
That's her younger kid heading out
to the academy at 7:30 p.m.

439
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,464
But the thing is,
her older kid came home after 10 p.m.

440
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,636
So there's no one to prove her alibi
for that three-hour window?

441
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,514
But none of the footage
shows her leaving the house.

442
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,560
Remember the realtor lady
from two months ago?

443
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,896
She vanished from her home,

444
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,190
but she wasn't caught
on any of the CCTV cameras.

445
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,484
From her children's perspective,

446
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,028
the younger one saw her
at home in the evening

447
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,114
and the older one also saw her at home
later that night.

448
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,617
Maybe that's why they said
their mom was home all day.

449
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,245
I mean, she wouldn't encourage
her kids to lie.

450
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,331
You still believe that all moms are good?

451
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,249
Well, I'm just…

452
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,920
-I'm surprised she touched up her nails.
-What?

453
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,340
I know this because I've seen my wife.

454
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,260
Nail polish usually chips in a day or two.

455
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,388
But his wife must do her nails
every night.

456
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,348
Her nail polish didn't chip at all.

457
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,559
What's it called?
What if she got a gel manicure?

458
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,561
Hang on. I saw her nails during the shoot.

459
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,355
I'm not talking about nail art.

460
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:14,984
That's when you put on sparkles
and draw on your nails.

461
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,028
Her nails are not like that.

462
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,780
Maybe she just picked a solid color.

463
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,075
It's very durable
so you need a solvent to remove it.

464
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,829
Think about it.
If she went to a nail salon

465
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:29,249
and asked them to remove it
because her husband went missing,

466
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,168
wouldn't that be weirder?

467
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,336
You think so?

468
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,130
Maybe you're right.

469
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,704
IMMIGRATION

470
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,209
MOVED BACK HOME

471
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,922
SELF-EMPLOYED

472
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,133
Did he quit?

473
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,135
Gosh, you scared me.

474
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,972
What kind of shoes are you wearing?
You walked in so silently.

475
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,558
I heard he was transferred. Did he quit?

476
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,395
Yes. He was transferred to Pocheon
after the incident at Segok,

477
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,897
but he quit after 15 days.

478
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,192
He currently works at his mother's
paper shop in Bangsan Market.

479
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,281
Why do you think the culprit
sent a photo of his tie?

480
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,533
To prove that they're the kidnapper?

481
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,453
But the blood wasn't necessary.

482
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,580
Maybe they wanted to show off.

483
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,334
They're crazy enough to send this.
They could do anything.

484
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,045
There are loads of people
who upload photos on the internet

485
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,505
after hitting someone with their cars.

486
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,631
Captain.

487
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,592
-We got something in the mail.
-What is it?

488
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,929
A show-off…

489
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,224
Bold enough to send
the victim's blood and belongings

490
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,100
directly to the police…

491
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,185
Oh, gosh.

492
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,189
-If the culprit wanted to show off,
-What's that?

493
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,525
wouldn't they have sent us
the tie instead of the photo?

494
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:23,029
They want to show off, not get caught.

495
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,698
Why are you all entering so quietly?

496
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,410
Sending us the necktie would allow us
to find the post office they used.

497
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,914
By visiting the post office,
they would be giving us a lead.

498
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,624
Many people don't realize it,

499
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,709
but there are many mailboxes
on the street.

500
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,462
Putting a letter in one of them
would only take a second.

501
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,714
There wouldn't be any witnesses.

502
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,007
And if he did that,

503
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,427
he could have given us a fingerprint
or other clues.

504
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,640
Even though there's blood on it,

505
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,142
we can't have anything tested
since it's just a photo.

506
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,729
But here's what I find strange.

507
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,024
I've been a detective for 30 years,
but I've never seen anyone

508
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,194
who's sent a message like this
after committing a crime.

509
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,989
Things like this only happen
in American movies.

510
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,367
Most culprits should be busy hiding.
They won't have time for this.

511
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,372
So why did they send us the photo?

512
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,503
If it wasn't about showing off,
it could be that they were upset

513
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,964
after watching the video we uploaded.

514
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:28,636
The culprit saw the victim as someone
who needed to be "washed,"

515
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,723
but people are now praising him
and criticizing the culprit.

516
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,892
Maybe that's what upset them.

517
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,644
That would mean they haven't
gotten rid of him yet.

518
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,938
Then we should do legwork,
not look for a body.

519
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,442
Dead or not, they must have
had him close by to have sent the photo.

520
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,069
Unless they have some kind of a fetish

521
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,863
where they collect
the ties of their victims.

522
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,951
Where would kidnappers in Korea store…

523
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,786
I mean, keep their victims?

524
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,955
If they're normal people like us.

525
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:00,668
It's not like there are any cabins
in the middle of nowhere like in the US.

526
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,046
Where would they keep their victims

527
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,173
in a densely populated country like Korea?

528
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,053
If it's a dead body, the trunk of a car
would be the most convenient.

529
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,641
They could have put him there at first.

530
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:19,103
But even if Prosecutor Seo
was unconscious at the time,

531
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,481
they would've had to tie him up
and gag him

532
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,067
so that he wouldn't cause trouble
when he woke up.

533
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,861
Would the culprit have done that
at the scene?

534
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,404
No, they'd run first.

535
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,824
They would obviously want to flee
the scene of crime first.

536
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,828
Plus, it was a residential area,
so they could've been seen at any moment.

537
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,580
Then where would they go to tie him up?

538
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,040
Where would they keep him?

539
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,918
A parking lot? That's even riskier.

540
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,756
What if the culprit lives in
a detached house with a separate garage?

541
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,342
That would be ideal for the culprit.

542
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,844
But then we need to add
one more condition.

543
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,515
The culprit would have to live
in a detached house with a garage,

544
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,850
but they have to live alone.

545
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,269
They have to live alone,
and even if they're not,

546
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,564
they don't share their car
with any of their family members.

547
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,484
Or the entire household
could be accomplices.

548
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,860
Like that incident before,

549
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,113
"My father was a victim of a hit-and-run,

550
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,700
but Prosecutor Seo took bribes
from the culprit and let him go."

551
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,870
So the entire family could lock him up
in their house as revenge.

552
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,456
It does seem like a detached house.

553
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,170
There aren't many apartments
that have wooden floors like that.

554
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,051
The wooden floor…

555
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,647
He only got to wear these for a few days…

556
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,651
I couldn't buy him these shoes.

557
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,072
But he said it was okay

558
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,743
and that he'd just get a part-time job.

559
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,928
I was already upset,

560
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,222
but that prosecutor kept
talking nonsense to me.

561
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,145
Do you remember
exactly what Prosecutor Seo said to you?

562
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,195
What if the culprit killed him

563
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,198
and left the scene with his body
in the trunk?

564
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,450
If he died at the scene,

565
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,078
the body would be decomposing by now.

566
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,748
And if they didn't get rid of the body,
they'd be keeping it close

567
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,875
since they would have to hide the smell.

568
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,836
When people kill their families,

569
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,633
they keep the body wrapped in a blanket
in their bathrooms or the closet.

570
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,928
It's hard for us to imagine
having to live with a body like that.

571
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,263
People like that can't even
open their windows

572
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,640
because someone might smell the body
and report them.

573
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,601
So the safest place for the culprit

574
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,230
is a location they have full control over.

575
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,607
I don't think we'll get anywhere

576
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,151
by investigating the scene of the crime.

577
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,154
The fact that the culprit left
the victim's car there

578
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,156
means they fled somewhere far away.

579
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,202
Gosh. Where could they be?

580
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,427
Why was it the necktie?

581
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,931
They could've taken his ear or his finger.

582
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,643
Because people wouldn't know
whose it is from the photo?

583
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,520
Because body parts wouldn't show
that it was the victim's?

584
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,856
But that's the same with blood.

585
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,568
Were they scared?

586
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,321
Was it because of that?

587
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,326
I WASHED THE DISHES

588
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,786
Maybe it wasn't revenge.

589
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,373
Oh, you two were here too.

590
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,001
This won't be enough then.
Order some more.

591
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,086
What is it?

592
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,630
Rhino Dumplings. We ordered
tteokbokki on the way here.

593
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,465
I was really craving that.

594
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,801
Hello. We just ordered…

595
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,761
Wait. We want to order some more.

596
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,179
I want dumplings and skewers.

597
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,390
Get fish cakes and sundae
for Detective Seo.

598
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,141
Two servings of dumplings,

599
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,687
two servings of fish cakes and sundae,
and rice cake skewers…

600
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,730
Prosecutor Hwang, do you want skewers too?

601
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,274
Of course. He'll eat them.

602
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,942
Six rice cake skewers then.

603
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,986
All right. Thank you.

604
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,948
I almost cried a while back
because I missed their food so much.

605
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,284
Why? You can just go there and have some.

606
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,661
So I ran over, but they were closed.

607
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,787
What?

608
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,373
You came all the way here
and left without dropping by?

609
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,126
Jeez. You almost cried
because a restaurant was closed,

610
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,838
but you ignored your colleagues
suffering from a heavy workload?

611
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,632
She won't think of us
as her colleagues anymore.

612
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,514
Oh, right.

613
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,809
I got a written statement
from Prosecutor Seo's wife.

614
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,861
WITNESS STATEMENT

615
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,203
Could I get this printed out?

616
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,663
Sure. Send it to me.

617
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,957
I can do it here.

618
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,083
What is that?

619
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,920
Handwritten statements
of the six Segok officers from 2017.

620
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,132
I got it.

621
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,220
Did the culprit not know
how to print something?

622
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,891
They used the non-dominant hand
to hide their handwriting.

623
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,645
It would've been easier
to type and print it out. Jeez.

624
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,817
Here you go.

625
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,906
WITNESS STATEMENT

626
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,118
Here.

627
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,667
Whose is this? It looks the most similar.

628
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,878
The one who left Korea.

629
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,381
-What if he came back for a short while?
-Right.

630
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,093
-Check his entry and departure records.
-Oh, come on.

631
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,804
Can you get these statements analyzed too?

632
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,805
Okay.

633
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,183
The food must be here.

634
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,061
-Are you here?
-Here. Get the receipt.

635
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,271
All right, I'll be there.

636
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,611
Do you think this is a ceiling light?

637
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,370
It looks like there are
two ceiling lights.

638
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,457
I think there's something written here.

639
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,091
Oh, my eyes hurt.

640
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,094
-Did you send this to Forensics?
-No.

641
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,222
It's not like the culprit
printed out the photo themselves.

642
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,474
I didn't think we'd get anything
from the photo.

643
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,351
Right, but just send it over anyway.

644
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,645
-It'll be better than just looking at it.
-Okay.

645
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,690
Would we have the results by tomorrow?

646
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,692
Why tomorrow?

647
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,944
The interim announcement.

648
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,029
Are you going to announce this?

649
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,198
Are you going to tell them
it was the culprit

650
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,951
-when we don't know who it's really from?
-The food's here.

651
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,454
We need to verify it first.
What's the hurry?

652
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,873
It's urgent. You know why.

653
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,181
I'm Han Yeo-jin, the detective
in charge of this case.

654
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:19,602
I will now announce
our investigation results so far

655
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,230
on the missing case of Prosecutor Seo
from the Uijeongbu Office.

656
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,359
Around midnight on March 26, 2019,

657
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:32,114
the blood of Prosecutor Seo from
the Uijeongbu District Prosecutors' Office

658
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,325
was found along with his vehicle

659
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,620
in an alley in Bogwang-dong, Yongsan.

660
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,456
The victim's ID card

661
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:44,585
and small amount of cash
were found in his car.

662
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,756
The entire Violent Crimes Unit
as well as the Intelligence Crime Team

663
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,051
and Investigation Support Team
at Yongsan Police Station

664
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,637
are all working together
to find the missing victim.

665
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,307
We're currently increasing our range
of investigation,

666
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,227
starting from the crime scene.

667
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,395
Just make the announcement.

668
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,898
Gather all the reporters
who said a cop did it,

669
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,067
and tell them they were wrong
to their faces.

670
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,195
The victim, Prosecutor Seo,

671
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,614
has been specializing in juvenile crimes

672
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,574
for the past few years.

673
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,870
The Uijeongbu District Prosecutors' Office
stated that

674
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,499
he was chosen as
the Prosecutor of the Month

675
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,668
for his diligence
and his investigation skills,

676
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,795
and was to receive an award soon.

677
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,754
Is that true?

678
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,965
No, I haven't heard anything.

679
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,177
-Why are they praising him?
-So they can ruin his image later.

680
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,597
We need to verify it first.
What's the hurry?

681
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,724
It's urgent. You know why.

682
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,851
If we announce this,

683
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,895
people will stop saying
that the suspect is a police.

684
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,147
So did the higher-ups tell you to do so?

685
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,817
We are still investigating the suspects

686
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,861
who were formerly
summoned by Prosecutor Seo.

687
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,116
No, it's not just that.

688
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,036
If this message was intended to
throw us off the track

689
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,166
and I announce it at an official briefing,

690
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,169
the Segok officers will think
that their plan is working.

691
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,339
Then they are bound to make a mistake.

692
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,300
Yesterday afternoon,

693
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,053
our investigation team received a photo

694
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,764
that is believed to have been
sent by the culprit

695
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,933
via text message.

696
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,728
Captain!

697
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,202
CULPRIT SENDS PHOTO MESSAGE

698
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,914
Mom.

699
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,084
No,

700
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,379
it's not about your dad.

701
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,347
The culprit is presumed to be
holding a grudge against the victim.

702
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,643
And despite having been
summoned by the prosecution,

703
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,605
the initial suspect was proven
not to have any motives.

704
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,858
So the investigation team
has decided to investigate

705
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,945
the victim's past actions
for new suspects.

706
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,042
Stop the car.

707
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,752
-Pardon?
-Stop the car.

708
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,133
Captain!

709
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,220
Don't! Captain!

710
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,765
Don't do it.

711
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,435
Go back inside.

712
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,524
Calm down.

713
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:55,984
Let's just go.

714
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,546
We're currently focusing

715
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,132
on the victim's actions
for the last two to three years.

716
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,301
And we will be moving onwards
with the investigation

717
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,429
based on the clues we find.

718
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,517
We are waiting for any reports you make
regarding this case.

719
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,936
We appreciate your cooperation.

720
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,149
I'll now answer your questions.

721
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,415
Chief Choi's gone too far.

722
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:05,179
Half the comments are about the culprit,
and the others are about Prosecutor Seo.

723
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,098
The fact that he was under investigation
two years ago comes up

724
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:12,060
when you search his name,
so many people are criticizing him.

725
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,564
And there are only a few comments
criticizing the police now.

726
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,066
All right.

727
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,737
Thank you.

728
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,072
Why are you thanking me?
I just said I got it.

729
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,827
It's already been days. The chance
of finding him is getting smaller.

730
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,789
It's obvious that we'll be criticized
if we don't find him.

731
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,292
You're right.

732
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,045
It feels like we're wasting our efforts.

733
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:42,758
That letter shows the culprit thinks
he's something that should be washed out.

734
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,092
Would they keep him alive?

735
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,637
We're also making investigations

736
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,306
based on the possibility that
the culprit buried the body.

737
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,812
We need a suspect to figure out
where the body would be.

738
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,564
It could be anywhere.

739
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,570
It'd be easier if they buried it outdoors.
What if they buried it in their own yard?

740
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,867
What? Is it something related to the case?

741
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,287
It's Detective Jang. About Kim Su-hang,

742
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,290
one of the officers who worked
at Segok Police Station…

743
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,667
Yes, I know. What about him?

744
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,503
Detective Jang got his resume,

745
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,880
and the store he worked at
right after his release

746
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,966
is just 650 meters away
from the crime scene.

747
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,219
On top of that, the store is his uncle's.

748
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,097
-The former Chief of Dongducheon Station?
-Yes.

749
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,641
I thought you checked
both their alibis yourself.

750
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,227
Come to think of it,
only Officer Kim's was confirmed.

751
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,521
Why do you say "come to think of it"?

752
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,814
The Chief worked overtime…

753
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,610
False entry…

754
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,947
Are you saying that was fake?
So he didn't work overtime?

755
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,574
Would it be possible to verify it?

756
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,869
I'll get it verified for you.

757
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,330
It's about him being a suspect or not.

758
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,456
Thank you.

759
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,916
Do it quietly.

760
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,335
It won't cause any trouble.

761
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,338
If he got someone to fake
his overtime work,

762
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,048
the cameras at the Uijeongbu Station

763
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,134
would have recorded him
getting off work early.

764
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,595
They use a different method these days.

765
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,098
Some people go home
and return to work at night,

766
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,226
and record their overtime work themselves.

767
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,562
They could say they had business outside.

768
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,022
How do you know that so well?

769
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,775
I guess officers in the field
still fake their overtime for more wages.

770
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,570
It's not just the officers working
in the field.

771
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,198
Should I make
a full investigation out of it

772
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,783
instead of keeping this quiet?

773
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,287
How could a civil servant do that
for a little pocket money?

774
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,164
This is ridiculous.

775
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,792
He's working at the Administration
Division in Uijeongbu, right?

776
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,002
Yes.

777
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,088
Go to my desk
in the Reformation Unit office.

778
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,634
There's a small cabinet under the table.
It's the second drawer.

779
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,885
Bring the…

780
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,305
Wait. What was that called?

781
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,100
-The Gyeonggi Province organization chart.
-What's that for?

782
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:02,147
We should interrogate the person
who gets the least amount of overtime pay.

783
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,651
Faking overtime work is a habit,
so people around them always know.

784
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,195
People who work honestly

785
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,114
hate higher-ups who fake their overtime,

786
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,533
so they'll tattle right away
when HQ asks them.

787
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,160
Yes, ma'am. I'll bring the file.

788
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,710
Am I one of the higher-ups that you hate?

789
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,129
What are you talking about?

790
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,049
Do you have anything to tattle--

791
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:34,846
What's with her?

792
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,606
CHIEF CHOI BIT

793
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,818
The second drawer…

794
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,616
What's going on?

795
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,118
What do you mean?

796
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,161
-The file you told--
-No, I'll do it.

797
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,707
You should go check out
the former Dongducheon Chief's store.

798
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,083
It's near the scene.

799
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:07,254
Officer Kim should know the neighborhood
since he worked there.

800
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,588
Right. I should head there.

801
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,966
I'll report to you later.

802
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,153
CALL HISTORY

803
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,672

00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,216

It's from 2018.

Hello, I got the browser history
you sent me.

824
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,857
What are these articles about
the former chief who died in Namyangju?

825
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,067
Let's go have lunch.

Chief Prosecutor Park Gwang-su.

828
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,783
Prosecutor Seo doggedly searched
articles about his death.

829
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,577
-Aren't we going?
-What? Oh, him…

830
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,704
A vacation home area?

831
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,457
He'll join us later.

832
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,294
Is there a possibility…

833
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,881
Hang on. You can go ahead first.

834
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,299
It's fine. Go on.

835
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,885
It's going to take a while.
I'll join you later.

836
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,309
-I'll text you when we get there.
-Okay.

837
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,150
I have to go somewhere.

838
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,860

-I have to go!

Then you must have the dashcam footage.

00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,415
What? Only the footage from that day
is missing?

842
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,252
How could the footage
from the day of his death be missing?

843
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,130
Hang on.

844
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,301
By any chance, did the driver die

845

00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,277
Yes, I'm heading there right now.

850
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:36,708
HIGHWAY 45, GEUMNAM-RI, NAMYANGJU

851
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,875
What the…

852
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,213
What the hell are you doing? Move!

853
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,466
What's going on? Damn it.

854
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,884
Jeez.

855
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,392
Damn it. What are they doing?

856
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,144
What? What's going on?

857
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,745
Are you okay?

858
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,957
What time did you find him?

859
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,084
I'm not sure about the exact time.

860
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,379
I was driving this way,
and that car suddenly stopped.

861
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,345
-Wake up, sir.
-Get him out.

862
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,362
Did he mention any other cases
besides the Segok Station case?

863
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,032
-Just the Segok Station case.
-Do you know why your late husband

864
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,284
was in Namyangju the day he passed away?

865
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,537
I guess it could have been a VIP.

866
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,205
What makes you think that?

867
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,998
You know why I called for you, right?

868
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,709
It's highly likely that he already knew
there weren't any security cameras

869
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,254
from the entrance of the alley
to the scene of the crime.

870
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,130
Could Prosecutor Seo's disappearance

871
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,967
have anything to do
with this case from a year ago

872
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,386
where a man died of a heart attack?

873
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,264
Chief Choi used to be the chief there.

874
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,974
If he was targeting Chief Choi,

875
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,351
he would've brought it
to the Supreme office for sure.

876
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:28,898
