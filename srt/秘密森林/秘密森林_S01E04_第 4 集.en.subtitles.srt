1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,261
STRANGER

3
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,740
She was a tough one too.

4
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,783
That's why I remember her.

5
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,996
Did you hear anything?

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,040
It was too long ago.

7
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,584
Did he tell her not to bullshit him?

8
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,420
Anyway, it was mainly him
who got all worked up.

9
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,924
He must've been caught on security cameras
in the hallway.

10
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,133
I'll look into it.

11
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,093
What else?

12
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,557
Their coffee was ready, but they didn't
pick it up as they were arguing.

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,851
I took it to them to also tell them
to keep it down,

14
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,062
and the man just grabbed
the coffee from me.

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,733
Then did the woman follow him out
right away?

16
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,612
Did she? I'm not sure.

17
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,906
That's all I remember.

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,246
Do you think that person is the killer?

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,414
The person Moo-sung last met on that day?

20
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,918
Is there a stationery store
around here by any chance?

21
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,393
What?

22
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,938
Captain, a child molestation
has been reported.

23
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,024
Let's go.

24
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,531
-Come on. Don't you want to catch him?
-Yes, sir.

25
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,742
Where's Sergeant Kim? Call everyone.

26
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,912
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, make sure to bring everything.

27
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,168
Hey!

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,837
Stop right there!

29
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,637
-Hey!
-You stop right there!

30
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,683
Hey!

31
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,072
After him!

32
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,202
-Stop!
-Hey, run!

33
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,912
-Get him!
-Hey!

34
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,122
-Gosh!
-Stop, you prick!

35
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,253
-Goodness.
-What's going on?

36
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,212
Hey!

37
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,880
Gosh.

38
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,220
You bastard!

39
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,557
You scum!

40
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,475
For goodness' sake.

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,019
Gosh, this jerk.

42
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,438
Hey, add assault too.

43
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,775
-Gosh, this prick.
-Good Lord.

44
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,296
Good grief.

45
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,218
Do you think you're Angelina Jolie
or what?

46
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,516
-What's wrong?
-He reeked of alcohol.

47
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,019
What if he uses it as an excuse
like Doo-soon Cho did

48
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,647
and says he has no recollection of it
or that he had diminished capacity?

49
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,525
Then we'll have to catch him again.
What else can we do?

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,194
He'd better not get released soon.

51
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,030
I'll kill him with my own hands
if he does.

52
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,574
Was the suspension not enough for you?

53
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,534
Do you want a criminal record?

54
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,912
Are you saying it's been lifted?

55
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,289
It's not like I want to.

56
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,376
Then who... Why?

57
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,879
Do you not like it? Shall I make you
get glued to your desk again?

58
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,172
No. Not at all, sir.

59
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,927
Do you know how much shit Chief gave me?

60
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,429
Because of me?

61
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,765
"We corrected what the prosecution
had ruined.

62
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,308
Why do we have to look like an underdog?

63
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,101
What will people think of the police?

64
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,062
We were the ones who revealed the truth."

65
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,190
Goodness. He lost it on me.

66
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,275
Anyway, the conclusion is

67
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,861
that we have to catch the culprit
before that prosecutor does.

68
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,906
We must make sure
the police get all the credit.

69
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,365
He's far below the level.

70
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,284
It must be someone who's higher up.

71
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,539
Why are you zoning out?
I'm talking about important stuff.

72
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,375
Right, my apologies.

73
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,546
The whole country is watching.

74
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,675
So before that prosecutor...
What was his name again?

75
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,178
-You mean Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang?
-Yes, that's right.

76
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,390
You need to get your hands
on whatever he finds out.

77
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,643
Information must be shared mutually.

78
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,563
You keep giving him all the intel,
and he just eats it all up. What is that?

79
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,149
Is that what Chief wants me to do?

80
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,276
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,904
He was talking about everyone. All of us!

82
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,158
He probably doesn't even know
that you exist.

83
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,415
Make him share his information with you
and report it to me directly. Got it?

84
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,504
Then promise me that I can stay

85
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,840
in the criminal department
if I catch the culprit.

86
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,842
You can't replace me, okay?

87
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,261
Well, about that...

88
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,934
Why are you zoning out, sir?
I'm talking about important stuff.

89
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,185
Why though?

90
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,604
Aren't you police academy graduates
in great demand?

91
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,482
With this job, you'll neither get promoted
quickly nor make enough money.

92
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,860
Getting married and raising kids
will become a challenge too.

93
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,319
Why the criminal department?

94
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,321
Gosh, you didn't have to tell me all that.

95
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,658
Soccer players must get a taste for goals,

96
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,660
and detectives must get a taste
for using cuffs.

97
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,329
The traffic or administrative division
is not bad,

98
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,040
but strikers are certainly
the most important ones on the field.

99
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,085
Look at what I did today. I scored a goal.

100
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:47,133
Gosh, a girl got hurt.
What am I even saying now?

101
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,760
-So? Have you gotten a taste?
-Yes!

102
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,220
I mean, no.

103
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,892
I've cuffed a suspect,
but it happened to be Jin-seob Kang.

104
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,480
Captain.

105
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,983
I'll keep enjoying that taste for a long
time and receive pension as well.

106
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,277
-You just watch me.
-All right.

107
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,863
Let's catch the culprit
of the Huam-dong case first.

108
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,947
I'll be sure to do so, sir!

109
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,122
Good work.

110
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,750
I'll continue to do my best.

111
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,252
You're the first person I've seen
who can run faster than me.

112
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,921
-Your lips...
-That must hurt.

113
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,088
No, it doesn't.

114
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,090
-It looks pretty painful.
-No, it's fine.

115
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,639
CHIEF

116
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,269
I made sure

117
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,898
that she'd have to report
what Si-mok Hwang is trying to snoop on.

118
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,901
By the way, are you sure
we can't find any dirt on him?

119
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,863
Since when was a prosecutor being a psycho
not even considered a flaw?

120
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,534
I guess you're with someone.
Let's talk later, then.

121
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,118
All right.

122
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,080
Where were we?

123
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,376
You were going to tell me
something the Inspector General said.

124
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,754
He said

125
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,590
that doing an internal investigation now
might be pointless.

126
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,969
"Two months isn't a long time."
That was the conclusion.

127
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,558
If that's what he thinks,
I'll pass along the message.

128
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,062
It doesn't sound like you agree though.

129
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,651
I guess we'll have to keep our mouths shut
even if everyone acts up like Si-mok did.

130
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,155
Shall I pass it along
to the Inspector General?

131
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,077
Two months isn't a long time.

132
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,623
I heard all of our department managers
get along very well.

133
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,333
I heard you guys meet up often too.

134
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,877
We understand each other well.

135
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,281
-Yes.
-The person from the newsroom is here.

136
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,616
Okay. Send him up.

137
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:21,037
Also, there's a new post on the internet.
Would you like me to print it for you?

138
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,331
I'll find it.

139
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,091
Another Source on Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang

140
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,012
"I'm the one who was attacked
by Si-mok Hwang."

141
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,222
Who is this prick now?

142
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,101
I already told you.
We cannot accept your interview request.

143
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,353
I apologize.

144
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,689
"I had been bullied since I transferred
to the school in seventh grade.

145
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,400
Then one day, Si-mok

146
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,027
beat me up.

147
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,196
On the TV show,
the anonymous informant said

148
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,407
Si-mok broke someone's finger.
That was me.

149
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,913
But surprisingly enough,
the classmates started

150
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,957
targeting Si-mok instead of me
after the incident.

151
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,502
I'm not saying he did it
to help me get out of being bullied..."

152
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,047
Hello?

153
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:14,965
No.

154
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,844
We're even getting calls
from tabloids now.

155
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,596
"I'm not saying he did it on purpose.

156
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,057
However, he was the only one
who didn't participate

157
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,768
when everyone else in the class
bullied and made fun of me.

158
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,190
He may have violent tendencies,

159
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,025
but he was not cruel.

160
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,861
The informant criticized him
and called him a psycho,

161
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,655
but the real psychopaths

162
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,825
were other classmates who took pleasure
in harassing and preying on the weak.

163
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,495
From what I remember,
Si-mok was never one of them."

164
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,207
I knew it. People are gossiping
when they don't even have a clue.

165
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,334
Do you know who this is, Mr. Hwang?

166
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,795
Whoever it is, I'm so thankful...

167
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,131
Mr. Hwang?

168
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,053
Three years ago, the former minister,
Il-jae Young, was accused of accepting

169
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,596
eight hundred million won in bribes.

170
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,223
I apologize, sir.

171
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,061
There is nothing in my house.

172
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,063
I've been set up.

173
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,107
I also...

174
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,905
I will investigate everything thoroughly
and bring the truth to light.

175
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,829
How could you...

176
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,541
How could you do this to me?

177
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,378
I mentored and groomed all of you.

178
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,716
Open your eyes wide
and look through every nook and cranny.

179
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,681
-Gosh, Dad!
-Sir, sir!

180
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,349
Come on. Call an ambulance. Hurry!

181
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,768
Sir. Sir.

182
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,445
At the time of Mr. Park's death,

183
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,947
where was Eun-soo and what was she doing?

184
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,116
How can you be thankful?
It's like a slap in the face.

185
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,577
He should've just kept his mouth shut.

186
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,537
Now, people will call Mr. Hwang
a social outcast.

187
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,916
Who took the call asking to look up
Jin-seob Kang's criminal records?

188
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,459
A call? When?

189
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,503
On the day Moo-sung Park died.

190
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,671
I called you guys from the scene.

191
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,218
Oh, was it Ms. Young?

192
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,095
It couldn't have been her
if it was that day.

193
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,307
I think all three of you were
away from the office that day.

194
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,726
I remember being here alone all day
since lunch.

195
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,354
Are you sure she was gone since lunch?

196
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,022
From what I remember, it was her.

197
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,567
My gosh, speak of the devil.

198
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,946
-Pardon?
-On the day Moo-sung Park died...

199
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:42,905
What is that?

200
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,742
Oh, this is addressed to this office.

201
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,619
Gosh, it must be another gift.

202
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,631
We just had a meeting.
I brought the minutes for you.

203
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,174
Meeting?

204
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,302
We won't have lunch together today.
Mr. Kang has an appointment.

205
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,516
Hey, psycho. Eat this.

206
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,395
-Gosh...
-What is this?

207
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,314
Have you found anything
about the phone call?

208
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,066
What phone call?

209
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,860
From our Public Service Center.

210
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,529
Oh, that. No. What about you?

211
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,489
Me neither.

212
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,076
I guess too much time has passed.
Anyway, I should get back to work.

213
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,475
Ms. Choi, how tall are you?

214
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,727
Me? 170cm.

215
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,479
Gosh, no way. I'm 175cm. You're my height.

216
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,482
That's because I'm wearing high heels.

217
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,320
Oh, you got the memo
about the meeting later today, right?

218
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,654
I'll be back before then.

219
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,825
Come have a look at this.

220
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,412
So many people commented on the post,

221
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,331
saying they got beaten up
by Mr. Hwang in the past.

222
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,791
I WAS BEATEN UP BY HIM TOO.

223
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,919
I'M ROOTING FOR YOU!

224
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,503
What's the truth?

225
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,347
Look who's here.

226
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,325
Just say you're sorry for not
having been able to visit me often.

227
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,160
And

228
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,621
say that you're glad to see me well.

229
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,417
Just make small talk like that first,

230
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
then get to the point.

231
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,170
That's what grown-ups do.

232
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,592
I don't think I visited you often
even when you were in your post.

233
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,139
But you do look better than I expected.

234
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,850
I must look well if this guy says so.

235
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,312
He looks a lot better now, doesn't he?

236
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,399
He quit drinking recently,

237
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,527
and he also started exercising again.

238
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,071
He used to be in such a great shape,
you know.

239
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,741
That's why I always used to look up
whenever I spoke with him.

240
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,327
That can't be. You're taller than me.

241
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,999
You didn't look up at me.
You looked up to me.

242
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,252
Stop it, honey.

243
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,506
Does Ms. Young's boyfriend
visit you often?

244
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,886
Why are you talking about that
all of a sudden?

245
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,431
I just thought he should visit you
because you're not well.

246
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,517
Since when did you care
so much about such decency?

247
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,105
Did Eun-soo tell you
that she has a boyfriend?

248
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,903
Did I say something I shouldn't have?

249
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,739
No, it's not like that.

250
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,534
Well, I wanted to thank you.

251
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,078
In the TV interview,

252
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,081
you said Eun-soo isn't responsible
for what happened and took it on yourself.

253
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,166
That is the truth.

254
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,712
I see. But still...

255
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,009
My husband hasn't told you,

256
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,637
but he was very grateful too.

257
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,766
My family was so worried
because of what happened.

258
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,188
Do you have any idea
of who the culprit might be?

259
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,984
What's your thought on it, sir?

260
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,861
Why are you asking for my opinion?

261
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,488
I'm completely out of the picture.

262
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,533
What are you talking about? Ms. Young

263
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,619
has a direct connection to the suspect.

264
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,622
Eun-soo has

265
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,125
a connection to the suspect?

266
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,586
You know that she presented the case
in the trial.

267
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,926
I apologize if the way I worded it
was inappropriate.

268
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,888
I asked you the question only because
I assumed that you two must have

269
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,808
exchanged opinions on the case
since you're her father.

270
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,853
Well, not really.

271
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,982
The case is a bit unusual.

272
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,485
The victim had close relationships
with the high-ups

273
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,529
in the organization.

274
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,656
With the one who will soon
be appointed Inspector General.

275
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,166
-I'll help you.
-No, thanks.

276
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,173
Was I sitting up for too long?

277
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,679
Please get some rest.

278
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,723
It's all complete nonsense.

279
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,100
What people are saying on TV.

280
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,477
That you're a psycho or whatever.

281
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,898
I picked you.

282
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,276
There's no way I wouldn't have seen it.

283
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,741
Well, wait.

284
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,713
Wait.

285
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,093
Thank you. I know you must be busy.

286
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,056
Please take good care of Eun-soo.

287
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,392
She's done nothing but study.
She's still like a kid.

288
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,811
Ms. Young is doing a good job.

289
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,483
I'm relieved to hear that.
Thank you for speaking highly of her.

290
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,613
My gosh. I thought that might be the case.

291
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,283
When I saw you saying
that it wasn't Eun-soo's fault...

292
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,622
Anyhow, don't take what he said to heart.

293
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,042
He probably reacted like that
because you brought up Hyun-chul.

294
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,962
It must've brought back
some memories for him.

295
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,006
-Hyun-chul?
-My goodness.

296
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,263
Eun-soo's ex-boyfriend.

297
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,472
She said they broke up.

298
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,599
They broke up.

299
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,104
Mr. Young must've been very fond of him.

300
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,357
I'm not sure if I can say that,

301
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,694
but he came over to our place
a few times to fix our computer,

302
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,113
so we were comfortable with him.

303
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,198
Gosh, don't get me wrong.

304
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,244
I'm not saying Eun-soo used to
bring guys over all the time.

305
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,289
It sounds like he was good
at fixing machines.

306
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,374
Did he fix your TV too?

307
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,919
-TV?
-He must be tall as well.

308
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,841
Goodness, being tall is of no use.

309
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,760
Tall guys have it harder
when they're older.

310
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,638
He was a mama's boy.

311
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,310
Even with Eun-soo,
his parents started disapproving

312
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,770
of their relationship
after my husband ended up like that.

313
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,607
That's why they broke up. We're over it.

314
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,569
I must say, I just...

315
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,908
I think someone who works
in the same field will be perfect for her.

316
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:08,994
I see.

317
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,748
Take care.

318
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,501
Please visit us again.

319
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,930
He must be interested in Eun-soo,
don't you think?

320
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,223
Nonsense.

321
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,602
He kept asking me about Hyun-chul.

322
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,188
I bet he couldn't ask such questions
directly to Eun-soo.

323
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,815
It looked like he came here
to get the information from us.

324
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,817
Stop spewing nonsense.

325
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,528
You have no idea what he's like.

326
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,949
Even if he's interested in her,
I can't allow it.

327
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:54,081
You said yourself
that he's not a weird guy.

328
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,084
I like him.

329
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,133
From the get-go, Il-jae Young knew

330
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,843
-Mr. Young is here!
-who pushed him out

331
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,056
and who lured him
with eight hundred million won.

332
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,398
There's no way Mr. Lee's family would've
spent their own money,

333
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,528
so he would've figured out in the end
that it was Mr. Park's cash.

334
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,990
But he's still not reacting.
Why would that be?

335
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:35,205
All of his enemies who utterly disgraced
and mortified him are associated with it.

336
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,499
If he has nothing to do with the case,

337
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,335
there should be no reason for him
to act like he doesn't know anything.

338
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,005
Move aside. Please move out of the way.

339
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,614
He wasn't surprised
when I mentioned Mr. Lee.

340
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,700
He must've heard about it
through Eun-soo already.

341
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,661
But how did she know?

342
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,540
She was preparing for her bar exam
three years ago.

343
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,250
How did she figure out

344
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:24,629
that Mr. Park was the one who provided
money for her father to be overthrown?

345
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,799
Did she and her father
share what they knew?

346
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,885
It that's the case...

347
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,974
-Do you know where they took the patient?
-Did they carry it out together?

348
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,104
Excuse me. Did you see a patient
from that room by any chance?

349
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,524
-She's dead.
-Pardon?

350
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,821
When a man has to give up
marrying the woman he loves,

351
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,323
how deep would his resentment be?

352
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,826
How should I take care of this?
This part and here.

353
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,829
In the documents
for the warrant request...

354
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,424
Yes, Dad.

355
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,054
Who came?

356
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,433
Why?

357
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,188
-Go on.
-So annoying.

358
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,940
Come on. This way, please.

359
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,859
Gosh, seriously.

360
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,750
Name, Min-ah Kwon.

361
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,670
She was at Babylon by Gangnam Station
until three months ago.

362
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,673
Only the one who gives me intel
on her first

363
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,132
can open her bar tonight.

364
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,135
The rest of you will see me
in the holding cell.

365
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,637
Unbelievable.

366
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,891
Look. You can't drag innocent people out
like this and threaten...

367
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,976
Innocent?

368
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,394
You ladies?

369
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,230
What should I start with?

370
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,942
Taxes? Ripping off drunk customers?

371
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,861
If this girl runs away
because you ladies blab your mouth,

372
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,239
every business sign in this alley
will be taken down.

373
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,535
Didn't you hear what I said?

374
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,328
Do you not want to open your bar?

375
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,416
Go!

376
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,170
Why did you try to cut off your right arm?

377
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,383
Only then, a fresh arm
will grow in its place.

378
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,760
You can't do that to me.

379
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,556
Did you think I was a complete moron?

380
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,182
Someone's here for me?

381
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,915
My gosh...

382
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,305
Do you have a boyfriend?

383
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,729
Why do you ask?

384
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,483
Let's say that you had a fiancé.

385
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,153
But somebody made your family go broke,

386
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,571
and the engagement got broken off.

387
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,450
Then how resentful do you think
your ex-fiancé would be

388
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,245
toward that somebody?

389
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,874
I guess you've taken on
a crime-of-passion case.

390
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,584
My family isn't even well-off
to begin with.

391
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,919
Would a murder be possible?

392
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,922
Strictly speaking, that person
didn't directly

393
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,300
inflict any harm on your ex-fiancé.

394
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,262
That person did him

395
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,348
a great deal of harm, in my opinion.

396
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,394
He should've stayed by her side
even if her family went broke.

397
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,272
But he couldn't.

398
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,691
No matter what the excuse is,

399
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,569
the conclusion is that he abandoned
his girlfriend who lost everything.

400
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,030
That's worse than just making them
break up.

401
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:05,535
He'd think everyone has found out
how shallow he is because of that jerk.

402
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,495
Then,

403
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,998
if he's not shallow,

404
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,500
that person has to be
the worst bastard in the world.

405
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,254
"He's a complete bastard.
We should get rid of him together."

406
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,422
Would he say that?

407
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,968
But if he really loves her,

408
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,471
do you think he'd drag her
into something like that?

409
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,015
If I were in that situation,
even though it'll never actually happen,

410
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,309
I'd act on my own.

411
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,312
So in conclusion,

412
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:37,358
love can make you kill someone,
for the one you love.

413
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,986
Why are you asking me?

414
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,322
Do you think you can do
something like that

415
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,407
for the woman you love?

416
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,621
I'm sure you've been in love.

417
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,873
Think about the women you've been with.

418
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,919
Your first love.

419
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,254
You have, right?

420
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,390
What about the Public Service Center?
Have you found who made the call?

421
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,560
-I'm not sure yet.
-It's someone from here, isn't it?

422
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,438
An outsider wouldn't get in here
just to make a call.

423
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,567
And it has to be someone who can
freely look up criminal records.

424
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,820
Isn't the suspect

425
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,155
someone at Western Seoul
Prosecutors' Office?

426
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,701
We can't assume that person is a suspect
just because of the phone call.

427
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,043
Have you ever had your TV broken?

428
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,172
No, I rarely turn my TV on.

429
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,425
I had to call a technician a few days ago
because my TV stopped working.

430
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,429
I observed him and found out
that it's actually very simple.

431
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,516
There's a thing called "reception card"
in old set-top boxes.

432
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,727
All he had to do
was take it out and put it back in.

433
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,772
It must've been the case at the scene too.

434
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,026
I was actually
just at Moo-sung Park's house.

435
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,824
His mother told me
that she watched a morning drama

436
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,326
right before she left the house
on the day of the incident.

437
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,249
I couldn't find any fingerprint on it.

438
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,126
Isn't it even weirder?

439
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,879
There must be someone
who made it and assembled the TV.

440
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,547
How can there be
no fingerprint whatsoever?

441
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,509
Someone must've messed around
with the card and erased all fingerprints.

442
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,637
Mr. Park couldn't sleep well at night.

443
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,723
He used to sleep in until afternoon
instead,

444
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,600
so it would've been easier
to aim for those hours.

445
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:38,354
He must've waited knowing
that Moo-sung Park was sleeping.

446
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,403
There's only one place he could've hid.

447
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,448
He must've kept waiting in there
patiently, then...

448
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,325
I'm the one who called about a broken TV.

449
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,328
Oh, you're nearby? Sure, see you soon.

450
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,581
He must've gotten out of there
around the time Jin-seob Kang arrived.

451
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,302
I don't get it.

452
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,554
There's nothing.

453
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,265
After the case closed,

454
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,602
people from the cleanup company
cleaned the scene except for this room.

455
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,564
He had to have left something
unless he's a ghost.

456
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,359
Don't you know he even calculated
the angle from the dashboard camera?

457
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,069
Exactly.

458
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,029
I really can't understand it.

459
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,823
There are so many weird things
about this case.

460
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,618
Do you know
what I'm struggling with the most?

461
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,454
The motive.

462
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,665
Getting rid of Moo-sung Park?

463
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,626
No one was home anyway.
He could've just killed him right away.

464
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,420
Why did he hide inside the closet
for such a long time?

465
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,006
He could've just stabbed him and run away.

466
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,427
And why did he mess with the TV
and drag Jin-seob Kang into it?

467
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,806
Because he needed someone
to dump everything on?

468
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,642
Framing a food delivery guy for it
would've been easier.

469
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,727
He must've needed an ex-convict.

470
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,813
Someone whom everyone will
believe to be the killer.

471
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,190
Just running the DNA found
on the scene through the system

472
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,900
will be enough to confirm him
as a suspect.

473
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,360
Exactly.

474
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,280
The culprit researched everything
in advance.

475
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,866
In order to find an ex-convict
around the victim,

476
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,576
an extensive research must've been done.

477
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,036
Do you think that's possible?

478
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,040
It has to be someone who has the authority
to look up criminal records freely.

479
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,545
Someone here or in the police.

480
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,677
But don't you think it's too persistent
even if the person could do it?

481
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,014
Why would anyone do all this if the goal
was just to get rid of Moo-sung Park?

482
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:40,059
I even thought about this scenario.

483
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,478
What if someone

484
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,773
was targeting Jin-seob Kang too?

485
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,234
Did he have to get rid of both of them?

486
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,862
-That's...
-The chances are very slim though.

487
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,780
He had to get rid of two people,

488
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,243
a man and a part-time TV technician
in the same neighborhood.

489
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,453
That's...

490
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,874
And how would he have known Jin-seob
would take his own life in jail?

491
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,794
He had made a suicide attempt

492
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,380
even while serving his previous sentence.

493
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,426
To be honest, his suicide is
what started everything

494
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,721
because he sent that letter of appeal
everywhere.

495
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,265
The culprit must be deeply regretting
what he did.

496
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:23,603
It turned into huge news because
he dragged the ex-convict into the game.

497
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,939
He might be happy about what went down.

498
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,193
-What?
-The bloodstain.

499
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,155
The bloodstain from the house next-door
is what started everything.

500
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,201
But why would he be happy
about what happened?

501
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,871
What if it wasn't a mistake?

502
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,125
You mean making people become convinced

503
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,837
that there's a real culprit? If he left
the evidence there on purpose...

504
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,635
-Why though?
-Both Moo-sung Park and Jin-seob Kang

505
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,679
might have been mere consumables to him.

506
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,099
Do you think that's why he killed them?

507
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,101
What's he trying to make?

508
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,488
Sorry to interrupt. They want all of us
to gather in the assembly hall now.

509
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,041
They say that women's vengeance
knows no bounds.

510
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,001
What? Me?

511
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,753
What are you talking about?

512
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,298
Is it a woman?
The one from the Public Service Center.

513
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,807
That must be why you brought up
the thing about a boyfriend.

514
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,047
They say that women's vengeance
knows no bounds.

515
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,341
Is it a woman?
The one from the Public Service Center.

516
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,552
Is that why he went to see Dad
at the hospital?

517
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,429
Because he's suspicious of me?

518
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,615
Dear colleagues and juniors

519
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,827
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

520
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,579
The last few days,

521
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,665
we went through an unprecedented ordeal.

522
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,461
We were criticized for being
incompetent and untrustworthy

523
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,380
while being branded
as an organization that is

524
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,592
selfishly preoccupied
with its own survival.

525
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,054
The worst of it all was
facing the mortification

526
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,808
from having our morality
and qualifications

527
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,228
as executors of the law being questioned

528
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,314
due to a loose cannon.

529
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,570
However, my dear colleagues
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office,

530
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,615
I can say this with all confidence
in front of anyone.

531
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,493
We have always

532
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,413
strictly followed the law,
and we have been working

533
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,666
extremely hard to ensure fair

534
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,585
and equal execution
of the law and justice.

535
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,754
I can say it

536
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:41,259
unabashedly and proudly
in front of all of you.

537
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,596
-My honorable comrades.
-Did you find her?

538
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,390
Please raise your heads up.

539
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,684
We have no reason to be ashamed!

540
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,936
Every single one of you here

541
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,355
is one of the smartest people
in the country

542
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,274
and has a sparkling clean conscience.

543
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,110
You said I should push
Mr. Seo out instead.

544
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,529
Unless Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office
gets emptied out,

545
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,656
I'll always have a right arm.

546
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,624
We're comrades. We're in this together.

547
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,253
INVESTIGATION REPORT ON PROSTITUTION

548
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,212
Hey!

549
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,174
What were you looking for in my office?

550
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,385
Why were you going through my stuff?

551
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,847
We'll make sure to find out why
it happened and who's responsible,

552
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,308
but criticizing one of us
just because others are doing so

553
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:35,187
should not take place
and will not be tolerated.

554
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,440
On behalf of all of you,

555
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,860
I solemnly swear before the country
and the people.

556
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,989
As a representative of public interest,

557
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,742
I will fight for justice and human rights.

558
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:53,164
-As a prosecutor who vanquishes darkness,
-As a prosecutor who vanquishes darkness,

559
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,916

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,501

-As a prosecutor who's stricter on himself
-As a prosecutor...

566
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,224
-From beginning to end, I will do my best

568
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,153
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

569
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,129
What did he find?

570
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,173
How did he figure it out?

571
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,587
JOY CLUB, BAEKSONG MASSAGE
AJ CLUB

572
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,947
S ROOM CLUB

573
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,951
-Is this your first time here?
-Not at all.

574
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,745
Min-ah is here, right?

575
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,623
My gosh.

576
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,168
I'd never forget such a handsome face.

577
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,170
By the way, Min-ah isn't here yet.

578
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,088
There's a new girl hotter than her.

579
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,131
Min-ah first.

580
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,592
I guess you're her boyfriend.

581
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,177
I'll tell her to hurry.

582
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,849
Call her here.

583
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,436
I didn't bring my phone.

584
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,399
Only 50,000-won bills can fit in here.

585
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,403
I'll bring you a few things on the house.

586
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,592
Where are you?

587
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,427
Are you almost here?

588
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,595
A regular?

589
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,432
How can I have a regular customer already?

590
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,770
What does he look like?

591
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,314
Where do you think he's from?

592
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,958
Did you do something bad?

593
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,336
If the business is affected, I... Gosh.

594
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,963
What are you doing?

595
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,047
Give it back!

596
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,351
Hey!

597
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,686
Hey!

598
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,895
Taxi, taxi!

599
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,315
Hey!

600
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,071
Mr. Seo!

601
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,492
Sir, please drive fast.

602
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,045
Hey! Move your car!

603
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,172
Damn it!

604
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,842
Today is her third day here.

605
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,261
I really don't know where she lives.

606
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,138
Then this place should be shut down.

607
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,601
Don't you girls know Min-ah's address?

608
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,020
Tell him right now.

609
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,525
I guess you girls are dying to see
this place going out of business.

610
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,652
Aren't you?

611
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:21,867
Why would I lie to you for Min-ah?

612
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,455
I don't know what I can do to make you
believe me. This is driving me nuts.

613
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,791
Why is it getting cold again? Jeez.

614
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,959
My gosh, where are you going?

615
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,337
Don't leave. Let's go back in together.

616
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,924
-Which taxi company do you use here?
-Pardon me?

617
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,218
Please call a taxi for me.

618
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,429
You want to get out of here with me?

619
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,771
You're going home already?
Are you feeling sick?

620
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,106
-No. It's...
-Thank you.

621
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,110
Thank you.

622
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,695
Gosh. You must've been drinking
since early evening.

623
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,948
-Where to, sir?
-Where is Min-ah's place?

624
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,410
-Who is Min-ah?
-You must pick her up a few times a day

625
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,621
and drop her off at a hair salon,
at work, then back at her place.

626
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,289
Let's not waste time, please.

627
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,752
Are you a cop?

628
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,423
You know it's illegal to do this
without a taxi license, right?

629
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,341
Give me Min-ah's address and phone number.

630
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,600
Hey, get off.

631
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,186
You're not a cop. Get off.

632
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,356
Get off, you prick. Get out of my car.
Goodness.

633
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,068
What do you want? Do you like her?

634
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,612
Why do you need her address?
Do you want to go there and fuck her?

635
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:45,200
If you like a bar girl, pay her
to spend time with her, you prick.

636
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,620
You're just a pervert who's chasing her
around. How dare you threaten me?

637
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,081
Yes, I'm doing this illegally.
What will you do?

638
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,586
Her address and number.

639
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,800
Her address and number.

640
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,282
MIN-AH KWON

641
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,838
A school uniform.

642
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,424
Is she still in high school?

643
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:23,019
Was this the dirt Mr. Park had on Mr. Lee?

644
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,905
MIN-AH KWON

645
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,952
MIN-AH KWON

646
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,452
The phone is switched off.
You will reach the voicemail.

647
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,513
"Prosecutors' Pledge to Find Truth."

648
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,936
Prosecutor Chang-jun Lee is different
than any other ones.

649
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,312
WOO-GYUN KIM

650
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,276
Hey.

651
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,654
A woman?

652
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,198
I'm surprised too. You had no idea?

653
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,409
Are you sure? Did Hwang...

654
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,328
Did he say that himself?

655
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,498
I think he found out that the last person
Mr. Park met was a woman.

656
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,917
Does anyone specific come to mind?

657
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,545
-Let's talk in person.
-All right. I'll get there shortly.

658
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,504
Me too.

659
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,843
Why...

660
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,404
Congratulations.

661
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,074
People are saying you're
an understanding and charismatic leader.

662
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,659
There's a ton of comments praising you.

663
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,620
I did it to incite such a reaction.

664
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,707
Then everything is good now.
Why do you look so troubled?

665
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,710
Do you think that woman Mr. Park met
before he died

666
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,880
could be her?

667
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,092
How would she have known?

668
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,138
Even just three years ago, she was
a novice who didn't know anything.

669
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,725
Her father probably told her.

670
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,731
Let me ask you one thing.

671
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,655
The eight hundred million won.
What really happened to it?

672
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,866
Was there actually a mishap
with the delivery itself?

673
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,534
Or is Mr. Young playing innocent?

674
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,958
You don't have to answer.

675
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,004
It is true that Mr. Young figured out

676
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,757
that it's cash and returned the whole box.

677
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,550
But the problem is

678
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,846
that someone took it that afternoon.

679
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,808
Well, everyone knows what happened
up to that point.

680
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:33,186
I'm asking who took the money.

681
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,191
Who would know if you don't?

682
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:42,112
An average person can't eat up
that kind of money.

683
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,363
Don't try to find out.

684
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,492
Do you really not know,
or are you just pretending?

685
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:57,877
If Mr. Young's claim that he's never
accepted any money is true,

686
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,672
then he was accused of being
a morally rotten criminal

687
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,259
who shamelessly tried to play innocent.

688
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,306
Does he have another child?

689
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,727
I don't think so. As far as I know,
Eun-soo is his only child.

690
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,186
That's strange.

691
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,649
If my dad was branded as a minister
who accepted that kind of bribe

692
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,652
and was utterly insulted
and stomped in public,

693
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,654
I'd never be able to forgive
those related.

694
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,531
I'd certainly attack them with a knife.

695
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,951
However, that wasn't done by a woman.

696
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,371
There's no way that person
in the dash camera footage is a woman.

697
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,713
Chang-jun. If they actually
got an accomplice

698
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,758
and stabbed him to death
because they wanted to get their revenge,

699
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,469
is there a guarantee
that they'll leave you alone?

700
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:51,431
Shouldn't you arrest them or do something
as soon as possible?

701
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,099
-No, I can't.
-What?

702
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,019
Even if that's true...

703
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,897
All the more so, if it's true.

704
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,775
We cannot arrest them.

705
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,652
He absolutely must not be caught alive.
If he's captured alive,

706
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,907
he'll give away names of everyone
who had any connection with Mr. Park.

707
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,165
Where did they find the accomplice?

708
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,335
Does he have a secret son?

709
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,057
Make him look like the culprit
and leak evidence.

710
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,184
Then make sure Si-mok can smell it.

711
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,813
Feeling completely cornered,
the culprit will end up jumping to death.

712
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,272
It'll put an end to everything.

713
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,282
Do you live around here?

714
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:33,700
Yes.

715
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,495
It must be nice to live close to work.

716
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,706
I don't drink.

717
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,749
What?

718
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,294
Just keep it there, then.

719
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,297
Do you live around here too?

720
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,632
Me?

721
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,136
I had to stop by
Mapo Police Station earlier.

722
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,765
Hey, just have one glass with me.

723
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,017
Sorry, I don't want to drink.

724
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,647
Don't look down on me.

725
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,401
I'm the only one who took your side.

726
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,196
I'm sure you know.

727
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,364
Yes, thanks.

728
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,995
You're still so arrogant and obnoxious.

729
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,165
You haven't changed one bit.

730
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,045
I knew it. You ignored my call
when we met again after 20 years.

731
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,299
How can I intentionally ignore a number
that I don't know?

732
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,010
What?

733
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,805
Did I not give you my number?

734
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,821
Why did you do that to me back then?

735
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,575
-Why did you do that to my hand...
-Because you were loud.

736
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,995
Because I was loud?

737
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,999
You were being too loud.

738
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,589
Hey, what makes you think
that you can be such a stuck-up?

739
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:15,218
Do you think you're so superior
that you can look down on others?

740
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,844
You're a prosecutor, but so what?

741
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,431
You'll grow old all alone.

742
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,810
Gosh, my bad. I was being loud again.

743
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,687
You can't stand loud people.

744
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,355
It's not loud.

745
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,525
You're not being loud.

746
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,027
It's all gone now.

747
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,113
Along with other things.

748
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,240
What other things?

749
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,369
What you said is right.

750
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,664
I'll be all alone

751
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,332
forever.

752
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,672
Hey, wait.

753
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,098
Why are you out here?

754
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,395
What's up? You're making me nervous.

755
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,815
You were so amazing today.

756
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,943
I saw you on TV and almost couldn't
recognize you.

757
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,695
Goodness.

758
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,074
I bet today was another long day.

759
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,285
I'm glad you're home now.

760
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,229
Get some sleep.

761
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,906
Have you tried this facial mask?

762
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,783
It's so easy. It looks like this.

763
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,536
-I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.
-Come on. Don't be shy.

764
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,829
Gosh. Oh, no!

765
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,623
I'm so sorry. You should've just...
This is...

766
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,959
Just find the parts
for eyes, nose and lips.

767
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,336
Like this. How pretty!

768
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,006
Look at you. You're already looking
more beautiful.

769
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,466
Your skin looks brighter already.

770
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:02,802
Please relax.

771
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,431
Gosh, this will be expired soon.

772
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,839
Min-ah Kwon

773
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,968
-Where did he go?
-He stepped out.

774
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,388
-See you later.
-See you.

775
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,932
Hey...

776
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,521
Please keep it in mind.

777
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,501
We keep running into each other.

778
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,836
It looks like you have a trial
this morning.

779
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:20,963
About yesterday...

780
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,133
I don't remember anything. Did I...

781
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,428
How do you know Jin-seob Kang?
I mean, you defended him.

782
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,639
Why do you think that I knew him?

783
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:33,684
His attorney lost the trial,
and you were apologetic.

784
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,770
How did you even notice that?

785
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,689
Someone at my church
put him in touch with me.

786
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,526
We weren't going to make any money
from it, but I pushed for it.

787
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,569
I told everyone that I'm certain
we can win.

788
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,739
Why were you so certain?

789
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,199
Why?

790
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,660
Because I trusted him.

791
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,871
He was with his baby when we met up.

792
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,457
He was holding the baby
in his arms like this

793
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:01,504
and kept saying he didn't do it.
He said he could swear on his baby's name.

794
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,005
He was obviously telling the truth.

795
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,676
What kind of father would lie
after swearing on his son's name?

796
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,803
I trusted him.

797
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,017
Why? What is it?

798
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,937
All right.

799
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,439
I'm really sorry about last night.

800
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,319
It's not like you're going to work
as a janitor or a security guard here.

801
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,154
This place is filled with civil servants.

802
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,825
Wouldn't it be better for you to visit
law firms if you need to find a job?

803
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,036
Is it that obvious?

804
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,789
No, except for the fact that
you don't have business cards.

805
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,044
Small firms aren't doing well these days.
It just happened.

806
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,507
If you ever need help
with your investigations

807
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,758
or an extra hand with anything...

808
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,387
Save my number.

809
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,399
You must be busy.
Let's talk some other time, then.

810
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:04,775
All right. See you.

811
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,753
-Mr. Seo.
-How dare you barge in like that?

812
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,339
My apologies. The suspect is...

813
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,091
-Get out.
-Okay. I'm going now.

814
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,515
ID CARD
MIN-AH KWON

815
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,269
ID CARD
MIN-AH KWON

816
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,336
You guys suck.
I think I can dance better than you guys.

817
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,088
What's wrong with this? I think it's cool.

818
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,465
It's hilarious.

819
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,884
-Hey, I need to use the bathroom.
-Hurry.

820
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,344
Come back quickly.

821
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,597
-Do you want me to come with you?
-No, it's okay.

822
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,236
-Hey, are you okay?
-Are you all right?

823
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,570
What's going on?

824
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,155
What happened?

825
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,866
-Is she dead?
-Hey, what should we do?

826
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,743
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

827
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,714
JUNG-BON KIM

828
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,029
Lieutenant Han.

829
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,074
Wake up, Lieutenant Han. Lieutenant Han!

830
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,707
Lieutenant Han. Lieutenant Han!

831
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,712
Lieutenant Han. Wake up, Lieutenant Han!

832
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,904
STRANGER

833
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,030
Why come this far?

834
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,616
The night you went after her
all of a sudden.

835
01:07:58,699 --> 01:07:59,617
Si-mok Hwang

836
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,078
must've followed her to her house.
It must be thorough this time.

837
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,329
Of course.

838
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,789
Who's at the hospital?

839
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,917
Tons of reporters are around here.
The culprit will notice it soon.

840
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,753
-We need backup.
-He came on the stage himself.

841
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,380
Isn't it strange? Moo-sung Park died
under Si-mok's watch.

842
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,424
-This time too.
-Who is it?

843
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,760
-Who's this lunatic?
-Are you the one with the knife?

844
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:19,720
Are you the one who stabbed her?

845
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:20,971
Are they after me from the start?

846
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,057
Or am I the one who led them?

847
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,270
