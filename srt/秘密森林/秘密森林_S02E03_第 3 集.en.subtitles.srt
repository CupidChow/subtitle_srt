1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,212
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,844
"Cleared of suspicion. Not guilty."

4
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,806
This case has reignited the debate
over reform

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,392
of the police and prosecution's
investigative authority.

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,478
Removal of the restriction line
did not cause the accident.

7
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,938
The lawyer who got special treatment at
the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office,

8
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,981
what was his name?

9
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,566
It's Oh Ju-seon.

10
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,151
But now, a former judge is involved

11
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,652
for someone who just cut a rope.

12
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,197
A Police-Prosecution Council
will be formed soon.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,908
We need someone who will protect
our authority at all costs.

14
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,869
And it should be an officer who works
in the field, not at headquarters.

15
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,870
You want me to do that?

16
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,499
In 2017, a police sergeant
committed suicide in Dongducheon.

17
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,126
Do you know anything about
the Segok Police Station?

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,503
"Segok"?

19
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,380
If you want Si-mok and me
to work on this together…

20
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,341
I mean, I'll do fine alone.

21
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,594
You brought it to our office,
so we should take care of it.

22
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,518
EPISODE 3

23
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,237
All right, I'm here.

24
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,656
-You can bring out the food now.
-Sure.

25
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,827
Were you giving him a hard time?

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,245
We were having a good time.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,666
You look like you've spent your whole life
reading in your room.

28
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,335
Do you feel as if
you're looking in the mirror?

29
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,254
-Assistant Chief Kim Sa-hyun.
-I'm Hwang Si-mok.

30
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,924
He's two years my junior,
but we joined the prosecution together.

31
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,342
Yes, I'm aware.

32
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,771
This is fresh omasum
with sesame seed oil drizzled on top.

33
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,898
You can have it raw. It's on the house.

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,734
They specialize in horumon,
dishes made from innards.

35
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,529
Mr. Hwang,
you're lucky to have such an amazing boss.

36
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,532
Thanks to him, you can enjoy
these incredibly fresh delicacies.

37
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,449
Right.

38
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,794
We're cooking this well-done
because you've never had it before.

39
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,712
Thank you, sir.

40
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,922
Do you usually eat well?

41
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm sure he does.
What is he going to do, starve to death?

42
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,719
You look so shy.

43
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,847
Can you eat alone at a restaurant?

44
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,181
Why the hell not?

45
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,349
Don't you worry.

46
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,269
Also, do you really think he's shy?

47
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,228
Give me a break.

48
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,330
I'm okay, sir.

49
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,881
All right, here's to our success.

50
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,382
Cheers!

51
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,438
-Try it when it's slightly cooked.
-Yes, sir.

52
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,487
Goodness, he really has no idea
how to eat this.

53
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,908
Add a bit of wasabi in the ponzu sauce
and dip the meat in it.

54
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,036
Add a little more wasabi.

55
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,596
All right.

56
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,516
Chief Woo's eldest kid
got into an international middle school.

57
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:27,850
Right.

58
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,727
And his daughter is
a classical ballet prodigy.

59
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,105
Prodigy, my ass.
She's costing me a fortune.

60
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,691
It's costing you because she has talent.

61
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,944
I have no idea what my daughter will be
when she grows up.

62
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,364
Don't you want to get married?

63
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,782
Don't. Why go down that path?

64
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,118
I wish you had given me that advice.

65
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,786
Why didn't you talk me out of it?

66
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,954
Why did you give up on me?

67
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,581
Hey, I've given up on myself.
Who am I to dissuade anyone?

68
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,670
Do you have alcohol intolerance?

69
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,048
-No, sir.
-Then what? Can you drink?

70
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,216
Well…

71
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,255
Hello!

72
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,548
Hello.

73
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,467
Isn't she Han Yeo-jin?

74
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,056
-Hello.
-Hello, it's good to see you.

75
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,725
-Hello.
-Hello.

76
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,269
Hey, what's up?

77
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,564
My goodness.

78
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,316
Gosh, you didn't have to.

79
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,985
You're not a guest.
You didn't have to bring anything.

80
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,696
Let's see.

81
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,866
-Hold on. What about rice?
-I got fried rice.

82
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,993
You sure know the drill.

83
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,244
-Detective Jang.
-Yes?

84
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,829
Spare me a moment.

85
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,247
-But the food…
-Come on.

86
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,167
-We should eat the fried rice right away.
-I'll be quick.

87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,293
What's going on?

88
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,298
-Me?
-Yes!

89
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,592
Come on.

90
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,385
I won't.

91
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,514
The Police-Prosecution Council? Forget it.

92
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,099
Come on, just do it.

93
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,309
Take the captain.
He'd be perfect for the job.

94
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,728
No, he doesn't qualify because of his age.

95
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,938
There's an age limit?

96
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,483
"The movement to redistribute
the investigative authority

97
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,028
is led by Police University graduates who
wish to take over the entire police force.

98
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,489
In the past, the police weren't able
to effectively reason

99
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,158
with prosecutors
who are legal specialists.

100
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,661
But the elite officers
who graduated from the Police University

101
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,455
have reignited the conflict
between the prosecution and police.

102
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,083
The Police University graduates
are the ones pulling the strings!"

103
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,293
We weren't able to reason with them?

104
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,337
That's what
all the prosecutors are saying.

105
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,630
So they're saying this happened

106
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,174
because the Police University graduates
are pulling our strings?

107
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,593
Damn it. Look who's talking!

108
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,429
The prosecution is ruled by
graduates from specific colleges.

109
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,098
That's what I'm saying!

110
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,809
You should show them that
you're not under control.

111
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,104
You can join the council even if
you're not a Police University graduate.

112
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,315
The only thing is that
low-ranking officers can't join.

113
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,485
Think about it. If it's a patrol officer
or a senior patrol officer,

114
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,989
-the prosecution will outrank us.
-But what has age got to do with it?

115
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,075
This is just between you and me.

116
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,912
I don't think the chief wants someone
who's older than her.

117
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,664
Will it make her uneasy?

118
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,417
To have a subordinate
who's older than her?

119
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,837
She's saying it has to be someone
who's at least a lieutenant,

120
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,089
but not a Police University graduate.

121
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,633
Just think. A lieutenant
who's not a Police University graduate?

122
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,803
Then we're talking well over 40.
I can't find anyone in their 30s.

123
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,014
This reminds me of someone.

124
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,640
Who?

125
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,018
You and the captain.

126
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
He's older than you, but…

127
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,356
I mean, he's way older than you.

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,025
But you outrank him,

129
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,443
so you've beaten him.

130
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,778
Cut it out.

131
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,530
Jeez, I'm not doing this!

132
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,824
Come on!
Are you really going to be like this?

133
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,953
Do you know who popped into my head
when I was talking to Chief Choi?

134
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,539
The man who is a detective
with the title of lieutenant.

135
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,000
He's only in his 30s
and he's good at his job.

136
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,794
Had I not known you,
I couldn't have thought of this.

137
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,255
-Right?
-Jeez.

138
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,467
Come on. I'm not that good.

139
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,639
But you know,
it's not something I can decide on my own.

140
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,015
I need the captain's permission.

141
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,975
He'll let you do it, of course.

142
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,770
-Him?
-Yes, sir.

143
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,273
-Where are you taking him?
-The Police-Prosecution Council.

144
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,441
But why?

145
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
As a representative of
the investigative officers. How about it?

146
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,906
No, you can't.

147
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,824
Why not?

148
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,327
Hey, we're already short-staffed.

149
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,912
We lost you already, and him too?

150
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,789
Look at us. What are we going to do?

151
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,999
But Detective Jang isn't leaving us
for good.

152
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,918
-He'll only attend their meetings, right?
-Yes!

153
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,046
We can hire someone if he's gone for good.

154
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,465
It'll be like having a ghost on the team.

155
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,344
Also, they'll take him
whenever they need him.

156
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,973
But it'd be good to have a field officer
occupying a seat in the council.

157
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,016
Those who do fieldwork

158
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,270
may be able to present different views
to those who sit at their desks all day.

159
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,563
Whose side are you on?

160
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,773
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,485
Take this one. He's friendly,
and he's got a lot of energy.

162
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,028
He'll be much better than Geon.

163
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,863
Take him.

164
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,116
Sun-chang, how many years has it been
for you?

165
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,742
Me? I joined the force three years ago.

166
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,160
You punk.

167
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,037
Gosh, you still have a long way to go.

168
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,747
Forget it, then!

169
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,167
The suspect will be
at the agency in Bogwang-dong.

170
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,211
At ten o'clock, but it may change.

171
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,879
-Okay, we're on it!
-What's going on?

172
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,090
What? Are you investigating
a real estate fraud?

173
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,216
With the Intelligence Unit?

174
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,927
It started out as an assault case,
but he's got a new specialty now.

175
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,970
-What?
-Rental scam.

176
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,733
What? Are you coming too?

177
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,610
Pardon?

178
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,325
-Detective Jang!
-Okay.

179
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,604
I'll see you again.

180
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,741
Gain as much experience as possible.
It'll become a valuable asset.

181
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,993
-Pardon?
-It'll be helpful for you,

182
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,330
and also for the entire police force.
It's a rare opportunity.

183
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,166
Don't you think
real changes will be made this time?

184
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,002
The public supports us,
and the higher-ups are pushing for it.

185
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,756
If you join the council and make them
hand over the authority to us,

186
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,217
the three syllables of your name…

187
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,844
I mean, the two syllables of your name
will go down in history.

188
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,013
It will look great on your resume too.

189
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,849
I'll work extra hard to fill in for you.

190
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,851
So don't worry and just join the council.

191
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,813
You're the second one
they're taking from us,

192
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,439
so they'd better let us hire someone.

193
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,608
Gosh, I told you
that I'm not leaving the team.

194
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,527
Why are you trying to send me away?

195
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,696
Hey, do you think Yeo-jin came to us
because she couldn't find anyone else?

196
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,949
She doesn't have it as easy as you think.

197
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,201
Think about how lonely she must've been.

198
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,663
She probably needed someone
she could open up to.

199
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,456
Darn it.

200
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,792
I'd go if I were ten years younger.

201
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,004
-I guess you've lost your vigor.
-No, it's not about that.

202
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,548
I didn't go to the Police University.

203
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,716
I should've at least
built connections like that.

204
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,635
I'm deeply regretting it now, okay?

205
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,057
-Hey, Jang Geon.
-Yes, sir.

206
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,185
I'm sure you want more than just having
your own team and staying a lieutenant.

207
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,521
Just make sure

208
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,898
you bring Yeo-jin with you
when you're done.

209
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,985
That's all I ask for.

210
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,529
Luck is obviously not on my side.

211
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,615
Had I served as an expert member,
I would've been able to transfer

212
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,409
to the Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

213
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,911
It would've been amazing.

214
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:31,083
Why get rid of it when it was my turn
to be sent to the National Assembly?

215
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,294
Everyone got promoted.
Why rob me of the opportunity?

216
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,630
Who knows? They might give you
special treatment to make up for it.

217
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,716
Just do a good job with this.

218
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,677
I always do a good job.
Did I ever do a bad job?

219
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,471
This time, you must do especially well.

220
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,598
Our lives are on the line.

221
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,187
Hey, give me a list of every assemblyman
who used to be a prosecutor.

222
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,938
-Former judges too.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,821
-Oh, boy.
-Let's also find out how many assemblymen

224
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,198
used to be in the police force.

225
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,369
The police came up with another proposal
on police autonomy.

226
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,704
-Let's get that too.
-Yes, sir.

227
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,789
Get a separate report on Jeju.

228
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,708
Compare it with the older ones
for the meeting…

229
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,085
Right,
you have to be there tomorrow morning.

230
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,546
-Where?
-You don't need to know.

231
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,840
We don't have time.
Get on it as soon as you're back.

232
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,568
He doesn't even smoke?

233
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,072
Hey.

234
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,366
Do you have a lighter?

235
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,078
Darn it. Would they have one
at the cash register?

236
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,705
What's the matter?
Are you worried about something?

237
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,123
What?

238
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,670
Joining us for a smoke?

239
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,547
No. I'll get going, sir.

240
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,507
Go where?

241
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,468
I've never seen anyone leave
before their seniors do.

242
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,386
Oh, I see.

243
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,596
I'll see you tomorrow, sir.

244
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,892
Hey!

245
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,443
2019 PROPOSAL
FOR AUTONOMOUS POLICE SYSTEM

246
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,155
PROSECUTOR HWANG SI-MOK

247
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,575
FORMER PROSECUTORS AND JUDICIAL OFFICIALS
IN THE 20TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

248
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,150
CASE REPORT

249
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,110
SUICIDE OF A SERGEANT
AT SEGOK POLICE STATION

250
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,786
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

251
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,722
Hello.

252
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,519
-What's up?
-Nothing's up. All is good.

253
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,994
-Take it easy.
-Bye.

254
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,518
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

255
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,103
-Hello.
-Hi.

256
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,563
-We're back!
-Good morning!

257
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,356
-Good work.
-Thank you.

258
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,442
-Do you want to have breakfast?
-Good work.

259
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,862
I can't. I have to rush home
to get my kids ready for school.

260
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,697
Have breakfast with Captain
before you leave.

261
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,656
-Yes, sir.
-Will do.

262
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,491
-Oh, boy.
-The summer of 2017.

263
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,201
-I'm exhausted.
-The nighttime patrol team

264
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,038
at Segok Police Station in Dongducheon
consisted of seven officers.

265
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,290
Hey, Captain Baek.

266
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,170
All right, guys. You can sit back down.

267
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,882
This is Sergeant Song Gi-hyeon.
He'll be joining your team.

268
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,259
-I hope you guys get along.
-Two of them have been convicted

269
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,303
-Sit here.
-of accepting bribes from businesses.

270
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,057
Two officers resigned,
and one officer was transferred.

271
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,350
-Where did you work previously?
-Dongducheon, sir.

272
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,937
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

273
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,940
All right, guys. Keep up the good work.

274
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,110
-Have a good day.
-Only one of them managed

275
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,404
to keep his position
after they got caught.

276
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,866
And there's the officer who died.

277
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,123
He was found dead
in a shower booth at the police station.

278
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,834
Sergeant Song Gi-hyeon.

279
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,046
Let's say a police officer
murdered his colleague.

280
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,547
If that were true,

281
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,801
it'll be the best thing
that could happen to us in this situation,

282
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,344
and the worst-case scenario for them.

283
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,722
Fill him in on the rest.

284
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,392
-Sir, I'm--
-I'm expecting someone else.

285
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,771
We have to wrap this up before
he gets here so that you can go home

286
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,648
and we can have our team dinner.

287
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,157
Chief Woo gave you the papers.
Take a look.

288
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,871
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

289
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,706
Six officers in a nighttime patrol unit

290
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,917
accepted bribes from
the bars and clubs in the area.

291
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,211
They had quite a lucrative gig for years.

292
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,840
But one day, someone new joined the team.

293
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,845
-This man?
-Yes, Sergeant Song Gi-hyeon.

294
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,098
The last investigation he conducted
was on his teammates.

295
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,809
I heard he tried to gauge the situation
all by himself.

296
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,728
Who told you that he tried to figure out
what was going on all by himself?

297
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,189
The bar and club owners
who bribed the officers.

298
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,360
But at the time,
no one even questioned his death.

299
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:18,073
Even though a police officer suddenly
hanged himself at the station?

300
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,534
It didn't really seem "sudden"

301
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,619
because he was suffering from depression.

302
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,207
So if he was murdered,
it means that the other officers conspired

303
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,251
to murder their colleague
who was investigating them,

304
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,296
and managed to conceal it for two years.

305
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,340
Correct. Their bribery allegations
surfaced

306
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,467
a few months after he was found dead,

307
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,386
so people forgot about his death.

308
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,804
But, sir.

309
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,766
Does the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
handle actual investigations now?

310
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,186
Had I known,

311
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,605
I would've asked you to take it on
from the get-go.

312
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,526
No, we don't handle
the actual investigations.

313
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,406
I guess that's still the case.

314
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,452
Then please allow us
to work together, sir.

315
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,622
Mr. Hwang and I will be able to make
a great team.

316
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,582
We had such good teamwork. Remember?

317
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,295
Together, we'll work hard…

318
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,340
No, we'll do a great job.
We'll unearth the truth at all costs.

319
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,060
You take the care of this.

320
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,854
But I want you to tag along
wherever he goes.

321
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,316
I want you to find out
if he indeed committed suicide

322
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,652
or if he was murdered by his colleagues.

323
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,570
Yes, sir.

324
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,739
Does this concern
the Criminal Legislation Division?

325
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,533
Yes, this definitely concerns
the Criminal Legislation Division.

326
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,494
The war over investigative authority
isn't about logic.

327
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,413
It's all about emotion.
Sure, everyone hates the prosecution,

328
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,332
but the police aren't the answer.

329
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,502
-Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,462
Don't bring up
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

331
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,257
No one can know
about our division's involvement.

332
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,177
Do not say anything about being affiliated
with the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

333
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,471
Keep a watchful eye on him.

334
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,224
Don't step in though.
Just let him do the work.

335
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,105
I'm not getting a prosecutor

336
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,982
to dig into corruption within the police.

337
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,527
A prosecutor of the Uijeongbu district
will be launching a reinvestigation

338
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,779
upon finding some suspicious things.
You know the drill.

339
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,448
Yes, sir.

340
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,491
Yes, sir.

341
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,663
If it was suicide,
what do you think is going to happen?

342
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,166
Then there was never a reinvestigation.

343
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,379
What's taking him so long?

344
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,465
Thanks anyway. You may leave.

345
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,289
This was my first time meeting him,

346
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,875
but he seems like the type
to use my name for his own benefit.

347
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,585
Make sure he doesn't do that, and

348
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,255
seeing how he came to see me with
a proposal when we haven't met before,

349
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,090
he's definitely the type
to be poking around all over the place.

350
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,926
The police will definitely take
note of him given the situation.

351
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,679
Make sure he stays on course
and focuses on digging into this case.

352
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,348
-Don't let the police find fault with us.
-Yes, sir.

353
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,268
I want daily updates
on how things are going.

354
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,187
We'll pull out
if things aren't in our favor.

355
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,938
FORMER PROSECUTORS AND JUDICIAL OFFICIALS
IN THE 20TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

356
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,443
A possibility of homicide
wasn't suggested at the time,

357
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,320
so why is it brought up now?

358
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,988
And how?

359
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,130
Good morning.

360
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,715
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

-Have a good day.
-Bye.

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,245
This is Segok Police Station.

00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,373
Yes, Baek Jung-gi speaking.

369
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,590
Okay.

370
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,816
-I'm heading out to patrol.
-This early?

371
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,943
All right, sir.

372
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,237
Be safe.

Shit. Hey, go bring this! This thing!

00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,203
-Shit! What happened?
-Song Gi-hyeon!

384
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,747
-Damn it.
-Hey!

385
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,041

DATE OF ENCLOSURE: SEPTEMBER 10, 6:30 A.M.
NAME: SONG GI-HYEON

391
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,245
His body showed
clear signs of physical confrontation,

392
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,580
but they just let it go?

393
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,457
If I…

394
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,627
No, let's say you died.

395
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,922
But six of your colleagues
are saying the exact same thing.

396
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,216
They tried to help you when they found you

397
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,009
but they were met with strong resistance

398
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,095
and ended up with the scrapes.
Who's going to find this suspicious?

399
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,764
Would any doctor think
that the six prosecutors are lying

400
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,391
and claim that an autopsy is required?

401
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,435
When it comes to bruises on the chest,
it's hard to tell

402
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,938
if it was caused by CPR or an assault.

403
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,316
Sergeant Song was found dead in September,

404
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,569
and the team's bribery case only surfaced

405
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,571
in December of that year.

406
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,990
Also, he was already
suffering from depression.

407
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,577
So there were no reasonable grounds
to suspect that it wasn't a suicide.

408
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,290
Do you think he transferred to the
patrol division because of his depression?

409
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,543
From what I've found out,

410
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,503
he used to be a police detective.

411
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:37,382
But he was suddenly transferred there.
Transfers like this hardly happen.

412
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,052
Didn't Chief Woo tell you?

413
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,596
I made a separate report

414
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,765
on why that decision was made
and submitted it to him.

415
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,350
No, he didn't tell me.

416
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,858
I guess he really liked that story.

417
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,484
I submitted two reports…

418
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,902
I'll have a look at these.

419
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,612
…but he didn't even read one of them.

420
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,951
Then shall I ask Chief Woo to tell me
why he was transferred there?

421
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,829
You're saying you've already
submitted the report to him,

422
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,497
so perhaps he should explain it to me?

423
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,500
Jeez, you always do this.

424
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,919
He wasn't transferred
because of his depression.

425
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,674
Rather, it was the transfer
that triggered his depression.

426
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,805
Hello, sir.

427
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,234
What is it? Are you hurt?

428
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,045
Are you okay, sir?

429
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,255
Someone was jaywalking…

430
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,968
Can't you drive properly?

431
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,430
You should've driven more carefully.

432
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,557
Was the chief injured?

433
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,352
He said he had a neck cramp.

434
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,525
The police chief's driver was beaten.

435
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,820
Who would dare do that?

436
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,154
It was the chief, of course.

437
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:27,200
CHIEF'S OFFICE

438
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,871
Yes, come in.

439
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,592
Hey! Have you lost your mind?

440
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,761
Did you really say that to me?

441
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,680
How dare you!

442
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,099
So he made a complaint to the Chief

443
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,058
and got transferred.

444
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,104
He couldn't let such injustice slip
at Dongducheon Police Station,

445
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,524
and he couldn't allow corruption
at the new station he was transferred to.

446
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,442
That's how he ended up dead.

447
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,238
Hey, doesn't this Sergeant Song

448
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,282
remind you of someone?

449
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,992
Who?

450
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,744
Never mind.

451
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,873
I wouldn't want that to happen,
even for you.

452
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,166
Seeing it happen twice is more than…

453
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,419
Was it three times?

454
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,714
Hello.

455
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,342
Hey.

456
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,846
Did you know Chief Woo
would ask you to work on this?

457
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,806
No.

458
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,851
It seemed like you already knew
that I was in that room.

459
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,770
I knew it from your shoes.

460
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,481
I saw you wearing the same shoes earlier,

461
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,983
so I knew you were inside.

462
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,323
You said there were no signs of homicide.

463
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,366
Then who first suggested the possibility?

464
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,870
You should be asking
who first discovered it,

465
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,622
not who first suggested it.

466
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,374
"Discovered"?

467
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,759
It was someone else
who started the investigation.

468
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,385
The former prosecutor in charge.

469
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:13,473
Around 9 p.m. on November 24th, 2017,

470
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,683
you got in a fight at Sanjeong Motel

471
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,603
with the waiters working for you, right?

472
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,355
No, they swarmed in

473
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,981
and ganged up on me.

474
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,777
-You closed your shop and ran, right?
-I didn't run, I just closed my business.

475
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,945
You didn't pay them, either.

476
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,030
It wasn't on purpose. I just couldn't.

477
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,324
Yet you had the money to bribe
the officers

478
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,576
-at the station.
-How did they find out about the bribes?

479
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,453
The waiters who were charged

480
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,788
for beating the business owner.

481
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,748
They had a grudge against him anyway,

482
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,875
so they spilled everything.

483
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,961
They testified that the owner paid

484
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,588
about 500 thousand won to the police
every month.

485
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,049
And the investigation revealed

486
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,635
that a certain patrol team
at Segok Police Station

487
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,304
was taking bribes from all
the bars and clubs in the neighborhood.

488
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,473
Businesses there aren't as booming
as they once were,

489
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,309
but they would have received
10 million won a month at the least.

490
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,980
The business owner admitted
everything up to this point,

491
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:06,651
but then he suddenly
said something strange.

492
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,195
That officer who committed suicide
a while ago,

493
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,406
I heard it wasn't really a suicide.

494
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,282
He said that an officer at Segok Station

495
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,743
committed suicide a few months ago

496
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,328
hadn't actually committed suicide.

497
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,039
-It was his colleagues.
-Do you have any evidence?

498
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,710
People in my line of business
wouldn't have evidence.

499
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,045
But everyone in the business knows it.

500
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,297
We're just keeping quiet.

501
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,758
We know it for a fact.

502
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,261
We didn't bribe them for no reason.

503
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,762
We were all scared.

504
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,974
They're people who would even
murder their own colleague.

505
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,560
-He said his colleagues did it.
-Who knows what they'll do to us?

506
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,354
According to him, the business owners
in the neighborhood

507
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,981
all knew that Sergeant Song

508
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,733
was asking around about the bribes,

509
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,902
so his colleagues would've known
about it for sure.

510
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,405
The reason why
the business owners said this

511
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,241
was because he wanted to claim
that he had no choice but to bribe them

512
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,910
since he knew how vicious they could be.

513
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,913
But if it's a murder,

514
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,249
bribery isn't the problem here.

515
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,335
And the prosecutor in charge
still didn't reinvestigate?

516
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,297
That's why I said the person
who discovered it is more important.

517
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,634
Shall we begin?

518
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,813
You do know why you're here, don't you?

519
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,440
No,

520
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,735
I have no idea why I'm here.

521
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,032
I know you're busy, but I felt so sorry
about what happened

522
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,450
so I had to come and talk to you.

523
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,745
You really don't need to feel sorry.

524
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,665
I felt like you and the eastern
district office got involved

525
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,502
in unnecessary gossip because of me.

526
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,961
It's just that the Tongyeong case…

527
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,131
Well, I wouldn't even call it a case.

528
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,927
The son of our law firm's
VIP customer was involved

529
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,846
so I paid you a visit to thank you.

530
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,223
I didn't expect this to happen.

531
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,933
We followed protocol.

532
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,936
We're not bothered by the police
talking about special treatment.

533
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,396
You really haven't changed a bit.

534
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,775
The president at my law firm
also mentioned

535
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,194
that you're a tough man.

536
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:14,862
Do you mean Mr. Kim Min-u?

537
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,447
I heard you two know each other well.

538
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,242
I only met him once a long time ago.

539
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,452
Yet you still remember him.

540
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,996
You two must have been something.

541
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,750
Oh, right. When I told him
I was going to meet you,

542
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,878
he told me to ask you to join our law firm

543
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,798
if you ever want to join one later.

544
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,467
-Well, I'm still--
-Of course.

545
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,428
Stay a prosecutor as long as you can

546
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,182
and be someone that your juniors
can look up to. You can join us later.

547
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,645
Everyone leaves the office eventually.

548
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,023
Right.

549
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:57,488
To be honest, I was feeling quite upset
even on my way here.

550
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,033
Sungmoon Daily was going on about

551
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,827
how the prosecution

552
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,872
was conspiring to glorify
a murderer or something.

553
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,000
You were working with him then, right?

554
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,460
-No?
-I was.

555
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,880
I worked under him at the Seoul
Western District Prosecutors' Office.

556
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,507
Can't you do anything about
Sungmoon Daily?

557
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,092
Even I got upset reading that article.

558
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,928
If we take any action,

559
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,932
we'd be involving ourselves in the battle
for Hanjo's management rights.

560
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,309
I guess you're right.

561
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,229
I bet Lee Sung-jae's
blaming himself pretty badly right now.

562
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,690
He should have taken over
his father's position

563
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,942
two years ago, no matter what it took.

564
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,944
He was in danger of getting arrested

565
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,946
along with his father back then.

566
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,741
He probably thought he could just let
his naive sister run things

567
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,869
and easily get back
the management rights later.

568
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,414
Our late Chief Secretary
will be turning in his grave.

569
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,541
The world hasn't changed at all.

570
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,670
You should say something on behalf
of the legal profession.

571
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,048
How dare they try to defame
a prosecutor like that?

572
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,925
You're in a position to represent us.

573
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,598
I'm not letting them off
because I want to,

574
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,728
but going against Lee Sung-jae
is the same as helping Lee Yeon-jae.

575
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,399
If we want to defend
the late Chief Secretary Lee Chang-jun

576
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,320
we'll have to claim that they didn't
work together on that scheme.

577
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,863
Then…

578
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,076
we'd be reaffirming
Lee Yeon-jae's legitimacy ourselves.

579
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,746
But you know,

580
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,416
if you think about it the opposite way,

581
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,586
wouldn't it be better to deal
with one chairwoman than the both of them?

582
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,340
Lee Sung-jae's strategy
is proving to be quite effective.

583
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,677
All of Hanjo's presidents used to be
under Lee Yun-beom anyway.

584
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,762
He made it seem like Lee Yeon-jae
used her husband

585
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,389
to get rid of her father

586
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,850
and discarded him as well
after she got what she wanted,

587
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,228
so all the affiliates are taking his side.

588
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:56,065
Lee Sung-jae really takes after
his father.

589
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,067
He's overly determined.

590
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,445
But what about Lee Yeon-jae?
She just took over an ownerless company

591
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,489
while all the men were occupied.

592
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,324
What would she know about anything?

593
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,286
From what I see,

594
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,122
you now have the casting vote to decide

595
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,999
who will be the next chairman of Hanjo.

596
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,210
Will it be Lee Sung-jae, who is defaming

597
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,504
the late Chief Secretary Lee Chang-jun,

598
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,465
or Lee Yeon-jae?

599
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,722
Whoever it may be,
wouldn't it be better to deal with one

600
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,681
than two?

601
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,435
Lee Sung-jae isn't the kind of man
who is afraid to get his hands dirty.

602
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,713
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

603
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,424
Come and have a seat, Mr. Oh.

604
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,737
I just met Chief Prosecutor Kang Won-chul.

605
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,826
It seems like he'll refute the article
by Sungmoon Daily.

606
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,164
He has no choice but to deny the claims

607
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,290
and criticize the article,

608
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,127
considering the situation he's in.

609
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,673
Good work.

610
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,300
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

611
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,013
Kang Won-chul mentioned
the word "legitimacy"

612
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,890
with his own mouth.

613
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,477
Was he talking about himself?

614
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,648
Yes, I'm sure he was unconsciously
thinking about himself.

615
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,234
His own legitimacy
is on the line right now.

616
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,738
Kang Won-chul was able to gain his current
position thanks to your late husband,

617
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,031
so if it turns out that he…

618
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,414
I'm sorry to say this, but if it turns out
that he was just a murderer,

619
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,417
Kang Won-chul would become
someone who rose to his position

620
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,585
thanks to a murderer.

621
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,754
He'd be something like
a by-product of a crime.

622
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,549
Like a bastard left alone
after his father's death.

623
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,885
The prosecutor general who promoted him

624
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,761
to chief prosecutor back then is gone too.

625
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,014
So if the late chief secretary is ruined,

626
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,141
Kang Won-chul would meet the same fate.

627
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:21,061
He'll be criticizing Sungmoon Daily
for defaming his late senior,

628
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,314
but he'd actually be hung up
on his own problems.

629
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:27,359
And I've just met him
and added fuel to the fire.

630
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,030
Lee Sung-jae isn't making himself
the enemy of the prosecution

631
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,949
-because he's stupid.
-Of course not.

632
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,244
But still, the reason why he's
going this far

633
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,371
is because he's that desperate.

634
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,666
It was probably the only way
to have a chance against you.

635
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:47,087
And what's worse for him is that
the prosecutor he blamed for conspiring

636
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,090
with your late husband is now working
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

637
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,261
I'm sure Lee Sung-jae is troubled
with a lot of things going on right now.

638
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,147
You've done such a good job. I'll probably
have to ask you for more favors.

639
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,734
No problem, Ms. Lee.

640
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,320
So I'd like to ask you

641
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,031
to be our internal advisor.

642
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,159
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

643
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,914
No one else needs to know
that you're working for Hanjo.

644
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,542
You'll be able to work freely, like today.

645
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,127
I understand.

646
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,006
We'll contact you
with further details of the contract.

647
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,174
I'll be waiting, then.

648
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,054
Please come out after five minutes.

649
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,395
I'll see you again, Ms. Lee.

650
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,491
How about making contracts quietly
for the other non-executive positions

651
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,869
like Mr. Oh
instead of hiring them officially?

652
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,665
I should show the stockholders

653
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:08,168
that I have a solution against
the National Tax Service.

654
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,546
We don't need to worry about Lee Sung-jae.

655
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,175
He has more former public officials
working for him than I do.

656
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,636
More importantly…

657
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,598
-Yes, ma'am.
-I guess Hwang Si-mok works

658
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,183
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office now.

659
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,981
I'll look into it.

660
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,097
SEGOK POLICE STATION

661
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,409
MEN'S SHOWER ROOM

662
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,261
If I… No, let's say you died.

663
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,473
But six of your colleagues
are saying the exact same thing.

664
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,517
They tried to help you when they found you

665
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,102
but they were met with strong resistance

666
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,395
and ended up with the scrapes.

667
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,706
Who are you?

668
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,668
Were you fixing something in there?

669
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,754
Damn it.

670
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,923
MEN'S SHOWER ROOM

671
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,925
Hey! Wait!

672
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,762
Why weren't you answering my calls?

673
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,271
Darn it.

674
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,943
Didn't you get a call?

675
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,573
A prosecutor summoned me directly.

676
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,994
That jerk is a pain even when he's dead.

677
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,164
-Hey!
-I'm sorry, sir.

678
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,211
No, I don't think he heard.

679
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,799
Just hang up. Let's talk later.

680
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,514
Jeez, he's gone already.

681
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,104
What is it?

682
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,815
Your zipper.

683
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,026
Oh, right.

684
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,611
Your vacation starts tomorrow, right?

685
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,654
-Yes.
-Switch with me.

686
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,281
I'm going somewhere with my parents!

687
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,659
We already made reservations! Sir!

688
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,337
I'm not late, am I?

689
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,589
No, you're just in time. Let's go.

690
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,638
Let's begin with the pamphlets
created for promotional purposes.

691
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,390
-These are investigative rights
-Why didn't you tell me?

692
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,309
-conflicts over the years.
-I'm overdressed.

693
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,895
-I like seeing you feel awkward.
-This will be released after

694
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,146
the council meeting tomorrow.

695
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,858
Since 1945 when the US Army Military
Government was established,

696
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,778
the police and the prosecution
have had four large conflicts so far.

697
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,156
The first conflict took place in 1998.

698
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,493
The prosecution opposed,
and the Ministry of Justice

699
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,786
took the prosecution's side,

700
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,206
stopping the police from gaining
independent investigative rights.

701
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,083
The second conflict was in 2005.

702
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,044
President Roh Moo-hyun expressed regret

703
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,129
that no agreements had been made,

704
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,049
and held a meeting in order to
mediate the two parties disagreeing

705
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,467
over investigative rights…

706
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,637
Even the Commissioner General
fought for investigation rights,

707
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,306
but the Criminal Procedure Code
stating that the prosecution is

708
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,016
in charge of investigations
wasn't revised.

709
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,518
So we had no results again.

710
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,354
The third conflict was in 2011.

711
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,816
Regulations stating
that judicial police officers had to obey

712
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,402
prosecutors' orders was finally deleted,

713
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,571
but the prosecutors still had rights
to command investigations

714
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,865
and only the prosecution had the right
to end them.

715
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,994
And the fourth and the final conflict
is now, in 2019.

716
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,330
The prosecution, who submitted
to the former governments,

717
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,290
have now lost the trust of the citizens.

718
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,209
This is the first time that they have

719
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,087
lost power over us in terms of
public opinion and political authority.

720
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,381
Noticing their situation,

721
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,216
the prosecution is agreeing
to an adjustment,

722
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,301
but only under several conditions.

723
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,684
Next, I'll talk about one of
the prosecution's conditions,

724
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,145
an autonomous police system.
This will also be included

725
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,731
in the pamphlets released
following the meeting tomorrow.

726
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,024
So what is this
"autonomous police system"?

727
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,235
Simply put, we'd be lending
a part of the police force

728
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,571
to local governments.

729
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:36,533
So the opposite of "autonomous police"
would be "national police."

730
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,410
-Detective Jang Geon.
-Yes, sir.

731
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,911
What do officers on the field think?

732
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,913
With this system,

733
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,624
officers may become local officials
instead of state officials.

734
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,418
I'm sure you'd be sensitive about that.

735
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,964
No need to be nervous. Talk comfortably.

736
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,218
Yes, sir.

737
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,348
We're rather positive about that.

738
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,809
-Is that so?
-Yes.

739
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,312
Local officers could reinvent

740
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,691
the image of the police force
to one that is more helpful to the public…

741
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,070
-So you have a positive view on it.
-Right.

742
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,408
All right, then.

743
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,659
Pardon.

744
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,872
You mean real officers
investigating on the field?

745
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,834
Are there fake officers, then?

746
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,379
Well, to be honest…

747
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,674
Hey, you can get punished for
obstruction of justice.

748
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,218
Investigative rights are great,

749
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,553
but I wish we could
defend ourselves in the field

750
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,431
even if we can't do things
like they do in the States.

751
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,099
If we're careful, they call us idle.

752
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,268
If we do anything,
they call it police brutality.

753
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,480
We'll be ridiculed
if videos like this surfaced.

754
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:51,233
Getting the warrants quickly
is the most important.

755
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,277
We do a search and seizure when we
think they'll get rid of the evidence,

756
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,571
but we can't even get a warrant
without the prosecution.

757
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,408
We waste time waiting for the warrant

758
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,077
and news spreads while we wait.

759
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,955
And who do you think spreads the word?

760
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,207
We'd be glad just to get the warrants.

761
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,587
The warrants are issued by the court,
but why does the prosecution

762
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,756
intercept in the middle?

763
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:20,220
I don't think the problem is about
autonomous or national police.

764
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,306
We need a certain regulation system.

765
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,602
Even if we gain investigative rights,
the chief could…

766
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,397
I'm not saying that our chief
would do such a thing,

767
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,900
but some higher-ups could use
their authority to manipulate

768
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,529
the investigation, and we'd have
no way of stopping that.

769
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,115
If the police could have
their own council…

770
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,366
Detective Jang.

771
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,785
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's stick to the topic.

772
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,662
Nobody here hasn't been on the field.

773
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,664
I'm sorry.

774
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,042
All right, I'll now explain

775
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,170
the work distributions
of the local and national police.

776
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,089
Autonomous police officers

777
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,425
will be working in fields
closely related to the public

778
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,845
such as safety, women, juveniles,
traffic, and local patrol.

779
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,472
We don't have much time,
but we should prepare

780
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,099
-as much as we can.
-Right.

781
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,272
-I was way too nervous.
-Let's go eat something.

782
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,523
How about pig skin?

783
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,942
Hang on,
let me go to my seat for a minute.

784
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,077
Why is only the captain left?

785
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,332
He claimed to have no knowledge
of the bribes his team received.

786
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,959
He was just demoted one rank
for being irresponsible

787
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,336
and kept his position.

788
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,548
So only the captain of the team
didn't know about it?

789
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,344
They work together as a team.
That's nonsense.

790
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,512
Our team worked together for five years.

791
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,184
We were on the streets every single day
whether it was cold or hot.

792
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,980
We didn't even get
to rest on the holidays,

793
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,900
but we always had each other's backs.

794
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,404
Sticking together like that for five years

795
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,658
makes you even closer than siblings.

796
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,453
Sergeant Song joined us as a member,

797
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,663
so I wanted to help him.

798
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,291
He didn't fit in,
so I was more friendly toward him.

799
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,586
We even shared his work.

800
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,717
If your team was like family to you,
how could you be the only one

801
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,718
who didn't know

802
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,638
about the bribes they were receiving?

803
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,975
You know that sounds far-fetched, right?

804
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,393
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

805
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,480
I wasn't charged

806
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,149
for bribery.

807
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,151
Your seniors,

808
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,737
the prosecutors who work in this building,

809
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,991
decided that I was free from suspicion.

810
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,702
And Song Gi-hyeon
really did commit suicide.

811
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,371
I saw him kill himself

812
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,832
with my own eyes!

813
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,960
You saw him killing himself?
Then you should've stopped him.

814
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,921
No, I mean I saw him after he was dead!

815
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,715
If you saw him after he was dead,

816
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,843
how can you be sure
if he really killed himself?

817
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,096
Having someone like that on the team

818
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,558
causes so much trouble for the rest of us.

819
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,602
He was always looking so depressed,

820
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,188
trapped in a victim mentality…

821
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,361
Of course, he wouldn't admit it
after all this time.

822
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,738
This will take quite a while.

823
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,699
I'm planning on visiting another
former member of that team.

824
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,659
The top senior of the station.

825
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,619
"Visit"?

826
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,413
He received a jail sentence for the bribes

827
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,373
and he's serving time in Anyang right now.

828
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,876
I'll go after the council meeting
tomorrow.

829
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:38,793
All right.

830
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,381
You told Prosecutor Seo
not to act rashly, right?

831
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,592
Yes, he's smart when it comes
to things like that.

832
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,968
He understood right away.

833
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,638
I did think so. Or else he wouldn't have
brought these files to me.

834
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,100
The prosecution and the police have caused

835
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,519
lots of problems so far,
but there was never

836
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,772
a homicide among colleagues.

837
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,862
There's overflowing criticism

838
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,740
regarding poor work performance
or lenience on corruption.

839
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,367
The police have had their fair share
of criticism.

840
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,387
But if an officer was killed
by his colleagues,

841
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,433
-it'll be much more serious than that.
-Good luck!

842
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,851
-Good luck!
-The citizens will

843
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,561
turn their backs on the police altogether.

844
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,522
Good luck on the meeting.

845
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,362
We can't get rid of the police,

846
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,030
and the people will cool down eventually.

847
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,157
Are you all ready?

848
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,575
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

849
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,162
But we'll have the power to stop
their persistent requests

850
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,206
for investigative rights.

851
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,586
Let's go.

852
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,880
-Yes, sir.
-Good luck.

853
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,132
You can do it!

854
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,389
They themselves gave us proof

855
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,642
why they shouldn't have more power.
This is a blessing for us.

856
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,602
This is the perfect weapon.

857
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,440
Whatever the police say
in the meeting today,

858
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,733
we won't hand over anything.

859
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,318
It belongs to us in the first place.

860
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,155
We'll maintain our rights,
just like we have for the past 70 years.

861
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,407
FIRST PROSECUTION-POLICE COUNCIL MEETING

862
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,368
BEGINNING TODAY AT 10 A.M.
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

863
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:58,141
BOARD OF AUDIT AND INSPECTION

864
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,851
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

865
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,764
Why bother meeting if we were to
accept the government's proposal?

866
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,141
With the power to request warrants,
you will face pressure

867
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,726
to prosecute or not prosecute
certain cases.

868
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,479
You were ordered to remove some evidence
just because of a complaint?

869
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,356
Why do you think that is?

870
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,274
He's a prosecutor,
just like everyone else.

871
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,361
Have you finally found your place?

872
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,364
Do you know which prosecutor
from Uijeongbu asked that?

873
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,533
Thank you for calling me, Ms. Lee.

874
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,117
But why did you want to see me?

875
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,869
If there is a reason

876
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,372
why the prosecution is digging up
an old case,

877
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,624
especially at a time like this…

878
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,709
I'll look into it.

879
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:11,798
