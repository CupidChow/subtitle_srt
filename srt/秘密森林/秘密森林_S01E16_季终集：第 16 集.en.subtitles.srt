1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,836
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,303
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,724
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, PLACE NAMES
AND CASES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,146
I have a faith.

5
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,107
I believe that there are two types
of people in this building.

6
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,902
Guardians and criminals.
Barrister's robes and prison uniforms.

7
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,779
No matter what the situation may be,

8
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,406
I believe that we're different
from those whom we need to punish.

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,116
Mr. Hwang!

10
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,578
The man, Byung-jun Woo,
did leave the country yesterday.

11
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,996
He went to Taipei, Taiwan.

12
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,334
Contact Interpol and ask them
to issue a red notice.

13
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,169
And inform
the Korean Mission in Taipei as well.

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,130
-We'll send investigators there.
-Okay, got it.

15
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,403
You moved Yeon-jae's money
after making her leave the country,

16
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,949
then you dared to summon Mr. Song
and tried to steal my profit.

17
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,492
Did you think I wouldn't know?

18
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,577
Of course you'd know.

19
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,830
What on earth are you up to?

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,749
Killing Eun-soo...
It was your doing, wasn't it?

21
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,381
Stop spewing such nonsense.
You're being ridiculous.

22
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,883
You told Mr. Woo to do the job

23
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,844
and sent him abroad after, didn't you?

24
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,514
You're much sneakier
than I thought you could be, Chang-jun.

25
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,182
Was this your plan?

26
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,893
Will you say that I instigated murder
to threaten me

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,603
so that you can take
a hefty amount from me?

28
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,398
The killer has already been caught.

29
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,900
I've never even met that guy.

30
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,029
He didn't kill Eun-soo.

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,407
Is there evidence?

32
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,908
I'm the evidence.

33
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,618
What do you mean?

34
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,331
Moo-sung Park and Ga-young Kim.

35
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,000
It was me.

36
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,297
The guy who got arrested is just a blade.

37
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,883
I'm the one who held the handle
of the knife.

38
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,426
Why?

39
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,927
You'll find out soon.

40
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,056
All right, I've told you everything.

41
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,102
Now, it's time for you to be honest,
Father.

42
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,979
I don't know anything about it.

43
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,857
Chang-jun.

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,321
We've been a family
for a pretty long time.

45
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,656
Why have we become like this?

46
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,909
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

47
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,746
I have to go.

48
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,624
Take care.

49
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,211
END THE CALL WITH FATHER

50
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,256
THE CALL HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RECORDED.

51
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,776
Freeze all bank accounts
under Chang-jun's name,

52
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,736
and tell them to stop all withdrawals
immediately.

53
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,705
Speak of the devil.

54
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,291
Were you talking about me?

55
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,043
I was thinking about you.

56
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,507
You can stop thinking. Let's meet up, sir.

57
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,053
Hold on. Mr. Hwang, which investigators
would you like to send to Taiwan?

58
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,681
-Lieutenant Han and Detective Jang.
-Got it.

59
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,184
Byung-jun Woo left for Taiwan yesterday.

60
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,103
We've asked their government
for cooperation,

61
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,939
so you should go there with Detective Jang
and arrest him.

62
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,859
And Chang-jun Lee was
the accomplice behind Mr. Yoon.

63
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,904
I'm on my way to meet him now.
I'll send you the address.

64
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,573
Hongje-dong.

65
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,996
Please track the location
of Chief Secretary Chang-jun Lee.

66
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,583
If people from Hanjo Group come,
do not let any of them into my office.

67
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,668
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,263
I sincerely apologize.

69
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,224
I ran into her right in front
of Mr. Hwang's place.

70
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,393
I didn't expect to see
Mr. Young's daughter...

71
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,854
You moron. Leave the country right away!

72
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,439
Don't come back until I tell you to do so.

73
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,567
-Thank you, sir.
-Take this too!

74
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,028
Get rid of it. Don't leave any traces.

75
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,049
Come in.

76
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,974
I found out that Mr. Lee has
a personal safe deposit box at Hanil Bank.

77
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,225
What should we do?

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,269
Tell the CEO of the bank
that I want to meet.

79
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,272
And bring Chang-jun here immediately.

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,272
It shows that Chang-jun Lee is
on the move toward Muakjae now.

81
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,316
Then he is going to Hongje-dong.

82
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,442
Where are you now?

83
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,403
I'm... Hang up first.
I'll send you my location.

84
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,741
Send the current location
to Detective Jang.

85
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,160
SEND CURRENT LOCATION TO DETECTIVE JANG.

86
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,164
DETECTIVE JANG, NEW MESSAGE,
TRACKING MY LOCATION

87
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,877
ADDRESS: HONGJE-DONG, SEODAEMUN-GU, SEOUL

88
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,006
We've figured out that
he's the accomplice.

89
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,050
Why is he letting us track his location?

90
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,886
What is he thinking?

91
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,403
What happened?

92
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,489
We're at the Blue House,
but we can't get in.

93
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,698
We told them your name, but...

94
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,993
Track his car. I don't care what you do!
Bring him to me immediately.

95
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,895
You got here faster than I thought.

96
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,773
You still have a long way to go, though.

97
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,408
You must have a lot of questions.

98
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,786
Did you instigate Mr. Yoon

99
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,163
into killing Moo-sung Park?

100
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,331
Yes, I did.

101
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,501
Did you cause bodily harm
to Ga-young Kim as well?

102
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,669
Yes.

103
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,256
What about Eun-soo Young?

104
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,262
Aren't you here
because you know who did it?

105
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,433
Why did you do it?

106
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,269
You said

107
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,105
that I must've been threatened by Mr. Park

108
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,316
and that I tried to shut that girl up.

109
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,319
I now know that's not what happened.

110
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,655
I should've said no.

111
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,784
Mr. Park begged me
to help him get a contract,

112
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,621
but I should've refused it.

113
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,417
Did you introduce him
to those in Hanjo Distribution

114
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,628
yourself?

115
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,673
He was trying hard to revive
his dying business,

116
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,842
and I had no reason to be cold to him.

117
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,886
Hanjo Distribution was

118
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,097
getting the least amount
of attention out of all the subsidiaries.

119
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,394
I didn't think putting him in touch
with them would affect anything.

120
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,690
You didn't know that it was soon
to be used for illegal transfer of assets.

121
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,525
I had no idea.

122
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,697
It wasn't in the limelight because they
wanted it to stay out of public attention.

123
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,037
I regret it.
That's the only thing I regret.

124
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,833
The one misjudgment I made.

125
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,628
Is that why...

126
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,508
Would you have

127
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,302
done something you'd regret later?

128
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,251
Why did you want to meet here?

129
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,508
It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?

130
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:02,972
I'll be cuffed.

131
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,350
Then with my prisoner number on my chest,

132
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,686
I'll be dragged around.

133
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,856
I'll be interrogated by prosecutors
below my seniority level.

134
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,358
I've seen it many times.

135
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,403
Isn't it strange?

136
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,699
All those men who were interrogated
in front of me

137
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,869
had lost a lot of hair
at the crown of their heads.

138
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,206
Why is this popping up
in my mind right now?

139
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,752
Please come with me.

140
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,801
Should I become the defeated

141
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,804
and get dragged around as a captive?

142
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,849
Or shall I choose to vanish

143
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,059
on the battleground?

144
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,520
Chang-jun.

145
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,773
Chang-jun?

146
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,443
I like being called that way.

147
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,372
Slow down.

148
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,881
Did Si-mok really say
that Mr. Lee is the culprit?

149
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,291
Pull yourself together.
Someone is up there.

150
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,126
I'll go check. Please stay with him here.

151
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,878
You can do it, right?

152
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,594
The redevelopment area in Hongje-dong.

153
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,138
It's behind Inwang Elementary School.
Send an ambulance immediately.

154
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,848
Someone fell.

155
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,656
Sir, Mr. Chief Secretary.

156
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,075
Sir, sir!

157
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,281
Mr. Hwang?

158
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,327
Sir!

159
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,089
Sir... Mr. Chief Secretary.
Please keep yourself together. Sir!

160
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,218
You still

161
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,346
have a chance.

162
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,642
Dong-jae.

163
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,063
Do not

164
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,484
follow my path.

165
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,828
Sir...

166
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,248
Mr. Chief Secretary...

167
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,553
Put both of your hands up.

168
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,145
Turn around slowly.

169
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,245
Did you push him?

170
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,604
Reporters will swarm all over here soon.
Tidy things up before that.

171
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,105
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

172
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,651
I heard he jumped off
before Mr. Hwang could even stop him.

173
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,612
Before that, he admitted
being the accomplice.

174
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,821
Are you sure it's suicide?

175
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,949
What if there was a tussle up there?

176
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,493
Lieutenant Han saw him jumping.

177
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,244
She must've seen it from down here.

178
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,246
Weren't they the only ones up there?

179
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm not saying that Prosecutor Hwang
pushed him intentionally.

180
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,794
He could've done it by mistake
while trying to stop him.

181
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,337
Prosecutor Seo said he saw it too.

182
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,806
It looks like he took his own life.

183
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,771
Who's here now?

184
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,148
The protocol team has started
preparing for the funeral.

185
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,110
The planning team and the PR team
are both on standby.

186
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,404
Shall I call the executives?

187
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,991
Control the media first.

188
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,788
Chang-jun has committed many corrupt deeds
since he was a prosecutor.

189
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,876
He kept his henchman in the prosecution
in order to bury all of his wrong deeds.

190
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,337
And using that guy,

191
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,176
he killed Moo-sung Park who bribed
prosecutors at the western office.

192
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,429
-Pardon me?
-The guilt made him take his own life.

193
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,515
Distribute a press release

194
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,101
before reporters come up
with imaginative stories.

195
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,478
Understood, sir.

196
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,155
What a moron.

197
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,578
They say that a live dog
is better than a dead lion.

198
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,959
I guess that's just his fate.

199
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,588
What can I do?

200
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,792
As a prosecutor, I want to do it. But...

201
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,174
Si-mok.

202
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,096
I don't want to lose this position.

203
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,318
Is it true? Our chief prosecutor...

204
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,279
I mean, the news
about Chief Secretary Chang-jun Lee.

205
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,697
He passed away.

206
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,784
Then the other things too?

207
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,496
How he was the mastermind behind Mr. Yoon
and that he took his own life?

208
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,206
Yes.

209
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,500
It's all true.

210
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,349
Are we going to start?

211
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,564
We should.

212
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,067
Let's do it.

213
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,783
Now, I'll distribute documents that list
all illegal deeds Hanjo has committed.

214
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,411
They're organized by date,

215
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,830
and they go back to about two years ago.

216
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,790
The enclosed memory sticks contain

217
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,460
voice files, which are recordings
of secret meetings held for the schemes.

218
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,676
Where did you get this?

219
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,429
Mine isn't about Hanjo Group.

220
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,514
They pressured our offices
to hire specific people.

221
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,934
There are things related
to the Public Prosecutor General as well.

222
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,773
Who else has been informed about this?

223
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,859
Those of you here
are the only ones who know.

224
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,736
They've never been disclosed before.

225
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,822
Intellectual property infringement,
illegal sales of real estate,

226
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,365
unlawful transfer of assets, tax evasion

227
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,867
and violating Foreign Exchange Act.

228
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,204
You'll see what each team from Division
One to Five will be in charge of.

229
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,125
Some public officials helped Hanjo
evade law enforcement.

230
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,835
There are politicians too.

231
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,463
We're so dead, aren't we?

232
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,639
Why should we die?

233
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,059
These guys are in trouble, not us.

234
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,896
All right. It's all or nothing.

235
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,940
If we want to crush them,
we must strike them with full force.

236
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,485
If we approach them rashly,
we'll be crushed.

237
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,616
Please help us out.

238
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,729
Your accomplice, Chang-jun Lee,

239
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,440
confessed everything
and jumped to his death.

240
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,447
You don't seem that surprised.

241
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,741
I guess the two of you
had talked about it.

242
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,748
Did he tell you that Byung-jun Woo
is the one who killed Ms. Young?

243
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,793
Is that why you kept your mouth shut?

244
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,964
Because we'd find out about your source
if you told us Byung-jun Woo killed her?

245
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,846
Did he tell you anything else
about Byung-jun Woo?

246
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,181
Where in Taiwan he may be, for example.

247
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,644
All I know is he went there.
I don't know anything else.

248
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,408
While you were working with us,

249
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,452
all of us must've looked
like complete idiots.

250
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:22,043
While wandering around to catch
the killer, we addressed you so politely.

251
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,798
We must've looked really pathetic,
especially me and Detective Jang.

252
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,098
During the special investigation...

253
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,019
It was the first time.

254
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,898
For the very first time in two years,

255
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
I felt like I could actually breathe.

256
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:59,414
Shall I go tell Mr. Park's mother that
the prick who slashed her son to death

257
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,666
said he felt like he could
finally breathe?

258
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,084
Or shall I go tell Ga-young's mom?

259
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,795
In this country,

260
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,798
there are so many parents
who lost their children

261
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,051
unfairly.

262
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
Do all of them brandish knives?

263
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,641
You basically stabbed them too.

264
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,311
They've done everything in their power
to overcome their losses,

265
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,063
and you made all of their effort
go to waste.

266
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,023
You feel like you can breathe now?

267
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,618
While many of us are still shocked
by the late Chief Secretary Chang-jun Lee

268
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,579
committing suicide right before getting
arrested for murder,

269
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,500
the recordings he left got leaked,
which has been causing a big stir.

270
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,877
The secret documents, which were made

271
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,588
to prevent betrayal of those
who were involved in the secret deals,

272
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,424
were taken into custody by the prosecution
after Chief Secretary Lee, who was

273
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,969
on the run from the police
and prosecution, took his own life.

274
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,137
Using these documents as evidence,
the prosecution have

275
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,224
commenced a search and seizure at Hanjo
and The Bahn Group early this morning.

276
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,310
Moreover, a list of high-ranking officials
who were involved in illegal acts

277
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,520
has also been disclosed,

278
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,064
which is expected to cause
an immense stir.

279
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,442
Detective Seo, join Team Two
and hit the savings bank.

280
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,653
Geon and Yeo-jin, go to the bus company.

281
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,322
Sun-chang, you and I will go
to Financial Supervisory Service.

282
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,993
The media beat us. Time isn't on our side,
so get moving quickly.

283
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,411
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

284
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,582
Hello? The Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

285
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,543
Official documents have been issued?

286
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,753
Thank you.

287
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,881
Detective Jang,
let's go catch that killer.

288
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,636
I told you that I don't know anything.

289
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,102
I'm calling from Mr. Chief Prosecutor's
office. Please play it now.

290
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,980
You've never given the Incheon office

291
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,774
any orders related
to Sepoong Transportation's trial?

292
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,068
Hey, Won-chul.

293
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,113
Do you want to leave the prosecution
right after your promotion or what?

294
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,993
Go bring that man, Mr. Yoon.
Let me talk to him face-to-face.

295
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,246
There's something you should hear
before that.

296
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,419
Hello, Congressman Bae.
It's been a long time.

297
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,671
-I heard the killer has been caught.
-Yes.

298
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:16,176
I didn't expect that you'd be
affected by the Huam-dong case.

299
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,679
What are you talking about?
I don't have anything to do with it.

300
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:26,353
I don't think you're in a situation
where you can worry about saving face.

301
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,897
The killer must've told them
everything by now.

302
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,483
It's only a matter of time
before your name comes up.

303
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:35,570
So? You must've called me
because you have a plan.

304
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,782
I'm sure there will be something
I can do for you.

305
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,200
Do you have some time now?

306
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:48,458
CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

307
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,629
I just got a call
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

308
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,548
We'll be sure to bring that prick,
Byung-jun Woo, back to his home soil,

309
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,093
so just trust us and wait for us.
Best of luck to you too.

310
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:02,972
Please catch him.

311
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,058
LIEUTENANT HAN

312
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,159
I've been

313
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,498
responsible for 30 percent
of this country's GDP.

314
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,833
That's right, 30 percent.

315
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,587
For my whole life, I've devoted myself
to sustaining the nation's economy.

316
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,299
And as you're probably aware,
I have given jobs

317
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,093
to millions of young people
in this country.

318
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,595
The anti-corporate attitude

319
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,848
that calls my effort a crime

320
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,852
and uses it as a reason
to criticize all the work I've done

321
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,104
makes businessmen like me lose our ground.

322
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,356
Wondering what kind of outcome
this may bring

323
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,400
truly terrifies me.

324
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,026
The thought of my beloved country

325
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,320
getting dropped from the list

326
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,533
of highly developed countries
due to such collective unreasonable rage

327
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,535
scares me.

328
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,330
I, Yun-beom Lee, would like
to make this one thing clear.

329
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:14,043
Prosecutors may be able to strap me down
jurisprudentially,

330
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,004
but I can

331
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,882
confidently face the honorable history
of this country and say

332
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,009
that I am innocent.

333
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,887
Even toddlers know shame.

334
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,235
You haven't become a decent human being
even after killing a person.

335
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,741
Well, I can understand
why the former minister

336
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,702
is not in his right state of mind
at the moment,

337
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,372
but I have nothing to do
with the death of his daughter...

338
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,290
Your son-in-law!

339
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,169
I'm talking about Chang-jun.

340
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,215
You killed him.

341
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,103
Did you ask the late Mr. Lee
to record those conversations secretly?

342
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,940
The suspect of Ms. Young's murder is
your employee. What's your thought on it?

343
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,984
-Please say a few words.
-Sir, please tell us.

344
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,029
-Sir!
-Sir, please say a few words.

345
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,366
-Sir, what is the truth?
-Please say a few words!

346
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:34,457
The intensive investigation on Chairman
Yun-beom Lee of Hanjo has been extended,

347
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,670
which has resulted in a prospect
that an arrest warrant might be requested.

348
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,672
And about Chairman Lee's daughter

349
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,925
and the late chief secretary's wife,
Ms. Yeon-jae Lee,

350
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,303
donating her illegally transferred assets
to a scholarship foundation,

351
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,848
the prosecution stated that they are
investigating it to find out

352
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,101
whether it was done to escape
being convicted of tax evasion.

353
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,561
Next breaking news.

354
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:58,064
The prime suspect
of Prosecutor Eun-soo Young's murder

355
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,149
who killed her two weeks ago
and fled to Taiwan

356
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,569
has been caught by Korean police officers
who were sent to Taiwan

357
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,153
and is being transferred at the moment.

358
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,658
I sat right beside him
and kept asking him,

359
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,493
but he strongly denied
Chairman Lee's involvement.

360
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,579
He kept insisting
that he did everything alone.

361
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,039
Damn it.

362
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,167
It'll become harder for us to prove it
if he keeps denying it.

363
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,378
He's certainly not an easy one.

364
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,963
He hasn't said a word about his boss.

365
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,092
You guys must be exhausted.
You should go home get some rest.

366
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,389
Gosh, I wish I could be home
when I open my eyes.

367
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,850
Oh, boy. I miss my son so much,

368
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,145
but he'll ask me to play with him
when I get home, which will exhaust me.

369
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,606
Then tomorrow...
Gosh, kids don't even get tired.

370
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,399
Hey, get up.

371
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,612
Hey, both of you.
Go home, wash up and go to bed.

372
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,823
That won't make my fatigue go away.

373
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,163
I'll say this one last time.

374
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,498
Do you think that

375
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,461
a sane person would get his subordinate
to kill someone?

376
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,506
Why are you guys making all this fuss
over what a crazy man said?

377
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,470
My apologies. So you're saying

378
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,349
that your son-in-law fabricated everything

379
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,850
and that none of it is true.

380
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,144
Of course, none of it.

381
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,357
My wife likes watching dramas.

382
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,485
This is what characters in those dramas
say when their parents don't approve

383
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,778
of the one they want to marry.

384
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,448
"We don't need your approval.
We wanted your blessing."

385
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,826
Right, then they ask their parents to buy
them a house and pay for their wedding.

386
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,164
They say that they don't need
their parents' approval, but in the end...

387
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,874
"Yes."

388
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,753
That one word is what they really need.
This isn't any different.

389
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,422
You're pretending that

390
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,801
you don't need me to admit the charges
because you have firm evidence,

391
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,471
but the fact that you're keeping me here
for this long

392
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,515
must mean that

393
00:32:56,265 --> 00:33:00,645
you guys can only do things
if I admit that I've done wrong.

394
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,564
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

395
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,651
No matter how hard I rack my brain,

396
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,404
I can only think
of the good deeds I've done.

397
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,160
I think I've done enough to help
the prosecution save face.

398
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,333
No one will criticize your investigation
or say that you gave me special treatment.

399
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,969
You've worked hard enough.

400
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,532
Please come with us.

401
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,621
Has it been issued?

402
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,082
-We just got the arrest warrant.
-Good.

403
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,334
Don't you dare touch me.

404
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,049
Si-mok.

405
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,345
If those of us collapse,
this country will collapse as well.

406
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,514
It won't collapse.

407
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,275
Let go!

408
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,031
Good work.

409
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,392
LIEUTENANT HAN

410
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,063
Hello?

411
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,566
Who?

412
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,531
Send her up, please.

413
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,783
Do you think you won this game?

414
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,998
I will destroy you with everything I have.

415
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,750
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

416
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,545
You'll beat your chest,
wishing you hadn't bothered us at all.

417
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,257
Who is "us"?

418
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,219
You and Chairman Lee?

419
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,764
Or you and your husband?

420
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,943
You killed him.

421
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,069
It was in the bag he gave me.

422
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,113
Chang-jun

423
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,950
gave it to you?

424
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,379
The Republic of Korea is collapsing.

425
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,675
Even the senses of security and belief
that most ordinary people would be safe

426
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,719
have collapsed,
and that's where we're at now.

427
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,055
Our society will break down soon.

428
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,474
For 19 long years...

429
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,979
For the last 19 years as a prosecutor,
I watched that hole of destruction growing

430
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,940
at a frightening speed
right before my eyes.

431
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,983
Mr. Prosecutor. Please.

432
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,902
I'm so sorry.
Please let it slide just this once.

433
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,988
Mr. Prosecutor!

434
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,782
-I'm so sorry. Please help me, sir.
-Once, an elderly woman who had been

435
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,867
living on sugar water was dragged to me.

436
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,289
One day, I had to arrest someone
for theft when all he had was nothing

437
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,582
but 3,000 won,
which he made from selling junk.

438
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,669
I arrested people like them during the day

439
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,921
and went to a secret lounge at night.

440
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,593
There, I met people who make hundreds
of billions of won with just a few words,

441
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,764
and I observed them so that they could
escape the net of justice.

442
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,932
CHIEF PROSECUTOR SANG-WOOK BAE

443
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,643
Yes, I completely understand how you feel,

444
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,895
but I have no choice.

445
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,649
It's an order from higher-ups.
Just let him go.

446
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,611
When I wasn't observing them,

447
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,742
I faithfully jotted down and executed
each administration's guideline.

448
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,957
Had our society been moderately corrupt,
I would've ignored it.

449
00:38:55,791 --> 00:39:00,171
I would've enjoyed what I have if that
had been the degree of its rottenness.

450
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,760
But at some point, my body started telling
me that it couldn't take it anymore.

451
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:11,265
I can't keep collecting dust
like an old book sitting on a shelf.

452
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,520
Everything in this bag

453
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,066
must be known as what was taken from me
when I got caught while on the run,

454
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,487
not as belongings of a traitor who stabbed
his father-in-law in the back.

455
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,032
It must be known as what the prosecution
confiscated from me,

456
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,575
a rich tycoon's loyal dog who enjoyed

457
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,036
a comfortable life
until his final moments.

458
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,500
Only then, they will gain irrefutable
efficacy and credibility as evidence.

459
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,640
VOICE RECORDING 001

460
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,600
FATHER, CONGRESSMAN SANG-WOOK BAE

461
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,103
RECORD

462
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,064
The corruption in our society
is no longer just a malaise.

463
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,650
It's killing people.

464
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,445
We're talking at least
dozens or hundreds of lives.

465
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,782
CHAIRMAN OF HANJO GROUP
YUN-BEOM LEE

466
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,724
I should've unsheathed the knife
from the get-go, from the very beginning.

467
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,229
If I don't pull out the knife
even at the last gasp,

468
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,481
the system itself will collapse.

469
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,485
What can restore
the crashed system is neither time

470
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,237
nor money.

471
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,030
Even if something unexpected happens...

472
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,825
Blood is what can reinstate
the destroyed system.

473
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,203
Blood of many people.

474
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,458
I want to say that history proves it all,

475
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,877
but blood sacrifices are still ongoing.

476
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,842
We must change it.

477
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,847
I must find whatever it is that I can do
and turn the tables.

478
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:24,607
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

479
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,652
We've already missed the time
it could've been healed by normal means.

480
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,741
I must not forbear any longer.

481
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,245
I should not wait for someone else
to clean up the filth in my place.

482
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,623
If I wait and stay silent,

483
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,335
this entire country will be
covered in filth in no time.

484
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,671
Now, I ought to open my mouth,

485
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,007
point at those who have done wrong

486
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,678
and reveal the secret behind the curtains
that had been kept closed.

487
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,725
I hope that this is the beginning.

488
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,776
Defendant, you stated
that you admit all of the charges

489
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,988
and that you do not wish to say anything
to defend yourself. Is it true?

490
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,739
Yes, Your Honor.

491
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,741
What is the reason?

492
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,869
I would like to apologize.

493
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,788
To whom?

494
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,419
"Under the name of justice,
we pursue truth

495
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,463
and never compromise
with injustice or any illegal pursuits

496
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,048
as righteous police officers."

497
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,468
I'd like to apologize
to everyone in the police force

498
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:20,806
who'd be working very hard even
at this moment with the Police Charter

499
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,766
engraved in their hearts.

500
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,186
I sincerely apologize.

501
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:31,233
I plead guilty to all of the charges

502
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,901
and deeply regret what I did.

503
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,237
I earnestly hope that those of you

504
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,074
in the force don't forget why you joined
the police and turn out like me.

505
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,912
I will now announce the verdict.

506
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,332
Even though the defendant, Woo-gyun Kim,

507
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,792
was a public official whose duty
was to be a model citizen,

508
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,588
he accepted bribes and bought
sex services from a minor.

509
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,798
His offences deserve a heavy punishment,

510
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,260
but he is repenting
and deeply regretting what he did.

511
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,930
Ergo, the court sentences him
to 42 months in prison.

512
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,485
Chief.

513
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,616
Chief.

514
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:22,868
Thanks, Sergeant Kim.

515
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,996
Su-chan.

516
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,471
Shouldn't that idiot know better by now?

517
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,557
Why is he not letting go
of the rotten rope?

518
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,577
I'll ask you once again.

519
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,374
Who are the other men you met
besides Chief Woo-gyun Kim?

520
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:16,880
Are you not going to answer?

521
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,635
Ms. Kim, you're here
as a perpetrator, not a victim.

522
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,762
You're being investigated
for prostitution.

523
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,141
If you keep this up, you may end up
with more than a fine.

524
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,393
I'm not well yet.

525
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,645
I don't remember anything.

526
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,785
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

527
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,122
You should've told them
that I still don't remember anything.

528
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,248
Are you a bonehead?

529
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:55,127
Stop following me around.
You're embarrassing me. Leave me alone!

530
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,463
Why do you keep taking everything
out on me? Goodness.

531
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,422
Hey.

532
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,757
My gosh, Detective.

533
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,593
-Why are you being like this?
-Look.

534
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,262
See what her arms are doing.

535
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:09,183
Look at what she's doing
even after hearing such rude remarks!

536
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,814
Do you know what your mom went
through while you were at the hospital?

537
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,859
Do you know how much effort the culprit
made to let you live?

538
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,570
-Sorry?
-Had it been someone else,

539
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,780
you would've died in someone's bathroom.

540
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,701
That's how you got your life back.
Do you want to waste it like this?

541
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,289
Do you know how many women
in prostitution end up dead?

542
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,250
There are so many of them
they don't cover the story on the news.

543
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,629
It was God's will
that your life was spared.

544
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,547
Don't you ever forget that.

545
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,260
You should really listen to her.

546
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,096
Why can't you pull yourself together?
And what are you wearing?

547
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,017
For goodness' sake.

548
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,354
That almost made me jump.

549
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,356
Shall I smash your desk for you?

550
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,859
You're back, sir. What happened to Chief?

551
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,655
What do you think? He's been
sentenced to 42 months in prison.

552
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,573
What's the matter though?

553
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,951
Gosh, don't even get me started.

554
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,537
He didn't have an attorney,
and he refused to defend himself.

555
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,958
Watching him admitting everything
and apologizing... Gosh.

556
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,502
At least Chief is repenting what he did.

557
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,924
"At least"? What do you mean by that?

558
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,843
I wonder what Sergeant Kim is up to.

559
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,430
What are you trying to say?
Don't be so cryptic.

560
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,267
Ask yourself what it may mean.

561
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,643
I'm done for the day.

562
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:37,896
Gosh.

563
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,607
That little...

564
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,110
I got a job.

565
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,946
-My comrades, please congratulate me.
-Why is she being like that to me?

566
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,906
I'll get going too.

567
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,450
You should ask yourself for the answer.

568
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,327
Lieutenant Han, wait up.

569
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,041
Good grief.

570
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,627
Oh, boy.

571
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:20,188
SERGEANT KIM

572
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,235
Hey, Sergeant Kim.

573
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,904
How have you been?

574
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,574
Well, I was just wondering.

575
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,829
Hey, let's meet up and have some soju.

576
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:40,125
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

577
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,467
It's not even a small law firm.
It's a big company.

578
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,926
They recruited me.

579
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,180
My experience in the special investigation
team was certainly very helpful.

580
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,306
Congratulations.

581
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,475
Your trip to Taiwan must've been intense.

582
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,811
You'll have to stay up for four nights
to hear about everything that happened.

583
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,939
You got promoted because of it though.
It's great.

584
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,733
You too, Detective Jang.

585
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,109
We really should celebrate.

586
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,944
Gosh, stop. I shouldn't drink anymore.

587
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,488
Are you still taking herbal medicine?

588
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,907
Does it even work?

589
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,700
You look even more fatigued than before.

590
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,410
I should start taking care of myself.

591
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,537
I'll have to wear the uniform
for the ceremony.

592
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,665
I should go get some coffee.

593
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,833
Ceremony, my foot.

594
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,919
-Does anyone want coffee?
-I'd love a latte.

595
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,545
-Me too.
-Same here.

596
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,634
What's going on with Mr. Hwang by the way?

597
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,469
-I couldn't get a hold of him.
-Oh, you're right.

598
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,846
He left work right on time today,
which never happens.

599
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,392
That jerk. He just sent me
a one-word text to congratulate me

600
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,561
-and didn't even answer my call.
-Stop calling him like that, will you?

601
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,273
-We're friends.
-And stop saying that as an excuse.

602
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,734
-Oh, coffee.
-He's just in a good mood.

603
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,781
This coffee is delicious.
Oh, I have to watch the baseball game.

604
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,159
Here.

605
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,536
For the last few months...

606
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,580
-Wait, wasn't that Mr. Hwang?
-What?

607
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,707
Switch the channel. Go back.

608
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,421
Today, we'll be speaking with Prosecutor
Si-mok Hwang from the western office

609
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,716
who's been on the frontline
of the investigation committed

610
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,970
to eradicating corruption,
which started with the Huam-dong murder.

611
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,931
-Hello.
-Hello.

612
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,892
-This is my second time meeting you.
-That's correct.

613
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,896
How are the trials of the politicians
and financial authorities going?

614
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,856
From what I know,

615
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,858
a number of trials have been held so far.

616
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,110
I mainly oversee investigations,

617
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,945
so I'm not directly taking part
in the trials.

618
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,449
You haven't changed at all
from what I remember.

619
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,494
There's something else I remember.
The last time you were here,

620
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,830
you said that you'd catch
the culprit within two months.

621
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,499
-Yes, I did.
-From the killer, Se-won Yoon,

622
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,711
to the mastermind behind him,
the late Chang-jun Lee,

623
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,422
you brought the truth to light
a few days before the promised deadline.

624
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,716
-That's right.
-You kept your promise.

625
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,885
That day, I asked you

626
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,096
to come back on the show
if you ever catch the culprit.

627
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,099
-You kept that promise too. Thank you.
-No problem.

628
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,227
I'm actually here because there is

629
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,606
something I'd like to say.

630
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,940
Sure, please go ahead.

631
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,068
The late Mr. Chang-jun Lee

632
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:17,699
didn't record the conversations
to threaten those who were involved

633
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:21,495
in the corrupt deeds with him
in case they might end up betraying him.

634
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,498
Isn't that what was released
by Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office?

635
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,832
Yes, that is correct.

636
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,794
And you're refuting it now?

637
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,962
This is an old case, but I'm wondering

638
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:34,049
if you remember what happened
at the genetic research lab in Pohang.

639
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,384
One of the employees

640
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,721
disclosed a confidential internal document
after he left the lab.

641
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,808
Even though the document
was very detailed,

642
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,227
none of the executives
whose names were on the document

643
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,354
was punished in any way.

644
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,815
From what I remember, people only
criticized the employee,

645
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,149
calling him a traitor and swindler.

646
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,943
It was because those at the lab

647
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,403
insisted that he embezzled research funds

648
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,949
and that he was lying
in order to conceal it.

649
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,617
They kept brainwashing people like that.

650
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,620
Are you bringing this up

651
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,498
because you think that Mr. Lee's case
is like his?

652
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,583
This was his final wish.

653
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:14,297
"I must be remembered as corporate riches'
spy who was loyal to them until the end."

654
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,259
He said that it will give

655
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,719
more power to what he was leaving behind.

656
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,304
Then, are you saying

657
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,433
that he voluntarily disgraced himself
in order to prove

658
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,061
the corrupt deeds that he had
witnessed and heard about?

659
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,354
That's correct.

660
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,065
When faced with death, all of us hope

661
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,777
that our true intentions would be
understood after we die,

662
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,362
yet he even gave up on that.

663
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,447
Yes.

664
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,408
I knew it.

665
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,535
Mr. Lee was such a righteous person.

666
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,579
I had no idea.

667
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,956
Those of us at the police
spoke ill of him like crazy too.

668
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,499
What you said is making me think

669
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,961
that he could either be viewed
as a criminal or as a righteous man

670
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,338
who sacrificed himself depending
on which aspects are emphasized.

671
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,008
Such dichotomous opinions
may be brought up.

672
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,468
What's your take on it?

673
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,014
He was a monster.

674
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,686
He killed a person.

675
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,689
He probably thought of it
as a small sacrifice for a big cause,

676
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,442
but I personally have never thought

677
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,194
that certain people's lives could be
considered less valuable than others'.

678
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,908
He deluded himself into thinking
that he had the right to punish sinners.

679
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,285
He was a monster created by our time.

680
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:29,456
A police officer once said to me
that people do things because

681
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,874
they can get away with them.

682
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,501
Because they can get away with it
and people will turn a blind eye.

683
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:38,214
She said people do corrupt things
because we turn a blind eye to them

684
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,801
and that we can change it if just
one person keeps his or her eyes open

685
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,219
and barks at them.

686
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,474
That is actually the prosecution's job.

687
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,435
How do you think
the prosecution have done?

688
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,895
We failed.

689
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,484
As an organization whose duty
is to correct injustice,

690
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,818
the prosecution has failed.

691
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,614
We, at the prosecution, applied
the presumption of innocence in a way

692
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,700
that was catered to those
with wealth and power. Moreover,

693
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,537
we protected a criminal,
instead of our citizens.

694
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,541
We failed in carrying out
our most essential duty.

695
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,295
The late Mr. Chang-jun Lee was the outcome
of accumulation of such failure,

696
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,049
and everyone in the prosecution
was his accomplice.

697
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:25,553
I cannot speak on behalf
of all of my colleagues, of course.

698
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:29,891
However, I thought I should apologize
to all citizens through this opportunity.

699
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,144
Those of us in the prosecution

700
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,188
disappointed you.

701
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,319
Nevertheless, I think
that we still have a chance.

702
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,701
"The most powerful weapon
law enforcers can have

703
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,746
is the constitutional law."
Someone once told me that.

704
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,959
We can continue to fight
as long as the constitution exists.

705
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:06,094
The prosecution will no longer
be swayed by those with power.

706
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,929
We'll rise again to fight.

707
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,598
We'll exercise our rights on indictment
accurately.

708
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,767
We'll remember that the people are
essentially

709
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,561
the ones who hold the power to appoint us.

710
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,104
We'll devote ourselves to you.

711
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,939
We'll take responsibility.

712
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,777
We'll strive to become fairer
and more honest.

713
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:27,198
We'll make sure that none of us
will become another monster like him

714
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,534
by doing our very best.

715
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,374
I've been feeling very bad
because my show has been filled

716
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,418
with nothing but disturbing news lately.

717
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,712
I think that

718
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:45,133
you should be able to relax a little bit
this evening after watching this.

719
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,635
Thank you for watching News 60.

720
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,596
Thank you.

721
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,824
I can understand Mr. Yoon though.

722
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,370
What are you talking about?
Anyone who kills a person is a murderer.

723
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:18,958
But his son... He lost his child
who wasn't even 10 years old.

724
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,587
And those pricks were living great lives
as if nothing had happened.

725
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,172
Even so, he can't punish them like that.

726
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,965
Why does the law even exist, then?

727
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,009
Even though prosecution
and police are both rotten,

728
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,638
there are still people like
Prosecutor Hwang, Lieutenant Han and me.

729
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,225
Yes, you're absolutely right.
It's all over now anyway.

730
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,352
Don't fight, guys.

731
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,607
By the way, Mr. Hwang

732
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,944
made another appearance on network
television, looking all handsome.

733
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:49,656
He's definitely going to be promoted
to the division head role this time.

734
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,282
I heard he'll go to the States.

735
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,829
Is Si-mok going to the States?

736
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,084
He was supposed to leave a while ago,

737
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,503
but he couldn't because of what happened.

738
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:07,048
We've arrested most of the people
who should stand trial,

739
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,508
so I guess he'll leave soon.

740
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,263
I heard the chairman of The Bahn Group
is already preparing for an appeal.

741
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,391
Of course. People like them
won't get locked up easily.

742
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,602
He's going to the States.

743
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,357
I wonder how Mr. Yoon is doing.

744
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,944
Why do you care? I'm sure
he's paying for what he did.

745
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,696
Gosh.

746
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,406
You said you don't want to drink more.

747
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,954
Gosh, seriously.

748
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,001
I watched the show.

749
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,550
What brings you here?

750
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:55,930
Si-mok.

751
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,725
Trust me and just give me one chance.

752
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,062
Mr. Lee's last wishes

753
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,524
and what he said to me
in his final moments.

754
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,361
I really want to keep the promise.

755
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,571
You

756
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,116
still

757
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,369
have a chance.

758
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,374
I'll never do anything stupid again.

759
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,085
I swear on my name.

760
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,427
I beg you.

761
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,056
Give me one last chance.

762
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,365
-He's coming!
-Oh, there he is!

763
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,284
Please say a few words.

764
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,037
-How do you feel, sir?
-How do you feel to stand trial?

765
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,331
-Is there anything you'd like to say?
-How do you feel now?

766
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,415
Gosh, don't push me.

767
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,918
-How do you feel?
-Please say a few words.

768
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,340
I'm

769
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,886
not well. I'm ill.

770
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,639
-What's your condition?
-How do you feel?

771
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,433
-Do you have to be hospitalized?
-Is that all you'd like to say?

772
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,935
Is that all you want to say?

773
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,563
-Please say something else.
-Please say a few words.

774
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,773
-Will you go to a hospital?
-Please tell us.

775
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,275
I told you to stop!

776
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,527
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

777
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,071
I'm

778
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,449
really ill.

779
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,034
What exactly is your condition?

780
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,828
What are you waiting for?

781
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,039
-What is your condition, sir?
-Please say a few words.

782
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,874
-Step aside!
-Are you going to a hospital?

783
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,476
Mr. Yoon, the firm I work at
will handle your trial.

784
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,192
He said

785
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,487
he has to meet you.

786
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,962
Did killing my dad

787
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,424
make you feel better?

788
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,555
I heard that you lost your son
due to an accident.

789
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,560
I lost my dad in your hands.

790
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,113
Are you satisfied?

791
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,329
Did you really achieve
everything you wanted?

792
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,030
I'm sorry.

793
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,288
I'm sorry.

794
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,462
I'm really sorry.

795
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:22,905
I'm fine.

796
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,784
Well, thank you so much
for everything you've done for me.

797
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,705
-I'll work hard and take care of Grandma.
-Good.

798
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,875
-Oh, right. I got a job at a golf course.
-Really?

799
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,961
It looks like good things are happening
to both of us.

800
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,629
Congratulations.

801
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,214
Thank you.

802
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,639
I'm glad that things are going well
for all of us.

803
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:54,437
Byung-jun Woo keeps insisting
that he did everything alone,

804
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,732
so we'll need more time to prove
that Chairman Lee instigated the murder.

805
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:02,779
Yun-beom Lee denied instigating
the killing even in the recordings.

806
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,157
Let's deal with the scandal
involving Hanjo's corrupt deeds first.

807
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,408
Got it.

808
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,120
Anyway, I can see
that the end is drawing near.

809
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,665
We've investigated most things
in the documents, right?

810
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:15,917
Yes, sir.

811
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,511
The plan of sending you to the States
has been canceled.

812
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,640
Will I be transferred elsewhere?

813
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,309
Yes, Namhae.

814
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,774
I see. Okay.

815
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:44,111
Mr. Lee was the one who brought us here.

816
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,615
The Public Prosecutor General told me.

817
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:51,244
Those at the Cheongju office wanted to
re-evaluate you as you irked them,

818
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,329
and I had been pushed out
of Criminal Division.

819
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:56,082
Chang-jun Lee was the one who brought
both of us here.

820
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,877
I think he wanted you to take care
of things after he died from the get-go.

821
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,550
"Who would take on this burden?"
I thought about it for a very long time.

822
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,554
I thought he gave me this position
of chief prosecutor to appease me,

823
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,848
but he was actually looking for someone
who would support you.

824
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,852
But... They should be awarding you
for all of your work if anything.

825
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,521
Damn it.

826
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,482
I'm sorry.

827
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:23,359
It's okay.

828
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,570
You have given me support.

829
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,698
Thank you for everything.

830
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:42,128
I think he wanted you to take care
of things after he died from the get-go.

831
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,006
Would you have

832
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,550
done something you'd regret later?

833
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,304
You can do it.

834
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,182
I know that you won't get swayed.

835
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:59,520
You'll chase them until the end
in an unflinching manner.

836
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:05,318
"Who would take on this burden?"

837
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,069
I thought about it for a very long time.

838
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,740
Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang.

839
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,411
You were the only answer.

840
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,668
-Si-mok.
-It's Si-mok Hwang.

841
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,170
For a better future.

842
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,756
You can't make me stand here.

843
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,634
Absolutely not. I will never

844
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,638
stand before you as a defendant.

845
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:37,808
Chang-jun?

846
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,603
I like being called that way.

847
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,658
Slow down.

848
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,098
What's the matter?

849
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,100
What is it?

850
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,811
-Did you get a boyfriend or what?
-Sorry?

851
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,229
Congratulations.

852
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,149
Bring him here. We should meet him
to make sure that he's a nice guy.

853
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,526
What are you guys talking about?

854
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:30,861
Ta-da!

855
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,921
Who sent it? Who is it?

856
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:52,925
Congratulations. Jung-bon.

857
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,554
I didn't know Jung-bon would
hit on you like this.

858
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,848
Don't be ridiculous.
He must've sent it as an ex-colleague.

859
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,474
We're just friends, okay?

860
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:04,603
I'm getting promoted too. Where's mine
then? He's obviously making a move.

861
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,190
You should open the present first.

862
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,120
-Wow.
-Wow.

863
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:24,123
Why is this so red?

864
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,500
-Is this food or lipstick?
-Gosh, stop it.

865
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,841
Why did he buy this for me?
I don't even wear lipstick.

866
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,469
Hey, get back to work.

867
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,096
-You'll put it on like this.
-Go. Get your work done.

868
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,974
It's only morning,
yet you guys are already so distracting.

869
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,229
What's wrong with them?
They're being so silly.

870
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:16,425
God.

871
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,136
It's so pretty. I like it.

872
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,604
Mr. Hwang will be transferred
to Namhae County.

873
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,022
What?

874
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,319
Enjoy.

875
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,911
Wow.

876
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,455
You know how to enjoy a drink alone now.

877
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:48,457
Look at you all grown up.

878
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:49,917
Why are you late?

879
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:56,215
Keep being inflexible like that,
and you'll be all alone in Namhae.

880
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,637
Anyway, it's so sudden.
What are you going to do with your house?

881
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,015
I'm going to lease it out.

882
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,395
Ten million won.

883
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,648
Rent it to me, okay?

884
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,571
I listed it for 350 million won.

885
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:23,576
You don't come across like that,

886
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,828
but I guess you're greedy for money.

887
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,290
Oh, well.

888
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:31,667
Come to my place if you have nowhere
to sleep when you come back.

889
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,962
I'll let you sleep on my porch.

890
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:36,213
All right.

891
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,549
The cold wind might freeze
your face though.

892
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,384
Okay.

893
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,139
Here. Congratulations on your promotion.

894
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,016
Gosh, it's not that big of a deal.

895
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,477
By the way, the promotion ceremony

896
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,354
will be held tomorrow morning.

897
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,148
So what?

898
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,483
You said you'll leave tomorrow morning.

899
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,277
What about it?

900
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,615
Forget it.

901
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,755
How's work going?
Did you get everything done?

902
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:23,219
Yes. There's Dong-jae, but I'll leave that
up to Mr. Kang's discretion.

903
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:25,679
Why aren't you arresting him?

904
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,431
He's done enough to be arrested.

905
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,934
She kept begging me to trust her,

906
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,520
but I chose not to trust her
until the end.

907
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,648
I'm talking about Eun-soo.

908
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,900
So you want to trust him?

909
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,111
Him out of all people?

910
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,366
I'll observe him.

911
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,341
Ta-da.

912
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,594
Gosh, it's...

913
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,471
What on earth is this?

914
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,556
This looks nothing like me.

915
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,647
You should look at it
and practice smiling.

916
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:18,107
It's a gift.

917
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,192
By the way,

918
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,028
why are they sending you to Namhae?

919
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,615
The high-ranking officials
and Chairman Lee have been arrested,

920
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,200
but things won't stay like this for long.

921
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:32,579
I bet they'll be released soon
by special pardons.

922
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,707
I guess it's a preparatory measure.

923
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:45,801
Goodbye.

924
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,137
I won't be able to see you off.

925
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,265
Good luck in your new position.

926
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:52,933
Sorry I can't attend the ceremony.

927
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,157
Wait, did you just order one?

928
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:11,201
How could you?

929
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,288
Gosh, you haven't changed one bit.

930
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:18,000
We had to water it down last time
because it was too salty.

931
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,253
You told me to get ramen instead.

932
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,380
It's under a new owner now.

933
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:26,175
Is that why you ordered it?
So how does it taste?

934
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,384
Is it not salty?

935
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,219
What happened to your lips?

936
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:31,221
Oh, this.

937
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:33,640
Why? Do I look pretty?

938
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,392
-It looks weird.
-What?

939
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:40,397
Lieutenant Yeo-jin Han
and Sergeant Geon Jang.

940
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:45,903
SPECIAL PROMOTION CEREMONY
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

941
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:55,746
"Lieutenant Yeo-jin Han made
great contributions

942
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:59,041
to solving the Huam-dong murder case
as well as to arresting

943
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:00,876
and transferring the culprit
of a serious crime.

944
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,838
Along with this recognition, she will
also be promoted one rank up."

945
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,895
Sergeant Geon Jang. The same as above.

946
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,070
Attention. Salute!

947
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,552
We'll see you soon, right?

948
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:55,305
It's a small world, you know.

949
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,224
Take good care of yourself.

950
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,518
Please don't skip meals.

951
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,772
-Thank you both for everything.
-We should thank you.

952
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:05,441
Thank you.

953
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,568
-You should go in.
-Okay.

954
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,027
-Bye.
-Bye.

955
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,447
Drive safely.

956
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,699
Please drive carefully.

957
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,394
Who do you think will come?

958
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,313
Who knows?

959
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,691
Come in.

960
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,743
-Where's Si-mok?
-Mr. Hwang just left.

961
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,620
Already? I guess I came too late.

962
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,247
-Well...
-I told you. He's not in his office.

963
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,459
Oh, this is my office now.

964
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,544
-What?
-Sorry?

965
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,213
Let's be a good team.

966
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,422
-Pardon?
-Hold on.

967
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,008
Wait, are you saying... Well...

968
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,570
This is Prosecutor Dong-jae Seo
of Division Three.

969
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,155
Prosecutor Dong-jae Seo?

970
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,575
I beg your pardon? Me?

971
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,120
Hold on a second, please.

972
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,769
Yes, sir.

973
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:09,898
I didn't expect
to receive a call from you.

974
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,567
Yes, I know. Of course.

975
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,111
The problem? Everything has been resolved.

976
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,863
Have you forgotten who I am?
I'm the prosecutor, Dong-jae Seo.

977
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,034
Of course. Totally.

978
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,537
When? I'd love that.

979
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,750
CHANG-JUN LEE RESTS HERE.

980
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,814
When I had soju at a tent bar

981
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,735
for the very first time,
you were there with me.

982
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,614
Why didn't you tell me?

983
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,201
You should've told me.

984
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:12,127
You made me feel so safe. What are you
doing there now, buried underground?

985
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:15,505
Are you

986
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,342
in peace there?

987
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,310
I'm sorry.

988
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,440
I'm sorry, honey.

989
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,100
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF HANJO GROUP
YEON-JAE LEE

990
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:20,987
Please let Mr. Chairman know that we're
working on getting his arrest suspended.

991
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:28,829
10 MONTHS LATER

992
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,082
Rain is expected to start
from the southern regions on Saturday

993
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:35,127
and to spread into the most parts of
the country. Have a great day, everyone.

994
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:39,965
Next song is "Camellia Lady" by Mi-ja Lee.

995
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,708
Prosecution, what is this about?

996
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,503
What a toxic, crude melody,
don't you think?

997
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,839
That's probably why the song got banned.

998
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:26,219
This song, "Camellia Lady,"
was banned in 1968

999
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,972
for Japanese influence
shown throughout the song.

1000
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,976
You may not believe it,
but that was before I was born.

1001
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:38,064
My deceased father used to like
the song a lot when he was alive.

1002
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,817
Hence, I always had this question.

1003
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:43,653
Which parts show the Japanese influence?

1004
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:47,991
What about this song is toxic?

1005
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,086
"Is this land still a good place to live?

1006
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:03,548
Is this land still beautiful?

1007
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,301
No, it's a lie.

1008
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,763
Every day, we have to pretend
that we don't know,

1009
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,599
quietly listen to lies

1010
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,977
and endure whipping that sends
pulsating pain down to the bones

1011
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:19,397
because we're servants, slaves
and puppets.

1012
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:25,111
How humiliating and mortifying."

1013
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:31,368
Had this been 31 years ago,
what I just did would've been seen

1014
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,537
as insulting the nation
and causing public harm.

1015
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,040
Now that 31 years have passed,

1016
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,042
I don't have to hesitate to deliver

1017
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:43,505
what the poet really wanted to convey,
and it makes me happy.

1018
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:46,424
However,

1019
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,261
the old poet had to give up

1020
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:53,139
his humble wish of wanting to go back

1021
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,850
to teaching Korean at the school.

1022
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,186
I would like to ask you all what you think

1023
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:00,647
a true reinstatement means.

1024
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,567
Last but not least,

1025
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,861
to the poet who was told

1026
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,823
he's not allowed to return to the school
even though he could be reinstated,

1027
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,828
I'd like to apologize as his contemporary
who has a lot to learn

1028
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,081
from his experiences,

1029
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:22,168
and I'd also like to thank him.

1030
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,386
I'd love to assist him.

1031
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,221
Isn't he so cool?

1032
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,208
Today's noon news.

1033
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,086
While the opposition party has been
strongly criticizing

1034
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,255
Prime Minister Chang-sik Kim
for abusing his power,

1035
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,175
Prime Minister Kim has been
denying all the allegations

1036
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:14,346
saying that he is being targeted,
which is becoming a heated debate.

1037
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:38,244
Yes, this is Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang
of Criminal Division Two...

1038
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,704
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

1039
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:40,956
Mr. Kang.

1040
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,791
Have you already made yourself
at home there?

1041
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,459
That won't be good.

1042
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,503
What are you calling about?

1043
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,590
There will be a special investigation
on Prime Minster Kim's power abuse case.

1044
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:54,386
Members of Congress chose you unanimously
for the special investigation team.

1045
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:56,763
I see.

1046
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,683
You're not even surprised.
You have to be here in two days.

1047
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,227
And when you're here,

1048
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:04,104
you have to do something about Dong-jae.

1049
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:06,064
What did he do?

1050
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,942
He's still the same.
He hasn't changed one bit.

1051
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:14,948
Okay. I won't be late.

1052
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:16,449
Sure.

1053
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,857
ALL EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

1054
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,869
STRANGER

1055
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:49,936
One, two, three.

1056
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,032
