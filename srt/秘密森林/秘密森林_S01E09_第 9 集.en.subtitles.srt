1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,303
STRANGER

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,890
As of 10 a.m. today,
our office will launch

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,725
a special investigation
to thoroughly investigate

5
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,810
the suspicions surrounding
prosecutors and corruption.

6
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,606
I will assign it to a prosecutor
who will investigate everyone fairly

7
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,316
regardless of their positions.

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,070
The prosecutor in charge

9
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,031
is Si-mok Hwang of Division Three.

10
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,215
Moreover,

11
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,759
I regret that the organization

12
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,304
under my leadership has been the source
of a series of mishaps and scandals.

13
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,264
Hence, I will take responsibility

14
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,767
by resigning from my position.

15
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,323
This organization
has been everything to me,

16
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,784
but I'm not indispensable here.

17
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,037
My departure from the organization
should not affect you.

18
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,707
You must carry out your tasks thoroughly
to make sure that no one questions

19
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,085
the results of the investigation
and the trial.

20
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,297
You haven't even had
your inauguration ceremony yet.

21
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,269
Do you take the post that lightly?

22
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,857
If you want to take responsibility,
do it in your position.

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,525
If you want to apologize,

24
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,653
do it as the Chief Prosecutor.

25
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,199
Is our office where people can come
and go as they wish?

26
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,337
Does my authority
as the prosecutor in charge

27
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,298
begin right away?

28
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,462
Officially, it begins upon receiving
a letter of appointment, but yes.

29
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,963
The job begins right away.

30
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,884
You'll have an office
at the central district office.

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,011
Get a team together first.

32
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,768
SENIOR ASSISTING OFFICER KIM

33
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,940
I need full information
on Mr. Seo's assets and properties.

34
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,568
I'll get a warrant issued immediately
so that he can't destroy any evidence.

35
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,528
Anyone else?

36
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,908
Anyone else you want to dig up
dirt on as if you've been waiting for it?

37
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,160
Not yet.

38
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,789
The Public Prosecutor General will decide
when you'll be appointed officially.

39
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,379
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,357
Mr. Hwang. He said
you're starting right away, right?

41
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,858
You'll be so busy.

42
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,610
What should I start with?

43
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,988
Don't do anything.

44
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,656
Okay.

45
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,520
Why are you doing this?

46
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,605
-Please get started.
-Yes, sir.

47
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,030
Mr. Seo!

48
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,691
Do you want to die?

49
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,777
How dare you try to trick me?

50
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,881
What are you all looking at?

51
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,269
I can't believe the first thing he does
is try to evade responsibility.

52
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,105
I saw them searching Dong-jae's office.

53
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,482
Already?

54
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,194
Does the Public Prosecutor General
know Si-mok?

55
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,863
How did he get assigned
to the special investigation?

56
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,615
There is no way he knows Si-mok.

57
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,367
He was probably recommended.

58
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,911
Mr. Lee must have given recommendations.

59
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,248
He wouldn't have recommended him unless
he wanted to turn this place upside down.

60
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,500
That's why he has washed his hands
of the whole thing.

61
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,504
"You all sort it out amongst yourselves.
I'm leaving." Wasn't it so?

62
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,596
LIST OF REQUESTED INVESTIGATORS
RECIPIENT: YONGSAN POLICE STATION

63
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,433
CHIEF PROSECUTOR

64
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,521
I regret that the organization

65
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,899
under my leadership has been the source
of a series of mishaps and scandals.

66
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,611
Hence, I will take responsibility
by resigning from my position.

67
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,743
Are you inside?

68
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,872
-Are you in there?
-Are you inside?

69
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,047
Do you all have that much time
on your hands?

70
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,741
I got that, and I packed that too.

71
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,244
I didn't forget anything, right?

72
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,331
I'm not sure what else we'll need
as it's my first special investigation.

73
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,960
What's going on? What's he doing?

74
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,044
Sir!

75
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
Mr. Hwang.

76
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,674
What's happening now?

77
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,970
Yes, this is
Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang's office.

78
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,931
Great, thank you.

79
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,437
Mr. Hwang, everything is ready
at the central district office.

80
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,359
-Let's go.
-Okay.

81
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,652
Pass me my jacket.

82
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,134
ASSISTANT CHIEF BYUNG-HO PARK
OF DIVISION TWO

83
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,262
Let's do it. Get in touch with me anytime
if there is anything you want to ask.

84
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,522
ONE NEW MESSAGE

85
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,901
CRIMINAL TRIAL DEPT. MIN-WOO CHOI
YOU RECEIVED A GIFT

86
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,653
You'll be pulling all-nighters
on behalf of us.

87
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,191
Chief Prosecutor of Western Seoul
Prosecutors' Office Suddenly Resigns

88
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,068
Goodness.

89
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,241
Chief, we received a request
from the prosecution.

90
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,743
What do they want now?

91
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,375
They want us to send investigators?

92
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,585
What?

93
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,545
Do they want this one too?

94
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,463
I know, right?

95
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,133
Shall I talk to her and discover
what they're trying to do?

96
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,680
There is no need.

97
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,849
Tell them we'll gladly cooperate.

98
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,267
Okay.

99
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,478
Yes, sir.

100
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,584
You're the first one to arrive.

101
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,502
-You're here.
-Yes.

102
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,212
It's okay.

103
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,342
Lieutenant, it's here.

104
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,681
Hello.

105
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,271
I'm Geon Jang from the investigation team
at Yongsan Police Station.

106
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,440
-Nice to meet you all.
-Let's save it for later.

107
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,651
Who else is coming?

108
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,236
Mr. Hwang.

109
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,156
Hello.

110
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,867
-Hello.
-Goodness, what a surprise.

111
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,752
What's the matter?

112
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:39,383
It looks like everyone is here now.
Let's introduce ourselves first.

113
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,302
I'm Si-mok Hwang.

114
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,055
This is Investigator Ho-seob Kim.

115
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,348
It's nice to meet you all.

116
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,726
I've been assisting Mr. Hwang
for two years.

117
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,231
Come on. I'm giving it to you
because I know how hard you work.

118
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,817
This is Assisting Officer Young Choi.

119
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm happy to meet you all.

120
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,155
Mr. Se-won Yoon from Case Management
at Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

121
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,364
It's nice to meet you all.

122
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,078
He came to my husband's company to talk,
saying he's your colleague.

123
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,414
And he already knew
about the surgery you had.

124
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,751
Have you been talking about that
to other people?

125
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,878
And...

126
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,463
Mr. Jung-bon Kim.

127
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,924
Jung-bon Kim?

128
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,093
I worked as a legal office manager
for a long time and...

129
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,639
Anyway, I'm honored to be here.
I look forward to working with you all.

130
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,309
I think it's strange that I keep running
into him since the trial.

131
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,436
It can be a coincidence, but it's too odd.

132
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,897
Would you be able to look into it?

133
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,776
They say, "Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

134
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,405
Lieutenant Yeo-jin Han from Yongsan
Police Station's investigation team.

135
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,866
Hello, I'll do my best to ensure
a successful investigation.

136
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,497
Detective Geon Jang is from the same team.

137
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,416
Hello, everyone. I'll do my very best.

138
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,751
I look forward to working with you.

139
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,006
What's the matter?

140
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,024
When did "financially-sponsored
prosecutor" become a common term?

141
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,777
As far as I remember, it was back
when a businessman in Busan

142
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,613
reported about 100 prosecutors
whom he bribed to the police.

143
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,784
That's right. Then how is this case
different from that one?

144
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,371
Back then, the briber was alive.

145
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,582
In this case, Moo-sung Park is dead.

146
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,208
That's correct.

147
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,794
Even though the briber himself

148
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,630
reported about 100 prosecutors
to the police,

149
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,842
the case closed with only one of them
being advised to resign.

150
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,304
In our case, the person who holds the key,
Moo-sung Park, is dead.

151
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,349
If you think this special investigation
will be a waste of time,

152
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,393
you may leave now.

153
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,694
This is Dong-jae Seo, the prosecutor
who helped Moo-sung Park,

154
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,697
who was the CEO of Sanghwa Construction
at the time, get cleared of his charges

155
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,157
for a DUI hit-and-run in 2013.

156
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,742
He...

157
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,661
is the starting point.

158
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,250
Mr. Kim, what I'm saying is

159
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,587
Kyung-wan Park had them even when
we were interrogating him that afternoon.

160
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,213
Those bruises. Yes.

161
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,133
I asked the police officers about it
right away.

162
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,844
They said he caused a total ruckus
when he was being arrested.

163
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,764
That's what I'm saying.

164
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,142
He resisted and went crazy
because he didn't want to be cuffed.

165
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,770
How can he publicly announce
that he was beaten up

166
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,690
by the police a day
after he got those bruises himself?

167
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,444
-I couldn't believe it. I was speechless.
-The date.

168
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,112
-It's obviously a lie.
-The changed date.

169
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,367
Why did he lie about the date
if he really was abused?

170
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,203
Mr. Seo.

171
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,206
I just heard that your arrest warrant
has been rejected.

172
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,167
Yes, that's right.

173
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,877
Exactly.

174
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,630
That is a fact.

175
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,429
Hello?

176
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,140
I've been listening to
what Mr. Lee was saying.

177
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,811
Me? I'm Prosecutor Dong-jae Seo.

178
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,193
I didn't get a heads-up either.

179
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,279
I think Prosecutor Seo went ahead
and tipped them off.

180
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,449
He definitely should have
consulted with us first.

181
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,744
He beat us because he was scared we might
get furious and take him down with us.

182
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,541
He'll be doomed for good
if people discover that he had her phone.

183
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,962
He knew that I'd say no
even if he tries to negotiate.

184
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,088
Goodness, that scum.

185
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:51,010
Frankly, that's the only way out for us.

186
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,721
There's no reason for us to say no.
Why are you against it?

187
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,016
He'll be the first one to get cuffed
when the special investigation begins.

188
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,895
But we can't really refute his claim.

189
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,027
It'd be better for us
if he doesn't get caught.

190
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,892
Lieutenant.

191
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,227
It's Mapo Police Station.

192
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,605
They were in charge
of Moo-sung Park's hit-and-run case.

193
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,981
Okay.

194
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,777
DUI HIT-AND-RUN CASE REPORT

195
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,361
CASE REPORT

196
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,863
MOO-SUNG PARK, DUI HIT-AND-RUN

197
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,781
TRAFFIC DIVISION

198
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,998
Moo-sung Park used to frequent
this place to entertain his guests.

199
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,166
Thank you.

200
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,628
CASE REPORT
ON CHEONGDAM-DONG LOUNGE ASSAULT

201
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,098
His name is Tae-gyun Kim.
He used to deliver cash for Moo-sung Park.

202
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,183
Get him!

203
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,684
You prick.

204
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,646
What should I work on?

205
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,025
You can prepare our statement
for the press conference tomorrow.

206
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,318
That's what you want me to do?

207
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,779
Does that mean you want me
to be the team's spokesman?

208
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,783
Mr. Hwang, the arrest warrant
for Mr. Seo has been rejected.

209
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,160
"Since he is willing to provide
explanations

210
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,537
for the crimes he is charged with,

211
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,123
it is hard to acknowledge the necessity
to take him into custody."

212
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,666
Goodness, they always say that.

213
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,668
It's like they copy and paste it
all the time.

214
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,922
This has Park's bank account history
from the last four years.

215
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,507
Gosh. Four years.

216
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,925
Let's work hard.

217
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,718
-Okay.
-Thank you.

218
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,178
-I'll see you all later.
-Bye.

219
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,189
Mr. Lee.

220
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,192
I see all of you are working hard.

221
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,653
I'm Geon Jang from Yongsan Police Station.

222
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,988
It's nice to meet you.

223
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,323
Yes, of course.

224
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,829
I'm Yeo-jin Han.

225
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,372
I've heard a lot about you.

226
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,004
I see. I hope they were good things.

227
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,637
I'm Jung-bon Kim. It's an honor to meet
you in person, Mr. Chief Prosecutor.

228
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,348
Jung-bon Kim?

229
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,979
The civil righter who exposed Kyung-wan
Park getting abused by the police?

230
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,740
I wasn't expecting much,

231
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,367
but no one will be able to doubt
the fairness of your investigation.

232
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,994
What a great move.

233
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,788
That's why you want me
to be the team's spokesman.

234
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,248
I'll be the face of the team.

235
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,760
Let's go see Mr. Prosecutor General.

236
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,431
-Yes, sir.
-Roll your sleeves back down.

237
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:50,958
See you later.

238
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
I hope the meeting goes well.

239
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,054
Do you and Mr. Hwang
personally know each other?

240
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,473
Goodness, my mouth.
I shouldn't have said anything.

241
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,183
We should get going too.

242
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,810
-Okay. See you.
-See you later.

243
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,311
-See you.
-See you in a little.

244
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,354
Bye.

245
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,316
KYUNG-WAN PARK

246
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,694
Lieutenant.

247
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,029
You knew about that guy,
Jung-bon Kim, didn't you?

248
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,906
He's the one who screwed us over.

249
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,117
Yes, I'll leave right away, Kyung-wan.

250
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,119
Okay. For now, just don't say anything.

251
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,120
Did something happen?

252
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,747
That was Kyung-wan.

253
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,624
He's being accused
of fabricating the whole story.

254
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,167
Do you mean the police?

255
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,711
My team at Yongsan Police Station?

256
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,921
They're basically saying
that Kyung-wan is a liar.

257
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,339
I have to go there first.

258
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,259
I'm aware you're not pleased
about the situation. I'm sorry.

259
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,594
-Well, it's...
-Hey, Kyung-wan.

260
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,055
-I was just... What did I...
-I'm leaving now.

261
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,101
Do you still think they screwed us over,
or is it the other way around?

262
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,357
Why is she getting mad at me?
I didn't do anything.

263
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,319
What did I do wrong?
They started it first.

264
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,037
How long have you known the civil righter?

265
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,331
We went to middle school together.

266
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,254
I heard about the court dismissing
the arrest warrant for Mr. Seo.

267
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,508
He'll get arrested
if your team delivers results.

268
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,730
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

269
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,278
Thank you, sir.

270
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,864
No, you should resent me.

271
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,285
I gave you a knife so that you can slay
your colleagues.

272
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,205
Mr. Hwang.

273
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,458
Do you know why you're here now?

274
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,002
I don't know why it has to be me,

275
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,755
but I do know what I have to do.

276
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,094
Right. I heard you're not married yet.

277
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,141
What do you think of him as your
future son-in-law? Isn't he so reliable?

278
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:17,062
Do you not love his job?

279
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,649
Most people think that the words,

280
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,193
"prosecutor" and "doctor,"
share the same Chinese character.

281
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,237
The character in "doctor" means "teacher,"

282
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,447
and the one in "attorney" means "scholar."

283
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,117
However, the one in "prosecutor"
means "work."

284
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,079
It made me wonder if we prosecutors
are thought to be inhumane,

285
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,749
but I heard that the character for "work"
embodies a person holding a flag high.

286
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,793
That's what we ought to strive for,
Mr. Hwang.

287
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,170
Someone who shows the way forward.

288
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,506
Someone who can lead others by example.

289
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,718
Show everyone that is how we actually are.

290
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,845
Yes, sir.

291
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,681
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

292
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,601
This won't solve anything.

293
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,478
I apologize, sir.

294
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,983
All right. Get started.

295
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,460
I wanted to get you set up before I leave.

296
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,171
I see.

297
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,797
Let's have dinner together.

298
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,132
I can't, sir. I need to get back.

299
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,051
No one will be there.
All of them must've left by now.

300
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,219
Pardon me?

301
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,889
It's just one meal. Relax.

302
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,107
Thank you.

303
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,993
I guess it's a small team.

304
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,788
Not having too many people on the team
must be better for teamwork.

305
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,292
Yes, it is.

306
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,130
I've never seen
a female homicide detective before.

307
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,466
How are you liking it?
Are they good to you?

308
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,971
There's no reason for them
to give me special treatment.

309
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,806
They treat me the same.

310
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,518
I see. Good for you.

311
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,190
That must be them.

312
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,531
-I guess the traffic wasn't bad.
-No.

313
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,247
I'm Si-mok Hwang.

314
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,290
Gosh.

315
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,169
You look much more handsome in person.
You look very young too. Aren't I right?

316
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,258
Please have a seat.

317
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,592
You too, honey.

318
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,411
I bought our flight tickets.

319
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,289
Let's go see Soo-jung as soon as
you finish tying up loose ends.

320
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,999
She won't even be happy to see us.

321
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,293
She's no longer our little girl.

322
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,462
Are you all married?

323
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,299
What about children?
Do all of you have children?

324
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,309
I have a three-year-old.

325
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,686
It's a boy.

326
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,565
That's when children are at their cutest.
Spend as much time as possible with him.

327
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,816
Yes. He's so adorable,

328
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,901
but I can't go home often.

329
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,279
It must be because of the investigation.

330
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,156
It looks like you've already
started working on it.

331
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:57,907
No, not yet.

332
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,789
What about you, Mr. Hwang?
Are you seeing anyone?

333
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,334
Pardon me?

334
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,086
I guess you're not.

335
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,715
Shall I set you up with someone?
I know many pretty ladies.

336
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,092
-Are you okay with that?
-Pardon?

337
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,013
I like pretty women too.

338
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,265
What do you mean by that?

339
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,353
They say that women are
their own worst enemies.

340
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,192
Women who agree with that saying
must have been

341
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,236
treating other women as their enemies,
don't you think?

342
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,427
Is it you, Dad?

343
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,892
You're home.

344
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,273
They're Chang-jun's colleagues.
We wanted to have dinner with them.

345
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,484
Hello.

346
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,032
You're more handsome in person
than on television.

347
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,024
All right. This looks
like The Last Supper.

348
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,736
-Sir, please join us...
-Hey.

349
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,703
Well...

350
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,039
We'll get going.

351
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,251
We're not done here.

352
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,672
It looks like everyone is done.

353
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,716
Apologies for the trouble.

354
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,552
If you know that,

355
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,264
-how can you be this rude to...
-It's okay.

356
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,852
Goodbye.

357
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,499
Chuck everything in the garbage.

358
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,335
He's like that. Just ignore it.

359
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,339
There's only a thin line between
a prosecutor and a chief prosecutor.

360
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,258
It wasn't a total waste of time though.

361
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,178
Now, I know that team is nothing special.

362
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,156
I did eat some food,
but I can't really say that I had dinner.

363
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,827
How about we go for some drinks
and something warm?

364
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,954
-That sounds great.
-I'll see you all tomorrow.

365
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,541
-Mr. Hwang.
-Have a good night.

366
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,128
Does he ever age or what?
He hasn't changed one bit.

367
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,380
Be respectful, will you?

368
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,466
But we are hungry.
So, let's go for some food.

369
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,592
-Let's go eat.
-Let's go.

370
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,427
Goodness, I'm craving soup.

371
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,389
What do you feel like eating?

372
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,975
Shall we go for sizzling hot soup
or something that's more like stew?

373
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,270
Well, what's happening with Kyung-wan?

374
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,980
It has turned into a big mess.

375
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,567
Even the human rights commission
is saying there's no way to refute it.

376
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,320
Is there anyone else who can prove it
by any chance?

377
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,868
It looks like you and Mr. Hwang
go a long way back.

378
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,204
Yes, time flies. We've known
each other for 20 years now.

379
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,875
Gosh, how did you put up
with his personality for two decades?

380
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,877
I can't say it's been two full decades.
There was...

381
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,676
JUNG-BON KIM

382
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,113
SI-MOK HWANG

383
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,080
Well, about Mr. Yoon...

384
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,625
Is there a problem in his family?
Are they having trouble conceiving?

385
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,378
Right, I was wondering the same thing
when she asked him if he has any children.

386
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,088
That's not it.

387
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,549
His kid died.

388
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,551
-Sorry?
-Pardon?

389
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,221
How did it happen?

390
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,848
A car accident.

391
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,934
On the way home from a field trip.

392
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,393
Goodness.

393
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,145
When was it?

394
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,064
Was it about two years ago?

395
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,443
He took a long leave of absence
after that.

396
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,736
He returned to work recently.

397
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,279
Gosh.

398
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,907
That place looks pretty good.
Let's just go there. It's the closest.

399
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,492
-Okay, let's do that.
-Sounds good.

400
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,703
-I love pollack.
-Me too.

401
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,016
RECEIVING

402
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,956
HANJO GROUP

403
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,709
Sponsor

404
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,287
Went to Yangkang High School together
October 27, 2016

405
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,581
Ga-young Kim, witness

406
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,750
Who would've been scared
of Ga-young Kim giving statements?

407
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,918
Moo-sung Park, victim
Sponsored the police and prosecutors

408
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,387
Associated with the Il-jae Young case

409
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,513
Chang-jun Lee, Dong-jae Seo

410
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,101
Yun-beom Lee, HANJO GROUP

411
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,880
What are you doing here?

412
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,049
Put that down.

413
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,306
Get out.

414
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,483
Why can't I be part
of the special investigation team?

415
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,986
Why do you have to be part of it?

416
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,822
Because I really want to work on the case.
I'll do my best.

417
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,033
I know that you'll work harder
than anyone else will.

418
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,162
I also know that you'll do your very best
to take down Mr. Lee.

419
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,831
I'm not trying to frame him
for something he didn't do.

420
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,249
You said yourself

421
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,377
that Moo-sung Park sent
an underage girl to Mr. Lee.

422
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,504
That sure counts as bribery.

423
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,095
Do you think we're here
to help you get your revenge?

424
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,056
Get out.

425
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,810
I knew you'd be here.

426
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,108
Gosh, I think I forgot something.
I should...

427
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,240
Ms. Young.

428
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,961
-Give it to me. I'll take it.
-All right.

429
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,276
I'll put in some rinds
as well as some fried chicken.

430
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,861
Nothing beats bossam
as a drink accompaniment.

431
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,488
Gosh.

432
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,742
You should take a quick break
and have some of this, Mr. Hwang.

433
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,577
-Goodness.
-It's bossam.

434
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,996
Thank you.

435
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,664
Your sweater fell on the floor.

436
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,410
It's been a long day
even though it was only our first day.

437
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,329
-Good work, everyone.
-Great job.

438
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,540
Mr. Yoon, how's your hand?

439
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,084
-Sorry? It's...
-You said you served in the Marine Corps.

440
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,170
Don't they say marines can
even beat ghosts?

441
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,297
Ghosts don't use cell phones.

442
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,798
I'll be sure to catch him next time.

443
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,344
About the restaurant Moo-sung Park used
to frequent to entertain his guests...

444
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,096
I heard they got audited out of the blue.

445
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,015
Collection officers came by at night

446
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,684
and counted the empty liquor boxes
put outside of the restaurant.

447
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,019
They turned the place upside down,

448
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,688
asking why the reported numbers
don't match that of the empty boxes.

449
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,981
Could it have been a coincidence?

450
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,443
The witness of the hit-and-run accident
changed the statement in a day

451
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,321
after saying Moo-sung Park was the driver.

452
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,822
I'm going to meet the witness tomorrow.

453
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,201
-By the way...
-Yes, Mr. Kim. What is it?

454
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,662
Mr. Lee's wife completely looks
like a beauty pageant queen.

455
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,581
-Goodness.
-Goodness, seriously.

456
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,500
I know, right? She's also
from a filthy rich family.

457
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,668
Yes, it means he has to see
Yun-beom Lee every day at home.

458
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,589
Will Mr. Lee start working for Hanjo Group
after leaving the prosecution?

459
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,840
It's owned by his wife's family.

460
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,302
He'll obviously go that route
for that reason.

461
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,221
He'll get a sweet position
using his connections.

462
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,348
I didn't think he'd do such a thing.

463
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,059
Well, it looks like he has some assets
under someone else's name.

464
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,772
It's the chief of Division One.

465
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,532
-What are you working on?
-Why...

466
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,369
-It's my task.
-Gosh.

467
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:17,039
Why are you being so shy?
Read it aloud for us as practice.

468
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,500
It looks short,
but it's actually very long.

469
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,050
"April 21, 2017.

470
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,720
I'll begin the first briefing
of the special investigation team

471
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,389
whose goal is to reveal the truth

472
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,058
about the bribery case
involving prosecutors.

473
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:41,522
First, we will summon Prosecutor Seo
from Western Seoul..."

474
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,940
No.

475
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,358
Don't specify anyone.

476
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,111
-Just say we're preparing for it.
-Okay.

477
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:52,283
Detective Jang, we have to interview
the referential witness tomorrow.

478
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,201
Please bring her on time.

479
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,620
Sure, no problem. By the way,

480
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,498
I don't have her address yet.

481
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,125
That information

482
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,627
will be given to you tomorrow morning.

483
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,628
All right.

484
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,099
"We're keeping all possibilities open

485
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,561
to uncover the constituents
of the crime as quickly as possible.

486
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,690
We'll let nothing get in our way to ensure
a thorough investigation of the case.

487
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:29,987
Last but not least, we would like
to express our heartfelt gratitude

488
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,658
for all of your support
and interest in the case."

489
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,332
BRIBERY CASE INVOLVING PROSECUTORS,
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

490
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,219
-There he is.
-Take photos now.

491
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,602
Did you receive bribes?

492
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,187
How do you feel now?

493
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,022
When did you first meet Moo-sung Park?

494
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,482
Will you be taken into police custody?

495
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,485
-How do you feel about the investigation?
-Please say a few words.

496
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,571
Go get some water at least, you pricks.

497
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:18,345
We received many gifts
because it was around the holidays.

498
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,433
I didn't think it was anything perishable
as it looked like a box of fruits,

499
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,103
so I left it in our balcony,
which I shouldn't have done.

500
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,106
We opened it when my husband got home,
and we were...

501
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,862
We were so surprised
when we saw the bundles of cash.

502
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,117
We called the number on the business card
found on the box,

503
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,953
and the person came and took it.
That's really everything that happened.

504
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:03,098
In 2013, the company at which your
brother-in-law was the director

505
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,600
was constructing a new building.

506
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,812
The contract with the late Moo-sung Park
was signed at a reduced price.

507
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,773
That is complete nonsense.

508
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,110
It was immediately after the two of you
met through the hit-and-run case.

509
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,529
You took the difference
which was 400 million won.

510
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,823
You must know it's considered
bribery through an intermediary.

511
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,409
This is considered spreading
false information and defamation.

512
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,744
You must know that.

513
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,606
This is amazing!

514
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,568
Mr. Hwang made a good call
by giving him time to hide things.

515
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,161
It's 78 REO 9257.

516
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,539
It's BMW's newest model.

517
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,126
We found it in the underground parking lot
at Crown Hotel near Namsan.

518
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,711
We heard that you've never paid
for parking for seven months.

519
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,465
You handled the owner of the hotel chain
Young-ho Cha's assault case, didn't you?

520
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,218
Immediately after that,
70,000 shares of the company's stock

521
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:25,180
got listed under your nephew's name.
How old is he this year?

522
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,519
-Tell Si-mok to come here.
-Is he even in kindergarten now?

523
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,062
I said, bring Si-mok!

524
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,272
He's busy at the moment.

525
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,695
He asked me to pass this message
along to you.

526
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,698
"We certainly have enough evidence
to arrest you.

527
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,200
The investigation will go on
for a long time.

528
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,997
We will make sure to reveal everything."

529
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,546
Well. I can share what I know...

530
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,048
He also said that there will be
no negotiation.

531
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,763
Chief of Division One was bribed too.

532
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,433
You can go home and wait
for your arrest warrant.

533
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,602
Just staying home might be a good idea.

534
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,260
MR. YOON

535
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,434
He's leaving now.

536
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,436
All right.

537
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,190
You can get going now.

538
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,697
Thank you.

539
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,034
I really appreciate
everything you're doing.

540
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,371
You don't need to thank me.
Please get going.

541
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,183
This way, please.

542
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,978
Reporters are still in the lobby, right?

543
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,229
Pardon me?

544
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,064
Let's take the stairs.

545
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,316
You can at least do that for me, right?

546
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,200
He needs to see her.

547
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,748
Mom!

548
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,421
Hey, Eun-soo. When did you get here?

549
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,922
-Mom, are you okay?
-Eun-soo?

550
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,300
Let's go.

551
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,358
He asked me to pass this message
along to you.

552
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,778
"We certainly have enough evidence
to arrest you.

553
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,655
-The investigation will go..."
-For a long time.

554
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,407
We'll make sure to reveal everything.

555
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,130
Mr. Seo! Gosh...

556
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,799
Mr. Seo. Goodness.

557
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:53,764
Hello? Someone here
fell down a flight of stairs.

558
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:54,681
Mr. Seo.

559
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,188
-What happened?
-What happened to him?

560
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,066
-Just a moment.
-Don't push!

561
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,069
-What on earth happened?
-What's going on?

562
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,870
Come in.

563
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,679
Don't you dare bother my family.

564
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:40,602
I locked myself away for three years.
You must know my intentions.

565
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:45,065
I'll take it to my grave,
so all of you should also

566
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,484
keep your promise.

567
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,821
My wife

568
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,073
and my daughter, Eun-soo.

569
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,617
Leave them alone.

570
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,037
I'm sorry, but I don't understand
what you're saying.

571
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:03,834
Si-mok Hwang summoned my wife.

572
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,130
He's protesting to make me
unbury the truth.

573
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,842
He's saying the investigation won't be
over with just a few prosecutors caught.

574
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:17,097
He intentionally got my wife involved
to make me disclose what I know.

575
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,809
This is only the beginning for him.

576
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:26,815
I won't say a word, no matter
what kind of ruckus he causes.

577
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,234
So all of you shouldn't

578
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,819
do anything either.

579
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,281
Go tell your father-in-law
exactly what I said.

580
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,826
Okay, I will let him know.

581
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,339
You're giving up on yourself after all.

582
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,759
How foolish.

583
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,053
You don't believe in yourself.

584
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,348
You don't know where your talents
should be used.

585
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,520
They've been used enough here.

586
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,023
I want to use them for something else now.

587
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:37,302
WESTERN SEOUL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
CHIEF PROSECUTOR CHANG-JUN LEE

588
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,649
That was at Mapo Police Station.

589
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,443
I think they re-investigated
Moo-sung Park's DUI hit-and-run case.

590
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,488
They're going the right way.

591
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,329
This guy is quite something.

592
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,711
He should've been taken aback

593
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,005
or at least tried to grip and yank
my hand as forcefully.

594
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,968
He did neither.

595
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,903
Goodness.

596
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,160
Yes, where are you? I'm here now.

597
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,081
Yes. I'm right outside.

598
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,666
Okay.

599
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:54,421
How long has it been since
the last time I worked? Dear me.

600
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,463
Goodness.

601
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,300
You can sit in the back.

602
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,429
Are you the one who called a taxi?

603
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,224
Why do you ask?

604
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,059
Am I not allowed to or what?

605
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,644
I was just...

606
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,729
What's this now?

607
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,148
-Who are you?
-Hello.

608
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,525
You are cops. Shit.

609
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,777
-Sir.
-Yes.

610
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,448
Where did you drop Min-ah Kwon off
besides the bar?

611
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,574
Is this about her again?

612
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,034
Please, sir. Okay, I'll tell you.

613
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,494
You've picked her up
from other places too, right?

614
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,623
Whether they're motels or hotels,
please list all the places

615
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,708
she used to go regularly.

616
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:36,379
Well, I actually got fired from the bar.
They found out I called the police.

617
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,548
Somebody must've blabbed about it.

618
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,675
-I see.
-Really? We're so sorry.

619
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,260
-What should we do?
-Was it...

620
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,889
I'll ask you one last time.

621
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,062
Was it back in the summer?

622
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,898
After I dropped Min-ah off,
I went inside to use the washroom.

623
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,900
That's when I saw her
using the phone in the lobby.

624
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,527
I thought the man must be someone
who's quite powerful.

625
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,489
Since a bunch of power brokers
got in trouble due to records

626
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,366
on a girl's phone in the past,

627
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,368
they all hate leaving traces
on phone records,

628
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,911
especially the more powerful ones.

629
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,958
-Hello.
-Hello.

630
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,459
We're from the police.

631
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,252
Please cooperate.

632
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,797
GUEST HISTORY

633
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,594
She's been here so many times.

634
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,017
Mr. Hwang.

635
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,727
Yes.

636
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,814
Well, they wanted some snacks.

637
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,902
Actually, there's something
I want to tell you.

638
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,821
Please go ahead.

639
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,865
I should have told you sooner.

640
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,577
I actually dug up some intel on you.

641
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,039
Why did you do that?

642
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,791
I was told to do it by high-ups.

643
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,253
So?

644
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,422
I reported everything to Mr. Lee.

645
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:05,301
How should I put this? Back then,
I didn't know he'd abandon us like this.

646
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,848
I apologize. You picked me for your team
without knowing any of it.

647
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,435
He came to my husband's company to talk,
saying he's your colleague.

648
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,189
If you no longer think that I qualify
to be part of the team...

649
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,274
It's fine.

650
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,317
My family already told me about it.

651
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,611
Your family told you?

652
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,779
Yes.

653
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,574
So you knew everything?

654
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,825
Yes.

655
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,421
My gosh, you bought so many.

656
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,716
We have so much bread here.

657
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,886
I'll make coffee for everyone too.

658
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,512
Wow.

659
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,931
-You're the best.
-I'll do it.

660
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,100
-Could you please stir it?
-Sure.

661
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,148
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

662
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,317
Here you go. I hope all of you enjoy it.

663
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,278
We can't even go out for team dinners
as people might eavesdrop.

664
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,281
This is really good. It tastes
as if it's from a coffee shop.

665
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,200
Gosh. You're right.

666
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,703
Si-mok. I mean, Mr. Hwang.
You should have...

667
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,045
Where's Mr. Kim?
Is he still at the hospital?

668
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,172
Why Mr. Seo out of everyone?

669
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,759
What do you mean by that?
Are they on bad terms?

670
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,761
I can't really say
that they're on bad terms...

671
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,558
Mr. Seo recently gave him
some cash as spending money,

672
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,519
which put him in an awkward position.

673
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,980
No, he didn't spend it.

674
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,610
He gave it all to me so that we can use it
toward our investigation expenses.

675
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:49,155
But Mr. Seo kept criticizing him
for eating up the money

676
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,199
and not giving him anything in return.

677
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,159
Even a kid won't be that immature.

678
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,496
Goodness. Hearing about that one incident
tells me all I need to know about him.

679
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,332
Is that good?

680
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,960
-Not really.
-Seriously?

681
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,630
You're right.

682
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,798
Then, something else for me.

683
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,308
Did you discover anything yet?

684
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,983
Well, we discovered that Ga-young
used to book a room

685
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,485
at the hotel on Mondays
about two or three times a month.

686
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,238
-Only on Mondays?
-Yes. She used Min-ah Kwon's name for it.

687
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,324
But we don't know anything about the man.

688
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,243
He must've paid for the room
with his credit card.

689
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,537
Ga-young paid.

690
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,205
With cash.

691
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,707
Goodness, how sleazy.

692
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,127
I bet he gave her the cash and got out
through the underground parking lot.

693
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,337
We asked them for the security
camera footage,

694
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,631
but they said they've
probably discarded it

695
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,924
as it was too long ago.

696
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,762
I had a chat with my friend
who works at Sungmoon Daily.

697
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,849
They still don't know
who the informant is.

698
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,809
No way. Don't you think it's bullshit?

699
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,436
I don't think so

700
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,730
because they think it's odd too.

701
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:08,526
Everyone knows that the chairman
of Hanjo Group is Mr. Lee's father-in-law,

702
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,113
yet that article exposing the scandal
was approved at one go.

703
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,200
As you all know, Sungmoon Daily
is conservative.

704
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,911
It's also a big corporation,
just like Hanjo Group.

705
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,246
They certainly could have filtered it out.

706
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,375
My friend said it's unprecedented.

707
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,835
Is there rivalry between them?

708
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,337
They might be holding grudges.

709
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,381
Have Sungmoon and Hanjo
ever butted heads against each other?

710
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,717
Not that I know of.

711
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,026
Can we talk for a minute?

712
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,287
Did something happen?

713
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:07,877
Well...

714
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,922
About Mr. Il-jae Young's wife...

715
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,758
Summoning her has anything to do
with the special investigation?

716
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:16,844
Yes.

717
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,972
Then you should've given us a heads-up.

718
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,225
We're a team, yet no one knew about it.

719
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,310
I had to keep it confidential.

720
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,980
Keep it confidential? From whom?

721
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,065
Chang-jun Lee

722
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,733
and Hanjo Group.

723
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,987
I get why you wanted to keep it
from Mr. Lee.

724
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,781
But why Hanjo Group?

725
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,701
Moo-sung Park's total shares
in Hanjo Group

726
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,744
used to be worth over ten billion won.

727
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,457
That ten billion won is what ties Il-jae
Young, Chang-jun Lee and Yun-beom Lee

728
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,875
together.

729
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,670
Are you saying you want
to drag Yun-beom Lee into this too?

730
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,173
This investigation will be meaningless
if it ends at Moo-sung Park.

731
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:58,886
The problem will continue to branch out
if we fail to uproot it completely.

732
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,722
There will be other victims
like Moo-sung Park.

733
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,724
Are you really determined

734
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,852
to uproot the problem with your own hands?

735
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,646
Someone has to get

736
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,357
to the bottom of it someday.

737
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,068
Our investigation could be
the starting point.

738
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,742
It won't be easy though.

739
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,288
Right, it's not like we're easy.

740
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,084
You asked me to gather
some intel on Mr. Jung-bon Kim.

741
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,753
-I'll throw this out for you.
-Thank you.

742
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:37,050
He offers free legal advice, and he's also
actively involved in NGO work.

743
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,261
What about the other ones?
Do you still not fully trust them?

744
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,974
Mr. Kim secured the evidence
without giving it away to Dong-jae.

745
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,477
Mr. Yoon also approached me first

746
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,271
to come clean about gathering intel on me.

747
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,067
What about me?

748
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,943
Can you trust me?

749
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,784
Is someone digging up intel on me?

750
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,329
That won't happen because there's no need.

751
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:15,505
Let's discover what Hanjo Group is hiding.
They aren't that big of a deal.

752
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:21,469
Gosh. I wonder how Mr. Kim is doing.

753
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,072
DEPARTMENT CHIEF, DIVISION THREE
WON-CHUL KANG

754
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,408
Are you really going to go?

755
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,910
Of course. Do you think
I'm putting on a show?

756
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:31,205
Does that prick want to die or what?
How dare he summon his department chief?

757
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:32,957
What are you talking about?

758
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,585
He got that job to do things like this.

759
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,757
Do you happen to know why he summoned you?

760
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,733
-Mr. Seo.
-Goodness.

761
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,276
Did you see...

762
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,111
-Goodness.
-What's wrong with him?

763
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,946
My shoes.

764
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:24,842
Yes, Mr. Kim.

765
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,970
What should we do? Mr. Seo is gone.

766
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,645
-Mr. Hwang, the hospital just called...
-I just heard about it too.

767
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,647
I guess miracles do happen.

768
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,155
Sir, please help me.

769
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,079
Sir, help me, please.

770
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,957
Sir! Sir, please help me.

771
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,583
Sir, I need your help!

772
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,669
I'll do anything, sir.

773
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,254
I can do anything!

774
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,881
Anything you say! Sir, please.

775
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,551
-Hey!
-Many are willing to do anything for me.

776
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,303
There's something Mr. Lee hasn't told you!

777
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,139
Let go!

778
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,782
STRANGER

779
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:14,327
-Hey, when did she wake up?
-We have to move her.

780
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,079
You can't tell anyone about it.
You absolutely shouldn't.

781
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,373
How can you not know where she is?

782
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:23,002
The guy who delivered the cash to my dad.
He's running away now.

783
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,670
What are you looking for?
It's not your desk.

784
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,713
Evidence.

785
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,090
The police did something
they should never do.

786
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,385
The culprit wants things
about Moo-sung Park to be exposed.

787
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,179
What will you sell if I'm buying from you?

788
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,223
I started the special investigation
to catch all of them.

789
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,725
Are you saying you'll do this?

790
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,186
I won't stop at a tip of the iceberg
like Moo-sung Park.

791
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,856
