1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,212
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,467
"Let's sacrifice one member

4
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,927
and save the whole team."
Is that what you thought?

5
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,263
Why would I harm that prosecutor?

6
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,807
"I'm finally mustering up my courage.

7
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,310
I was at the scene that day."

8
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,313
I saw someone putting something
in the trunk of a car.

9
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,731
I saw his face.

10
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,066
He saw the culprit's face.

11
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,233
What's his deal?

12
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,778
He went in and out of jail
for gambling and scamming.

13
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,530
I think it's a pattern on the watch.
Are they flowers?

14
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,325
What we saw in the photo is not
a ceiling light.

15
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,202
It's a watch. A police watch.

16
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,453
What do you mean?

17
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,038
Are you kidding me?

18
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,083
Bring those Segok Station jerks.
Summon them right now!

19
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,843
Damn it.

20
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,725
This is freaking ridiculous.

21
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,103
All right.

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,492
-Mr. Jeon Gi-hyeok?
-Yes?

23
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,120
You made the witness report, right?
It's Yongsan Station.

24
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,079
Where are you now?

25
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:07,001
Look. We have your resident registration
number as well as your address.

26
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,879
We can't wait around,
so just tell us where you are.

27
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,797
Where are you now?

28
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,260
Tell us, or we'll just go to your house.

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,863
EPISODE 11

30
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,143
Over there, please.

31
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,054
Come on in.

32
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,182
Sit at the very end.

33
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,874
Hello, sir.

34
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,721
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

35
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,019
Hey, what about our team?

36
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,479
Detective Jang is getting the witness.

37
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,231
Sun-chang is getting their captain.

38
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,025
-Are they on their way?
-Not sure.

39
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,404
The captain's on patrol,
but they can't reach him.

40
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,615
-Call them.
-Okay.

41
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,359
Captain Baek…

42
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,118
What?

43
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,935
DETECTIVE SEO

44
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,355
My gosh.

45
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,817
Are you trying to remove
a huge nail or something?

46
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,943
Yes.

47
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,656
You know that you need
to mix this with water, right?

48
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,866
Yes, I know.

49
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,327
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

50
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,713
DAEWON MOTEL

51
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,726
Who are you?

52
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,832
Hello, sir.

53
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,376
Hello.

54
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,295
Hey, you're here too.

55
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,756
Well, you can sit over there.

56
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,247
-Kim Su-hang.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,131
So you worked as a volunteer
bathing the elderly.

58
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,926
Did you wash the blood off there?

59
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,887
No, sir.

60
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,763
I worked all day from dawn to dusk.

61
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,602
He did work all day. We've verified it.

62
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,647
Who works at Bangsan Market?

63
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,441
That's me, sir.

64
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,443
So it's your mother's shop?

65
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,822
She could have said you were there even if
you weren't because she's your mother.

66
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,574
That day,

67
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,661
I worked until late at night.
All the other shop owners know that.

68
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,079
What day?

69
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,753
The day the prosecutor went missing.
Isn't that why you summoned all of us?

70
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,296
As for the other shop owners,

71
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,382
your mother could have asked them to say
they saw you that day.

72
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,717
What? Come on.

73
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,220
There were customers too.

74
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,056
It's been days.
You think they'd still remember your face?

75
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,267
I don't even remember who I saw yesterday.

76
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,479
My customers are all regulars.

77
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,234
The missing prosecutor…
I've never even met him.

78
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,446
There were security cameras at the shop.

79
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,907
We've confirmed he worked late.

80
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,994
When did you come to Seoul?

81
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,140
How is it to be back in your hometown?

82
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,768
I work at a security company.

83
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,437
I worked the night shift on March 26.

84
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,190
I responded to a false alarm
and reported it.

85
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,527
We've verified it, sir.

86
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,237
I live in Ulsan now.

87
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,700
I was nowhere near Seoul that day,
let alone the scene.

88
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,536
Shouldn't you have a legitimate reason
to be summoning me?

89
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,329
I'm not a cop anymore,

90
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,083
so I am not obligated
to obey any of your orders.

91
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,461
How could you summon
an innocent, hardworking civilian

92
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,380
just based on a groundless suspicion?

93
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,220
You prick.
Can you not gauge the situation?

94
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,560
When did you come to Seoul?

95
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,562
Did you come to set your stories straight?

96
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,815
-You summoned me.
-Sir.

97
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,112
We summoned him today
for an investigation interview.

98
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,532
There were six of you.

99
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,326
The three of you here.

100
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,661
One is in jail now.

101
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,456
Did you not hear back
from the one who emigrated?

102
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,292
Yes, sir. He hasn't returned
since he left the country.

103
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,047
Where's your captain?

104
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,257
That's…

105
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,260
One of our detectives went to get him.

106
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,847
Well, should I step out and call him?

107
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,224
You have such good vision for your age.

108
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,769
You don't miss a single thing, do you?

109
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,569
Where did you hide him?

110
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,826
Among the four suspects, one has no alibi.

111
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,203
That means he's the culprit.

112
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,997
You own the store in Bogwang-dong.

113
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,250
Did he show up and interrogate you?

114
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,585
And you lost it?

115
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,171
You beat up the chairman's grandson.

116
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,632
He dared to drive poorly
and give you muscle cramps.

117
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,343
Did you assault the prosecutor
with that temper of yours?

118
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,600
Sauna.

119
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,270
I was at a sauna.

120
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,985
Which one?

121
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,321
Which one?

122
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,866
Gold Sauna.

123
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,286
-Check his alibi.
-Yes, sir.

124
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,873
So, did you fake your overtime?

125
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,418
When did you find out?

126
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,629
We found out about it just now.

127
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,840
And the shop in Bogwang-dong?

128
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,799
The shop…

129
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,137
We learned about that
when we learned about the faked overtime.

130
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,305
We've already checked the shop.

131
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,974
Doesn't that mean

132
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,894
that you had enough time to inform
the prosecutors' office in charge?

133
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,691
There's something more
I need to know, right?

134
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,530
It's a watch. A police watch.

135
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,288
What did I do so wrong?

136
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,877
What's so wrong
with getting some overtime pay?

137
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,253
Let's be honest.

138
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,089
There were many work-related expenses
that I paid for myself.

139
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,134
When I had an accident on the job,
I took care of the expenses.

140
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,179
And I worked all night
almost every day as a detective.

141
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,722
Did you pay me properly then?

142
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,348
-Uncle.
-Shut it!

143
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,100
I'll just quit.

144
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,771
It was so bad that our bank account
was overdrawn.

145
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,564
You should be ashamed of yourself!

146
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,361
Hey!

147
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,741
I'm sorry I'm late.

148
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,992
Did he resist?

149
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,827
No, it's not that.

150
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,965
What are you talking about?

151
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,180
We really needed money.

152
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,516
We're sorry, sir.

153
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,312
Sergeant Lee's mother was very ill.

154
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,816
Sergeant Lee? The one in jail?

155
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:15,195
He said she'd pass away
if she was taken off her meds.

156
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,823
He held out for five years
with his rent deposit,

157
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,825
-Hey!
-but even that money was gone.

158
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,368
-Enough!
-Break it up!

159
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,746
He said he couldn't go on anymore
and burst into tears in front of us.

160
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,582
-Hey!
-Move back!

161
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,041
I felt so bad for him.

162
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,797
Jeez, what are you saying?

163
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:38,510
But he said it'd be covered by insurance
as soon as the new law passes

164
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,180
and that it'd only cost one percent
of the price.

165
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,306
-Hello?
-Come on.

166
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,809
We were going to hold out just until then.

167
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,604
"Hold out"? How?

168
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,067
This is what I said to my team.

169
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,457
Just until the law changes…

170
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,008
We'll accept bribes.

171
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,803
I said we'd do it just until the meds

172
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,432
could be covered by insurance.

173
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,769
Take bribes from bar owners?

174
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,065
But you kept on doing it.

175
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,108
We couldn't stop.

176
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,154
What about Sergeant Baek?

177
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,657
No, not Captain. I swear.

178
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:47,287
He pulled out as soon as we no longer
needed the money for the medicine.

179
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,040
He had no idea
we continued to take bribes.

180
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,751
As the captain of the team,

181
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,964
you knew they were leaking
information to the bar owners, didn't you?

182
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,342
How could I not have known?

183
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,095
I just couldn't stop them.

184
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,681
You did try to stop us.

185
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,393
You yelled at us and even pleaded with us.

186
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,396
I dragged them into it after all.

187
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,401
I was the one who planted that awful seed…

188
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,529
in their heads.

189
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,081
Sergeant Baek, where were you on March 26,

190
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,292
between 19:00 to 23:00?

191
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,127
That really wasn't me.

192
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,879
I went straight home after work.

193
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,507
Your wife was the one who said
you were home that night.

194
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,844
Yes, she lives with me. Who else
would know whether or not I was home?

195
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,188
Jeez, that startled me.

196
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,315
What was that?

197
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,473
-Sorry to interrupt, but…
-Do you think we're idiots?

198
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,477
If you showed us his suicide note
after all these years,

199
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,521
did you think we'd go,
"Gosh, it was indeed suicide"?

200
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,066
I found this on Sergeant Song's desk

201
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,693
after he passed away.

202
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,530
This says that you took bribes,
bullied him, and made his life hell.

203
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,450
And you kept this all these years?
Who'd believe that?

204
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,829
-I couldn't chuck it out.
-Why not?

205
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,041
I was scared.

206
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,253
I was afraid

207
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,131
that he'd haunt me as a ghost

208
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,384
if I burned it.

209
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,222
I wasn't holding onto it.

210
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,974
I just shoved it somewhere people can't--

211
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,186
How could you…
You've kept it all these years?

212
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,439
And you let them insult me like this?

213
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,615
The thing is--

214
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,617
If we didn't kill Sergeant Song,

215
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,328
it means we had nothing to do
with the missing prosecutor.

216
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,747
It was suicide,
so what's there for us to hide?

217
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,291
Why would we be threatened
by that prosecutor?

218
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,378
We'll verify this at the prosecution.

219
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,339
Sure.

220
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,716
The witness is here.

221
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,307
You have nothing to be afraid of
if everything you said is true.

222
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,810
Let's get this over with.

223
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,122
-There was a witness?
-No idea.

224
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,166
Yes, there is.

225
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,794
How do you know?

226
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,176
I found this on Sergeant Song's desk

227
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,595
after he passed away.

228
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,066
Go on in.

229
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,420
Stand in a straight line
and face the front, please.

230
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,715
Stand over here.

231
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,594
I'm your superior, you bastards!

232
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,888
Over here, please.

233
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,848
Do we really have to do this?

234
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,266
Let's just get it over with.

235
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,732
We'll see who it is

236
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,360
that gets over and done with.

237
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,987
Face forward, please.

238
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,001
The witness is here.

239
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,964
Come on in.

240
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,686
Is he here?

241
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,531
Yes.

242
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,412
Who is it?

243
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,258
It's him.

244
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,865
You may leave.

245
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,368
Let's go.

246
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,419
Mr. Baek Jung-gi.

247
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,505
You're under arrest
for kidnapping and confinement.

248
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,132
-What?
-You may remain silent,

249
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,093
-hire an attorney, or explain yourself.
-It wasn't me.

250
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,512
You may file a complaint
for unlawful detainment.

251
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,639
-No, it wasn't me.
-Come on.

252
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,016
Bring the witness here!

253
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,607
Move.

254
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,660
Could you tell us more details
about what you witnessed?

255
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,081
I have nothing more to tell you.

256
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,000
I wrote everything in the comment.

257
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,253
I was going up the stairs
and saw someone suspicious.

258
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,091
I saw his face, and it was him.
That's all.

259
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,719
What was the distance
between the staircase and the vehicle?

260
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,641
That I don't know.

261
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,477
Mr. Jeon, how good is your eyesight?

262
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,024
It was dark.
Could you really see his face?

263
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,486
Well, I have good eyesight.

264
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,155
Also, it wasn't that far.

265
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,241
Why didn't you come forward sooner?

266
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,492
Well…

267
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,870
I thought I had witnessed something

268
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,957
so I looked up some articles and stuff.

269
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,877
And every time I used my phone,
I saw that video

270
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,423
of the prosecutor's wife
pleading for help to find him.

271
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,592
So I felt bad.

272
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,138
If you saw the news,

273
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,766
I'm sure you knew that a cop
was interviewed as a suspect.

274
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,976
Yes.

275
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,104
So maybe you assumed
the culprit would be a cop.

276
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:55,525
Maybe you just pointed him out
because he was in a police uniform.

277
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,193
Gosh, no.

278
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:02,240
I was also surprised to see that man
in a police uniform.

279
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,492
-Is he here?
-Yes.

280
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,832
Why were you there at that time?

281
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,626
To visit my friend's place.

282
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,504
Can we have your friend's address?

283
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,633
Why?

284
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,637
If you don't believe me, just forget it.

285
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,892
What the hell?
It's not like I did something wrong.

286
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,896
I didn't see anything. Can I just go now?

287
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,990
Was this taken at your place?

288
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,870
No! I told you.
Why would I do something like this?

289
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,665
Listen.

290
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,752
Let's say I'm the culprit.

291
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,463
But I'm a police officer too.

292
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,507
Why would I send a clue like that?

293
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,133
Because you're a cop.

294
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,427
You know how to mess
with the investigation.

295
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,764
Sir.

296
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,642
This is a setup, all right?

297
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,102
This is just ridiculous!

298
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,397
Why would the witness set you up?

299
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,067
Where's Prosecutor Seo?

300
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,235
Tell us right now.

301
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,697
Did you bury him?
Is that why you're not telling us?

302
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,295
Do you remember the motel floor?
Was it similar to the photo?

303
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,091
No, it was a different pattern.

304
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,889
Did you hide the prosecutor in that motel?

305
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,518
The room was tiny.
There was just one blanket on the floor.

306
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,103
Did you check the whole motel?

307
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,689
How can you know from just one room?

308
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,531
Could he…

309
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,410
You saw Sergeant Song's will.

310
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,998
What motive would I have
for harming the prosecutor?

311
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,332
You must have been upset

312
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,835
because he kept accusing you
of killing Sergeant Song.

313
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,921
Is that why you fought?
Did you hit him with a brick?

314
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,183
Hey. Why are you crying?

315
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,104
Don't you know who wants
to cry the most here?

316
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,441
Damn it.

317
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,363
You saw him at a gambling house, right?

318
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,743
You were gambling
at one of the houses, right?

319
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:57,081
I'll really get killed
if I tell you the location.

320
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,960
The police should protect the witness.

321
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,379
The neighborhood was in chaos
because of the case,

322
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,672
and it's still open?

323
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,176
That's not what's important.
I'm telling you, he's the culprit.

324
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,427
Mr. Jeon Gi-hyeok.

325
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,306
This is different from scamming.
You'll get additional punishment.

326
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,476
Jeez. Is this how you treat a witness?

327
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,188
Is it because of money?

328
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,690
Money?

329
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,985
You're doing this so you won't
have to give me the reward.

330
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,279
You don't want to pay me 10 million won,
right?

331
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,033
Are you here because of the money?

332
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,953
Yes. What's so wrong about that?

333
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,456
You're the ones who offered
the reward money.

334
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,500
I know you're treating me like a fraud

335
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,837
and threatening me,
expecting me to give up the money.

336
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,172
But you're wrong.

337
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,970
I couldn't sleep because of the nightmares
since I saw those legs that night.

338
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,764
You know how tough it is
when you can't sleep well.

339
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,225
I have the right to get that money.

340
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,061
No matter how much you threaten me,
I saw what I saw.

341
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,480
The money is mine.

342
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,899
Give us the address.

343
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,776
Didn't you hear anything I said?

344
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,488
If you want that money,
tell us where you witnessed it.

345
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,035
Tell Team One and Two to go to the motel.

346
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,246
-You search his house.
-Yes, sir.

347
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,123
Bring his clothes from the house

348
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,668
-so he can remove that police uniform.
-Okay. We'll go now.

349
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,087
Sir, at least let me make a phone call.

350
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,255
To get rid of evidence?

351
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,465
My wife will be startled!

352
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,051
Prosecutor Seo's wife is the one
who was startled.

353
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,055
You're a cop. You know what it's like
to be screwed over by some lowlife.

354
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,891
How do you think I'd feel
because of what you did?

355
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,477
I'll get stoned to death soon.
Because of you…

356
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,522
Isn't Senior Inspector Han
the one who's really screwed?

357
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,315
Right.

358
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,610
She was the one who was on TV.
They'll blame her,

359
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,863
not the director.

360
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,907
What if they blame her
because she was the one in charge?

361
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,349
We're not hiding anything anymore.

362
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,776
BOGWANG-DONG BICHANG-RO 11BEON-GIL

363
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,491
So what about Seo Dong-jae?

364
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,080
Okay. Good work, Prosecutor Hwang.

365
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,465
You picked up right away.

366
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,093
Aren't you supposed to
be busy writing articles?

367
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,013
How did you know it was me?

368
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,393
Yes, they got him.
It's the suspect from before.

369
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,814
Yes, the witness saw him at the scene.

370
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,734
That's right.

371
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,877
Could we check your room?

372
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,796
Oh, my gosh!

373
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,550
You startled me.

374
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,219
My goodness.

375
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,640
Were you about to hit me with that?

376
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,560
I thought you were one of the gamblers.

377
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,567
So this must be the gambling house.

378
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,902
There's no one inside.

379
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,723
I can see you.

380
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,100
Maybe it's because I know you.
I see you clearly.

381
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,481
What about the plate number?

382
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,609
You're in front of the plate, so…

383
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,238
He said he saw the car leaving.

384
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,740
Still, I can't see the numbers.

385
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,077
I can only see that there is a plate.

386
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,538
The witness said he couldn't
see the numbers.

387
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,958
When did you ask him that?

388
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,377
Excuse me.

389
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,089
Do you remember the shoes
of the missing victim?

390
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,590
What?

391
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,010
Yes, they were men's dress shoes.

392
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,554
Very common ones.

393
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,806
What about the car color?

394
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,808
The car of the officer you pointed out.

395
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,769
I think it was a dark color.

396
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,939
I think that's what I saw.

397
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,149
Did you see the license plate?

398
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,568
If you could see his face, then maybe…

399
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,029
Well, it was nighttime,

400
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,740
and he was standing in front of the plate

401
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,575
so I couldn't see it.

402
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,169
Like this?

403
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,512
But license plates are pretty long.

404
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,432
Maybe you could have seen the numbers
at each end.

405
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,101
He said he also felt bad

406
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,061
that he couldn't see the numbers.

407
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,026
You could have just used the door
on your way out.

408
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,697
Oh, about that message.

409
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,991
It wasn't Captain Baek's house.

410
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,411
He could have thrown away the watch,

411
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,371
but he couldn't have changed the floors.

412
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,374
And our team checked all the motel rooms.

413
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,462
And we need another warrant.

414
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,756
The witness' phone location history.

415
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,799
-I already made a request.
-I see.

416
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,429
Well, our team's still investigating
Captain Baek's house.

417
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,557
I'm going to go to Yongsan Station
and talk to him again.

418
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,602
I told you everything, okay?

419
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,625
Hello.

420
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,068
Bye, then.

421
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,323
-Hello?
-I heard you got the culprit.

422
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,825
What about Seo Dong-jae?

423
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,034
We didn't find him yet.

424
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,286
Why not?

425
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,288
Is he not talking?

426
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,540
He's strongly denying it.

427
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,168
What's there to deny?
I heard he was seen doing it.

428
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,628
I thought the witness saw it all.

429
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,338
We're still checking.

430
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,340
I'll call you when we find him.

431
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,050
I'm sure it'll be on the news
if you find him.

432
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,927
They've already published
the articles about his arrest.

433
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,429
Just focus on your work.

434
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,055
Yes, sir.

435
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,328
A man has come forward claiming
to have witnessed the kidnapping

436
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,955
of the prosecutor
that happened in Yongsan on March 26th.

437
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,249
This witness has pointed out

438
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,045
an active police officer as a suspect
leaving people in shock.

439
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:50,090
The police are yet to release
an official statement…

440
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,802
Witness testimony was revealed to be
in conflict with the police announcement

441
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,681
suspecting that the culprit could have
kidnapped the prosecutor out of grudge…

442
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,854
-It's unbelievable.
-It doesn't make sense.

443
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,980
-Did you hear?
-Yes.

444
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,233
The Minister of Justice
and the Minister of Security

445
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,109
asked the Prosecutor General
for a meeting.

446
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,946
It's only a small chance,
but they may ask us

447
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,158
to hand over the investigative rights
to the police despite the situation.

448
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,118
Prosecutor Kim and Prosecutor Hwang.

449
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,871
-Yes?
-Prepare a resignation letter.

450
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,500
Yes, sir.

451
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,295
Starting with us…

452
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,422
Aren't you listening to me?

453
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,217
I was listening.

454
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,720
But things won't go that far, right?

455
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,807
At the moment,
it looks like we have the upper hand.

456
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,351
All the prosecutors are in an uproar,

457
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,436
saying that a cop
beat a prosecutor to death.

458
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,190
They wouldn't dare to bring up
anything about investigative rights.

459
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,694
If they do, we're going on strike.

460
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,446
All our offices are going to close down
and stop working.

461
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,324
If 2,000 prosecutors stop working,

462
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,702
no one will mention investigative rights.

463
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,246
No one in the current government
or the next.

464
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,456
I guess so.

465
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,628
The toughest problem we were facing
seems to be getting solved now.

466
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,298
But I heard you guys caught the culprit.

467
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,591
Where's the victim, then?

468
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,384
There's no need to ask him now.

469
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,304
We can't let the police
keep working on this case.

470
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,973
The central district office
will take over.

471
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,266
Prepare the documents to hand over.

472
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,018
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

473
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,394
You send over the files too.

474
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,062
Yes, sir.

475
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,066
-It's almost time.
-Yes.

476
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,695
Good luck, sir.

477
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,240
Should I stay here with you?

478
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,001
I'm pretty sure our listeners
already heard the news.

479
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,211
-It's starting already?
-Today on the show,

480
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,589
we have Prosecutor Woo Tae-ha
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

481
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,342
to share his thoughts on
the kidnapping of a prosecutor

482
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,302
at the hands of an active police officer.

483
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,595
Prosecutor Woo Tae-ha?

484
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:03,057
Hi, I'm Woo Tae-ha from
the Criminal Legislation Division.

485
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,978
Many people, including myself,
are curious whether it's true.

486
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,690
Is it true that the witness
pointed out a cop as the culprit?

487
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,276
Well, as released by the media,

488
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,363
it's true that the witness
made such a statement.

489
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,489
But it hasn't been confirmed.

490
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,950
We can't say for sure
that he is the culprit.

491
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,619
It wouldn't matter that much

492
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,747
whether the victim was an ordinary citizen
or a prosecutor,

493
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,501
but isn't it a serious matter if an active
police officer is actually the culprit?

494
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,588
The prosecution service might be
emotionally charged right now.

495
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,382
THE POLICE HAVE DENIED POSSIBILITIES
OF THE CULPRIT BEING ONE OF THEIR OWN

496
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,510
Well, I believe that
the police as a whole

497
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:43,097
should not be criticized for the deed
of just one individual.

498
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,266
Many people, including myself,
feel the same way.

499
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,396
What's more shocking is
that there are rumors saying

500
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,566
that this case has something to do with
the corruption of the suspected officer.

501
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,151
Is this true?

502
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,781
If so, there's something
the listeners would be worried about.

503
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:06,578
If the prosecution did not have
investigative authority, in other words,

504
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:11,333
people have been asking whether
the corruption would have been revealed

505
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,836
if the police could
close the case on their own.

506
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,588
The police…

507
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:21,009
I'm not in the position to
be pointing fingers.

508
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,347
Investigations cannot be closed
by the police

509
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,391
without the prosecution's knowledge.

510
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,685
Regardless of who
has the right to close a case,

511
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,021
it is our job as prosecutors
to review the case files thoroughly

512
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:37,526
to make sure the citizens
are not treated unfairly.

513
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,863
But if we don't have the authority…

514
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,031
Let's take this case as an example.

515
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,534
I think it's extremely possible

516
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,537
that the very thing the citizens
are worried about could happen.

517
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,205
I see.

518
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:55,210
Unprecedentedly, the Supreme Prosecutors'
Office led the investigation on this case.

519
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,714
You, especially,
must have worked very hard.

520
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,717
Well, I don't think
I can say that just yet

521
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,887
since our colleague is yet to be found.

522
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,972
We need to work harder.

523
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:11,101
I hope the victim is found soon.

524
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,854
Thank you for your time today,
Prosecutor Woo.

525
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,439
Yes. Thank you.

526
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,201
Come in.

527
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:33,207
The Deputy Prosecutor General wants
to congratulate you over lunch.

528
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,625
There's really no need…

529
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,844
They're celebrating
when the victim's not found yet…

530
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,394
I'm heading out to lunch.

531
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,969
Mr. Baek Jung-gi.

532
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,180
Would you stop already?

533
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,995
Where is he?

534
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,623
My husband.

535
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,546
Our kids are still young.

536
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,133
Our youngest is still a baby.

537
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,678
They didn't get to spend much time
with their father.

538
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,227
Where is my husband?

539
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,607
It wasn't me.

540
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,741
Even if he's dead,

541
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,493
please send him back to me.

542
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,288
Even if it's just his body.

543
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,503
Why won't you tell them?

544
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,757
Things can't get any worse for you.

545
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,678
Please.

546
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,097
Please, I'm begging you.

547
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:58,518
We can't go on not knowing
whether he's dead or alive.

548
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,812
I don't know!

549
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,774
It really isn't me!

550
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,068
This is driving me crazy too!

551
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,196
I wish I could just confess everything.

552
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,783
I wish I could end this. I really do.

553
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,160
But I don't know what happened.

554
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,329
I didn't do anything to him.

555
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,915
I have a kid too.

556
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,751
Please believe me. It really isn't me.

557
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,845
You can just tell me.

558
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,641
I promise I won't tell the police.

559
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,561
Please just tell me where he is.

560
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,147
-It really isn't me.
-Please.

561
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,650
It's not me.

562
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,237
No.

563
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,253
It really isn't me.

564
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,882
It's not me. It really isn't.

565
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,261
I heard you came.

566
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,731
Why don't you come and sit over here?

567
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:46,001
Is he really the culprit?

568
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,547
You should go home.

569
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,257
We'll call you if there's any news.

570
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,054
The Central District Prosecutors' Office
will be taking over.

571
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,725
They're all colleagues of your husband,
so they'll do their best.

572
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,602
And I'll keep searching too.

573
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,608
The witness really saw him do it, right?

574
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,110
Yes.

575
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,450
My husband said this once.

576
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,036
He said that the culprits

577
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,830
always say it wasn't them.

578
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,625
That they always deny their crimes,

579
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,460
but it always turns out

580
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,088
that they were lying through their teeth.

581
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,845
Did he say something to you in there?

582
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,475
What happens if he keeps denying it?

583
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,561
We'll keep questioning him.

584
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,648
And we'll keep
investigating and searching.

585
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,569
It must be really tough.

586
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,254
My youngest will be home soon.

587
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,383
Did you come alone?

588
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,260
Are you sure you're okay to drive?

589
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,102
Be careful on your way home.

590
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,319
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT TEAM 3

591
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,211
Hello?

592
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,382
Yes, I made the request
for his phone location history.

593
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,427
Yes, for the 26th.

594
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,808
So was the signal really caught
at that station?

595
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,522
So he really was at the scene.

596
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,609
Okay, thanks.

597
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,993
And he says it wasn't him.

598
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,622
Damn you.

599
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,381
PROSECUTOR HWANG

600
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,945
The gambling house is closed.

601
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,988
Don't worry, no one will see you.

602
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,031
Where is it?

603
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,836
Is that it? Tell me where it was.

604
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,256
-Yes. It was right there.
-All right.

605
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:28,682
You told me to bring my ID and a copy
of my bankbook so I could get the money.

606
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,724
When can I get it?

607
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,018
Not until the on-the-spot
inspection's done.

608
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,437
This must be your first time
getting reward money?

609
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,563
Is it always like this?

610
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,065
It'll only take a minute.

611
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,361
We found the victim's DNA
in the culprit's car anyway.

612
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,159
Is it that car?

613
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,664
Is that the cop's car?

614
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,041
Yes, we have to bring it back,
so let's hurry.

615
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,376
Plus, it's cold out here.

616
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,004
I think it was that car.

617
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,464
The color's the same?

618
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,718
Yes. It was black.

619
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,554
And he was standing there like that.

620
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,265
What about the plate?

621
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,684
I already told you I couldn't see it.

622
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,186
You can't see it now too?

623
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,359
Can you really see that?

624
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,904
I can only tell that the plate
is white and the numbers are black.

625
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,908
I can't see it either.

626
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,078
Maybe it could have been brighter
that night.

627
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:32,996
No.

628
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,583
You said you saw the culprit leaving.

629
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,753
The tail lights would've been on.
But you didn't see any number?

630
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:44,215
I couldn't focus on that. I was startled
when I accidentally kicked something here.

631
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,092
I thought I'd get caught.

632
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,511
I was hiding like this.

633
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,347
-Like this?
-Yes.

634
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,393
I really can't see it.

635
00:55:56,227 --> 00:56:00,023
I guess you could have only seen
that it was black and white.

636
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,401
I'll report what you just said, okay?

637
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,820
-Okay.
-All right.

638
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,072
Can I get my money now?

639
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,949
Are you color blind?

640
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,868
What?

641
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,289
Even if you're color blind, you'd still be
able to tell the difference.

642
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,708
We're done.

643
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,649
It's impossible to have missed that
no matter how dark it was.

644
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,903
You're right…

645
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,825
Why didn't I notice that?

646
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,661
Maybe I was too focused on the person.

647
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,289
I guess I was more startled
than I thought.

648
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,501
Why did you do it?

649
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,753
Do what?

650
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,969
So you were setting me up,
not inspecting the crime scene.

651
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,221
You still don't believe me.

652
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,732
Why are you all gathered here?

653
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,154
Oh, I get it now.

654
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,074
It's not because of the money.
It's because I accused a cop.

655
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,285
They've been talking about it all day.

656
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,036
So what do you want me to do?

657
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,956
Should I say I was mistaken
and that it wasn't a cop?

658
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,332
Give me your phone.

659
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,501
You need a warrant for that.

660
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,753
Here comes the man who issued the warrant.

661
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,188
He has it here.

662
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,816
You weren't here on the 26th, were you?

663
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,319
-You didn't see anything, did you?
-I really was here.

664
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,821
You used an app that changes
your GPS location

665
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,115
to pretend you were here.

666
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,784
It takes less than a minute.

667
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:20,580
We can find out when you used this app
and where you really were at that time.

668
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,709
That's not why I have that app.

669
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,044
I've always used it.

670
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,255
Why would you go this far?

671
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,137
Damn it.

672
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,016
What do you mean why?

673
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,685
Things would've been different
if the culprit really was a cop.

674
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:28,273
With everything going well, we may end up
drawing unwanted attention if we carry on.

675
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,650
The second meeting has been scheduled.

676
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,027
-What?
-Are you still with Prosecutor Hwang?

677
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,445
Why is the investigation over?

678
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,990
We don't even know if he's alive.
If we end it now…

679
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:37,991
Watching those two,

680
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,493
it seems as if they share everything.

681
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,662
Why don't we resume
the council meeting first?

682
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,081
The rest is in cloud storage.

683
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,875
-Choi Bit has asked to meet him.
-There's no way

684
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,752
the police would approach him
for no reason.

685
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,589
I'm not saying
we shouldn't trust the police.

686
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:58,303
