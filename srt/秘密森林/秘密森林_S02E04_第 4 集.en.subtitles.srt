1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,046
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,548
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,010
Let's say a police officer
murdered his colleague.

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,638
If that were true,
what do you think is going to happen?

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,266
His body showed
clear signs of physical confrontation,

6
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,517
but they just let it go?

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,519
They tried to help you when they found you

8
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,064
but they were met with strong resistance
and ended up with the scrapes.

9
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,984
The prosecution and the police have caused
lots of problems so far,

10
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,986
but there was never a homicide
among colleagues.

11
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,989
Preparing for the lawsuit comes first.

12
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,699
There's over 100 billion won
to account for.

13
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,327
I should show the stockholders

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,580
that I have a solution against
the National Tax Service.

15
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,082
Are you all ready?

16
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,458
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

17
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,086
Let's go.

18
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,429
EPISODE 4

19
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,394
Is he a kid or what?

20
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,961
BOARD OF AUDIT AND INSPECTION

21
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,974
We have to see the Chairman first.
We'll meet you there.

22
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,059
It's Room 302, sir.

23
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,065
FIRST PROSECUTION-POLICE COUNCIL MEETING

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,481
CHIEF OF EASTERN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE CRITICIZES THE TABLOID

25
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,114
Hello.

26
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,034
This is Prosecutor Hwang Si-mok, ma'am.

27
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,121
-It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
-We finally meet.

28
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,706
I'm Choi Bit.

29
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,338
Saving those seats for your colleagues?

30
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,090
Do you prefer to sit on this side?

31
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,759
No, that's not what I meant.

32
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,105
It's good to see you again.

33
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,775
She told me that you were back in Seoul.

34
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,193
I see.

35
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,071
Goodness. Can you at least ask him
how his kids are doing?

36
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,406
"How big are they now?
I heard you had your second kid."

37
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,743
How are your kids doing?

38
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,121
They're doing well, of course.
I mean, they're kids.

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,962
I won't bite. I didn't even say anything.

40
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,716
I'm glad you already have a good rapport
with these kids.

41
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,302
-Yes, ma'am.
-"These kids"?

42
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,735
What are we doing here of all places?

43
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,654
They said no
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office,

44
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,156
and it's not like we can go
to the National Police Agency.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,449
Here, everyone's uncomfortable.

46
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,493
I wonder if they're all here.

47
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,246
-My gosh.
-Hello.

48
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,834
-I'm Kim Sa-hyun.
-Nice to meet you.

49
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,045
Let's go.

50
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,551
I'll take the photo now.

51
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,970
Jeez, is this really necessary?

52
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,597
One, two, three.

53
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,517
FIRST PROSECUTION-POLICE COUNCIL MEETING

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,519
Great, thank you.

55
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,522
-I'll send you the photo separately.
-There's no need.

56
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,712
Thank you all for taking time

57
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,256
out of your busy schedule to be here.

58
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,342
-First and foremost--
-We're just doing our job.

59
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,637
We should thank you
for coming all the way here.

60
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,978
Let's briefly touch upon
why we're here today.

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,355
The current administration
is trying to carry out

62
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,024
administrative reforms on many levels.

63
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,109
There are four issues that concern us.

64
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,780
Who has the power to lead and terminate
investigations, and request warrants?

65
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,531
The reform will address
these three issues.

66
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,992
And lastly, we'll discuss
the establishment of

67
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,952
the Senior Civil Servant
Corruption Investigation Unit.

68
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,579
I'm sorry to interrupt,

69
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,248
but the government has decided
not to change anything

70
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,958
regarding our power to request warrants.

71
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,043
They'll keep it as is,

72
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,504
so shouldn't we exclude it
from this discussion?

73
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,172
I'm sorry to interrupt,

74
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,467
but why bother meeting if we were to
accept the government's proposal?

75
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,095
After all, aren't we here
to discuss the issues at hand

76
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,889
so that the police and the prosecution
can come up with a new proposal?

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,809
"Warrants issued by a judge
through due procedures

78
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,186
-upon the request of a prosecutor--"
-I obviously know…

79
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,146
"…shall be presented

80
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,357
in case of arrest, detention,

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,068
seizure, or search."

82
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,196
"Upon the request of a prosecutor."

83
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,074
Article 12.3 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Korea.

84
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,492
Are we amending the Constitution?

85
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,285
I remember

86
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,164
the very first time
I read those lines in the Constitution.

87
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,169
I thought it was odd to see those lines
in the Constitution

88
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,465
when the rights of civil servants aren't
a general rule or an ordinance.

89
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,342
That's probably because
it was your first time.

90
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,803
You must be used to it now, right?

91
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,138
Why do you think that is?

92
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,056
Because it's that important.

93
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,725
Don't you think they included it
in the Constitution

94
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,853
so that the future generations
wouldn't be able to change it so easily?

95
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,982
I supposed that the prosecution service
had so much power

96
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,734
that they could even spell out
their rights in the Constitution.

97
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,195
-It's not like we wrote that in there.
-Right.

98
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,322
It wasn't the prosecution.

99
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,118
Those who organized the May 16 coup d'état
made it so that only prosecutors

100
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,453
can request warrants.

101
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:38,332
The first Constitution clearly states
that warrants can be requested

102
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,376
by prosecutors
or judicial police officers.

103
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,879
But those behind the coup
removed the police from that clause

104
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,339
even though they had no legislative power.

105
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,843
As legal experts, I'm sure you prosecutors

106
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,597
are fully aware
of how problematic that is legally.

107
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,433
Legally speaking,
we can't say it's problematic.

108
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,769
It's true that the amendment was made
by those behind the military coup,

109
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,148
but the Supreme Council for
National Reconstruction had been granted

110
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,359
legislative, judicial,
and administrative powers

111
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,111
through the Law Regarding
Extraordinary Measures.

112
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:11,491
So what? Are you saying you approve of
the Law Regarding Extraordinary Measures?

113
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:12,950
No.

114
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,870
It was an unjust law
that should've never existed,

115
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,414
but we can't deny its existence.

116
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,043
Accurately speaking,
it's not legally problematic.

117
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,629
But it's definitely problematic
when viewed historically.

118
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:30,092
Moreover, that specific clause
has remained unchanged

119
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,096
despite the four constitutional amendments
that have taken place since 1969,

120
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,182
so the clause should remain as it is.

121
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,352
But you said yourself
that it's an unjust law.

122
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,355
Why do you think it has remained unchanged
for 50 long years?

123
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,651
This question just reminded me of a case.

124
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,445
We were supposed to conduct
a search and seizure of a lawyer.

125
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,572
Why did the lawyer
become the police's target?

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,866
He colluded with a private agency

127
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,661
and carried out a sting operation
against an illegal gambling company.

128
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,497
But after that,

129
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,583
this lawyer approached
the company which he reported,

130
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,254
offered them to drop the charges,
and walked away with a huge settlement.

131
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,173
Reporting an illegal activity
was never his goal.

132
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,467
He was after the settlement money.

133
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,469
He did this multiple times.

134
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,722
I'm sure you both know
who I'm talking about.

135
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,350
Wasn't he your direct supervisor?

136
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,978
I never met him,
and it happened over ten years ago.

137
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,479
Yes, it happened over a decade ago.

138
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,232
How do I know about the case
if it happened over ten years ago?

139
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,401
I know about it

140
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,321
because he sued the police
for damages a few years later.

141
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,949
He claimed that the police
unfairly targeted him

142
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,410
because they were holding
a grudge against him

143
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,495
as he always represented the prosecution

144
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,498
when they butted heads with the
prosecution over investigative authority.

145
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,251
Right, but he lost the lawsuit anyway.

146
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,795
He even lost the appeal,
so why even bring it up?

147
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,589
You know that he lost the appeal,

148
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,967
so you must also know how he was able
to file a lawsuit against the police.

149
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,053
Even a child would know
that we should have been allowed

150
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,390
to search his office and access
his bank accounts without question.

151
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,601
However, we couldn't do anything.

152
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,728
Because we couldn't get
a search warrant issued.

153
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,771
The police sent in numerous requests,

154
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,523
but the prosecution kept rejecting them.

155
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,193
Talk about protecting a former colleague.

156
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,654
Shouldn't you be embarrassed?

157
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,741
If that was the case,
we would've protected him to the end.

158
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,620
The warrant was issued when it was
handed over to a different prosecutor.

159
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,498
Right, but he was acquitted when the case
was sent to the prosecution.

160
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,583
Case closed.

161
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,134
You mentioned the May 16 coup d'état

162
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,055
and even the case from ten years ago.
You keep talking about the old days.

163
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,100
Aren't we able to talk about the past
because things have gotten much better?

164
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,188
Then, may I mention a case
we're currently working on?

165
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,358
This happened a few days ago.

166
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,571
I'm sure everyone here
has never been a victim of a rental scam

167
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,076
since you know the law by heart
and are very smart.

168
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,921
-Hello.
-I'm sorry.

169
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,090
I don't want my employer to find out.

170
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,591
Gosh, don't worry about it.

171
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,346
Well, there's something I needed to check.

172
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,681
You said you met the fake landlord
when signing the lease.

173
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,891
Was it this man?

174
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,769
Yes, it's him.

175
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,354
Did you catch him?

176
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,731
No, we should catch him.

177
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:35,361
The thing is,
the details are quite different

178
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,655
from the information on the profile
we had on him,

179
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,241
so we had to verify
whether or not it's the same guy.

180
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,995
It took me ten years to save up that much.

181
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,456
And all of that money
vanished in just a day.

182
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,710
I'm not asking for too much, right?

183
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,172
It's just a rental studio apartment,
for God's sake.

184
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,384
I thoroughly checked everything.

185
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,637
I heard it could be a scam if you
deal with the landlord yourself,

186
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,014
so I did it through a realtor.

187
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:04,932
Right.

188
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,934
And I made sure
to meet the landlord in person

189
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,438
and even checked his ID card
before signing the lease.

190
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,067
He said he'd install a door security guard
for me because not having one

191
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,195
could be dangerous
for a woman who lives alone.

192
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,990
So I thought I was lucky
to have met such a great landlord.

193
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,951
I had no idea that it was all fake.

194
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,079
Gosh, that bastard.

195
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,081
The suspect will be
at the agency in Bogwang-dong.

196
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,041
At ten o'clock, but it may change.

197
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,209
Okay, we're on it!

198
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,969
Look, over there.

199
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,723
-Is that him?
-I can't see a thing.

200
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,559
-No?
-No, it's not him.

201
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,480
He was supposed to be here at ten.

202
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,524
Should I go find out what's going on?

203
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,445
Yes, go.

204
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,573
Hey, tell the Intelligence Unit
to stay in the car.

205
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,949
They might catch on to us.

206
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,826
Got it.

207
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,516
UNNAMU REAL ESTATE AGENCY

208
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,834
Damn it.

209
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,503
Guys!

210
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,923
-Hey, quick!
-Come on!

211
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,551
Shit.

212
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,387
-This way!
-Hey!

213
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,440
-Hey! He went that way.
-Damn it.

214
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,693
Shit.

215
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,572
Damn it.

216
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,284
-Are you all right?
-Just go. Hurry!

217
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,160
-Darn it.
-God damn it.

218
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,376
-Hey.
-Jeez.

219
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,136
-We lost him.
-What?

220
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,972
Hey, just jump over it.

221
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,099
-Hey, come on!
-Just jump over it. Hurry!

222
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,981
-Just go in. Go!
-Yes, sir.

223
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,357
Yes.

224
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,737
Just a moment, please.

225
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,115
Captain, the prosecution wants us
to transport the assailant to them.

226
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,409
-Shall I tell the guys to do it?
-What assailant?

227
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,494
The guy who's in our holding cell
for stabbing a friend.

228
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,371
The Western District Office wants us to--

229
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,290
If they need him,
tell them to come and get him.

230
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,834
How dare they order us
to bring him to them? We're busy as hell.

231
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,503
They said they're extremely busy
and asked for our cooperation.

232
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,505
The night-duty officer
is asking me what to do.

233
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,757
-What should I tell him?
-Hey!

234
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,928
Hey, they're supposed
to transport suspects themselves.

235
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,679
Why are they still bossing us around?

236
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,014
The law changed a long time ago.

237
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,017
-Then--
-Get their investigators to do it!

238
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,935
Yes, sir.

239
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,938
-Yes, well…
-Is he not there?

240
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,232
Wait, that's… Captain, it's him!

241
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,026
Hey, Jang Geon. Geon!

242
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,487
-This way!
-Hurry!

243
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,529
Come on!

244
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,782
Come here, you bastard!

245
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,950
We caught the scammer.

246
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452
We stayed up all night and caught him.

247
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,579
We've apprehended him,

248
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,873
but the warrant still hasn't been issued.

249
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,377
The Western Office told us to conduct
a supplementary investigation,

250
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,837
so we submitted another report
with all the evidence

251
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,591
including his fake ID, a copy of
the register, and the victim's statement.

252
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,343
And we still don't have
the arrest warrant.

253
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,347
The real landlord listed the property
for monthly rent, but that prick

254
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,849
colluded with the realtor and acted like

255
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,560
he was the landlord to turn it
into a lease on a deposit basis.

256
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,562
Then he ran off with the deposit.

257
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,649
Six families fell victim to the scheme.

258
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,111
You see, 250 million won
may not be a lot of money to some people,

259
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,655
but the victims lost all they had.

260
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,782
On top of their lifetime savings,

261
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,034
they even took out loans.
It really was all they had.

262
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,496
When do you have to let him go?

263
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,081
After midnight tonight.

264
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,625
We'll have to let him go
if the warrant isn't issued until then.

265
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,586
Nothing has changed in the past 15 years.

266
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,384
Back in the day,
prosecutors used to order the police

267
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,844
to bring over and pick up suspects.

268
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,347
An officer who refused to do so
and questioned why we had to be

269
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,225
at the prosecution's beck and call
received a jail sentence.

270
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,395
That happened 15 years ago.

271
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,565
Soon after, we abolished the clause
about the police's duty

272
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,525
to obey the prosecution's orders.

273
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,610
It looks like nothing's changed.

274
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,614
Detective Jang Geon, right?

275
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,533
-Yes.
-It was a misunderstanding.

276
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,411
What do you mean, sir?

277
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,413
I get why such a misunderstanding arose,

278
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,292
but a suspect transport order like that
is a custom that no longer exists.

279
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,420
We no longer order the police
to take care of such things

280
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,090
and aren't petty enough to withhold
a warrant for refusing to do that for us.

281
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,303
That officer received a jail sentence
according to the law at the time.

282
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,557
No matter how much you hate it
or how much it hurts your pride,

283
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,478
the police were obligated to obey
the prosecution's orders back then.

284
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,813
The court found him guilty
according to the law.

285
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,400
Don't treat it as if we've deliberately
mistreated an innocent police officer.

286
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,277
Is that what's bothering you right now?

287
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,321
Getting warrants
is already such a headache for us.

288
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,324
And you say that you cannot hand over
your authority to request warrants?

289
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,078
Mr. Hwang.

290
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,371
She's that prosecutor.

291
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,042
She was demoted when she mentioned
external pressure on a radio show.

292
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,892
Today morning is colder than Moscow.

293
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,685
Good morning listeners.

294
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,272
Currently in Seoul,
it is negative 16 degrees Celsius

295
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,233
and it is negative 10 degrees Celsius
in Moscow.

296
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,692
So Seoul is colder…

297
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,694
LEE HA-NI'S CURRENT EVENTS MAGAZINE

298
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,617
The same day, the Assistant Chief
summoned me to his office

299
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,202
and said something that surprised me.

300
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,913
"The assemblyman's lawyer
used to be a chief prosecutor,

301
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,706
so do not call him directly."

302
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,334
He also said the assemblyman
complained about how I dealt with it,

303
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,003
and I was told to remove
some evidence from the list.

304
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,923
You were ordered by the assistant
chief prosecutor to remove some evidence

305
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,633
-just because of a complaint?
-Yes.

306
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,803
I told him that the lawyers
already made copies of the list

307
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,763
and that it's out of our hands now.

308
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,765
I also asked him
who'd take responsibility for it

309
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,684
if people found out
the prosecution removed it,

310
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,186
but the evidence ended up
being removed in the end.

311
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,897
But at that time the evidence
had already been

312
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,483
revealed to the defendants,
so the prosecutors…

313
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,575
There are 150,000 police officers
in this country.

314
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,579
Let's say one percent of them
make a mistake while requesting a warrant.

315
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,663
That'd be 1,500 officers.

316
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,500
The entire prosecution service
consists of about 2,000 prosecutors.

317
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,128
Are you trying to see
who's more qualified?

318
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,504
No, that's not what I meant.

319
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,215
You talked about how many prosecutors
and police officers there are.

320
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,051
You implied that you're more qualified
based on those numbers.

321
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,262
"You're not any better than us."
Is this your strategy?

322
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,471
Should we keep going?

323
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,974
Well, the power of the prosecution

324
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,643
lies in their authority
not to prosecute cases,

325
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,770
not in their criminal
prosecutorial authority.

326
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,523
If the prosecutorial process
begins with a warrant,

327
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,943
the power should be exercised by the one
that can prevent such misuse of authority.

328
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,613
That is why I must ask you this question.

329
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,282
With the power to request warrants,
you will face pressure

330
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,034
to prosecute
or not prosecute certain cases.

331
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,578
How do the police plan to tackle it?

332
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,747
That is one of our concerns as well.

333
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,749
That's why we're thinking of bringing in

334
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,751
law experts
to develop an inspection system--

335
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,253
Lack of legal knowledge isn't the issue
as seen in our case.

336
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,963
If we want this debate

337
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,300
to be a fruitful one
that brings about meaningful change,

338
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,843
we need to be able to illustrate

339
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,221
at least one difference
between the two organizations.

340
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,598
You must see a different doctor
to get different treatment.

341
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,100
But what if the new doctor is a quack?

342
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,353
-What? A quack?
-Mr. Kim, calm down.

343
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,063
Who's the quack here?

344
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,857
-Are you calling us--
-Enough.

345
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,151
If we're just going to fight like this,
forget it.

346
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,487
This isn't a meeting.
We're only upsetting each other.

347
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,823
The police are asking
for the authority to request warrants,

348
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,283
not to issue warrants.

349
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,410
We're not saying
we'll make legal judgments.

350
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,955
We just want to deal directly
with the court.

351
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,873
If the authority is handed over
to the police,

352
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,959
the police will definitely
abuse their power.

353
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,253
You'll want to make arrests for the cases

354
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,712
you worked hard to investigate.

355
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,339
We're here to prevent that from happening.

356
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,300
Because you want to protect the people?
Not your fellow prosecutors?

357
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,886
If there's anything wrong
with the warrant,

358
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,805
the court will reject it,
so don't you worry.

359
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,474
The court's procedure is like
checking off a few boxes.

360
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,768
And all warrants infringe
constitutional rights.

361
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,230
A step where the police reports
are thoroughly reviewed

362
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,398
is absolutely required.

363
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,485
Give me a break. Is the prosecution
a human rights organization now?

364
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,862
Ask anybody on the street.

365
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,200
Anyone would know about cases where
the prosecution violated human rights.

366
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,827
That's exactly my point.

367
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,037
It's directly connected to human rights.

368
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,999
In our case, there are high-ranking
officers who are in the public eye,

369
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,584
but the police work more closely
with the people.

370
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,963
The police have been accused of
a lot more cases, but people have no idea.

371
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,548
Why? Because they're not on the news.

372
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,258
Because there are just so many of them.

373
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,636
What I'm saying is,
an overissue of warrants is highly likely.

374
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,306
What about the human rights of the
people who are suffering

375
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,348
due to withheld warrants?

376
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,809
Take it up with the Constitutional Court.

377
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,146
If you must change the Constitution,
go to the Constitutional Court.

378
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,647
Enough! We should go.

379
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,025
Let's wrap it up.

380
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,776
Thank you all for coming.

381
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
Director, thank you for your opinion.

382
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,030
Chief Choi,
I get what you're trying to say.

383
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,657
We have until the general election
to make a decision,

384
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,326
-so let's wrap this up here.
-All right.

385
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,870
As for our next meeting,
we'll schedule it another time.

386
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,790
-We'll be off, then.
-Thank you for coming.

387
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,435
-What kind of idiot--
-Sir.

388
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,313
Damn it.

389
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,277
Who's withholding the warrant
to provoke them?

390
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,196
Don't blindly trust that detective.

391
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,447
Times have changed.

392
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,324
Who'd withhold a warrant
just to retaliate?

393
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,410
I bet it was rejected because they relied
on the victim and did a half-ass job.

394
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,828
Which prosecutors' office?

395
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,205
Which station is he from?

396
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,831
I think it was Yongsan Police Station.

397
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,084
Then it's the western office.

398
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,212
Who's the chief there? Is it Im Chae-gyun?

399
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,797
Why does that matter? What will you do?

400
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,048
Just leave them be.

401
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,261
Jeez, we can't tell them
to just issue that darn warrant.

402
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,555
If we suddenly get it issued
after all this time

403
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,890
just because they brought it up,

404
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,975
we'll be admitting to their accusations.

405
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,687
Leave it to the prosecutor in charge.
If you step in, you'll be vilified.

406
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,941
What if they actually have to let him go?
The rental scammer.

407
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,777
Hey, you used to work
at the western office.

408
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,362
-Do you know anyone there?
-No, I don't.

409
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,697
-When did you transfer?
-Two years ago.

410
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,950
All of his former co-workers
must have left too.

411
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,536
Hold on. There is someone I know.

412
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,995
Who?

413
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,081
Never mind.

414
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,042
That meeting was intense.
I'm starving now.

415
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,919
Hey, what's there to eat around here?

416
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,213
I saw a handmade burger place
right by the main entrance.

417
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,756
I'll choke on it. Anything else?

418
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,008
I saw a rice bowl place
20m away from the burger joint.

419
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,844
I want something piping hot!

420
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,439
Let's eat something spicy.

421
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,483
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

422
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,613
-What do we do?
-It's okay.

423
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,623
It's under seven percent.
Must we be whipped around like this?

424
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,251
It looks like Mr. Lee Sung-jae
made a move right away

425
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,503
due to the article about
the eastern office's rebuttal.

426
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,510
Our subsidiary governance structure

427
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,388
had remained largely unchanged
up until the second quarter two years ago.

428
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,308
However, this was our situation
at the beginning of this year.

429
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,854
Led by Mr. Lee Sung-jae,
Hanjo Motors and Hanjo Engineering

430
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,149
purchased a major stake in Hanjo
subsidiaries, including Hanjo Chemical.

431
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,066
Meanwhile…

432
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,735
EQUITY HOLDING
SECOND QUARTER, 2019

433
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,529
As you can see, Mr. Lee Sung-jae's stake
has grown substantially.

434
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,323
It's because the former chairman

435
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,034
transferred a lot of shares to Mr. Lee
before his arrest.

436
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,287
And there's another person
we must not overlook.

437
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,499
Kim Byung-hyun, the CEO of Sungmoon Daily.

438
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,295
He's said to be Lee Sung-jae's supporter.

439
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,965
He started purchasing
our subsidiaries' shares two years ago,

440
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,886
and he's currently
our third-largest individual shareholder,

441
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,013
following Ms. Lee and Mr. Lee Sung-jae.

442
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,806
And with all this going on,

443
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,186
Mr. Lee has notified us
of a bylaw amendment.

444
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,063
When? I didn't hear anything about it.

445
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,397
Just a few minutes ago.

446
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,650
The gist of their proposal is--

447
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,445
They wish to change
Hanjo's current bylaw that allows

448
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,823
the company's chief executive officer
to also serve as the chairperson

449
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,995
of the board so that
the CEO will be prohibited from doing so.

450
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,332
So Ms. Lee will no longer be
our chairperson?

451
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,750
Then who will take over?

452
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,628
Voting will take place,
and one of the board members

453
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,088
will be appointed as the new chairperson.

454
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,173
But if we separate the two roles,

455
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,509
we'll need the chairperson's permission
on everything.

456
00:25:54,928 --> 00:26:00,016
I suppose the most recent
example of this would be…

457
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,309
A small enterprise did it.

458
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,354
I say it's "small,"
but it has over 500 employees.

459
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,065
The board members also appointed
a separate chairperson,

460
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:11,111
so the supporters of the company owner
and the chairperson are butting heads now.

461
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,529
What are they fighting about?

462
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,658
The board appointed a separate chairperson

463
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,577
to push the owner out of the company.

464
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,039
So they'll order the chairperson
to keep an eye on me

465
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,625
and find fault with me
so that they can push me out?

466
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,339
Who's the person Mr. Lee has in mind
for the chairperson role?

467
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,257
I'm not sure.

468
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,468
It's got to be someone we know.

469
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,388
Has anyone at our other subsidiaries
heard anything?

470
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,850
The CEOs of the subsidiaries
didn't even know about the proposal.

471
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,400
I'm sorry, but I don't know much
about Hanjo's current situation.

472
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,610
Why don't you just repurchase the shares?

473
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,612
You can change the governance structure.

474
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,157
-Well--
-We don't have money.

475
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,660
The government is asking us to pay
300 billion won in fines.

476
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,454
The corporate headquarters of Hanjo

477
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,207
has no money.

478
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,419
The former chairman
passed all the subsidiaries

479
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,464
on to Ms. Lee Yeon-jae.

480
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,506
Exactly.

481
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,426
The fines were issued
before Ms. Lee took over.

482
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,054
And Ms. Lee is strongly against

483
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,389
using the company's capital

484
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,475
just to protect her management rights.

485
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,644
We need to find out
who Mr. Lee has in mind as a candidate

486
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,271
to come up with a plan.

487
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,233
Agreed. Why is he being so secretive?

488
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,194
Informing the board members

489
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,446
as soon as possible
on whom he'd like to nominate

490
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,781
will work to his advantage.

491
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,076
Could it mean that an early announcement
isn't necessary?

492
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,620
Who could that be?

493
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,455
There's only one person.

494
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,665
Pardon me?

495
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,126
An early announcement isn't necessary

496
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,046
because he's still the most
influential person in the company

497
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,674
and all our shareholders
want him to return. My father.

498
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,099
Lee Sung-jae will bring
Honorary Chairman Lee Yun-beom back

499
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,809
and make him the chairperson again.

500
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,981
If he's the honorary chairman…

501
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,110
With all due respect,
it'll turn into a war.

502
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,321
It'll be worse than a war, ma'am.

503
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,491
You must make sure the honorary chairman

504
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,535
stays out of this.

505
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,627
He doesn't want to see you.

506
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,839
He said you should leave.

507
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,259
Did you tell my father that I'm here,

508
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,886
right downstairs?

509
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,763
Yes, ma'am. But…

510
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,434
He said you don't need to visit him again.

511
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,687
I apologize.

512
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,947
Mr. Lee asked me to pass along
this message to you.

513
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,288
"Father no longer considers you
his daughter.

514
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,083
Those were his exact words,
so don't upset him in any way.

515
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,795
My mother and I
used to live in this house together.

516
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,423
I, too, no longer consider you my sister,

517
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,592
so you'd better stay away."

518
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,512
I'm sorry, ma'am.

519
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,724
Mr. Lee asked me to pass along
every word he said.

520
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,176
CHAIRWOMAN LEE YEON-JAE

521
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,892
Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae called
multiple times during your meeting.

522
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,393
He'd like a meeting with you, ma'am.

523
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,439
Mr. Park.

524
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,399
A pass. From the middle to…

525
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,235
-Hurry up.
-Will he lose the ball here?

526
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,237
-Gosh, the neck…
-That jab in the neck saved him.

527
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,030
-Yes, that was…
-Jeez.

528
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,741
How come he never passes the ball
to Heung-min?

529
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,952
And he always whines
about racial discrimination.

530
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,328
That racist prick.

531
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,497
-Yes!
-Nice.

532
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,999
-Hey.
-What?

533
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,876
-Heung-min!
-Goal! They scored a goal!

534
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,130
-Well done.
-My, that was great.

535
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,050
Are you a Manchester United fan?

536
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,594
-No, sir.
-Then which team?

537
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,347
I don't watch soccer.

538
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,391
What about baseball? Ryu Hyun-jin?

539
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,602
-No.
-Then volleyball? Kim Yeon-koung?

540
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,105
I don't watch any sports.

541
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,107
What do you do at night?
You don't even drink.

542
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,984
He probably sees his girlfriend.

543
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,611
-Oh, you have a girlfriend?
-No, I--

544
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,074
I have to get this.

545
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,117
Yes.

546
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,704
Speak of the devil.

547
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,623
No, I'm out. What's the matter?

548
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,624
Jeez.

549
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,838
It'll take about 40 minutes.

550
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,799
Okay.

551
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,277
Let's get some ice cream after this.

552
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,240
Gosh, I feel much better now.

553
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,415
Earlier, you listed all those details
on what we and the prosecution did

554
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,585
as well as the exact timelines.

555
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,795
-Did you memorize all of it?
-Yes.

556
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,380
Goodness.

557
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,798
I had to, you know.

558
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,175
Let's not talk about work.

559
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,677
Yes, sir.

560
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,474
By the way, the warrant
for the rental scam case…

561
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,351
Is there anything we can do?

562
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,105
Those damn prosecutors.

563
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,698
You did well today, Ms. Han.

564
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,493
And you made a good statement,
Detective Jang.

565
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,246
Don't be disappointed that we had
no results. We just got started.

566
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,208
-Right. Thank you.
-Right.

567
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,753
You were a bit cool today.

568
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,840
What? But I'm the one paying
for the meal today.

569
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,801
You were awesome too.

570
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,428
This is Park Seong-uk,
the Chief of Yeoju Police Station.

571
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,514
Someone from the Uijeongbu
Prosecutors' Office asked

572
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,307
about an officer that was in jail.

573
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,266
I need to make a call.

574
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,230
Who told you that?

575
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,690
Someone from the Uijeongbu Office

576
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,775
asked Yeoju Prison directly.

577
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,821
He wanted the number of the former officer
who was imprisoned for bribery.

578
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,907
The prison didn't know either,
so they asked us about it.

579
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,242
That's how we found out.

580
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,120
Do you know which prosecutor
from Uijeongbu asked that?

581
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,690
What? You're back already?

582
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,275
How was it?

583
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,235
We barely managed not to have a fistfight.

584
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,821
Did you talk to Prosecutor Hwang

585
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,489
about the warrant for the rent scammer?

586
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,324
I could tell he wouldn't even listen.

587
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,037
He wasn't any different
from the other prosecutors.

588
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,372
But he's from the
Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

589
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,416
You could've asked him to help out.

590
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,376
Why do you think that is?

591
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,795
He's a prosecutor,
just like everyone else.

592
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,466
They were all fixated
on trying to defend what's theirs.

593
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,509
How could I ask them that?

594
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,139
Should I try talking to Yeo-jin, then?

595
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,640
How could she help with this?

596
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,268
Maybe the HQ could talk
to the prosecution.

597
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,728
Who knows?

598
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,272
Don't. What could a Senior Inspector do?

599
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,150
Hey, do you think sitting around
would get us a warrant?

600
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,152
The higher-ups might have

601
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,446
some kind of connection
and understand each other.

602
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,865
We should make the best use
of a member at the HQ.

603
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,784
That's nonsense.

604
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,285
Don't do it, seriously.

605
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,413
My gosh.

606
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,334
Why are you putting that on now?

607
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,628
You should've put that on in the morning

608
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,047
and made them all smell it.

609
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,423
"I hurt myself catching him!

610
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,551
I can't just let him go like this,
so get us the warrant!"

611
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,761
You should've said that!

612
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,097
-My goodness.
-That's ridiculous.

613
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,723
They'll only look down on me

614
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,143
if I enter the meeting room smelling
of pain relief patches.

615
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,271
Plus, no one at the HQ

616
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,983
even mentioned trying to help us
get the warrant.

617
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,276
Seriously?

618
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,823
-Damn it.
-So don't ask Senior Inspector Han.

619
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,420
This is reverse discrimination.

620
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,633
She's just a dispatch, but she even
brought her old colleague here.

621
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,720
Right. We've worked here for years,
but she's the one joining the council.

622
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,766
She's having a tough enough time as it is.

623
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,598
What?

624
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,647
Is that a woman?

625
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,484
I guess he's on a blind date.

626
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,909
You were pretty close by.

627
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,785
Yes.

628
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,289
Have you finally found your place?

629
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,421
Other things must find their places too.

630
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,052
We should correct that article
by Sungmoon Daily.

631
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,682
You should talk to
the Press Arbitration Commission.

632
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,103
Is an arbitration going to be enough?

633
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:15,107
That article is making you seem
like an indirect murderer.

634
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,403
If that doesn't satisfy you,

635
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,490
you can file a claim in court.

636
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,994
I guess my husband

637
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,664
was a mere acquaintance to you.

638
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,790
But still,

639
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,962
don't you feel like you're indebted to him
at the very least?

640
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,386
What about you?

641
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,894
Are you heading out now?

642
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,896
I'm a bit busy with work today.

643
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,939
Let's go tomorrow.

644
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,951
I thought you were visiting
the officer today.

645
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,912
He's busy with work
at the Uijeongbu office.

646
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,205
Should I go alone?

647
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,790
No, go with him tomorrow.

648
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,044
-Don't give out any business cards.
-Yes, sir.

649
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,464
Why did you come back so early?

650
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,356
HANJO

651
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,441
Thank you for calling me, Ms. Lee.

652
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,405
We should've met earlier,
but I was just too busy.

653
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,283
Of course you are.

654
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,994
I read about you on the news every day.

655
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,998
I was so glad to see you become
the chairwoman

656
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,458
of the Hanjo Group.

657
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,711
Thank you. Sit down.

658
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,171
Yes, ma'am.

659
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,095
I heard you called several times.

660
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,805
I'm sorry about that.

661
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,558
I had something I wanted to ask you.

662
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,645
There was no one else I could ask
for the truth.

663
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,563
"The truth"?

664
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,607
Yes. Ms. Lee, have you heard

665
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,235
of Chief Choi Bit by any chance?

666
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,909
Then do you remember a lawyer
named Park Gwang-su?

667
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,416
Should I know that name?

668
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,545
I'm sorry. I should've explained
what this is about before asking you.

669
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,506
This lawyer named Park Gwang-su

670
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,675
used to be in the prosecution service.

671
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,137
He left his post as a Chief Prosecutor
two years ago and moved to a law firm.

672
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,889
I heard Hanjo Group tried to recruit him

673
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,517
as a non-executive director
right after he left.

674
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,810
Did we?

675
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,978
Not officially, of course.

676
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,730
Some civil servants are restricted

677
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,442
from working
for private firms after retirement.

678
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,988
Are you explaining the Public Service
Ethics Act to me right now?

679
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,159
No. Of course not, Ms. Lee.

680
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,871
What I mean

681
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,333
is that Hanjo Group probably tried to get

682
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,962
Mr. Park's help unofficially.

683
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,507
But it seems like
he bragged about it to his family.

684
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,634
He said that he'll be working for Hanjo,

685
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,345
and that he might be able
to earn quite some money.

686
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,265
And who did you hear that from?

687
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,350
From Mr. Park's wife

688
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,685
in person.

689
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,898
But why don't I remember him?

690
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,816
It's because he died from an illness.

691
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,777
I did meet Mr. Park,

692
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,280
but we didn't recruit him
officially nor unofficially.

693
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,615
He died before we could.

694
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,824
Did I kill him?

695
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,827
Pardon?

696
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,079
What do you mean?

697
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,998
The prosecution loves stories like this.

698
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,709
"A former high-ranking official

699
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,503
illegally works for a large firm

700
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,338
and dies a mysterious death."

701
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,468
Well, it wasn't a mysterious death.

702
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,513
What came after is what's mysterious.

703
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,558
The late Mr. Park was someone
who couldn't drink a drop of alcohol.

704
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,937
But the autopsy report said they found
alcohol in his body.

705
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,481
But the Chief

706
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,776
of Namyangju Police Station covered it up.

707
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,488
So that Chief is the one you mentioned?
Choi…

708
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,156
Chief Choi Bit, ma'am.

709
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,243
Mr. Park did drink, though.

710
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,496
What?

711
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,873
I only met him once, but I saw him
drinking quite a lot.

712
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,585
I guess he didn't enjoy drinking

713
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,587
with certain people.

714
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,427
Then do you happen to know
who Mr. Park met on the day he died?

715
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,805
You're asking a lot about
someone I can't even remember.

716
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,598
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,728
I feel sorry about not being of
any help when you came all the way here.

718
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,443
But why did you want to see me?

719
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,445
I heard you said you needed to see me.

720
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,406
Was I mistaken?

721
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,449
Well, you're not someone
anyone can just meet.

722
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,159
I only asked

723
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,621
because you might've had a reason
to allow me to see you in person.

724
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,252
Ms. Lee.

725
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:13,382
If there is anything I can do for you,
please let me do it.

726
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,218
It might not be the case for other people,
but to you, Ms. Lee,

727
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,637
my late senior's wife,

728
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,390
I would never tell any lies.

729
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,111
Prosecutor Seo, you met the former
Chairman Lee Yun-beom

730
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,029
a few times, right?

731
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,158
Yes, he even gave me some work before.

732
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,411
Would you like to pay him a visit?

733
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,666
Yes, sure.

734
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,834
I'll tell you where he is.

735
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,380
Are you not living with him right now?

736
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,715
You used to live with him…

737
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,842
I haven't seen him

738
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,136
since he was released.

739
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,684
My father firmly believes

740
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,561
that I worked with my husband
to send him off to jail.

741
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,480
He thinks I would have known for sure.

742
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,984
He was only a little upset
at the beginning.

743
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,655
It seems like he's changed a bit
during his time in prison.

744
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,118
He won't even show his face
to any of my people,

745
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,161
but since you're not one of mine…

746
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,500
But I would like to become one of yours.

747
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,177
I guess this is why my husband
kept you by his side.

748
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,686
Well, I'm not asking this
because I'm doubting you,

749
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,772
but maybe Mr. Lee

750
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,942
can't see you because
he hasn't fully recovered yet.

751
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,237
He looked rather unwell when he received
the suspended sentence.

752
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,573
Don't be such an amateur.

753
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:56,962
Just give this to him.

754
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,423
Here's the address.

755
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,216
Yes, ma'am.

756
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,719
It's daytime, so the owner
will probably be out.

757
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,304
I mean Lee Sung-jae.

758
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,514
Alright. I'll go and visit him right now

759
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,224
and report to you right after.

760
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,870
-Yes, ma'am.
-Where are you?

761
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,705
I'm on my way to check.

762
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,458
Was Choi Bit mentioned back then too?

763
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,211
No, but I just looked into it,

764
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,422
and she moved to the Intelligence Bureau
just after the incident.

765
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,424
The Intelligence Bureau…

766
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,846
So it is connected. Shit.

767
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,516
Tell Oh Ju-seon

768
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,061
not to tell anyone, even his wife,
about working with us.

769
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,469
Who is it?

770
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,389
I'm delivering a present.

771
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,307
What present?

772
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,351
Who sent it?

773
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,228
The prosecution service.

774
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,105
"The prosecution service"?

775
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,274
Yes. I'm Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

776
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,484
I'll just deliver the present and go.

777
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,620
All right.

778
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:06,925
Hello.

779
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,845
I didn't hear that you were coming.

780
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,471
Oh…

781
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,641
All right.

782
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,685
Here you go.

783
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,103
SEO DONG-JAE

784
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:23,108
Chairman Lee Yun-beom knows me.

785
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,277
I worked for him before.

786
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,863
I should've visited sooner.

787
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,200
Could you tell him that Seo Dong-jae
is here to see him?

788
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,952
He's not home at the moment.

789
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,374
But…

790
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,375
He's not here.

791
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,672
Well, then.
I'll just leave this inside and go.

792
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,050
I'll give this to him.

793
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,219
All right.

794
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,931
I'm sorry, but could I have
a cup of water?

795
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,643
I looked around everywhere
on the way here,

796
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,603
but there wasn't
a single convenience store.

797
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,565
-Wait a moment.
-Okay.

798
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,473
All right.

799
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,392
Thank you.

800
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,229
Please make sure Mr. Lee gets it.

801
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,148
All right. Goodbye.

802
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,401
All right. You can go back inside.

803
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,987
Okay, then.

804
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,383
All I did was get some water.

805
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,682
I couldn't give him the letter.

806
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,560
I thought about putting it
inside the present,

807
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,730
but I thought I shouldn't risk
anyone else seeing it.

808
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,317
I understand.

809
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:36,032
Is there someone ill in that house though?

810
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,367
What?

811
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,582
I think these are from a medicine bottle.

812
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,528
GLASS, PLASTIC, CANS

813
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,575
GLASS

814
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,708
There weren't any documents or anything.

815
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:30,337
I heard that people of high positions
even shred supermarket receipts,

816
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,255
so I didn't expect anything special.

817
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,133
You went through their trash?

818
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,052
Well, I couldn't come back with nothing.

819
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,929
I'm a highly skilled worker, you know.

820
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,818
It's not my expertise so I'm not sure,

821
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,362
but I saw quite a lot of empty bottles

822
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,155
with no labels on them.

823
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,908
These really seem like labels
from a medicine bottle.

824
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,829
If you don't know of anyone ill
in the family,

825
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,831
then maybe it could be Mr. Lee.

826
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,003
I brought this to you since I thought
you'd be able to figure out what this is.

827
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,300
Thank you. I didn't think
you'd be so dedicated.

828
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,052
Good job, Prosecutor Seo.

829
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,597
Well, I did it to receive a compliment.

830
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,141
I don't usually get many.

831
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,395
How could you not when you're so smart?

832
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,315
Your late husband…

833
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,111
The late Chief Prosecutor Lee Chang-jun

834
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,823
requested several things from me,
but I haven't been able to do any of them.

835
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,868
He'll probably yell at me for that

836
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,704
when we eventually meet again.

837
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,540
But now I can brag

838
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,710
about how I did something

839
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,837
for Chairwoman Lee.
It's all thanks to you.

840
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,341
He has no right to yell at you.
He did nothing good either.

841
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,887
He should've stayed and watched over you
instead of making requests.

842
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,015
He should've held on to the people
he cared and worried about.

843
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,391
He's the one who let go,

844
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,685
so he has no right to yell at anyone.

845
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,033
Well…

846
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,411
Chairwoman Lee Yeon-jae.

847
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,001
I am sincerely rooting for you.

848
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,213
There seem to be
some people in the public,

849
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,634
and even within Hanjo Group,
who are uncertain

850
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,052
about you leading a huge firm.

851
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,764
Just show them what you can do.

852
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,517
Why shouldn't you deserve it?
You're his daughter, too.

853
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,400
Well, then.

854
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,320
I'm sorry for taking so much of your time.

855
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,114
No, it's fine.

856
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,409
We can meet again
when things calm down a bit.

857
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,037
-We should have a meal together.
-Yes, ma'am. I'll be waiting.

858
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,658
Yes, I know Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae.

859
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,245
I didn't know he was in Uijeongbu though.

860
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,415
I remember that case too.

861
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,583
Several officers in Segok Police Station

862
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,420
had colluded with
local bar and club owners.

863
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,715
Prosecutor Seo from the Uijeongbu office

864
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,176
is showing interest in this case,
and I have no idea why.

865
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,388
Why now? It's been years.

866
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,932
Segok?

867
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,270
Prosecutor Seo was trying to get
the number of this officer.

868
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:21,067
He was one of the two officers
who served time in jail.

869
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,402
Officer Kim Su-hang.

870
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,866
Could you meet him quietly?

871
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,075
Officer Kim?

872
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,454
He was released last year,
so his whereabouts are unknown.

873
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,790
That's why he asked the prison about him.

874
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,752
I'll try and find out where he's living.

875
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,714
One of the people involved in the case
is still in the field.

876
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:48,678
I want to know why a district
prosecutors' office is looking for him,

877
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,388
and if there is a reason

878
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,183
why the prosecution is digging up
an old case,

879
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,934
especially at a time like this.

880
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,352
I'll look into it.

881
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,229
Okay.

882
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,697
KIM SU-HANG

883
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,411
Do you know anything about
the Segok Police Station?

884
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,707
-Welcome back.
-Prosecutor Seo from the Uijeongbu office

885
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,627
is showing interest in this case,
and I have no idea why.

886
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,423
Do you know anything about
the Segok Police Station?

887
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,550
-In the shower there…
-"In the shower there…"

888
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,990
SEGOK POLICE STATION SHOWER ROOM

889
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,997
UIJEONGBU DISTRICT COURT

890
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,974
This is Segok Police Station.

891
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,769
Sergeant Baek is on vacation today.

892
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,191
What? I'm Ko Chang-yong.

893
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,109
Who is this?

894
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,430
How does someone from headquarters
know my name?

895
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,348
You don't need to be nervous.

896
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,227
Why is Sergeant Baek suddenly on vacation?

897
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,646
I'm not sure.

898
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,983
I looked into some court files
before I came here.

899
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,945
And your name was in it too.

900
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,573
Do you mean the bribery case?

901
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,326
I was only a witness.

902
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,954
You were working with them
when it all happened though.

903
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,708
I don't know anything about it.
I wasn't even on Sergeant Baek's team.

904
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,426
But Song Gi-hyeon was on his team.

905
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,639
Sergeant Song is dead though.

906
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,598
I know.

907
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,767
-It was suicide.
-I know.

908
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,937
Let's talk about what happened then.

909
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,107
I wasn't on duty the day he died,

910
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,860
so I didn't even see the scene.

911
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,571
I only heard about it later.

912
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,951
Sergeant Song's colleagues were caught
for bribery

913
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,410
in December 2017,

914
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,913
and Sergeant Song died three months
before that in September.

915
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,792
Did Sergeant Song get along well
with the rest of the team?

916
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,670
Especially with Officer Kim Su-hang.

917
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,089
Why him?

918
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,674
Answer me.

919
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,384
Would you like to go straight to HQ?

920
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,927
You worked right next to them.

921
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,891
I just saw it once.

922
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,143
-Them taking bribes?
-No.

923
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,605
-Hello.
-Hello.

924
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,731
Hello.

925
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,946
-Hello.
-Hi.

926
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:00,096
-Ouch!
-I didn't know you were there.

927
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,308
-I didn't see you.
-What do you mean?

928
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,018
You should've been more careful.

929
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,686
Are you blaming me for this?

930
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,481
Are you blind? How could you pour
boiling water on someone?

931
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,482
Sorry.

932
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,111
Look at all the water.

933
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,280
You're flooding the floor.

934
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,449
Come on, wipe it up.

935
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,744
It'll be your fault if someone slips.

936
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,581
Captain.

937
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,237
-Sergeant--
-Who are you to tell me that?

938
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,905
Nobody wants you here.

939
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,615
I would have already left if I were you.

940
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,746
It's none of your business whether
I come to work or not.

941
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:50,665
Why are you so rude?

942
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,668
Being older isn't everything.

943
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,963
-Officer Kim.
-You should grow up first.

944
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,172
Please stop.

945
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,841
You're so ridiculous.

946
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,051
What?

947
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,469
Kim Su-hang!

948
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,437
So his colleagues bullied him?

949
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,021
The police?

950
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,617
Who was there at the station when he died?

951
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:33,207
Who first found Sergeant Song's body?

952
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,338
He already had severe depression.

953
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,928
He died surrounded by colleagues
who had been bullying him.

954
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:49,974
His body was found at dawn,

955
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,186
and there was no one else at the station
besides his colleagues.

956
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,065
Former officer Kim Su-hang,
the one Prosecutor Seo was asking about,

957
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,568
was the first one

958
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:04,822
to find his body, and he wasn't
with anyone else at the time.

959
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,326
Damn it!

960
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:15,708
It was suicide,

961
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,462
but it's homicide.

962
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,796
Why did it have to be
Segok Police Station of all places?

963
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,297
Are you saying it wasn't a coincidence?

964
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,300
Make it a special visitation.
He's a suspect of an unsolved case.

965
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,511
You can tell me everything
you didn't get to say then.

966
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,097
The prosecution was targeting the police.

967
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,431
But it turns out…

968
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,642
"Outside forces are interfering
in our company's business."

969
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,852
Give it some impact.

970
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,813
The problem is the seven percent
that Sungmoon Daily's president has.

971
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,982
How much did you cover up?

972
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,859
Han Yeo-jin is with
the Intelligence Bureau?

973
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,486
Choi Bit got Han Yeo-jin
to dig up something.

974
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,697
Find out what it is.

975
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:33,661
