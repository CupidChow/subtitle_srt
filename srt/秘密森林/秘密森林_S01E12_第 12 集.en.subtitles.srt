1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,794
STRANGER

2
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,261
STRANGER

3
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,217
Did we miss anything
when we were inspecting the scene?

4
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,608
Kyung-wan, I'm sorry to bother you,

5
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,694
but could you go upstairs
and put on some loud music?

6
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,487
Music?

7
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,169
Ga-young must've been
somewhere around here.

8
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,657
What?

9
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,242
Is she home already?

10
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,370
I don't want her to know
about things like this.

11
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,788
Is anybody home?

12
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,665
What?

13
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,324
Captain.

14
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,452
What brings you here?

15
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,169
What about you?

16
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,858
You think she was kept here
after she got abducted?

17
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,237
We searched the basement back then,
but didn't find anything...

18
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,328
What's the matter?

19
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,831
Over there.

20
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,582
Seven.

21
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,961
-What about it?
-Did she see it when she was there?

22
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,922
No, I don't think she could've seen it
from the floor here.

23
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,007
What are you talking about?

24
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,510
Ga-young said "zero" and "seven"

25
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,679
when we asked her about the culprit.

26
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,806
Zero and seven? As in numbers?

27
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,058
That seven?

28
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,977
Where is zero, then?

29
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,605
Goodness, you should've told me about it.

30
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,441
She said it last night.

31
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,419
What is it? Did you find something?

32
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,054
Where is that scratch from?

33
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,182
It looks like it's from something
being dragged upward.

34
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,977
It must've been something metal.

35
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,647
Something with a metal part.

36
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,401
A bag with wheels, perhaps?

37
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,112
Wheels?

38
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,786
-Something like this?
-Yes, but this one

39
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,246
has three marks.

40
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,962
They're pretty deep.
They must be from something heavy.

41
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,049
BAGS WITH SIX WHEELS

42
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,015
An expendable wheeled luggage.

43
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,736
Dragging her would've attracted people's
attention even if it was at night,

44
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,656
so the culprit must've carried her
in a luggage.

45
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,200
But you know what?

46
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,661
It might not be from that time.

47
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,539
We inspected everything
with the forensic unit.

48
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,668
There wasn't even half a page
about this basement in the case report.

49
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,214
Back then, there was
a total mess upstairs.

50
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,425
If we had known she was kept here,
we would've taken a better look...

51
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,138
Hang on. It's strange though.

52
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,307
Whether she was inside a luggage or not,
why did the culprit keep her for a day?

53
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,726
You wrote in the case report

54
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,272
that those middle school children got here
earlier than usual that day, right?

55
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,565
Yes, I did.

56
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,903
The day Ga-young got abducted
was one of those punks' birthday.

57
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,738
They said they had a party here that day.

58
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,617
They usually met up here
at around midnight,

59
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,828
but they got here
two to three hours early that day.

60
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,790
When the culprit brought Ga-young here
after abducting her,

61
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,042
those children must've been upstairs.

62
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,254
Those punks were partying it up
inside the house,

63
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,300
so the culprit must've
brought her here first.

64
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,470
The next day, he probably
dragged her upstairs and...

65
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,637
He stabbed her?

66
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,060
But why didn't he do it here?

67
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,022
This must've been a better place to do it.

68
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,317
That's one thing,

69
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,111
but why didn't he do it
the day he abducted her?

70
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,699
Those punks wouldn't have known
even if a war broke out down here.

71
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,076
If he had to tie her up
inside the house for some reason,

72
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,787
he could have waited a little bit
and dragged her upstairs

73
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,706
after those children left
later that night.

74
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,750
Why did he have to wait
until the next day?

75
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,961
Because Ga-young would have died
if he had done so.

76
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,546
Come again?

77
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,800
What do you mean? He obviously
stabbed her because he wanted to kill her.

78
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,303
What...

79
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,932
If he had done it here,

80
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,643
she would've been found after a while.

81
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,522
Even if she was found within
a couple of days, it would've been

82
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,607
after she died
due to excessive blood loss.

83
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,613
She would've also died if he had
stabbed her the day he abducted her

84
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,699
because she would've been found
the next night.

85
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,203
If he had stabbed her
after those punks had left,

86
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,456
she would've been found the next night,

87
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,125
which means she would've
continued to bleed the whole time.

88
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,546
That's another death scenario.

89
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,298
So, are you saying he wanted her alive?

90
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,592
Yes.

91
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,135
But why?

92
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,014
Then, why did he do that to my dad?

93
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,142
Why did he kill my dad
when he made sure she could live?

94
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,728
What did my dad do so wrong?

95
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,491
Captain.

96
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,493
Yes.

97
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,454
Would you be able to discover
what kind of music

98
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,082
those children were
listening to that night?

99
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,586
-Why do you need to know that?
-Ga-young's memory

100
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,589
might return faster if she hears it.

101
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,008
Goodness.

102
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,051
It'll scare her.

103
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,097
Let's try it.

104
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,729
But why did he try so hard
to make sure she lives?

105
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,626
Goodness.

106
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:28,878
Captain.

107
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:35,009
By the way, what brought you here, sir?

108
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,470
Well,

109
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,182
I wanted to speak with Kyung-wan.

110
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,063
Well, Kyung-wan.

111
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,148
Captain.

112
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,027
Dong-jae and Sergeant Kim are the ones

113
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,237
who are making you look like a liar.

114
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,200
They conspired together
and leaked the information to the media.

115
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,994
I know that you won't believe this,

116
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,539
but after doing that to you that day,
as a police officer...

117
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,208
No, as a human being,

118
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,710
I was so ashamed of myself.

119
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,171
I'm really sorry.

120
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,679
I should've stopped Sergeant Kim that day
because violence is simply wrong.

121
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,725
From your perspective,

122
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,436
the one who was watching
wouldn't be much different

123
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,313
from the one who hit you.

124
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,193
Well, I'm sorry. Hey, Kyung-wan.

125
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,072
Kyung-wan.

126
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,793
Captain, I think you should leave.

127
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,540
Is it true?

128
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,377
Did my captain really not hit you?

129
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,837
Let's not talk about it.

130
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,923
Did he or did he not?

131
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,469
My dad was stabbed to death.

132
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,264
Punching me a few times
must've been nothing to them.

133
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,310
Why are you saying such a thing?
You didn't even do anything wrong.

134
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,229
I...

135
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,066
I hated my dad.

136
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,196
I just couldn't understand
why he had to live his life like that.

137
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,409
But

138
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,538
when I heard that he died,

139
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,294
what I hated even more is
the fact that he actually died.

140
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,423
Why did he have to die like that?

141
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,303
But now,

142
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,353
I'd love a day with him just to talk.

143
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,231
Even if he yells and swears at me,
I'd be fine with it.

144
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,985
For just once,

145
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,822
I want to let him know
I don't hate him anymore.

146
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,453
I want to tell him I had no idea
things would be like this without him.

147
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,792
He died alone like that.

148
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,796
God, I feel so bad for him.

149
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,690
I'd love a day with him just to talk.

150
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,484
I want to let him know
I don't hate him anymore.

151
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,737
He died alone like that.

152
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,616
God, I feel so bad for him.

153
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,759
We should eat too.

154
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,427
Right, those teacups.

155
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,763
Go ahead. I'll tidy up.

156
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,181
-All right.
-Okay.

157
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,364
What are you doing?

158
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
I'm looking for a spoon.

159
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,125
I dropped it earlier.

160
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,922
I thought it'd be impolite
to look for it when you're here,

161
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,674
so I came in after you left.
I apologize, sir.

162
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,888
Lift this.

163
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,892
Pardon me?

164
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,246
The spoon isn't here.

165
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,998
Did it roll over to somewhere else?

166
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,668
What are you doing?

167
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:42,269
Well, shall I listen and discover
what kinds of things tycoons talk about?

168
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,318
Why is he here?

169
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,196
It's...

170
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,908
Good, this is great.

171
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,294
-Damn it.
-You've already taken care

172
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,921
of everything with Ukraine.

173
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,507
What? What are they saying?

174
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,716
We just need to import it.

175
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,760
The one from Ukraine...

176
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,677
Crane?

177
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,970
we'll swap the document.

178
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,180
Hong Kong?

179
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,643
We'll invest a large sum
through Hong Kong.

180
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,937
If we bump up the credit rating,

181
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,648
inflate the stock prices
and withdraw our investment right away,

182
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,360
even the most robust bank will falter.

183
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,613
If we sell it then,
the assets alone will reach

184
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,907
seven trillion won.

185
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,619
I just need you to sit there
when I meet the Director

186
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,704
of Financial Supervisory Service.

187
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,435
How much do you think all of that will be?

188
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,647
What are you referring to, sir?

189
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,818
He won't even make enough for a cup
of coffee young people drink these days.

190
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,863
Right.

191
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,991
The assets alone will reach
seven trillion won.

192
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,951
Seven trillion won.

193
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,635
I heard about

194
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,431
how the two of you met.

195
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,685
-Chang-jun and me?
-Yes.

196
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,855
I heard that you liked him first.

197
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,025
Mr. Lee was pretty drunk
when he told us the story.

198
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,527
Truth comes out when you're drunk.
Yes, that's right.

199
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,279
I liked him first.

200
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm only asking this
because I have no idea what it's like.

201
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:07,122
What's it like when you live with someone
for ten years as a married couple?

202
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,292
Have you changed your strategy or what?

203
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,630
Did the female cop advise you
to beat around the bush like this?

204
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,593
I also don't know why you had to run

205
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,803
to the hospital where Ga-young was

206
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,931
late at night.

207
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,353
Did you and the person you met at the ICU

208
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,899
make a promise to pretend
you two never saw each other?

209
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,527
I don't need any deals.

210
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,447
-What happened there?
-I don't know because I never went there.

211
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,161
Then, I have no choice.

212
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,791
I'll have to summon you as a suspect.

213
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,711
You're at it again.

214
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,964
We have a witness who saw you

215
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,093
at the Intensive Care Unit
at around 10 p.m. on April 7.

216
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,138
You were the only one who was seen
at the site where Ga-young was found

217
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,850
taken off the ventilator
except for herself and the medical staff.

218
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,894
Please wait for your summons.

219
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,106
I just wanted to see what that girl
looks like. What's so wrong with that?

220
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,027
No one would've known. Why do I have
to go through this because of that moron?

221
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,117
Woo-gyun Kim.

222
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,662
He could barely stand still.

223
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,832
Why did he even go there
if he couldn't handle it?

224
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,875
He couldn't even finish it anyway.

225
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,169
What couldn't

226
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,131
Chief Kim finish?

227
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,553
I couldn't see everything
because of the curtains.

228
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,598
It looked like he was
pressing down on her face,

229
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,771
but he fled in the middle of it
looking terrified. That's all I saw.

230
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,817
Okay.

231
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,652
Don't tell my husband.

232
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,824
I'll keep that in mind.

233
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,396
Next news is about the MND.

234
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,275
The Ministry of National Defense
announced its plan to import

235
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,236
a detection radar system manufactured
by a Ukraine company, L Defense.

236
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,448
This importation, which was mediated
by the consortium

237
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,991
of Hanjo Group and The Bahn Group,

238
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,328
will take up 20 percent
of this year's national defense budget.

239
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,503
Hong Kong, crane.

240
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,046
PROSECUTOR DONG-JAE SEO

241
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,384
I told you that I'd help you.

242
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,761
I got a recording.

243
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,680
It's Mr. Lee's secret conversation
with Chairman Lee.

244
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,432
What does "Hong Kong, crane" mean?

245
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,476
They'll import cranes from Hong Kong.

246
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,270
That five-way meeting
must've been about this.

247
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,856
What does the Ministry of National Defense
have to do with it?

248
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,692
They must be planning to sell them
to the military on a big scale.

249
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,860
What about Matsuyama then?

250
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,113
They have a factory in Hong Kong.

251
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,032
Hanjo manufactures heavy equipment too.
Why would they import them?

252
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,660
Hey, why do we import
cars and clothes then?

253
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,911
Do we have none in the country?

254
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,080
That must be all you know for certain.

255
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,456
Forget it if you don't believe me.

256
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,125
They even made sure
they wouldn't be bugged,

257
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,417
but you don't have to believe me.

258
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,092
Goodness, that douche.
He is not even buying it.

259
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,818
Manufactured by a Ukraine company,
L Defense...

260
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,861
Crane.

261
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,029
Announced its plan to import
a detection radar system...

262
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,447
They'll import cranes from Hong Kong.

263
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,700
The Ministry of National Defense
announced...

264
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,077
Hanjo Group and the Minister
have joined hands.

265
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,871
Chairman Cho of The Bahn Group too.

266
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,123
Ukraine.

267
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,543
A five-way meeting with Matsuyama?

268
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,721
Hanjo and The Bahn mediated the deal

269
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,390
so that National Defense
could purchase the weapon from Europe.

270
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,975
How did it go in Hannam-dong?

271
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,895
There is no role for a Japanese company
to play, so why...

272
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,688
Mr. Hwang?

273
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,902
Why did Yun-beom Lee meet up
with the Minister of National Defense

274
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,906
and a Japanese weapons company instead of
someone from a European company?

275
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,324
Is something bothering you?

276
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,326
Why did he gather them together?

277
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,411
Pardon?

278
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,523
What are you doing?

279
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,612
I see you often these days.

280
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,782
What brings you here?

281
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,700
As you can see.

282
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,619
What about you? Is someone ill?

283
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,287
I'll help you. Which ward are you heading?

284
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,664
Don't worry. I'll carry it.

285
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,833
You make male juniors do it for you.
I can do it too.

286
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,294
I'm worried that you might
run away with it.

287
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,382
You said you're here to visit someone.
Did you come empty-handed?

288
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,679
I bet you didn't even think about it
as you're preoccupied with other thoughts.

289
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,348
What other thoughts?

290
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,851
Don't you think it's too late
to put on an act?

291
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,354
It looks like we're here to see
the same person.

292
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,280
Don't worry. I won't tell on you.

293
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,285
You and I have different goals.

294
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,619
We sure do.

295
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,998
You must be here to ask her
if Chang-jun Lee is the culprit.

296
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,166
You must be here to confirm
with her that he is not

297
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,876
because you work for him now.

298
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,628
You've gotten quite ballsy.

299
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,630
I apologize.

300
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,965
Let's check.

301
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,263
-Who are you?
-Just a second, please.

302
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,146
I'm from the Blue House.

303
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,692
Goodness, this must've been
devastating for you.

304
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,570
I should've visited sooner.

305
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,701
I'm here to see how she is doing.

306
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,370
Who are you?

307
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,582
I'm the prosecutor who was
in charge of Ga-young's case.

308
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,417
I currently work at the Blue House though.

309
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,585
Pardon me?

310
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,508
Hello, I'm Prosecutor Eun-soo Young
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

311
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,260
I work with Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang.

312
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,471
I see.

313
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,975
It looks like you trust Si-mok
more than the Blue House.

314
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,355
Yes, you should.
You're doing the right thing.

315
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,106
Ma'am.

316
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,194
I'm sorry to bother Ga-young,
but may I show her a photo?

317
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,695
Sure.

318
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,497
Ga-young, could you take a look
at this photo?

319
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,630
Have you seen this man?

320
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,760
Do you know him?

321
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,646
Hey!

322
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,109
Sir, please drive fast.

323
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,667
-Ga-young.
-Doctor!

324
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,085
-Doctor!
-Ga-young, what's wrong?

325
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,754
-Ga-young, are you okay?
-What's the matter?

326
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,008
Ga-young, can you hear me?

327
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,343
Ga-young.

328
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,150
Have you seen this man?

329
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,732
You'd better not do that again.

330
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:37,942
Sorry?

331
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,529
Mr. Chief Secretary now has
the power to hurt someone like you

332
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,864
without any effort at all.

333
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,701
You might get in huge trouble if you use
the same approach you used on me.

334
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,412
The approach I used on you?

335
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,041
Don't you remember?

336
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,710
What would you have done
if I actually was the culprit?

337
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,962
The day I strangled you,

338
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,299
I couldn't sleep at all that night.

339
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,594
What would you have done
if I did something to you out of anger?

340
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,096
What would it have done to my life?

341
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,809
I'm sorry about that time.

342
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,354
I didn't bring it up to get an apology.

343
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,899
I trained at the institute too.

344
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,027
I didn't go to the top university,

345
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,489
but I also learned from your father
when he was a professor.

346
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,534
I also want things to go well for you.

347
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,664
I didn't know that you thought that way.

348
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,292
I'm not the type to show
those things, you know.

349
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,752
Sorry?

350
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,468
What did Si-mok say?

351
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,596
He even did the official briefing,
so you must've heard some things.

352
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,306
Have they discovered anything new?

353
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,392
You see him often.

354
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,478
I rarely see him these days.

355
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,774
Let's go.

356
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,237
I'm busy because I work
at the Blue House now.

357
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,661
Is that why you gave me those tips?

358
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,871
What?

359
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,790
Was it because you wanted
things to go well for me?

360
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,168
Yes.

361
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,673
I've only realized it now,
but you've already left the prosecution.

362
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,803
What are you talking about?
I'll be a prosecutor forever.

363
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,180
I'll be sure to go back
and become a chief prosecutor,

364
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,266
so prepare yourself for then
as I'll make you work hard.

365
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,351
Okay.

366
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,278
Have you seen this man? Do you know him?

367
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,738
Do you know this man?

368
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,160
It was the same person.

369
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,787
Why did she react
like that only this time?

370
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,386
SUNGMOON DAILY

371
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,896
CEO OF SUNGMOON DAILY
BYUNG-HYUN KIM

372
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,523
You must be very busy these days.

373
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,069
-Thanks to you.
-That's true.

374
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,864
The special investigation was launched
because we exposed it.

375
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,158
What brings you here by the way?

376
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,578
You know who sent you the information
on the bribery suspicion, don't you?

377
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,999
Isn't your job investigating the message?

378
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,918
Why are you so fixated on the messenger?

379
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,630
Even the Special Prosecutor is only
obsessed with tracking down the informant.

380
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,590
How sad.

381
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,593
Was the target Western Seoul
Prosecutors' Office or Hanjo Group?

382
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,553
The effects of exposing
the bribery scandal

383
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,390
would go beyond the prosecution
and affect Hanjo as well.

384
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,642
You must've been aware of it.

385
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,107
Judging from how aggressive you are,
you must be holding something.

386
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,776
Well, open your hand
and show me what you got.

387
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,569
Please answer my question first.

388
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,947
Why did you go ahead and publish

389
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,784
a story on the suspicions
without any details?

390
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,417
Well, the reason is quite personal.

391
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,211
You might get disappointed.

392
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,589
If it had not been personal, I would've
discovered about it before coming here.

393
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,932
You're an interesting man.

394
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,064
You know that the chairman
of Hanjo has a daughter, right?

395
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,693
Ms. Yeon-jae Lee?

396
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,237
She is Mr. Chief Secretary's wife.

397
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,032
Well, Yeon-jae could've been my wife.

398
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:57,910
Then,

399
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,747
are you saying that it was

400
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,875
because of a woman
you dated over a decade ago?

401
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,502
Don't you know what it means
to marry the daughter

402
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,796
of Hanjo's chairman?

403
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,842
If that lowborn prick
hadn't stolen her from me,

404
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,470
Sungmoon's headquarter would've been mine,

405
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,016
not a small subsidiary like this.

406
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,311
Who knows about it?

407
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,731
-My family knew that we dated.
-No.

408
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,357
The informant must be someone

409
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,361
who knows you're still holding grudges
against him because of it.

410
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,988
That's why he sent

411
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,115
the information
to Sungmoon Daily intentionally.

412
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,956
The person who sent that letter

413
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,834
is a high school girl.

414
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:48,961
A high school girl?

415
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,715
She said that someone gave her
100,000 won and asked her to do it.

416
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,593
She was asked to send the letter here.
Since it was just a letter,

417
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,430
she thought,
"It wouldn't be a terror attack."

418
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,518
Who is the person that gave her money?

419
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,355
All she remembers is
that it was a middle-aged man.

420
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,317
By the way, Mr. Hwang.

421
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,488
You said I'm holding "grudges." Right?

422
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,449
Even my parents don't know how I feel.

423
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,326
Who would've known?

424
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,745
I need that girl's information.

425
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,040
You're asking for too much for free.

426
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,129
What are you holding? What makes you think
that you can be this demanding?

427
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,256
Then, let's do this.

428
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,342
National Defense announced
its plan to import a weapon.

429
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,302
Yes, I'm aware.

430
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,222
L Defense, a company known
as its manufacturer,

431
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,516
and Matsuyama, a Japanese weapons company.

432
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,768
Dig into the relationship between the two.

433
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,149
What does Japan have to do
with that import?

434
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,985
You'll want to discover
who really manufactured

435
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,696
the weapon.

436
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,119
I'll send you the girl's information.

437
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,001
I probably won't have to tell you this,

438
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,712
but please forget what I told you earlier

439
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,338
about my past relationship.

440
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,685
Assemble everyone.

441
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,035
The informant must've known
about all of these three things.

442
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,038
The relationship between
Chang-jun Lee and Moo-sung Park.

443
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,208
The marriage talk between Sungmoon
and Hanjo which was called off a long ago.

444
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,587
Most of all, the old grudges the CEO
of Sungmoon Daily has been harboring.

445
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,757
Who can know all of these things?

446
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,809
SUNGMOON DAILY

447
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,479
Was the Weapon
Actually Manufactured in Japan?

448
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,817
Was the Weapon
Actually Manufactured in Japan?

449
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,542
A grenade gets destroyed after explosion,

450
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,836
but this is a radar system.

451
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,464
It's completely computer-controlled.

452
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,966
If it was made in Japan...

453
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,218
They could plant something in it.

454
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,888
Now that L Defense, which was known
as a Ukraine company,

455
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:50,184
has turned out to be one
of Matsuyama's subsidiaries,

456
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,853
the question is whether or not Hanjo,
The Bahn Group

457
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,690
and the Ministry of National Defense
colluded with each other and falsified

458
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,693
the manufacturer information,
fully knowing what they were doing.

459
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,864
It's similar to what we got
from our research, don't you think?

460
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,575
-Yes.
-It's causing a big stir on the internet.

461
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,456
-"Those companies betrayed our country."
-My goodness.

462
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,208
"The Minister must get fired."

463
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,376
"This is simply unacceptable."

464
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,380
It must be affecting Hanjo
and The Bahn quite seriously.

465
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,842
Si-mok, did you give Sungmoon
the information?

466
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,927
-Yes.
-Why?

467
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,180
We could've exposed it ourselves
as part of the special investigation.

468
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,517
By the time we figured out who's behind

469
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,395
the company no one has heard of
in a small country in Europe,

470
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,522
the import would've been completed.

471
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,107
There will be serious consequences too.

472
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,859
That's true.

473
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,236
Sungmoon can attack Hanjo like that,

474
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,447
but we would've been slain had we done it.

475
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,199
But will the CEO of Sungmoon

476
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,368
keep the information
you gave him to himself?

477
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:54,206
For the Chief Secretary, finding fault
with Sungmoon and threatening them

478
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,624
will be too easy.

479
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,219
Because of the returned cultural assets,

480
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,139
Matsuyama's public image
is at its best at the moment.

481
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,184
I told you that all congressmen
are enthusiastically welcoming the plan.

482
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,229
The public criticism will die down soon.
We've been through this before.

483
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,068
This can have a severe impact
on the country's reputation.

484
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,235
The work is already...

485
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm letting you join us
and eat what's already been cooked.

486
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,662
All you need to do is just enjoy it.
Are you going to chicken out alone?

487
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,251
All right. You should attend the meeting.

488
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,420
Let's talk again soon.

489
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,764
Who is the rat that did this?

490
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,563
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

491
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,023
What should I talk about first?

492
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,778
Shall I start with
how you tend to like female singers?

493
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,323
Or would it be more interesting to talk
about how well-versed your company is

494
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,491
in real estate?

495
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,663
What I find more interesting is
the fact that you're interested

496
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,374
in such matters.

497
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,841
SI-MOK HWANG

498
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,013
You didn't even hesitate.

499
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,143
It has caused such a stir.

500
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,312
You could've just asked me to tell you

501
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,189
without bothering with this hassle.

502
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,110
I won't see you out.

503
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,529
You went through hoops
to make this position yours.

504
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,074
It's too bad that the President's
term of office will end soon.

505
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,579
I'll just have to do my best

506
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,665
to serve my guest during his time of stay.

507
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,960
I heard that business tycoons say this.

508
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,256
"Even presidents are temporary guests."

509
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,179
It looks like you think

510
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,726
that you've actually become
part of that family now.

511
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,061
I'm off.

512
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,615
It didn't leak from me as I've never let
that happen in the last 30 years.

513
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,576
There is a rat

514
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,245
around you.

515
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,837
Where is Mr. Seo?

516
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,131
He went to the annex.

517
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,552
A guest will arrive from Ukraine tomorrow.
Please keep it confidential

518
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,554
and book a room at Triple Hotel.

519
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,890
Don't tell Mr. Seo either.

520
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,226
-Yes, sir.
-Tell him to meet me here when he is back.

521
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,477
Yes, sir.

522
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:10,569
CHIEF SECRETARY OF BLUE HOUSE
CHANG-JUN LEE

523
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,285
Yes, I figured it out.

524
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,580
Your guess was right, Father.

525
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,375
What should we do?

526
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,420
Okay.

527
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,973
Did you want to see me, sir?

528
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,642
I'm expecting a guest
from Ukraine tomorrow.

529
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,227
Book a room at Myeongdong Hotel.

530
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,106
-No problem, sir.
-Ms. Yang and others don't need to know.

531
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,732
Yes, sir.

532
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,579
What are you doing?

533
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,462
Get me the prosecutor general.

534
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,680
Young people these days

535
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,724
are fearless.

536
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:38,115
Shall we summon even those
who were just treated to meals and drinks?

537
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,993
I don't know how I feel
about the word "just" in there,

538
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:45,289
but if we summon even those people,
the office will be turned upside down.

539
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:50,002
Let's focus on reciprocity
and discover if they returned his favors.

540
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,504
Right, but it's not easy to prove

541
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,757
whether there was reciprocity or not.

542
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,176
Anyway, all right.

543
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,014
Let's eat something.

544
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,851
What shall we order today?
We've been ordering in every day.

545
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,318
Let's have a team dinner.

546
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,070
-We've never had one.
-I'm in!

547
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,405
We've arrested corrupt prosecutors.

548
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,657
A corrupt police officer too.

549
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,159
-Also, a corrupt company...
-We told the media.

550
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,827
-We told the media about them.
-That's right!

551
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,845
Aren't we going?

552
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,515
-Yes!
-Nice!

553
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,141
I'm so excited!

554
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,020
What should we say
if anyone asks us what we do?

555
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,440
Goodness. We'll just tell them
that we work at a bread factory.

556
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,858
Bread! That's funny.

557
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,986
Yes, Mr. Public Prosecutor General.

558
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,490
Pardon me?

559
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,042
Understood, sir.

560
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,754
Why did he call?

561
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,972
Please stay here and don't let anyone in.

562
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,684
What's going on? What did
the Public Prosecutor General say?

563
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,688
"The prosecution is ordering
the special investigation team

564
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,440
to be disbanded immediately.

565
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,734
All data and information
regarding the team's investigation

566
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,487
must be transferred
to the central investigation department."

567
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,744
Please wait for me here.

568
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,716
Shall we put up barricades or something?

569
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,918
What is the reason, sir?

570
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,006
You've done enough.

571
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,967
No, there is more work to be done.
It's not over yet.

572
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,345
Just end it.

573
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,181
Whose order is it?

574
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,476
How dare you.

575
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,978
The order came from me,
and it's my decision.

576
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,189
"Someone who shows the way forward.

577
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,484
-Someone who can lead others by example."
-Be quiet.

578
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,946
You told me to show everyone
that is how we actually are.

579
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,989
Where did that person go?

580
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,284
You've already arrested your colleagues
as well as a police chief.

581
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,495
Do you want to turn everything
upside down or what?

582
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,830
Even people at the western office
are against it now

583
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,083
although it's the office you belong to.

584
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,751
Think about the entire prosecution.

585
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,670
If the western office's opposition
is the problem...

586
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,649
We dare ask you for a favor, sir.

587
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,943
The special investigation team

588
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,280
must not be disbanded.

589
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:47,823
Please withdraw it.

590
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:59,251
Are you ganging up against me to coerce me
into withdrawing my decision?

591
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,963
I have the responsibility and duty

592
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,340
to protect our organization.

593
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,343
Please protect the reason
why the prosecution exists, sir.

594
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,973
Our job is meaningless if all we can do
is breathe quietly as if we're dead.

595
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,562
Exercising my authority
won't resolve this situation.

596
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,147
This comes down to our pride.

597
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,232
You must not succumb, sir.

598
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,443
How dare you say that I'm succumbing?

599
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,404
I made the call. It is my decision.

600
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,782
Neither you nor we own the prosecution.

601
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,034
More importantly,

602
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,412
it absolutely cannot be used to serve
someone's personal needs.

603
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,914
It's just 20 days.

604
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,711
Please allow us to keep the amount
of time we were initially given.

605
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,720
Since when did we have to beg
for time for investigations, sir?

606
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,081
BRIBERY CASE INVOLVING PROSECUTORS,
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

607
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,879
There is nobody.

608
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,341
I guess no one knows
about our disbandment yet.

609
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:32,260
It's more frightening when things
like this get done quietly.

610
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,346
Are we chess pieces or what?

611
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,431
They kept doing whatever
they want with us.

612
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,893
I think this happened
because we struck against Hanjo.

613
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,103
But Sungmoon exposed it.

614
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,272
Finding their source
must've been a piece of cake for Hanjo.

615
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:48,235
Things usually end on a bad note
when problems like this arise.

616
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,239
-We'll probably get demoted.
-Or get pushed out.

617
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,173
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

618
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,928
I didn't do it for you.

619
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,681
I just didn't want to feel ashamed.

620
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,600
I was so scared thinking
that he might tell us to resign.

621
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,561
Goodness, same here.

622
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,771
That should've been
a chief prosecutor's job.

623
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,231
Who will be our chief prosecutor?

624
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,608
Why are they taking such a long time
to fill the position?

625
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,110
CHIEF PROSECUTOR

626
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,990
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

627
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,492
Please check the number you have dialed.

628
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,580
PROSECUTOR DONG-JAE SEO

629
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,253
Please let Mr. Chief Secretary know.

630
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,816
Excuse me, Mr. Chief Secretary.

631
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,257
JUDGE'S BENCH

632
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,232
Thank you for coming all the way here.

633
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,568
You had to come all the way here too.

634
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,073
Come to think of it, it was right here.

635
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,952
This is where I first met you

636
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,162
when you were a prosecutor.

637
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,836
I guess you're getting old too.

638
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,046
Seeing you talk about the old days.

639
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,174
It was a lawsuit against the government.

640
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,011
"The prosecution would obviously
side with the government."

641
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,681
That's what everyone was expecting,

642
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,850
but what you did was
the exact opposite of that.

643
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:26,434
That day,

644
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,521
I set a direction
on what kind of prosecutor

645
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,606
I should become.

646
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,946
It sounds like you're saying
you thought of me as your role model.

647
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,574
Yes.

648
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:47,664
I must say, having power is great.
It got those barbs out of your words.

649
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,250
Look at you trying to butter me up.

650
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,835
Also,

651
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,172
you're my target now.

652
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,137
What frightened you so much
three years ago that you had to destroy

653
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,722
the person who was like a father to you?

654
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,058
What is scaring you now

655
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,185
that you had to disband us?

656
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,230
Scared?

657
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,861
Why do you think I sent you to that team?

658
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,197
It's because you kept getting in my way.

659
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,533
The same goes for this time.

660
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,496
You got in my way.

661
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,460
That must mean

662
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:38,298
that I'm heading in the right direction.

663
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,009
So?

664
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,764
Did you want me to come all the way here
to tell me that I'm now your target?

665
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,267
Do you want to tell me that we'll see
each other here in the near future?

666
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,269
As a prosecutor and a defendant?

667
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,272
Only you would know

668
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,691
whether or not you're at the end
of what I'm chasing.

669
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,862
You won't be able to do it.

670
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,365
You can't make me stand here.

671
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,325
Absolutely not.

672
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,371
Did you just admit that you're indeed
at the end of what I'm after?

673
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,081
I will never

674
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,918
stand before you as a defendant.

675
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,968
I'll work harder.

676
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,011
All right.

677
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,516
You should've worn your judicial robe.
You would've looked very cool.

678
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:49,911
PROSECUTION

679
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,593
What is going on?
This is driving me crazy.

680
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,179
If we actually get disbanded,

681
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,432
will you be all right, Lieutenant Han?

682
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,893
-Why do you ask?
-You'll have to return to the station.

683
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,312
After all, you arrested Chief Kim
a couple of days ago.

684
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,069
Detective Jang ran away
at the perfect time.

685
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,571
He must be very clever.

686
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,699
He didn't run away.
Please don't joke about it.

687
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,908
Sorry.

688
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,871
It's me.

689
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,667
What happened?

690
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,379
What did he say?

691
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,091
We're not disbanded.

692
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,766
Goodness, I was so worried thinking that
I might have to go back to being jobless.

693
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,226
Is that what you've been worrying about

694
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,644
-all this time?
-I thought...

695
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,855
All right, you all. We have to do
something to celebrate.

696
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,025
-Let's do what we were going to do.
-Today might not be the best day for it.

697
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,778
We did receive an order to disband
even though it's been withdrawn.

698
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,572
Right, if someone sees us
eating and drinking on a day like this...

699
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,536
We can do it at a place
where no one can spot us.

700
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,415
-Is there such a place?
-A garden party!

701
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,961
Great!

702
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,130
Let's go. Come on.

703
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,341
-Shouldn't we pick another day?
-Why?

704
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,979
Request for tax reassessment must be
made by this week. Don't forget!

705
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,591
Did I mishear it?

706
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,478
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG

707
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:27,944
Thank you.

708
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,112
Ta-da.

709
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,323
-Perilla leaves.
-Pass it to me.

710
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,784
Don't they look delicious?
They're homemade.

711
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,744
-Amazing.
-I didn't make them though.

712
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,831
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food.

713
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,834
Mr. Hwang! Ms. Young is calling you.

714
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,587
Ms. Young?
The one who left in tears, right?

715
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,423
The lady who looks like Tang Wei?

716
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,924
I think Si-mok has been seeing her.

717
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:51,801
Sorry?

718
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,595
She looks like Tang Wei.

719
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,180
No, not about that.

720
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,222
Then what?

721
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,392
The number you have dialed...

722
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,336
Hello?

723
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,257
Isn't this Mr. Si-mok Hwang's phone?

724
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,542
By the way, we're missing
the most important thing.

725
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,502
I can't digest meat without it.

726
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,505
I know, right?
My throat's been feeling dry too.

727
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,798
-I'll go pick some up.
-Don't.

728
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,301
-Just wait.
-Are we getting something delivered?

729
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,179
Gosh.

730
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:22,809
Goodness, I really shouldn't have
left like that.

731
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,019
This is stressing me out so much.

732
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,358
-You're that...
-Pardon me?

733
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,986
Are you here for that too?

734
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,655
Are you a member
of the special investigation team?

735
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,202
Goodness, that must be Jung-bon.

736
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,788
I bet that's Jung-bon.

737
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,666
-Let's go.
-Sure.

738
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,042
What's that?

739
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,921
Goodness, look at you.

740
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,631
I'm here.

741
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,174
My goodness, you brought booze!

742
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,720
-Nice.
-We have booze now!

743
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,013
Goodness, I'm here too.

744
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,098
Please come join us.

745
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,435
-Ms. Young!
-My goodness!

746
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,061
Welcome.

747
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,563
-Hello.
-I'm here too, you know.

748
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,480
Goodness, move over.

749
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,941
-Ms. Young, please have a seat here.
-Sure, thank you.

750
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,276
He got this too.

751
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,655
-Welcome.
-Please sit.

752
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,742
I hope I'm not intruding.

753
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,994
Why are you asking me?
This isn't my place.

754
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,496
Goodness, are you going to be mean
to my guest?

755
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,666
You all are so unfair.

756
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,710
-I'll be off then. Bye.
-Just grill the meat.

757
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,005
Goodness, I shouldn't have come.

758
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,008
This must be shoulder meat.

759
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,719
I got expensive jowl meat,
and you're calling it shoulder meat.

760
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,888
Try it again. You obviously
don't know how to taste meat.

761
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,056
Alright. Here are your drinks.

762
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,933
-Pass them around.
-Pass them around.

763
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:46,893
Pass them around.

764
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,645
The other way too.

765
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,483
All right. Let's drink now.

766
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,609
Hold on a second.

767
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,194
I take herbal medicine these days.

768
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,863
Drinking occasionally will make
your medicine more effective.

769
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,156
No, that's not what I meant.

770
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,076
I'm sorry about that time.

771
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,495
-You're a real man.
-Look at you.

772
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:09,123
-Cheers!
-Cheers! Drink up, everyone!

773
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,714
I'll peel them.

774
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,508
You don't have to.

775
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,301
-I'll use this.
-Sure.

776
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,140
Actually...

777
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,142
Yes?

778
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,103
Are you and Mr. Hwang...

779
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,775
Never mind.

780
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,362
Wow, it's delicious.

781
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,783
Thank you.

782
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,829
-For what?
-For inviting me here.

783
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,165
Thank you for coming.

784
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,754
Sorry, can I use your washroom?

785
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,840
Yes, of course. It's over there.

786
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,184
It'd be great if you can just bring out
the drinks.

787
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,185
No problem.

788
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,022
Where does she keep forks?

789
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,326
Thank you.

790
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,583
My goodness! No.

791
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,834
I'm so sorry. Goodness.

792
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,963
-I'm really sorry.
-Ms. Young.

793
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,549
Just tell me if I ever hurt your feelings.

794
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,259
My gosh, your shirt is completely soaked.

795
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,100
By the way, what's this? Is it a tattoo?

796
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,102
Are you still...

797
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,397
What happened? My goodness.

798
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,232
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay. Just leave it.

799
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,609
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

800
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,444
You're soaked. My goodness.

801
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,361
Goodness.

802
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,864
-It's okay. I'll do it.
-I'm sorry. I'll clean it.

803
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,617
No, it's really okay.
My goodness, be careful with this.

804
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,713
Zero. Seven.

805
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,270
-You don't peel them?
-I know, right?

806
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,355
That was ridiculous.

807
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,234
You're not supposed to dip it that way.

808
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,779
By the way, what's this? Is it a tattoo?

809
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,407
Come to think about it, it was hilarious.

810
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,959
What was that?

811
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,987
STRANGER

812
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,656
The things you know about...

813
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,116
Trust me and let me do this.

814
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,786
It seems Si-mok Hwang's met Il-jae Young.

815
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:58,120
We shouldn't let him be anymore.

816
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,456
And find someone for the plan.

817
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,958
Go and get it.

818
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,168
-What Ga-young said.
-She'll remember everything soon.

819
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,461
It's just a matter of time.

820
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,963
It's just a matter of time, indeed.

821
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,382
-At the hospital, Ga-young and some man...
-Want me to go there?

822
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,133
I thought someone was opening the door.

823
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,051
Who is this?

824
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,095
Who did you say entered my house?

825
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,263
She's not near the hospital.
I'll keep looking.

826
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,015
A dead body's been reported just now.

827
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,894
