1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,171
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,965
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,219
Prosecutor Seo doggedly searched
articles about his death.

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,596
Bastards.

5
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,932
Did your late husband usually
not use a GPS when he drove?

6
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,810
There's only a small chance that
he knew the route well.

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,688
I might be trying too hard
to link the case to Prosecutor Seo.

8
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,357
It might be that I'm holding
on to useless pieces.

9
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,484
Chief Choi Bit?

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,403
Find out what relationship she had
with Park Gwang-su,

11
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,030
the lawyer who died from a heart attack.

12
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:12,947
Mr. Baek Jung-gi.

13
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,034
You're under arrest
for kidnapping and confinement.

14
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,993
What?

15
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,453
Bring the witness here!

16
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,704
Why did you do it?

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,249
It's not because of the money.
It's because I accused a cop.

18
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,252
You weren't here on the 26th, were you?

19
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,505
-You didn't see anything, did you?
-I really was here.

20
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,882
-Why would you go this far?
-Damn it.

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,676
What do you mean why?

22
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,351
EPISODE 12

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,313
If anyone saw my husband…

24
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,065
I beg of you.

25
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,068
Please call us.

26
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,780
Ten million won?

27
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,911
The witness is here. Come on in.

28
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,628
Is he here?

29
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,096
He came here knowing
that the suspect is a cop.

30
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,014
So he knew who to pick.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,394
He said he would've picked him out even if
he wasn't wearing the uniform.

32
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,187
How?

33
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,231
He said gamblers can tell whether someone

34
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,233
is a card shark or an undercover cop.

35
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,986
That lunatic. He doesn't even realize
what he has done.

36
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,656
Too bad we have to hand him over
to the prosecution.

37
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,116
I wish we could take him.

38
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,619
Had the central office
acted just a day later,

39
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,204
we could've worked on it.

40
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,874
This is why we're fighting for
investigative authority.

41
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,709
Anyway, good work.

42
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,043
Thank Prosecutor Hwang--

43
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,671
Tell him I said, "Good job."

44
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,007
Sure thing. Have a good night, ma'am.

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,593
Okay, thanks for taking care of it
until so late.

46
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,235
Chief Choi said you did a good job.

47
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,237
She also thanked you.

48
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,697
Okay.

49
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,787
Hey.

50
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,751
Do you want to grab a drink?

51
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,037
Drink slowly, or you'll get throat cancer.

52
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,332
It's cold.

53
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,126
Why worry about my throat?

54
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,921
Why did you want to meet?

55
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,009
I thought you'd be beating yourself up
because of Prosecutor Hwang.

56
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,431
I was just curious to see
the state you were in.

57
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,643
You must be upset.
You were even on the radio.

58
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,229
Of course, I had to.

59
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,190
I'll do anything
no matter who I'm up against.

60
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,485
Why did you really want to see me?

61
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,077
I'm wondering if I should meet
Park Gwang-su's wife

62
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,335
and ask her what she told
Prosecutor Hwang when she saw him.

63
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,464
Am I overreacting?

64
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,093
I'm not worried about her.

65
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,972
If my husband's colleague
came to see me and said,

66
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
"Your late husband was actually
doing dirty work for conglomerates.

67
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,480
He must've told you about Hanjo.

68
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,232
We found out about it
shortly after the accident,

69
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,652
but he had already passed away,
and the lobbying attempt had failed.

70
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,364
And he used to work in the prosecution,
so we covered it up, but…"

71
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,326
I'm sorry I have to bring this up,

72
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:14,207
but some are questioning what your husband
had been up to before the accident.

73
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,876
We may have to reinvestigate the case,

74
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,629
but Hwang Si-mok,
the prosecutor in charge,

75
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,007
never even met Gwang-su
while he was alive.

76
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,843
So you must do as I say.

77
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,013
Whether it's about him drinking or Hanjo,
do not say anything.

78
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,849
If you care about your husband

79
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:36,270
and the prosecutors
who covered for him back then.

80
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,607
I care, of course.

81
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,901
How could I not?

82
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,030
If he said something like that,

83
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,449
I'd never tell him anything.

84
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,956
You said
you're not worried about the wife.

85
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,251
Are you saying that you're worried
about something else?

86
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,513
Park Gwang-su is dead,

87
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,932
and we know his wife won't talk.

88
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,229
And Hanjo definitely won't call
Prosecutor Hwang over for a confession.

89
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,313
What's the problem?

90
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,485
There might be someone else

91
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,863
who knows about it.

92
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,698
What?

93
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,827
-Do you know Oh Ju-seon?
-Woo Ju-seon?

94
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,539
No, not "Woo Ju-seon."

95
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,543
Remember the couple
who removed the warning sign in Tongyeong?

96
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,086
He was their lawyer.

97
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,588
Okay, what about him?

98
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,177
When he came to see me as
Director Kim's lawyer a little while ago,

99
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,346
he said this to me.

100
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,725
Namyangju, for me,
brings back bad memories…

101
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,311
He was in a car accident
at the beginning of last year…

102
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,606
That it reminded him of his colleague
who died on a highway in Namyangju.

103
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,983
What did? Seeing you?

104
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,152
To be exact,

105
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,572
he said that hearing about Namyangju
brought back that memory.

106
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,868
Who was the colleague he was referring to?

107
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,329
That he didn't say.

108
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,624
But I looked into it

109
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,212
and found out that he had volunteered
to take on Director Kim's case.

110
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,840
What? Why would a lawyer do that?

111
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,801
There was a reason.

112
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,640
Apparently, some people wanted
what Director Kim had done to stay hidden.

113
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,643
The higher-ups, you know.

114
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,271
I guess they hired a new lawyer for him.

115
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,566
That I understand, but…

116
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,069
The thing is,

117
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,323
Oh Ju-seon called me
two more times after that.

118
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,076
What a weirdo. Why did he call you?

119
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,744
Well…

120
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,623
Seeing how he referred to
Park Gwang-su as a colleague,

121
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,834
he might know something as well.

122
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,878
Damn it.

123
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,880
I was not expecting this.

124
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,591
Should I meet with him?

125
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,052
Should I ask him to meet up?

126
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,304
What if he causes problems?

127
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,147
Let's go. My kids are waiting for me.

128
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,865
Give me that. You're done, right?

129
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:35,866
I'll throw it out.

130
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,791
We should've removed Si-mok
from the team a long time ago.

131
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,045
Then we wouldn't have known
that the witness was lying.

132
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,925
Then will you let Senior Inspector Han
keep snooping around?

133
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,011
Watching those two,

134
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,763
it seems as if they share everything.

135
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,144
Why don't we resume
the council meeting first?

136
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,895
To keep them busy.

137
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,064
And to nag us about the authority?

138
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,818
Jeez.

139
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,004
I wonder if the culprit
will send anything else.

140
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,591
He shouldn't have stopped
if he wanted to show off.

141
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,301
He has no backbone.

142
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,095
We only received the photo two days ago.

143
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,221
Oh, really?

144
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,474
It feels so long ago.

145
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,601
No, it shouldn't be long ago.

146
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,563
Do you really think
it was sent by the culprit?

147
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,444
That's actually two questions
in one sentence.

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,030
Just like the fake witness,

149
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,741
was that photo sent by a fake culprit?

150
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,369
Or, because the police watch
was in the photo…

151
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,580
It was either a coincidence
or done deliberately.

152
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,376
Seeing how little we know,
are we totally off track now?

153
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,051
Excuse me. Can we get more cabbage?

154
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,010
Sure.

155
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,431
Even a deer can jump into your car
sometimes, right?

156
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,769
Right.
All kinds of accidents happen on the road.

157
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,853
What? A deer?

158
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,689
Thank you.

159
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,279
What do you think will happen if you drive
after drinking this much alcohol?

160
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,074
Did someone hit a deer
while driving under the influence?

161
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,078
His wife says
that he drank as much as others did,

162
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,996
but his secretary says the opposite.

163
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,665
This man died while driving.

164
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,833
That's odd.

165
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,169
Did he not get along with his wife?

166
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,338
Him and his wife? I'm not sure.

167
00:11:55,756 --> 00:12:00,010
The husband died
while driving under the influence,

168
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,680
and the wife said
he could drink quite a bit?

169
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,183
Was she trying to get back at him
for everything he put her through

170
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,269
because he was a nasty drunk?

171
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,441
His name is Park Gwang-su.
He was the chief of the Daejeon office.

172
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,445
He died last April,
while driving on a highway in Namyangju.

173
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,655
His blood-alcohol level was 0.018 percent.

174
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,325
That amount of alcohol
couldn't have killed him.

175
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,619
Right, he died of myocardial infarction.

176
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,622
And he had received angioplasty
in the past.

177
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,709
I see. Then he died from an illness.

178
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,085
What about it?

179
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,590
Right before Prosecutor Seo went missing,

180
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,550
he had pulled aside three files.

181
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,429
Three files on Segok Station,
the Dongducheon Chief, and Park Gwang-su.

182
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,763
Those three files.

183
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,641
I understand what the first two
were about, but Park Gwang-su?

184
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,060
Well, maybe it's not important.

185
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,229
But you think it may be connected.

186
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,194
Prosecutor Seo brought the first two
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

187
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,571
but left the third one in Uijeongbu.

188
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,699
Maybe he went through it
and concluded that it wasn't important.

189
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,368
But why did he check the file
to begin with?

190
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,372
The man died of a heart attack
on a highway. What could he…

191
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,251
Did you say Namyangju? Last year?

192
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,837
-Yes.
-Could it be that again?

193
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,383
My boss used to be the chief there.

194
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,010
Maybe he was trying to find fault

195
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,388
with Chief Choi in regard to the death
of the former chief prosecutor.

196
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,683
Just like how he approached
the bereaved in Tongyeong

197
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,268
and asked them tons of questions.

198
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,105
I'm not sure.
If his target was Chief Choi,

199
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,733
he would've brought the file
to the Supreme Office for sure.

200
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,443
Park Gwang-su…

201
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,363
Do you think we're wasting time?

202
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,991
What? My gosh, he was too young
to die of myocardial infarction.

203
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,744
He was 56, so yes. I'd say so.

204
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,456
The 25th class?
They're already in their 50s?

205
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,376
If he passed the exam late…

206
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,964
Right. He's from the 25th class.

207
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,301
There aren't many articles
about the accident.

208
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,387
No secondary damage.

209
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,348
Sir, you were in the 25th class, right?

210
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,768
Who is this? And why do you ask me that?

211
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,603
My apologies. It's me, Hwang Si-mok.

212
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,398
I know, you punk.
Aren't you going to say hello?

213
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,607
Hello, sir.

214
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,278
Are you driving now?

215
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,862
Yes, what's up?

216
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,576
May I stop by your office tomorrow?

217
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,743
Sure, whatever.

218
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,002
The second council meeting
has been scheduled. Get ready.

219
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,838
Did you hear anything about the council?

220
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,548
The council? No.

221
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,800
The second meeting has been scheduled.

222
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,510
What? When?

223
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,929
Wait, hold on. My goodness.

224
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,897
Hello, ma'am.
Do you have a moment to talk?

225
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,775
Has the second council meeting
been scheduled?

226
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,529
I was going to tell you tomorrow.
Who told you?

227
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,032
Are you still with Prosecutor Hwang?

228
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,242
Yes. The thing is, now's not a good time

229
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,578
because we're also
investigating that case.

230
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,996
Watching those two,

231
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,874
it seems as if they share everything.

232
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,543
No, it's fine.

233
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,507
Why is the investigation over?

234
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,761
We don't even know if he's alive.

235
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,180
If we wrap it up now,
then what about the victim?

236
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,640
It's all fieldwork now.

237
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,102
We stepped in for fear
that the police might be involved,

238
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,688
not because the victim is a prosecutor.

239
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,191
After all that's happened,

240
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,818
we must conclude
that we had nothing to do with it

241
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,488
and treat it as a regular criminal case.

242
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,711
And just between you and me,

243
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,632
we won't find him alive.

244
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,301
It's not like he went into hiding.

245
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,806
You know what happens when a healthy
adult male has been missing for this long.

246
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,895
Hand over the case before they put
the blame on HQ for failing to find him.

247
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,819
The investigation is over?

248
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,779
How so? We haven't found him yet.

249
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,740
Then can I keep investigating the case?

250
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,826
Let Uijeongbu handle it. It's their case.

251
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,830
Transferring the case
to another office now

252
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,581
wouldn't be helpful.

253
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,084
Then you should've done a better job.

254
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,128
What did you do for a week?

255
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,592
It's because the entire prosecution is
in danger now, not just Dong-jae.

256
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,219
Did something happen?

257
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,388
A new minister may be appointed.

258
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,141
I've gone through the list of candidates,

259
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,934
and we're going to be in trouble.

260
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,480
Let's disseminate the reformation bill.

261
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,857
Pardon me?

262
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,859
"It's nothing we can't do.

263
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,861
Even without the police,

264
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,113
we are capable of inspecting
our organization internally."

265
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,698
This should be our main argument.

266
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,160
They won't read it if it's too long,
so don't go over ten pages.

267
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,246
Ask Prosecutor Kim for any information
on the National Assembly.

268
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,915
-Yes, sir.
-And you, keep going to Yeouido.

269
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,501
-Secure more votes while you're there.
-Yes, sir.

270
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,421
There was a delay,
but the real war begins now.

271
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,425
The Criminal Procedure Code
will not be amended.

272
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,887
We must make sure it won't happen
at all costs. Understood?

273
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,722
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

274
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,493
The rest is in cloud storage.

275
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,581
2019 SPECIAL JUDICIAL REFORM COMMITTEE
TENTATIVE LIST

276
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,502
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE REFORM
PROJECTIONS BY PARTY

277
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,142
You said the HQ is out. Why come here?

278
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,727
Get ready for your meeting.

279
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,187
I'm totally ready.

280
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,898
I already have everything I need.
I just have to show up.

281
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,526
Yes, ma'am. I'll call you back.

282
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,236
What?

283
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,530
Goodness.

284
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,954
Well, the witness…

285
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,998
It turned out he didn't witness anything.

286
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,750
You may leave.

287
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,661
I should have stopped back then.

288
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,205
Just until the law changes…

289
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,881
No, we cannot accept bribes.

290
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,386
I could have

291
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,181
stopped then.

292
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,812
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

293
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,606
The percentage of arrest warrants

294
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,858
that are rejected by prosecutors
or judges.

295
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,944
The percentage of the cases
that get non-prosecution.

296
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,740
The police-prosecution ratio in regard
to the number of warrants requested

297
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,492
and prosecution's requests
that were rejected.

298
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,287
Pull all the data from 2010 to 2018.

299
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,916
Pardon? So nine years?

300
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,420
Look into abuse of authority cases again.
Find something worse.

301
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,715
Are you going to submit all of this
to the council?

302
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,550
No, it's for the director's interview.

303
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:24,097
We must prove that the prosecution's
double-screening process is ineffective

304
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,183
so there can't be any numerical errors.

305
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,605
NO NUMERICAL ERRORS

306
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,555
The returned performance bond was added
to the total revenue of Q1,

307
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,766
so the sum has greatly increased.

308
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,061
And people are now aware
that you're the one who landed us

309
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,980
the thermoelectric power plant deal.

310
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,566
As for the audit,
they'll broaden the investigation

311
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,778
to include all the way up to 2014,
before the damage occurred.

312
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,866
The situation and the numbers
seem positive.

313
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,536
Congratulations, ma'am.

314
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,748
Shall I tell Mr. Oh to stop?

315
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:39,548
Regarding Namyangju Chief's involvement
in the Park Gwang-su case,

316
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,008
we won't have any problems

317
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,593
if it stays this quiet.

318
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,429
Right.

319
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,350
Most importantly, the person
who brought up Choi Bit is now gone.

320
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,187
With everything going well,
we may end up drawing

321
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,109
unwanted attention if we carry on.

322
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,535
Tell Mr. Oh he no longer needs to contact
the National Police Agency.

323
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,454
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,374
Like you said, everything's going well.

325
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,835
Why don't you get off early
and get some rest?

326
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,962
You've been working
past midnight everyday.

327
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,006
I guess you have plans this evening.

328
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,425
-No, that's not why--
-Sure.

329
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,553
I'll get the car ready.

330
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,779
Ms. Lee is leaving early today.

331
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,198
-Tell the driver to get ready.
-Yes, sir.

332
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,628
Come in.

333
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,598
Mr. Oh called just now.

334
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,225
Choi Bit has asked to meet him.

335
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:14,893
Why, out of the blue?

336
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,147
He claims that his attempts to build
a rapport with her is paying off--

337
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,107
No.

338
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,651
Oh Ju-seon said he could do it,
but he was bluffing.

339
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,487
I know because I've heard men bluff
all my life.

340
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,449
There's no way the police
would approach him for no reason.

341
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,993
Shall I meet with Mr. Oh now?

342
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,620
Yes.

343
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,915
-Mr. Park.
-Yes, ma'am.

344
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,834
Take some cash with you.

345
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,503
And if the cop actually wants to meet him

346
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,381
because of his efforts
and doesn't have any ulterior motive,

347
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,385
then he'll need to know some things in
order to obtain useful info from Choi Bit.

348
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,721
How much did I tell him?

349
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,973
You told him to find out

350
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,642
the relationship between
Park Gwang-su and Choi Bit.

351
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,103
That's all you told him, ma'am.

352
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,897
Then don't tell him
about the vacation home.

353
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,109
Just tell him what he needs to know
to get us key intel.

354
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,196
Maybe just say we're saddened
by Park Gwang-su's death.

355
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,447
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,741
And make sure you don't mention
Seo Dong-jae.

357
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,994
Understood, ma'am.

358
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,013
Why don't you come in?

359
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,307
We can talk in the reception room.

360
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,154
-What--
-To cover your expenses.

361
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,199
Thank you.

362
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,995
Please let Ms. Lee know how grateful I am.

363
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,164
-So Chief Choi Bit contacted you first?
-Oh, that's…

364
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,834
You already told me
it was because of all your hard work.

365
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,840
But what could be the real reason
she contacted you out of the blue?

366
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,010
I don't think there's such a thing.

367
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:40,557
I asked her for intel on the director
of the Intelligence Bureau.

368
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,309
That's probably why.

369
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,692
We've asked you not to tell anyone
about your relationship with us.

370
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,194
You remember that, right?

371
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,905
-Of course.
-That includes your wife.

372
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,826
You've said nothing
about the work you do for us

373
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,954
to anyone you've met while on the job.

374
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,206
Correct?

375
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,710
Yes.

376
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,340
Mr. Oh?

377
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,260
Of course, never.

378
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,224
You told your wife.

379
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,518
-No, that's--
-Should I give your wife

380
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,687
a visit?

381
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,486
I didn't tell my wife.

382
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,406
And it wasn't anything related
to the job anyway.

383
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,744
I have to find out about Park Gwang-su's
relationship with Choi Bit.

384
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,039
I need something to work off of
to find out about that,

385
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,374
but Park Gwang-su is dead.

386
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,209
It's not like I can ask a dead man,

387
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,627
so I looked into it.

388
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,464
He and the chief of the Eastern Office
were colleagues in the Training Institute.

389
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,841
Chief of the Eastern Office?

390
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,844
You see, I'm not that naive.

391
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,473
I was the presiding judge
for the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

392
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,393
What did he say to you?

393
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,311
Gosh.

394
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,564
It'd be weird if I suddenly started
talking about a dead man.

395
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,568
They had initially hired
a different law firm,

396
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,905
but they suddenly came to us
and I ended up taking it on.

397
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,784
I wondered why they had to switch
to a different law firm.

398
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,577
I was like, "Was there a problem?"

399
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,997
So I tried to sound out the client

400
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,419
and found out that the lawyer
they had hired died unexpectedly.

401
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,214
Who died?

402
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:41,469
Do you happen to know
a man named Park Gwang-su?

403
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,141
Park Gwang-su?

404
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,142
How on earth…

405
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,478
I can't believe he asked him
of all people.

406
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,690
Hwang Si-mok obviously knows
that the two of them were colleagues.

407
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,192
He even came here and asked us
about Seo Dong-jae.

408
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,320
I bet he'll ask Kang Won-chul too.
Then what will Kang Won-chul say?

409
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,407
"How come both you and Oh Ju-seon
are asking about Park Gwang-su?"

410
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,495
And he calls himself a lawyer?

411
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,623
Kang Won-chul told him

412
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,085
they didn't stay in touch after graduating
from the Training Institute.

413
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,004
They never worked together.

414
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,840
So he didn't even get
any valuable information?

415
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,635
He thought he needed whatever
he could get to move things along,

416
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,429
so I think he just meant well.

417
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,975
I should've met with him separately
and told him what he needed to know.

418
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,560
It's my fault.

419
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,229
I'm sorry, ma'am.

420
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,774
Tell Oh Ju-seon

421
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,444
to contact Choi Bit
and agree to meet with her.

422
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,529
-Yes, ma'am.
-As for Kang Won-chul,

423
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,407
have Oh Ju-seon
arrange a meeting with him as well.

424
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,451
-So both of them?
-That's right.

425
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,661
We need insurance too.

426
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,122
I'll take care of it now.

427
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,882
People will say we're scheming
to expand our authority

428
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,842
if we insist on changing the law now.

429
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,721
Who's changing what law?

430
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,223
Well, I'm just saying.

431
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,310
PROSECUTION REFORMATION AGENDA

432
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,188
ALTERNATIVES FOR REFORMATION

433
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,276
What is this?

434
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,779
Come inside.

435
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,964
"People's distrust of the prosecution
comes from political bias.

436
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,967
The prosecution
must be separated from politics,

437
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,426
so the law should be revised…"

438
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,520
"There's a chapter on the court's
independence in the Constitution…"

439
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,230
You even brought up the Constitution?

440
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,067
"Besides the two phrases
regarding the request of warrants,

441
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,528
there is no constitutional device

442
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,031
that guarantees
the independence of the prosecution."

443
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,035
Are you crazy?
We're fighting not to get the law revised.

444
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,537
What is this nonsense?

445
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,462
Redo everything
except the corruption investigation.

446
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,340
You talk about political bias
in this situation?

447
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,758
You're being ridiculous!

448
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,177
Political bias doesn't necessarily mean

449
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,431
that we're getting along
with the political authority.

450
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,474
What I meant was
that the political situation--

451
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,518
Are you trying to lecture me?
How dare you!

452
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,400
You're smart. Good for you.

453
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,485
Why are you working here then?

454
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,947
Prosecutor Hwang. Get out.

455
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,001
What's with you?
He can have his own opinions.

456
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,961
Shut up. You get out too!

457
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,680
Hwang Si-mok.

458
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,681
Yes, sir.

459
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,363
He doesn't seem to mind getting yelled at.

460
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,407
He must have it easy

461
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,242
while we're the ones suffering.

462
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,494
You know why, right?

463
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,120
Yes.

464
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,081
So you do know.

465
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,251
I know you just did your job
and you did it right.

466
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,422
But from his perspective, you ruined
everything that was going well.

467
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,091
I see.

468
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,468
And from my perspective too.

469
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,889
You won't be told to take responsibility,

470
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,433
but if we can't keep
our investigative rights,

471
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,143
we'll be the first to lose our positions.

472
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,106
Things would have been different
if the culprit really was a cop.

473
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,857
It would have been a strong defense.

474
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,276
And the entire prosecution
would have stood behind it.

475
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,361
But now

476
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,446
it's gone.

477
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,907
Should I

478
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,785
apologize for that?

479
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,208
I'm saying you don't need
to take it personally.

480
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,920
Imagine how tough it'll be for someone

481
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,589
who's never taken a step back,
like Chief Woo.

482
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,466
I see.

483
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,552
Go on, then.

484
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,852
What are you doing?

485
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,905
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

486
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,824
About the witness, Jeon Gi-hyeok…

487
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,617
Do you have any data left on him?

488
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,119
Do you need something?

489
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,288
I have some files saved here.

490
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,831
I heard he had criminal records.

491
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,167
I want to know which offices
were in charge.

492
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,793
Hang on.

493
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,797
Jeon Gi-hyeok…

494
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,134
He was fined by the Northern Seoul
Prosecutors' Office at first.

495
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,136
It was for fake gift cards.

496
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,848
And Northern Seoul again in 2016,
and Seongnam in 2017.

497
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,183
Both for speculative acts.

498
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,935
Which division in Seongnam?

499
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,647
Criminal Division Two.

500
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,108
Okay. Thank you.

501
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,742
Things would've been different
if the culprit really was a cop.

502
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,786
It would have been a strong defense.

503
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,956
From his perspective, you ruined
everything that was going well.

504
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,958
And from my perspective too.

505
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,470
There are statistics for each year
until 2015.

506
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,223
And then some explanation,

507
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,933
and more statistics after that.

508
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,392
And then the conclusion?

509
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:08,272
Yes, I'm stating that the police take on
far more cases than the prosecution do,

510
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,733
so we inevitably have
more indictments than them.

511
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,821
And I'm explaining that the prosecution
is trying to make it seem

512
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,156
like we're charging people
without proper investigation.

513
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,576
And their abuse of authority?

514
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,667
Someone who swindled
seven billion won wasn't searched

515
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,169
because of his connections
with the prosecution.

516
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,087
Was it a bribe?

517
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,090
They helped them get rid of the evidence
because they were close.

518
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,218
The inspection team made a request
to punish the prosecutor.

519
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,928
It's taken care of then.

520
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,055
Isn't there anything
that would agitate the people?

521
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,016
Something that will make them
swear at the prosecution.

522
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,812
I'll bring something else then.

523
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,792
Something that'll make people swear…

524
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,170
Something to agitate them…

525
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,014
What can we use?

526
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,727
BOARD OF AUDIT AND INSPECTION

527
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,481
The police took nearly a year

528
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,775
tracking down someone who fled abroad.

529
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,195
What did the prosecution do
when we caught him?

530
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,741
He was the head of a tax office
under investigation for receiving bribes.

531
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,577
He was caught while fleeing
to Hong Kong and Thailand

532
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,495
and was brought back to Korea,

533
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,664
but he was freed without a charge.

534
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,042
The prosecution let him go,
and that was it.

535
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,503
It's because his sibling was
an Assistant Chief Prosecutor.

536
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,506
Are you saying that the family members
of prosecutors are all above the law?

537
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,343
He was freed thanks to his sibling?
That's pure speculation.

538
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,178
There's more.

539
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,932
He was golf buddies
with other prosecutors too.

540
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,433
They used fake names.

541
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:11,395
Why do you think they used fake names
to make reservations?

542
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,981
If it were really pure speculation,

543
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,734
the prosecution should have issued
an arrest warrant immediately

544
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,029
when we requested one urgently
because he fled overseas once before.

545
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,656
But we couldn't arrest him

546
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,700
because the prosecution rejected
the request for a warrant.

547
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,494
We're not the ones who reject them.

548
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,496
It's the judge who rejects warrants.

549
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,290
And you're saying that
there will be side effects

550
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,960
if the police have the right
to end investigations?

551
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,713
That story reminds me of someone too.

552
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,633
The head of investigations
at Moraenae Station.

553
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,679
You'd know about this
better than I do, Director.

554
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,013
Since the residents

555
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,141
from the area up for redevelopment
held protests in front of HQ.

556
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:53,980
The police claimed that someone
bribed the head of the tax office,

557
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,149
but the one who took that money

558
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,734
was actually a police officer.

559
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,486
The head of investigations at Moraenae.

560
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,991
He's currently suspended.
We didn't go easy on him like you guys.

561
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,201
What about that station chief?

562
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,370
I heard that a chief from another station

563
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,248
pressured Moraenae
not to touch the demolition company,

564
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,542
saying he and the CEO
went to the same school.

565
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,835
He quit as well.

566
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,088
Then why was
that demolition company left out

567
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:24,051
when the case was forwarded
to the prosecution later?

568
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:29,557
That company broke numerous laws,
but the police covered them up.

569
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,769
If the police had the right to end
investigations when it happened,

570
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,854
who knows?

571
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,566
The company could have still
been at large this very moment.

572
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,944
I understand why you were reminded
of Moraenae Station

573
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,030
when we mentioned
the head of the tax office.

574
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,324
The two cases are fundamentally the same.

575
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,701
It's why we're discussing
investigative rights.

576
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,746
In order to find a better way
to investigate and indict criminals

577
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,914
to make sure the citizens aren't wronged.

578
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,209
As you know, the police have been
arguing for decades

579
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,713
that we should be the ones to investigate,
while the prosecution manages indictments.

580
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,216
But this is the first time people have
been supportive of us this much.

581
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,303
And you clearly know why.

582
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,973
Because the prosecution has been
disappointing the citizens.

583
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,393
We admit that the prosecution
needs to change.

584
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,189
But it doesn't mean we have to hand over
investigative rights to the police

585
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,941
and give them more authority.

586
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,235
I'll be honest with you.

587
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,904
I think that's ridiculous.

588
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,741
You're suggesting that we make
this country a police state.

589
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:33,371
You say you're willing to reform,
but won't accept the means.

590
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,040
The first step of a reformation
is to split the authority.

591
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,335
Authority is based on
how many rights you have--

592
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,296
If 150,000 police officers in the nation

593
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,423
gained independent investigative rights,

594
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,052
it would be the same as having
150,000 more prosecutors

595
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,387
with no legal training.

596
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,431
You have a huge resource
for investigations and intelligence.

597
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,850
And you even have armed forces.

598
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,396
Police work is directly connected
to public welfare.

599
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,772
Ordinary citizens.

600
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,690
If we stop leading the investigations,

601
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,402
how will the authority of the police
be kept in check?

602
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,614
You're talking as if prosecutors
are always at the scene

603
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,990
leading the investigations.

604
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,368
Prosecutors hardly know what's going on

605
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,745
in the field outside their offices.

606
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,748
And it's not like
the police call the prosecutors

607
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,500
whenever they go out to investigate.

608
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,087
The prosecutors know the case
and actually lead the investigations

609
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,547
only four percent of the time.

610
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,631
No.

611
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,925
It's 100 percent, not 4.

612
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,804
You're only talking about cases
where prosecutors directly intervene

613
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,265
from the beginning of an investigation.

614
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,309
Even in the 96 percent of the cases,

615
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:41,063
it is the prosecution's authority
that prevents human rights violations.

616
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,816
You know very well
that the prosecution will intervene

617
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,360
if you conduct a coercive investigation.

618
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,529
If we lose that right

619
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,074
and there is no longer any surveillance
on police investigations,

620
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,201
do you really think there won't be
an increase

621
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:58,164
-in coercive investigations and violence?
-Is this really about human rights?

622
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,459
Aren't you just anxious about losing
the privileges you have?

623
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,836
Why do you think it's about privileges?

624
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:07,673
One side has control
over the other and is monitoring them.

625
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,925
What could that be about,
besides privileges?

626
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,302
It's about validity.

627
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:16,599
The right to investigate and indict is
a right the citizens gave to the nation.

628
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,186
It should be connected as one,
not separated.

629
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,271
What's the goal of an investigation?

630
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,690
If you investigate
as well as indict a criminal,

631
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:28,360
you'll want to send them to court
no matter what.

632
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,404
How could anyone think otherwise?

633
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,199
If you really value human rights,
it should be separated.

634
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,327
Well, arresting someone isn't
all there is to an investigation.

635
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,913
Legal actions, judicial evaluation,

636
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,082
verifying investigation methods.
They're all included.

637
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,584
Everything's connected.

638
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,753
Let's say this isn't about privileges.

639
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:51,050
Chief Woo said earlier that police work
is directly connected to public welfare.

640
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:55,095
Then what is police work
the least connected to?

641
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,724
The prosecution. We can't investigate
prosecutors who commit crimes.

642
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:02,186
Come on. That's a bad joke.

643
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,854
It's happened just once.

644
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,191
A prosecutor being summoned
by the police to be investigated.

645
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:11,028
Only once, excluding DUI cases
or car accidents.

646
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,615
The prosecutor was questioned
for leaking a photo of a criminal.

647
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,785
During all those years,
among countless cases,

648
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,203
that was the only one.

649
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:23,040
You want to point a finger at each other?
You think we have nothing on you?

650
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,168
We can talk all night
about corrupt prosecutors.

651
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,386
This is like watching
a National Assembly meeting.

652
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:41,392
You're taking sides and fighting
each other, no matter what the issue is.

653
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,151
-Should we go out for a smoke?
-All right.

654
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,279
Or we can continue after a meal.

655
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,449
Or we can schedule the next meeting
and call it a day for now.

656
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,034
Are we far behind schedule?

657
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,202
Not much.

658
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,704
We can decide that over a meal.

659
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,207
But there aren't that many
good restaurants nearby.

660
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,588
Right. And it's not a good idea
for us all to go somewhere together.

661
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,809
Prosecutor Hwang.

662
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,103
Prosecutor Hwang!

663
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,649
Hey, where are you going?

664
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,151
Where is he going?

665
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,902
Maybe it's urgent.

666
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,503
Did he get indigestion?

667
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,798
But what's with Ms. Han?
Why does she care?

668
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,676
Right. What's going on between them?

669
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,511
That's really strange.

670
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,560
It's pointless if we carry on like this.

671
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,271
Right. We're just repeating
the same thing.

672
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,916
Are you okay? Are you feeling better?

673
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,179
You've gotten much better though.

674
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,434
I was worried I'd have to
carry you and run to the hospital.

675
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,768
You've become stronger.

676
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,813
You did a good job enduring the pain.

677
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,240
Do you want a cold drink?
Would you like some coke?

678
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,243
-Yes.
-Okay.

679
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,579
Hang on. I'll be back in one minute.

680
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,583
Stay right there.

681
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,668
What is it?

682
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,091
What? When?

683
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,219
At eight this evening.

684
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,014
Let's meet him together.

685
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,266
What if it turns out to be nothing?

686
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,686
What if he gets suspicious
since we both showed up?

687
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,189
I can just say I stopped by to greet him

688
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,565
since he's my senior.

689
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,487
Are you worried I might use you
as a scapegoat

690
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:07,407
and escape by myself
if Mr. Oh already knows what happened?

691
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,577
-Chief Choi.
-What?

692
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,496
Don't you think you'd be

693
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,207
digging your own grave
if he already knows?

694
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,292
Do you enjoy
shouldering everything yourself?

695
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,047
Are you saying you're worried about me?
Not yourself?

696
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,341
Just send me the address. Now.

697
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,638
What's with him?

698
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,758
Thank you.

699
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,845
Everyone left. There's no need to hurry.

700
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,144
They really left after I told them to.
How cold.

701
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,355
I sent everyone a text saying

702
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,482
that you weren't feeling so well.

703
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,654
So they might be thinking
that you have severe diarrhea.

704
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,115
Me? Diarrhea?

705
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,868
Well, I can't tell them that I have it.

706
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,000
Can I have a sip too?

707
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,010
I was worried
something terrible would happen.

708
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,390
I'm sorry.

709
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,313
There's no need to be so serious.

710
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,522
It's fine.

711
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,528
Hey, look at your face!

712
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,448
-You're angry, aren't you?
-No.

713
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,825
I can tell you're angry.

714
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,327
You're upset.

715
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,578
No, I'm not.

716
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,083
Are you upset? You get upset so easily.

717
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,043
That was nothing.

718
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,420
I have trouble breathing.

719
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,682
I'll drop you off at your office.
I need to go somewhere.

720
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,934
If you're going to Yongsan Station,
take me too.

721
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,022
Will that be okay?

722
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,819
I'm not in charge anymore, but I'm sure
it will be okay to take a look.

723
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,654
No, I meant your headache.

724
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,073
You should just take
the rest of the day off.

725
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,492
I'm totally fine now.

726
00:49:57,035 --> 00:50:00,664
If anything new came up,
Detective Jang would have told me earlier.

727
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,918
I don't think you'll find anything new
at the station anyway.

728
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,169
Still.

729
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,887
Some people are found safe
after being missing for a long time,

730
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,432
so don't get too stressed
about Prosecutor Seo.

731
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,226
"Stressed"?

732
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:24,896
It seems like you were planning on
coming to the station after the meeting.

733
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,065
Yes, I was. So?

734
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:32,362
There aren't any leads and the case
was transferred to another office.

735
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:37,075
So you were thinking of going
to the station but the meeting dragged on.

736
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,203
That's probably why you got the headache.
You were way too stressed.

737
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,622
Not really.

738
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,167
Did it hurt when you were
in Tongyeong too?

739
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,085
Has it been hurting regularly?

740
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,880
No, I was fine there.

741
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,762
We were arguing like crazy a while ago,

742
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,722
and now we're talking like this.

743
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,271
I'm not saying
we shouldn't trust the police.

744
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:11,234
I'm not saying everything will be okay
if we gained investigative rights either.

745
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,821
Then why didn't you say so at the meeting?

746
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:20,535
There are things
that should be said later.

747
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,499
You weren't the kind of person
to postpone things.

748
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,703
Chief Choi Bit, right?

749
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,942
She's going in now.

750
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,458
ACCUMULATED ASSETS
CURRENT LIABILITIES

751
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,187
Why is he going this far
just for a meeting?

752
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,692
I did find it odd when he asked to meet
at Hanjo Hotel.

753
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,819
He must be working for Hanjo.

754
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,580
I'm sorry, but we need a security check.

755
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,011
Please turn off your phones.

756
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,160
What's going on?

757
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,080
Why did you ask to meet me here?

758
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,417
Because this is a serious matter.

759
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,655
It's… Well…

760
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:31,661
I'm torn between turning a blind eye to it

761
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,831
and doing something about it.

762
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,126
I guess it's troublesome.

763
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,378
I'd be glad if it was just troublesome.

764
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,630
I might be killed if I make a wrong move.

765
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,826
I thought you'd be able
to take care of it.

766
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,757
It's a financial statement.

767
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,134
Which company's is it?

768
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,347
Hanjo…

769
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,600
Engineering.

770
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,653
Choi Bit brought someone.

771
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,530
Assistant Prosecutor Woo Tae-ha.

772
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,950
He was at the
Fair Trade Investigation Department

773
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:53,952
last year.

774
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:01,709
Ms. Lee, have you heard
of Chief Choi Bit by any chance?

775
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,920
What came after is what's mysterious.

776
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:07,423
The late Mr. Park was someone
who couldn't drink a drop of alcohol.

777
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,802
But the autopsy report said they found
alcohol in his body.

778
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:16,307
But the Chief of Namyangju
Police Station covered it up.

779
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,685
Hello.

780
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,939
It's nice to meet you. I'm Choi Bit.

781
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,691
I'm Woo Tae-ha.

782
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,070
You probably don't remember,
but we've met before.

783
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,657
And when was that?

784
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,161
At my late senior Lee Chang-jun's funeral.

785
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,037
I see.

786
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,499
Chief Choi Bit
of Namyangju Police Station.

787
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,043
She's the Chief of
the Intelligence Bureau now.

788
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,213
Oh, right. Chief Choi
of the Intelligence Bureau.

789
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,841
I haven't really heard much about you.

790
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,885
I heard about Chief Woo

791
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,345
through Mr. Park though.

792
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:55,972
Right.

793
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,018
Where did you two first meet again?

794
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,687
He told me you two go way back.

795
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,523
It was at the Incheon office.

796
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,777
He's the one who first helped me get work

797
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,988
at an office in Seoul.

798
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,575
PARK GWANG-SU

799
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,577
Right.

800
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,829
That's why Mr. Park

801
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,999
invited you, a prosecutor at
the Fair Trade Investigation Department.

802
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,418
But…

803
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:30,590
I don't know how the Chief of Namyangju
Station became involved.

804
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,763
Why did Mr. Park die?

805
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:57,992
What did you say?

806
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,994
I'm the one who wants to ask

807
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,789
what you did

808
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,251
to Mr. Park.

809
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,750
Why did you let Prosecutor Hwang
take the case?

810
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,961
Because that would put me in control.

811
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,255
How did you discover the accounting fraud?

812
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:55,300
I guess you got something
that'll take down Lee Sung-jae for good.

813
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,886
I want to keep investigating
the Prosecutor Seo case.

814
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,849
Prosecutor Seo took on
a middle school violence case.

815
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,435
So do you think he's a suspect?

816
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,771
It seemed like he talked a lot
with the junior prosecutor.

817
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,648
Why? Does she seem suspicious?

818
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,651
If we dig into it rashly,
we could ruin everything.

819
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,737
Prosecutor Seo! Seo Dong-jae!

820
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,280
Where could he have gone?

821
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:22,702
