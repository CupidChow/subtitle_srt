12
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:58,344
Ah...

13
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,349
Hmm... Ah...

14
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:11,353
Already... it's okay now

15
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,363
sorry

16
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:26,374
If Ikuko were to ride on top... I think I could still do it

17
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:29,377
No way

18
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:31,379
It's embarrassing

19
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,385
"I'm embarrassed to move on from the first formula, but I'm gonna say it's embarrassing to move on to the first formula ➡

My beloved wife is extremely vigorous

21
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:49,330
Even if you rely on the power of medicine, it is difficult to deal with bottomless desires.

22
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,330
It was no good

23
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,339
never mind

24
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:07,345
Because I'm sick

25
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:27,368
Hey?

26
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:32,373
Toshiko says he wants to bring Kimura-san out of now...

27
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:34,375
good?

28
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,377
Yeah

30
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:53,327
I'm sorry

31
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,329
I'm telling you not to drink too much today

32
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,332
The numbers were a little high

33
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,334
(Kimura) Oh, sorry at times like that

34
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:05,339
Don't worry about it, just take a little time to drink

35
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:08,342
(Toshiko) It's better mentally to be busy, right?

36
00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:11,345
Yes, it would be better if two people came.

37
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:13,347
Ikuko looks like she's having fun too

38
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:16,350
Kimura-san, the more you bring it, the more luxurious the food you cook.

39
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,353
Huh... That's right

40
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:24,353
No, Kimura-san, I thought it might be too long

41
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:31,365
It's also the drinking season, so today, you should take care of me.

42
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:34,368
Ah... Ah, no...

43
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:36,370
yes

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,373
"My wife is my student ➡

45
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:44,378
I've used my charms from the moment I met the man I introduced to my step-sister.

46
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:47,378
So... then sorry

"More than jealousy, my wife's sexiness has never been seen yet➡

48
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:55,318
I felt an unspeakable excitement.

49
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:04,327
Maybe I've already done some stew

50
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:09,332
Ah... I'll help too

51
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:16,343
Looks tasty

52
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:19,346
Is there anything I can do? Ah, then...

53
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:22,349
I'll add some condiments so...

54
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:25,352
Kimura-kun has that kind of thing too.

55
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:30,352
Ah, I don't seem to hate housework because I live alone.

56
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:37,364
If it's a marriage, you won't be able to do well?

57
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:39,366
Hmm

58
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:42,369
But I still don't know about Kimura-san.

59
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:45,306
I wonder if it's going to be about to begin

60
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,308
ah

00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:52,313
"I too can be a stimulant, this man's feelings ➡

Are you okay?

64
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,322
Ah, it's okay (Toshiko) Don't push yourself too hard

00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:04,322
Ah thank you (Toshiko) Yes

I thought it might be fine ha ha ha ha...

00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:24,345
Ah

71
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,347
Ah, I forgot to say

72
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:29,350
I was contacted by Kimura.

73
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,352
I don't have anything prepared...

74
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:35,356
Ah no, I just brought it today

75
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:38,356
Yeah?

76
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:49,299
Ah... Then I'll come and visit

77
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,312
I can do this

78
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:01,315
Ah, it's best to suit your mouth

79
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:03,317
What's wrong with Toshiko today?

80
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:06,320
I contacted you earlier and they said they didn't ask

81
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,323
Did you contact me? Eh... yes

82
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:12,326
I didn't contact you

83
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:16,330
That teacher said he had a talk

84
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,332
Is that so? yes

85
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:22,336
No, I also want to talk about research...

86
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:25,339
Hmm, it's about Toshiko

87
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,341
picture?

88
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,344
No, just because it's my introduction...

89
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:33,347
I thought there was no place where I forced myself to

90
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:36,350
Even if you don't ask me that...

91
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,353
Isn't there something that we find difficult to say?

92
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:42,356
Toshiko is a good girl, a good girl, but...

93
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:45,292
Because it doesn't suit me

94
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,294
Hey? Hmm...

95
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:50,297
I'm thinking of listening to the story here

96
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:52,299

It's okay, your face was good

Ah... Ah, is that so?

120
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:55,284
It's better not to interfere every time

121
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,292
Ah, it's a learning experience

122
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:00,292

Furthermore, it will not work immediately if it is maintained as is.

00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:52,327
You must always update the highest level.

Toshiko... you're late

159
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:00,340
Apparently I've been busy with work lately

160

162

No, that's right

I'm not a good fit for me as a student

164

I'm also trying to introduce a promising young man to my cute step-sister.

What?

174
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:03,337
Did you just kiss?

Haa

If you don't express your intentions, Toshiko will probably be the one.

203
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:05,325
Wait until Toshiko arrives

204
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:07,327
That's right, I have to show my face

205
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,329

Thank you for your hard work

212
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:40,360
Ah... what about your sister?

213
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,362
Just in the bathroom

214
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:45,298
Ah yes

215
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:48,301

216
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:50,301
Is that so?

217
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,304

219
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:07,320

00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,341
Big sister!? Ikuko!

224
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:45,292
"My wife was stimulated by the man's presence and was completely overly sexual."

225
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,294
Please help me too

226
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:50,294
Ah yes

227
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,299
(Kimura/Kanda) Sweet...

228
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:03,310
Toshiko-chan, can you bring me a change of clothes?

229
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,310
(Toshiko) Yes

230
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,323
(Sniffing sound)

231
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:18,325
You can help too

232
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,325
You'll have a cold

233
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:23,328
yes

234
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,338
"It seems to be very stimulating for men too.

235
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:37,338
This is a chance to renew the highest level.

236
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:46,286

237
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:50,290

238

(Hard breath)

239
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:04,304
(Toshiko) I brought a change of clothes but...

240
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:08,308
Oh, that teacher asked me to...

241
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,310
Ah... Shall we replace it?

242
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,313
Please

243
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,315
Ah, Kimura-kun

244
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:18,315
I want you to help me carry it to the bedroom

245
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,321
(Toshiko) Here

246
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,330
(Toshiko) Is it okay? Are you okay

247
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:38,336
(Toshiko) Here

248
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:03,293
Oh Kimura-kun, please put it on your pillow

249
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,323
It's rare for a sister to turn out like that.

250
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,325
I agree

251
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:36,329
No, I've been drinking a lot these days so I've become stronger

252
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:38,331
Hmm

253
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:42,331
Maybe something fun today

254
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:48,341
No no...it wasn't something in particular

255
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:50,341
Hmm

256
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:57,350
I've heard that I often only invite Kimura recently...

257
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,352
Maybe I'm in the way?

258
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:02,352
No, that's not the case, right?

259
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:06,356
Toshi-chan looks busy...

260
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Or maybe it's something strange about your brother-in-law.

261
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:18,371
You said something strange

262
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:21,374
Let my sister get closer to Kimura-san ➡

263
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:24,377
I wonder if they're having fun

264
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:30,383
Haha... what is that? What kind of hobby is it?

265
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:33,383
Do you have any hobby of being cuckolded?

266
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:37,390
Cuckold?

267
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,394
(Toshiko) Yes, let your partner and others do it ➡

268
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:45,394
I've heard that there are couples who are having fun.

269
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:48,334
That's right

270
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:51,337

Eh, but you already bought it, haven't you? yes

00:52:34,379 --> 00:52:36,381
Toshiko-chan, what happened?

557
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:38,381
(Toshiko) Huh?

558
00:52:41,386 --> 00:52:45,386
Kimura-kun, is that okay? Ah yes

559
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:54,332
This is because she hadn't acted on Toshiko yet.

560
00:52:54,332 --> 00:53:00,332
It's a problem if you get drunk and lose consciousness.

561
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,340
Haha...

562
00:53:05,343 --> 00:53:08,346
It's a good drink so I end up drinking too much

563
00:53:08,346 --> 00:53:10,348
Hmm

564
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:12,350
Hey brother-in-law

565
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,354
Why did you introduce me to Kimura?

566
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:21,359
yeah? Huh... Huh? Hehehe...

567
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,363
Hmm? Suddenly what?

568
00:53:25,363 --> 00:53:28,363
I'm tired of dating a farce

569
00:53:33,371 --> 00:53:37,371
Toshiko? Toshiko!

570
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:52,323
Sorry

571
00:53:52,323 --> 00:53:55,323

572
00:53:56,327 --> 00:53:58,327

577
00:54:15,346 --> 00:54:18,346
Don't read it anymore

578
00:54:22,353 --> 00:54:27,358
Toshiko has already revealed our feelings

579
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:33,358
And the teacher is really keen intuition

580
00:54:40,371 --> 00:54:44,375
I've loved Ikuko from the beginning

581
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:48,312
What... what are you talking about?

582
00:54:48,312 --> 00:54:51,315
Don't be fooled, even if you read the teacher's post ➡

583
00:54:51,315 --> 00:54:54,318
It's clear that I was aware of my feelings

584
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:56,320
That is...

585
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,324

587
00:55:02,326 --> 00:55:05,329

588
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:09,333

609
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,333
Is there someone who doesn't care?

610
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:27,338

00:57:37,348 --> 00:57:39,348
I don't have a face to meet

615

Do you want to apologise?

616
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:50,294
Apologies?

617
00:57:50,294 --> 00:57:56,294
I thought it would be nice to invite only Kimura to apologise for the apology party.

618

Maybe he'll come

619
00:58:02,306 --> 00:58:09,306
I'm also feeling uncomfortable if I keep going like this so I'll try calling out

620

01:13:19,356 --> 01:13:21,358
So why...

746
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:25,362
If there's anything I'd like to ask

747
01:13:25,362 --> 01:13:27,364
It's fine

748
01:13:27,364 --> 01:13:32,369
I have to punish the sly "professor's wife"

749
01:13:32,369 --> 01:13:34,369
It's thrilling

750
01:13:45,315 --> 01:13:47,317
{Die...} What? Can't you log in?

751
01:13:47,317 --> 01:13:50,320
"We're so uneasy in the afterlife ➡

752
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,323
Enjoying bad taste

753
01:13:53,323 --> 01:13:56,326
{However, when I read my husband's post again➡

754
01:13:56,326 --> 01:14:01,326
There's no doubt that it's the foundation of my love for me.

755
01:14:02,332 --> 01:14:07,337
"You really... didn't you want to be cuckolded? 》

756
01:14:07,337 --> 01:14:10,340
What should I do
