1
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,975
As for our news updates,

2
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,447
an encounter in Iloilo resulted in the
death of several members of rebel groups.

3
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,559
According to a report
from the military,

4
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:39,128
there was an intense
clash between soldiers

5
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,697
and a rebel group
yesterday morning

6
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,466
that lasted for several hours.

7
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:44,699
In the said encounter

8
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,271
three rebels were reported dead,

9
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,908
while three others were
injured and captured.

10
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,944
Operations by the military
forces are still ongoing.

11
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,180
To ensure the safety of
the communities in the area.

12
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:59,307
No soldiers have been
reported wounded.

13
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:02,540
However, the authorities are
closely monitoring the situation.

14
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:06,001
The local government continues
to remind the residents

15
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:10,601
to report any suspicious
activities in the area.

16
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,221
We are continuing to monitor
the events that will soon unfold.

17
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:05,025
Oh...

18
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,349
I know this person.

19
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:10,118
Hi, love.

20
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:18,485
Are you not tired of those?

21
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:23,875
No matter what,
I'll never get tired of this.

22
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:27,433
I'm so handsome,

23
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,253
and so lucky too.

24
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,841
So... how are the children?

25
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:35,475
Well...

26
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,090
We were sent home early today.

27
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:41,471
There was another encounter

28
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,814
with the military in the city.

29
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,220
I was just there.

30
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:48,501
Really?

31
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:51,234
I'm glad you're safe
and back home.

32
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:55,917
People in the NPA will

33
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:58,484
never stop fighting for
what they believe in.

34
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:01,935
Government officials
will continue

35
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,122
their efforts to stop them.

36
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:08,823
Make sure to always
be careful, okay?

37
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,765
- Yes.
- I don't want to be a young widow.

38
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,050
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:19,516
I'll always

40
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:21,723
be careful for you.

41
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,261
Come, take a rest.

42
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,894
Take a break.

43
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,760
Come on.

44
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:36,977
- You're already tired.
- Grades are due tomorrow.

45
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,253
Give that to me.

46
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,696
That's enough.

47
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:42,997
Hey, love.

48
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,367
I've got it covered for you.

49
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,341
Come on. Take a rest.

50
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:54,285
I'll make sure you pass.

51
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:40,117
A violent encounter
has once again resulted

52
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,768
in the loss of many lives,

53
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,662
including those of countrymen
who are rebels and soldiers,

54
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,740
- Roy?
- in the secluded village

55
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:47,199
- Are you there?
- of Hacienda Conchita

56
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:49,668
in the province of Iloilo.

57
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:54,197
The deceased military personnel
and rebels are still being identified.

58
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,608
I'm even more scared
hearing that news.

59
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,288
Until Ka Roman is alive,

60
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,639
our lives will
not be at peace.

61
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,339
Change your clothes first.

62
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,238
I cooked your favorite water spinach.

63
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,439
I want to eat a different
kind of water spinach.

64
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,147
You're so silly.

65
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:21,306
Why? Don't you want to?

66
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,351
Let's eat first.

67
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,384
Later.

68
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:27,638
I want to eat you first.

69
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:05,120
Oh?

70
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,907
Are you sure you're not
going to eat breakfast?

71
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,243
I'll eat at the
military camp.

72
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:14,456
There was a commotion in the area.

73
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,336
I also woke up late.

74
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:22,366
You tired me out last night.

75
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:24,877
You tired me out too.

76
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,562
Love.

77
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:34,082
Aren't you going to school?

78
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:36,396
You've already been
absent for days.

79
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,665
I’m really feeling lazy.

80
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,821
Maybe I'm pregnant.

81
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,257
Pregnant?

82
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:45,938
Love.

83
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:49,823
Oh you! You might
just be feeling sad here.

84
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:55,232
I'll just cook you favorite dish.

85
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:59,016
That's why I'm
gaining weight.

86
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,878
Alright, love.

87
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:02,873
I'll go ahead, okay?

88
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,776
How many times
should I tell you, love?

89
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,000
Every time you go,

90
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,141
don't say 'I'll go ahead.'

91
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,129
We're still young,

92
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,912
and we still have
many dreams,

93
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:20,648
plus we'll have many kids.

94
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:26,024
Yes, alright.
I'm leaving now.

95
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:34,727
Permission to leave, ma'am!

96
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,040
Okay!

97
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:38,219
Bye.

98
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,224
Roy?

99
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:07,909
Roy?

100
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:48,443
Come here!

101
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,196
You fell asleep there again.

102
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:49,161
You know what?

103
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,839
If I were Roy,
I would be upset with you.

104
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,753
Would he really hold
a grudge against me?

105
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:01,892
I'm already sleeping beside him.

106
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:14,446
Oh?

107
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,348
What happened?

108
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:27,861
It's a long story.

109
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:32,181
Our house was set on fire,

110
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,240
but Roy saved me.

111
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:39,650
Then,

112
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:44,346
they took our
land after that.

113
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:48,116
And since then...

114
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:51,750
Roy and I decided to
live on the mountain.

115
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:41,742
You know,

116
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:43,154
I’m intrigued by you.

117
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:47,424
Whenever we
pass by this tree,

118
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,327
you stop.

119
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:51,931
What’s so special
about that tree?

120
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,774
That particular tree...

121
00:27:57,748 --> 00:27:59,334
is the witness by my side

122
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:03,039
to Ka Roman killing
my husband.

123
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:06,488
Roman?

124
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:08,690
Isn't that just his alias?

125
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,148
Yes.

126
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:14,951
His real name is
Mark Santa Cruz, right?

127
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:17,707
Why?

128
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,977
That bastard Roman

129
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,839
still hasn't been
caught until now.

130
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:25,839
He murdered Lito

131
00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:28,246
because of his loyal
service to the town.

132
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:32,250
All my husband wanted

133
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:35,973
was a peaceful life for our town.

134
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:39,369
I honestly don't know

135
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:41,833
what the NPAs
are fighting for.

136
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:45,481
I’ve left the movement.

137
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:49,577
That's why we left the mountain

138
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:52,421
because we want
to start a new life.

139
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:57,102
We no longer know
what we are fighting for.

140
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:00,895
A never-ending battle.

141
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:06,689
To be honest,

142
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,566
I’m still terrified of
gunshots until now.

143
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:15,321
I don't know what
to do anymore.

144
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:25,258
Don't worry.

145
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:27,259
I'm here.

146
00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:30,822
I’ll always be
here for you.

147
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:36,403
No wonder I felt so at ease

148
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,240
when I first saw you.

149
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:41,788
Me too.

150
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:45,309
Maybe it's because
we are both widowed.

151
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:48,523
We both have
suffered a loss.

152
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:09,709
Happy Birthday to you!

153
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,495
Love?

154
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:20,574
Love!

155
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:23,706
Where are you?

156
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:25,945
I'm here, love.

157
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,243
Come, let's eat.

158
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:31,623
I cooked your favorite.

159
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:33,860
It looks delicious.

160
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:36,377
Thank you, love.

161
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:38,083
I love you so much.

162
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,622
I love you.

163
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:04,775
I miss you so much, Lito.

164
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,921
Thank you, love.

165
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:47,288
Breaking news,
fellow countrymen.

166
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:51,221
More than fifty rebels have
surrendered voluntarily today,

167
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:55,143
- February 17, 1980.
- Emma?

168
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:58,552
To rejoin society here
in the town of San Rafael,

169
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,125
- province of Iloilo.
- Emma!

170
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,186
As promised by the government,

171
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:06,059
- Emma?
- there are programs prepared for them.

172
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:07,631
- One reason for this is that
- Emma!

173
00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:09,482
life in the mountains is said

174
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,016
- to be getting tougher.
- Emma?

175
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:14,865
Emma.

176
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:16,700
Just a second!

177
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:52,823
It's only Saturday, right?

178
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:56,007
I thought that
we would visit

179
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:57,593
our husbands on Monday.

180
00:36:58,792 --> 00:36:59,879
Yes.

181
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,306
But I don't have
anything to do at home

182
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,101
so I decided
to come here.

183
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:08,430
I also

184
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,843
have something
to give you.

185
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:13,441
What is it?

186
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:14,675
A dress,

187
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:16,282
I bought it in town.

188
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:26,032
Oh my!

189
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:28,006
You didn't have to.

190
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:30,141
You shouldn't
have bothered.

191
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:34,724
Come, let's go inside first.

192
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,206
Just a minute.

193
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:20,232
This is really beautiful.

194
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:24,854
Even though I don't
usually wear dresses,

195
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,504
I'll wear this.

196
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,042
Come on, I cooked Adobong Kangkong.

197
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,472
Thank you again
for the dress.

198
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:15,203
This food... This is Roy's favorite.

199
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:17,864
Try it.

200
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:38,699
It's delicious.

201
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,338
Here.

202
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:45,074
Have some pork adobo.

203
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:02,009
It's delicious too.

204
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:07,934
Maybe...

205
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,761
that's why we
became friends

206
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:13,207
because

207
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,477
our husband's
favorite food is

208
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:19,041
adobo.

209
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:21,720
Adobong kangkong.

210
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:23,731
Pork Adobo.

211
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:21,623
Hey!

212
00:49:23,522 --> 00:49:25,431
Ah! What are you doing?

213
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:27,987
You're going to give me
a heart attack!

214
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,551
Sorry.

215
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:33,862
Hey, I'm sorry.

216
00:49:35,192 --> 00:49:37,252
Don’t do that again, okay?

217
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,648
It won't happen again.

218
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:41,369
Promise.

219
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:45,306
Do you want

220
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:46,970
to go to town?

221
00:49:51,303 --> 00:49:52,928
We might get home late.

222
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,479
You know that

223
00:49:56,504 --> 00:49:58,418
our village is far from town.

224
00:50:04,185 --> 00:50:06,933
That’s why I decided
to bury Roy here.

225
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,197
That's why it's easier
for us to visit them, right?

226
00:50:21,628 --> 00:50:23,354
You can sleep at my house.

227
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:26,264
I'm alone anyway.

228
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,409
Love?

229
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:21,065
How are you?

230
00:54:23,044 --> 00:54:26,798
I asked your colleagues...

231
00:54:27,236 --> 00:54:29,598
About that bastard
Ka Roman.

232
00:54:30,158 --> 00:54:32,027
Whether he has
been caught or not.

233
00:54:33,117 --> 00:54:34,529
They said he hasn’t
been caught yet.

234
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:46,491
Your husband might answer
if you keep talking.

235
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,639
You’re actually talking
to him, aren’t you?

236
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:53,589
Yes.

237
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:57,612
Especially when I'm at home.

238
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:05,891
Does he answer?

239
00:55:07,594 --> 00:55:08,648
Yes.

240
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,715
I talk to him
in my mind.

241
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:22,200
Especially

242
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:26,121
when I'm next
to his portrait.

243
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:28,809
I feel like...

244
00:55:30,058 --> 00:55:31,476
He is really here.

245
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,724
I thought I was
losing my mind.

246
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:41,177
Because

247
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:44,017
I did exactly what you're doing.

248
00:55:49,423 --> 00:55:51,135
We're not going crazy.

249
00:55:55,594 --> 00:55:57,460
We do this

250
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:00,433
because of

251
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:02,906
how deeply we love them.

252
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:07,019
And we don't
want to lose that.

253
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:11,643
That's why I always
try to look good.

254
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,234
Especially when I visit him.

255
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:21,820
Emma, wait.

256
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,165
Can we talk first?

257
01:01:27,008 --> 01:01:28,528
Talk to me, please.

258
01:01:28,696 --> 01:01:30,098
What did I do?

259
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:32,495
This is wrong.

260
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:35,092
What we did is wrong.

261
01:01:35,952 --> 01:01:37,979
What do you mean?

262
01:01:41,669 --> 01:01:42,852
I feel like...

263
01:01:44,419 --> 01:01:45,530
What we did isn't right.

264
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:47,828
Not right?

265
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:51,427
I don't care what
others might say.

266
01:01:53,488 --> 01:01:54,915
I'm a teacher.

267
01:01:57,027 --> 01:01:58,299
I couldn't care less.

268
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:01,960
We did not mean
for this to happen.

269
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:04,897
It happened spontaneously.

270
01:02:07,196 --> 01:02:08,854
A weak woman

271
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:11,889
is helped by a strong woman.

272
01:02:14,628 --> 01:02:16,628
Perhaps this is our fate.

273
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:21,138
We both lost our spouses.

274
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:24,682
We both experienced grief

275
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:29,317
and here, we found each other

276
01:02:31,527 --> 01:02:33,488
to be there for one another.

277
01:03:40,408 --> 01:03:41,428
Love.

278
01:03:42,912 --> 01:03:44,314
I'm going home now, okay?

279
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:48,817
I love you so much.

280
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:53,009
That's why

281
01:03:53,609 --> 01:03:55,191
I fought for you

282
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,622
to be buried
here in our land.

283
01:03:58,686 --> 01:04:01,172
Because I don't want you
to be far from me.

284
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,131
There's something
I need to tell you.

285
01:04:11,588 --> 01:04:12,643
You know,

286
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:14,617
since

287
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:16,610
I married you,

288
01:04:17,584 --> 01:04:19,152
I have dedicated

289
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:23,302
myself and all my love to you.

290
01:04:28,301 --> 01:04:31,516
I tried to stop myself
from being who I truly am.

291
01:04:32,561 --> 01:04:35,897
To be true to myself.

292
01:04:39,023 --> 01:04:41,409
I am asking for
your forgiveness.

293
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:07,449
Roy,

294
01:05:08,747 --> 01:05:10,621
Emma didn't visit you?

295
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:16,336
I haven't seen her for weeks now.

296
01:05:21,448 --> 01:05:22,699
I hope

297
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:26,740
you can forgive me because
I created chaos in her life.

298
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,007
Emma!

299
01:05:49,714 --> 01:05:50,737
Emma!

300
01:06:05,652 --> 01:06:07,438
Emma, what happened to you?

301
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:20,609
It's nothing.

302
01:06:22,356 --> 01:06:23,956
It's just a fever.

303
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:40,910
Here,

304
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,513
have some hot soup.

305
01:07:44,276 --> 01:07:45,379
To help reduce
your temperature

306
01:07:45,404 --> 01:07:46,982
and you can have
your medicine as well.

307
01:07:54,189 --> 01:07:56,493
Thank you, Sandra.

308
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:52,905
I should thank you

309
01:08:53,217 --> 01:08:54,717
because you came with me.

310
01:08:56,105 --> 01:08:57,190
Why?

311
01:08:57,659 --> 01:08:58,691
What do you mean, why?

312
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:02,849
Why are you doing this?

313
01:09:04,454 --> 01:09:06,964
Of course, who else
would help each other?

314
01:09:07,672 --> 01:09:09,466
Well, it's us widows.

315
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:16,359
I don't know,

316
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:20,294
but ever since I kissed you.

317
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:25,333
I kept trying to
forget about it,

318
01:09:25,358 --> 01:09:26,782
but I just can't.

319
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:32,190
Is that why

320
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:34,376
you don't visit your
husband anymore?

321
01:09:35,858 --> 01:09:37,235
I still visit,

322
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:40,625
but on a different day.

323
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,818
Now I understand.

324
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,670
A sad report has been received

325
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:18,115
about the situation of the
rebellion in the mountains.

326
01:10:18,115 --> 01:10:19,658
According to the authorities,

327
01:10:19,658 --> 01:10:22,786
the conflict between the military

328
01:10:22,786 --> 01:10:24,747
and armed groups
seems to be escalating.

329
01:10:24,747 --> 01:10:27,333
The long-desired peace

330
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:29,585
still appears far
from being achieved.

331
01:10:29,585 --> 01:10:31,879
Despite government efforts,

332
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:34,173
the area affected by the incident

333
01:10:34,173 --> 01:10:37,426
is falling into chaos and fear.

334
01:10:37,426 --> 01:10:39,470
It’s disheartening
to think that many

335
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,222
innocent individuals
remain victims.

336
01:10:42,222 --> 01:10:46,101
Many of them have wives
and children who are grieving

337
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:48,896
the permanent loss of
their husbands and fathers

338
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:52,149
because of the
seemingly endless war.

339
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:55,694
As the fight and
misunderstanding continue,

340
01:10:55,694 --> 01:10:58,447
the peace that has
long been hoped for

341
01:10:58,447 --> 01:11:02,701
seems like an
unreachable dream.
