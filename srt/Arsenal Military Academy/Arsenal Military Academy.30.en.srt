Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,539
Episode 30

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,240
You come to ask for mercy for him?

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,680
Yes.

6
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,360
He killed people of ours,

7
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
and ruined our business many times.

8
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,600
It's merciful that he can live till now.

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,600
I come here

10
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
in hope of cutting him some slack.

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Why do you think you can help him?

12
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
What rights do you have?

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Xianrong.

14
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you really forget

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,480
who you are?

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,320
Have you made up your mind?

17
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,720
Can't you cut him some slack?

18
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,880
I never change my mind

19
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,520
once I make it.

20
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,970
I remember when I was young,

21
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,880
you told me to

22
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,280
be good and

23
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,320
behave myself.

24
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,280
So I did everything

25
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,520
that you asked me to do.

26
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,920
But now,

27
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,240
you are going to kill the man I love.

28
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,640
I can't allow it.

29
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,760
What happened?

30
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,000
From now on,

31
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,560
I am

32
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,440
in charge here.

33
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,040
Junshan.

34
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,370
Junshan.

35
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,159
Junshan!

36
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,280
Wake up!

37
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Junshan, wake up!

38
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,700
Who are you?

39
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,970
What do you want?

40
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Put your gun down.

41
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,960
Oda Xianrong.

42
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,040
Come out!

43
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,240
Do you know where you are?

44
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,400
How dare you make a scene here?

45
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,150
Of course I know.

46
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,150
You do have guts.

47
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,570
Why do you come to me?

48
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,080
Did you send the people

49
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
to kill Junshan?

50
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,160
How is he now?

51
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,760
Did you?

52
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,280
No, I didn't.

53
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,920
Swear it.

54
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,440
I said it was not me.

55
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,920
How is he now?

56
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,330
Alright.

57
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,240
I trust you this time.

58
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,100
Where is he now?

59
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,880
The municipal hospital.

60
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,920
He was slashed in the back twice

61
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,320
and stabbed in the belly.

62
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,480
His internal organs are hurt.

63
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,280
He needs an operation right now.

64
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,400
The director and the attending doctors

65
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
went to Peking for a meeting.

66
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
The rest doctors can't do the operation.

67
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,760
We need a doctor

68
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,690
named Kushi Koji to be the surgeon.

69
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
Go to find Doctor Kushi

70
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,280
and send him to the municipal hospital.

71
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,840
Hurry up.

72
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,560
Yes.

73
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,930
Let's go.

74
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,440
Junshan! Junshan!

75
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,370
Hold your fires.

76
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,020
Where is he?

77
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,660
This is Doctor Kushi that Doctor Liu mentioned.

78
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,480
The situation is urgent.

79
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
We have no choice.

80
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Do you trust them?

81
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,740
I trust her.

82
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,740
I believe she won't hurt Junshan.

83
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,840
I will kill all your families

84
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,680
if Mr. Shen can't live.

85
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
He won't,

86
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,380
if you keep standing in my way.

87
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Get out of the way.

88
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,040
Let him in.

89
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,240
The operation is very successful.

90
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,320
He is out of danger.

91
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,360
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

92
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
You should thank Doctor Kushi.

93
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,640
Without his good skill,

94
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,700
the operation cannot be successful.

95
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,760
Doctor Kushi,

96
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,800
thank you.

97
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,160
I'm sorry that I offended you.

98
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
Hope you understand us

99
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
and don't mind it.

100
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,930
I understand it.

101
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,800
Let me go in and have a look.

102
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,760
The patient needs a rest after the operation.

103
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,220
Come out after you see him.

104
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,010
Did you inform his brother?

105
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,050
I sent a telegram to him.

106
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,020
It will take at least two days before he arrives.

107
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
I need a word with her.

108
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,320
Oda Xianrong.

109
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Thank you so much.

110
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,340
In what position do you thank me?

111
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Who are you to him?

112
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,460
I am his classmate,

113
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,820
and his friend.

114
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,080
I know who you are.

115
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,320
So does Junshan.

116
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,170
About the students back from Japan in Peking,

117
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
it was you, right?

118
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,320
Selling labors, stealing the royal seal

119
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,320
and killing the hunter in the mountain.

120
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,210
They're all your doing, right?

121
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,320
Yes.

122
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,400
They are.

123
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,200
But

124
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,170
what can you do about it?

125
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,620
You will pay for it.

126
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,090
Good luck to you.

127
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
What's wrong with you?

128
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,480
Why do you look upset?

129
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,780
What happened?

130
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,960
Junshan was attacked last night

131
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,020
and hurt severely.

132
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,780
Liangchen is at the hospital now.

133
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,160
He got hurt severely?

134
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,170
No wonder that he didn't come back last night.

135
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,760
We don't know what happened

136
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,680
as well.

137
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,730
Let's go to the hospital

138
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,720
after class.

139
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,980
Gu Yanzhen.

140
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,410
You've got a visitor from your family.

141
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,080
Sir,

142
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,560
Mr. Gu asked you to go back

143
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,820
for something urgent.

144
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,320
Did he tell you what the thing was?

145
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,800
No.

146
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,200
Mr. Gu.

147
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,160
What is it?

148
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,960
Your father is waiting for you in his study.

149
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,640
Dad.

150
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,370
You asked for me?

151
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,400
I am back.

152
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,280
Yanzhen.

153
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,800
These days,

154
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,960
don't go to school.

155
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,380
Now the situation is chaotic.

156
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,400
I plan to

157
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,160
send you and Qiqi

158
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,050
back to Nanjing.

159
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,890
Is the negotiation not going well?

160
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,200
Weak countries don't have a say in the negotiation table.

161
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Negotiation?

162
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,609
Negotiate what?

163
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,880
We are just forced

164
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,200
to do what they want.

165
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,320
When the treaty is signed,

166
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,170
the situation will be more difficult to control.

167
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,720
Then,

168
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,560
I will go back to Peking soon.

169
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,600
You and Qiqi go back with me.

170
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,230
We arrive at Peking.

171
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,340
Then I'll ask someone to send you to Nanjing,

172
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,670
to your grandpa's home.

173
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,370
It won't take us a long time.

174
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,680
Go to prepare it.

175
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,040
Did you hear that?

176
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,920
Dad.

177
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,730
Have some water.

178
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,720
Yanzhen.

179
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,440
Now Feng'an is especially chaotic.

180
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,400
I can't help you when I get back to Peking.

181
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
Don't make troubles for me, OK?

182
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,120
I follow what you say.

183
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,490
Junshan.

184
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,040
Doctor! Nurse!

185
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,260
Both of the pupils are normal.

186
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,600
The heartbeat is normal.

187
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
The wound is healed well.

188
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,100
Everything goes well.

189
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,700
Let him have more rest.

190
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,100
Thank you, sir.

191
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,200
This year,

192
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,260
I almost become

193
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,000
a frequent guest of the hospital.

194
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,980
That's absolutely right.

195
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,560
Last night,

196
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,960
you sent me here?

197
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,400
Yes.

198
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,440
When I came back from Xiaojun's place,

199
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,040
I saw you lying with bodies.

200
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
I was scared to death.

201
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,920
Did you faint last night?

202
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,180
I'm surprised that you remember.

203
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,560
I remembered some.

204
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,320
I need to

205
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,260
tell you one thing.

206
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,020
Your surgeon was found

207
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,880
by Oda Xianrong.

208
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,980
All the doctors went to Peking for a meeting.

209
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,970
The rest doctors

210
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,050
can't do such an operation.

211
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,980
Only a Japanese doctor

212
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,520
can do this in Shunyuan.

213
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,240
You went to her?

214
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,180
I had no other choices.

215
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,730
I had to ask her for help.

216
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
At the beginning,

217
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
I thought she sent people to kill you

218
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,570
since she was angry for being exposed.

219
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,330
Now it seems that

220
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,600
I was wrong.

221
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Did you ever think

222
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,840
if it was she

223
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,380
who had sent people to kill me,

224
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,730
then you were risking your life

225
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,280
when you went to her?

226
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,770
I didn't have time to think much

227
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,420
under that situation.

228
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Have a rest.

229
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,160
The doctor says more rest helps you be better soon.

230
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,360
I'll take some water.

231
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,940
Gu Yanzhen?

232
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,880
What brings you here?

233
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,680
I have something to tell you.

234
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,270
How's everything going at school?

235
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,960
I didn't go back last night.

236
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,290
Was the sergeant angry?

237
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,760
You don't have classes this afternoon?

238
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,820
Why do you come out?

239
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,600
Gu Yanzhen.

240
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,580
What's wrong with you?

241
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,680
I'm leaving.

242
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Where will you go?

243
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,490
Back to Nanjing.

244
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,400
Nanjing?

245
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,080
Will you marry that Miss Dong?

246
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,020
My father's order.

247
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,120
Well, when will you come back?

248
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,370
I don't know.

249
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,930
I'm afraid others will be arranged

250
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
to live with you after I leave,

251
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,080
especially that Li Wenzhong.

252
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,410
I always suspect that he knows something.

253
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,120
If you like Shen Junshan,

254
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,080
apply to the sergeant to

255
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,530
let him live in our dorm.

256
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,830
If he is here,

257
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,130
you won't be bullied by others.

258
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,660
You will graduate in less than a year.

259
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,780
After graduating, you are best to go back to Peking.

260
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,640
After all, you are a girl.

261
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,720
You can't join the army, can you?

262
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,240
If you like,

263
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,680
I'll arrange a

264
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,700
civilian post for you.

265
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Did you hear that?

266
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,800
I did.

267
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,770
Alright.

268
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Go back in now.

269
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,000
See you.

270
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,580
Gu Yanzhen.

271
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,160
When will you leave?

272
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,490
I'll see you off.

273
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,020
No, thanks.

274
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,210
Stay here for Shen Junshan.

275
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,200
Junshan.

276
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,700
How do you feel now?

277
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,520
I'm fine.

278
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,650
These Japanese are too savage.

279
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,290
Don't worry.

280
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,840
I will avenge you.

281
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,250
You are all here.

282
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,880
Just now,

283
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,320
Gu Yanzhen came.

284
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,520
He was afraid to disturb you

285
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,920
so that he didn't come in.

286
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,360
Junshan.

287
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,060
Take care of yourself.

288
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,040
I'll see you the other day.

289
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,340
Liangchen.

290
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,600
Thank you.

291
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,640
Let's go.

292
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,440
Sir, where do you keep him?

293
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,810
Huang He!

294
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,320
Huang He!

295
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,140
Huang Song!

296
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,140
Huang Song!

297
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,060
Huang Song!

298
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,260
Huang Song!

299
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,600
Thank you.

300
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,800
Thank you.

301
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,080
Be quick.

302
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,640
Alright.

303
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,400
Huang Song.

304
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,960
Huang He.

305
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,360
Did they beat you?

306
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,300
Huang Song.

307
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,760
Two of my classmates were killed by them.

308
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,120
Huang He.

309
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,330
Don't worry.

310
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,160
I will get you out.

311
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,340
Have some food.

312
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,200
Slow down.

313
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,820
Don't be choked on.

314
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,340
Huang Song.

315
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,440
Does our sister know?

316
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I didn't tell her.

317
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,260
Take your time.

318
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,000
By the way,

319
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,680
a school organization found us.

320
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,840
He told us to make a play.

321
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,280
After the meeting, we were arrested.

322
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,160
We did nothing.

323
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,040
I know.

324
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,720
If you did something,

325
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,940
you must have died.

326
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,900
These students pity the southern revolutionists,

327
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,600
which is a big taboo.

328
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,000
Huang He.

329
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,400
You're so stupid.

330
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,210
I don't know.

331
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,040
Time's up.

332
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,440
Sir,

333
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
could you give me more time?

334
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,320
Thank you.

335
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,360
Thank you.

336
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,300
Huang Song.

337
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,640
Don't tell our sister.

338
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,160
I know.

339
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,280
Hurry.

340
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,570
Huang He.

341
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,720
When I get enough money, I'll get you out.

342
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,000
Give me some time.

343
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Come out quickly.

344
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,820
I have to go.

345
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,720
Song?

346
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,120
Why don't you come in?

347
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,200
I heard that Shen Junshan was severely hurt.

348
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,520
How is he now?

349
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,320
He fell asleep just now.

350
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,680
He's between sleep and wake.

351
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,810
He still has a fever.

352
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,010
It's lucky that he is out of danger.

353
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,200
Song.

354
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,800
You look so pale.

355
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,880
I don't.

356
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,080
I don't.

357
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,960
Are you sick?

358
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,880
No.

359
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,480
I am well.

360
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,160
Really?

361
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,680
Yes.

362
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,410
Don't worry.

363
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,290
Alright.

364
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,200
Go back now.

365
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,400
I'll take care of him.

366
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,200
Rest assured.

367
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,400
Well, I'll go back now.

368
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,920
Song.

369
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,010
Are you really fine?

370
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,840
Yes.

371
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,720
He beat his rival just with a fist.

372
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,880
Wager on him.

373
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
It can't be wrong.

374
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,680
Hurry. It will begin. Chop.

375
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,720
Hurry up.

376
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,480
There.

377
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,600
Hurry. Hurry.

378
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,400
Where is my birthday gift?

379
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,660
The apple is that gift.

380
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,500
Who gives others an apple as a birthday gift?

381
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
It is too late.

382
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,400
Where can I

383
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
buy a gift for you?

384
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,960
What about I give you the button

385
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,920
on my clothes to you?

386
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,560
Lights on, the night is deep

387
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,410
You lost the button?

388
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,960
Breeze blows through windows and doors

389
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,720
Where is it?

390
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,730
Look around.

391
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,800
Ask from the bottom of the heart

392
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,760
Is the love true

393
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,850
Yanzhen.

394
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,170
Why are you still up?

395
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,170
I can't fall asleep.

396
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,400
Why?

397
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,190
I'm a little scared.

398
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,159
Come here.

399
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,040
Yanzhen.

400
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Our dad won't be in trouble, will he?

401
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,000
No.

402
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,440
You will go back to Nanjing with me,

403
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,040
won't you?

404
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,550
Don't give me that look.

405
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
The director must have arrived.

406
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,040
I called him just now.

407
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,700
He just came back from France.

408
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,890
How did you find him?

409
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,380
I met him at Paramo.

410
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,480
When I knew he was a director,

411
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,960
I gave him your information.

412
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,720
Well done.

413
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,560
Good boy.

414
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,370
I'll treat you a big dinner.

415
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,000
Manting.

416
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,040
I have something to tell you.

417
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,680
Next time.

418
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,610
I can't keep the director waiting.

419
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,820
I must tell you now.

420
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,680
What's so urgent?

421
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,560
Can't you guess it?

422
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,160
Why is she here?

423
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,920
Tao.

424
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,440
Tell her

425
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,680
why I am here.

426
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,280
Director Sheng changed the actress suddenly.

427
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,010
She's the leading actress now.

428
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
You're replaced.

429
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,200
Don't be so upset.

430
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,320
After all, we're friends.

431
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,560
I feel sorry

432
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,080
for you to be

433
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,580
rejected all the time.

434
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,280
How about

435
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,560
I talk to Director Sheng

436
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,720
and give you a role as my maid?

437
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,240
A maid is prettier than her lady?

438
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,160
Don't you feel embarrassed?

439
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,680
You!

440
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,920
Today I'm here

441
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,320
to tell them to

442
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,520
stop dreaming about me staring in a film

443
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,240
directed by an obscure director

444
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,570
or produced by a small company.

445
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,200
Well,

446
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,920
I'm not an actress that you,

447
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,720
or some nobody can invite.

448
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,840
Garbage.

449
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,760
Let's go.

450
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,320
Tao.

451
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,000
You're just jealous.

452
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,440
Manting.

453
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,500
Mr. Sheng just came back from abroad.

454
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,700
He is Sheng Huainan's nephew.

455
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,100
Sheng Huainan is the minister of Taxation.

456
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,490
Since he just came back,

457
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,000
Dong Huiseng forgot him

458
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,320
when he informed

459
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,800
the film company

460
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,540
not to allow you making a film.

461
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,480
So unlucky.

462
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,000
Sheng Huainan just came back

463
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,700
to attend the birthday party of General Zhang's mother's.

464
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,200
He...

465
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,890
He came to the studio this morning.

466
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
After he left,

467
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,140
the cast were changed.

468
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,240
Yuan Pingting arrived just now.

469
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,210
I didn't even have time to tell you.

470
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,200
Manting.

471
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,040
It's my fault.

472
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,370
I made you embarrassed.

473
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,840
But…

474
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,740
Please don't be angry.

475
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Who does Yuan Pingting think she is?

476
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,290
She was not qualified to serve you.

477
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,200
The one who was not qualified

478
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,040
to serve me

479
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,320
is bullying me now,

480
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,650
which makes me angrier.

481
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,800
Manting.

482
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,720
I...

483
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,520
This is none of your business.

484
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,780
Don't blame yourself.

485
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,010
This time, I have a bad luck.

486
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,640
No one else should be blamed.

487
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,090
But this is just the beginning of the game.

488
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,760
Wait and see.

489
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,090
Hello. Qian.

490
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,400
How's everything going

491
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,560
with your poetry anthology?

492
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,760
It's already finished.

493
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,920
I edited it with several friends.

494
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,480
So it didn't take us much time.

495
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,720
But unluckily, we are

496
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,850
neither superstars

497
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,160
nor social ladies.

498
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,040
And we are all from conservative families

499
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,560
where we are not supported to come out to work.

500
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
Few publishing houses

501
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
will publish our anthology.

502
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,440
You didn't help us last time.

503
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,040
Now, I do.

504
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
The thing is that I have little

505
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,040
knowledge about French and Russian.

506
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,500
And my English is not good.

507
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,480
If my name was in the book

508
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,560
as a translator,

509
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,480
no one would believe it.

510
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,880
It would be humiliating.

511
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,860
How about this?

512
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
I invest your publication,

513
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,700
and my name appears in the book

514
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,240
as an editor

515
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
or

516
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,320
a sponsor.

517
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,760
Or whatever you like.

518
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,360
As long as my name is in it.

519
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,040
This will help your book become a best-seller.

520
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,370
That will be wonderful.

521
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,290
When shall we publish the book?

522
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,450
As soon as possible.

523
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,090
When you finish it, tell me.

524
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,800
I'll contact the publishing house.

525
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,360
Alright.

526
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,020
I'm going to contact them now.

527
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,010
Alright.

528
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,570
Goodbye.

529
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,520
Hello, Director Liu.

530
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
It's me, Qu Manting.

531
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,290
Hello, Mr. Lin, it's me.

532
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,840
Ms. Huo,

533
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,890
this is Manting.

534
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,240
Well,

535
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,920
I want to attend

536
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,520
the birthday party of General Zhang's mother's.

537
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Hello, Mr. Li?

538
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,480
My friends and I

539
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,920
edited a poetry anthology.

540
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,220
Will you help us publish it?

541
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,400
Now, I have time to do the interview

542
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,040
that you mentioned several days ago.

543
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
You told me that

544
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,680
you'd like to publish my autobiography.

545
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,040
I like to calm myself down

546
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,440
every once in a while.

547
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
If you recommend me,

548
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,210
they would allow me attend.

549
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,560
I...

550
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,680
Ms. Huo. Don't worry.

551
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,920
I have been trained well

552
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,160
on the basic skill for these years.

553
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,800
If you don't believe me,

554
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,220
I'll sing it for you tonight.

555
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,600
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

556
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,480
OK. See you.

557
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,320
It's so hard.

558
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,520
Manting.

559
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,020
You finished your phone call?

560
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,920
You want to...

561
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,920
Get my stage back.

562
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,700
Please look after my father.

563
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,720
Take care.

564
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,160
Don't worry.

565
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,840
He should be grateful that

566
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,410
his bone ash can be buried in Japan,

567
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,220
instead of being thrown outside.

568
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,290
After all, he brought me up.

569
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,800
Also,

570
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,410
the Japanese would take off the gloves

571
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,400
if we didn't take his bone ash back.

572
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,860
Will the Japanese approve

573
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,400
if you don't go back?

574
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,740
They are eager to see me staying here.

575
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,520
Oda Hideyuki died.

576
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,000
My brothers will fight for

577
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,240
the asset of the Oda's for years.

578
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,230
Has that person been found?

579
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,400
Not yet.

580
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,340
He has been with Oda Hideyuki these days.

581
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,480
I haven't met him,

582
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,360
but I know his existence.

583
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,890
These things were dealt with by him recently.

584
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,220
We must find him no matter how.

585
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,880
And I have the feeling

586
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,280
that I know him.
