Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 19

4
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,380
They are treasures we lost in the old Summer Palace.

5
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,360
The consignor

6
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,520
is the chairman of Japan Daiwa Association, Uiju County branch,

7
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,360
Takeda Syun.

8
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,320
When the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Peking,

9
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
he was a captain.

10
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,740
The receiver is the chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce,

11
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Oda Xianrong.

12
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,440
That's what I know for now.

13
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,420
It might be not enough.

14
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,620
But you have to get the information by yourself.

15
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
There are too many goods.

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,130
It's impossible to steal them.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
If we snatch by force,

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,419
we would break the treasures.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,480
It's not easy.

20
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,780
That's why I reach for you.

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
There are ways to do it.

22
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,520
However,

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,440
I have two questions.

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,320
Please be frank.

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,560
Why don't you do it yourself?

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,090
It requires expertise.

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm not an expert

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,880
in this.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,440
It's the truth.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,040
The second question.

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Why do you want the goods?

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,800
In recent years, many treasures from the Summer Palace

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,530
have been traded on the market.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,079
You never paid attention to them.

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,920
As a Manchurian,

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,180
it's my duty to save our forefathers' property.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,160
You may take it that

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
I suddenly find my conscience,

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,960
or I need to keep myself busy.

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,770
Forget it, if you don't want to answer.

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,720
But let's make it clear.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
If what you kept from me

43
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,880
ruins our business.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,120
The money

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,760
is not to be reimbursed.

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,320
I have every confidence in you.

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,700
I'll take it as your blessing.

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,800
Then I'm counting on you.

49
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,000
Lord,

50
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,600
recently, there have been

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,850
people wandering around the mansion.

52
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,200
I guess

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,610
they're probably Oda Xianrong's men.

54
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,640
Since she sent men to monitor us,

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,920
Ms. Huo...

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
You're right.

57
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,720
But the goods

58
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,960
are so special.

59
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,800
Especially the Royal Seal.

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,880
Huo Xiaoyu is a gangster.

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,980
She is not to be fooled.

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,160
Yeah.

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,640
These damned eunuchs!

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,930
How dare they steal the Royal Seal!

65
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,420
They should be burned in the inferno.

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,290
The country is dismantled.

67
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,480
But the emperor, my uncle,

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,200
is just a kid,

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,810
and can do nothing about it.

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
Luckily, he's got you and your father.

71
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,159
We're not doing this for him.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,720
We're doing this for ourselves.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,170
Once we lose the forefathers' empire,

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,880
no one can live in peace.

75
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,440
Gu Yanzhen?

76
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,080
Gu Yanzhen? Is that you?

77
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,780
When did you...

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
How did you get in?

79
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,610
I've got the key.

80
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,380
Gu Yanzhen is not coming back.

81
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,920
His bunk belongs to me now.

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,920
Who gave you the permission?

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Sergeant Lv did.

84
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
If you disagree, talk to him tomorrow.

85
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,960
But...

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,260
you'd better have a rightful excuse.

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,530
What are you looking at?

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We men should be frank to each other.

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,120
Look at me.

90
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,840
These trivial matters...

91
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,570
Out of my way.

92
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,340
Do you leave or not?

93
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,680
Cozy!

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,640
OK.

95
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,440
You stay.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,280
I'll go.

97
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,540
Isn't that better for us to live in a dorm?

98
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
You're so boring.

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,760
Li Wenzhong.

100
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,370
You bastard.

101
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,809
Liangchen,

102
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,120
are you OK?

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,549
You look terrible.

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,940
I haven’t slept all night.

105
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,560
Did Li Wenzhong bully you?

106
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,440
I heard that he changed a dorm.

107
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
He is living in your dorm now.

108
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,770
Did he make trouble for you?

109
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm fine.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,260
Probably caught cold.

111
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Cold?

112
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,330
How could it happen?

113
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,280
Don't stop.

114
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Keep running!

115
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,770
Liangchen, come on.

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,610
Liangchen, come on.

117
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,580
The training today...

118
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,780
Excuse me, Sir.

119
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,300
Xie Liangchen passed out.

120
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,120
Everyone stays here.

121
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:40,960
Shen Junshan!

122
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,520
Yes.

123
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,760
Take him to the infirmary.

124
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,320
Yes, Sir.

125
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,010
Hurry up.

126
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,730
Careful.

127
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,160
Doctor!

128
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,320
Come in.

129
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
Get the doctor.

130
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
- OK. - Hurry.

131
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,560
Where's the doctor?

132
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,080
Sir,

133
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,620
the doctor is not here.

134
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,560
OK then,

135
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,240
you get back to the training ground.

136
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
I'll take care of him.

137
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,560
You wake up.

138
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,480
Sergeant Guo.

139
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Take it easy.

140
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,800
Don't you feel dizzy now?

141
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,330
Sit down.

142
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,880
Do you know that you have a fever?

143
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,040
Here.

144
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,980
Take the medicine.

145
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,020
Thank you, Sir.

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,660
So you're from Peking?

147
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
What's your father's name?

148
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,700
What does he do?

149
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,240
Sir, why do you ask about my father?

150
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,900
I just want to talk.

151
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
Yeah, I come from Peking.

152
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,450
My father is Xie Zhipei.

153
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
He's a teacher.

154
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Why do you want to be here at Arsenal Military Academy?

155
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,160
I...

156
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,200
I read about the admission notice

157
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,960
of our academy on the newspaper.

158
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,760
So here I come.

159
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,480
But your physical condition doesn't allow it.

160
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,080
Why do you still want to come?

161
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,080
Sir,

162
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,370
I think I'm not that bad, right?

163
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,320
With a good training,

164
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,250
I can get better.

165
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,520
I mean

166
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,380
what's your purpose of studying in a military academy?

167
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,520
I just want to.

168
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,600
I don't have a particular reason.

169
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,930
Maybe the others don't.

170
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,450
But you probably do.

171
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,640
I mean that

172
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,480
it's not appropriate for you

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,080
to join the army.

174
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,410
I told you that I would work on my training.

175
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,080
Besides,

176
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,080
even my physical condition is not well,

177
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
but I'm better than women, aren't I?

178
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,360
You're right.

179
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,840
Well,

180
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,440
Sir,

181
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
can I go back now?

182
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,640
Of course.

183
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,500
Well, you don't

184
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,640
have to go for the training today.

185
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,600
Get some rest.

186
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,620
Thank you, Sir.

187
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
What are you doing?

188
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,280
Find my things.

189
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,490
Why do you search in my drawers?

190
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,160
It's just you and me in this dorm.

191
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,320
I can't find my things in my drawers.

192
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,890
So I try my luck in yours.

193
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
What do you mean?

194
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't worry.

195
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,320
I can give it to you when I find it.

196
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,500
You're not looking for anything.

197
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,920
You're looking for trouble.

198
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,400
Do you want to pick at me?

199
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,420
Liangchen,

200
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,770
you won't take some?

201
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,780
I don't have appetite.

202
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,340
You just sleep in your bed.

203
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,340
What can that coward do to you?

204
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,890
I'm so angry at the sight of him.

205
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,080
Why don't you talk to the sergeant

206
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
and ask him to transfer you to another dorm.

207
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
I've talked to the sergeant.

208
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,700
He didn't grant it.

209
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,280
Then we can do nothing.

210
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,520
When will Gu Yanzhen come back?

211
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,160
Right.

212
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,420
Did you hear it?

213
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,920
There's a woman

214
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,880
in our academy.

215
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,740
Are you all right, Liangchen?

216
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,560
You overreacted.

217
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,760
Not at all.

218
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
Have you ever seen any woman in our academy?

219
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,640
It's impossible.

220
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,520
And I heard that

221
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,600
the woman was dressed like a man.

222
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,960
Who said that?

223
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,319
I don't know.

224
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,349
The gossip says so.

225
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,349
It's impossible.

226
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,589
We do everything together.

227
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,880
Even when we take bath.

228
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,560
If a woman is among us,

229
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,890
we would have found out.

230
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,880
Why?

231
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,160
Have you taken bath with all the others?

232
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,829
Of course.

233
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,000
I had bath with you, Shen Junshan,

234
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,520
Zhu Yanlin and Gu Yanzhen.

235
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,180
Liangchen,

236
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,100
it seems that we haven't go to bath together.

237
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,820
- I... - Liangchen,

238
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,580
I never went to bath with you, either.

239
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,340
Let me see whether you have mustache.

240
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,270
Of course I have.

241
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,820
I had bath with Shen Junshan once.

242
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,450
Do you need help?

243
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,160
Nope.

244
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,800
Did you?

245
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,900
And Gu Yanzhen.

246
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,040
Boring.

247
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,120
Hey,

248
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
would you say the woman is a ghost?

249
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,840
Coward!

250
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,560
No.

251
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,880
I heard that

252
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,880
the academy

253
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,160
was built on a mass grave.

254
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
Then our masculine

255
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,040
can dispel the evil spirits.

256
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
But we're not strong enough.

257
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,060
Liangchen,

258
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,770
we're not strong enough for the ghost.

259
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,920
Eat your meal.

260
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
I'm a little scared.

261
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,320
Mr. Gu,

262
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,520
where are you going?

263
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,780
I...I just want to take a walk.

264
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,410
Do you need company?

265
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,520
No. Forget it.

266
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,760
I'm not going.

267
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,380
I'm sick of you.

268
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,080
Mr. Gu,

269
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,360
don't stay up late.

270
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,480
I could say the same to you.

271
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,960
Mr. Gu,

272
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,880
don't worry.

273
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,900
We take shifts.

274
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,080
We're not tired.

275
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,420
Liangchen.

276
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,720
Liangchen, Liangchen.

277
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,240
Coming.

278
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,620
Liangchen,

279
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,530
Gu Yanzhen is getting married.

280
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,020
Where is it?

281
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,940
The other side.

282
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,880
Here.

283
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,380
Liangchen,

284
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,120
what is it?

285
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Don't you want to say something?

286
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
What should I say?

287
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,920
What is his marriage

288
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,760
to do with us?

289
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,760
Don't say that.

290
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,500
We're in the same academy.

291
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,120
Shall we bring some gifts to him?

292
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
What gifts?

293
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Did he invite you?

294
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,440
Don't bother.

295
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,120
Move.

296
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,960
Morning temper?

297
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,600
The sky is crystal

298
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:26,200
The chrysanthemum field is golden

299
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:38,680
The west wind is chilly

300
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,840
Manting has been singing since noon.

301
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,040
Why is she still singing?

302
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,440
She sings well.

303
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,440
Mrs. Zhang, Mrs. Li,

304
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
and Cuijuan from the kitchen

305
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
are all listening outside the door.

306
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,440
My lady, don't worry.

307
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,900
She's not going anywhere.

308
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,850
She singles out the bitter love songs.

309
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,220
She was singing about the Cry at the Tomb.

310
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,530
Now it's the Cry at the Wedding.

311
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,560
One minute ago it was Butterfly Lovers.

312
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,620
Now it's the Romance of West Chamber.

313
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,020
She seems determined.

314
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
When she heard that he was getting married,

315
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,690
she packed up and decided to go to Nanjing.

316
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,530
What a shame for our family!

317
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,530
Alright.

318
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,720
The lady must be thirsty.

319
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,560
Bring some fruits to her room.

320
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,080
OK.

321
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
What should I say?

322
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,480
She is your daughter.

323
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,340
How could you say such mean words?

324
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
If others overhear,

325
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,770
they'll gossip.

326
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,360
Here.

327
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,730
Alright.

328
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,040
Dismiss the servants.

329
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,920
There are so many people.

330
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,120
The outsiders would wonder

331
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,580
whether something is wrong with our family.

332
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,600
What if she runs away?

333
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,520
She is singing upstairs.

334
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,520
And the servants are watching.

335
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,650
How can she run away?

336
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Well.

337
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,880
Dismiss them.

338
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,090
Yes, master.

339
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,040
My lady,

340
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,760
my lady,

341
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,360
you have sung all the afternoon.

342
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,960
Take some fruits. They're good to your throat.

343
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,560
My lady.

344
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,480
Put it here.

345
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,760
The pursuit of fame

346
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:37,200
Separates us

347
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,800
Hello?

348
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,090
Can I have a ticket to Nanking tonight?

349
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,050
No more tickets.

350
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,280
No...no sleepers?

351
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,320
No.

352
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,920
Well, I'll take the seat then.

353
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,120
No tickets for the coming 3 days.

354
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,000
No tickets at all?

355
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,560
Three...

356
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,200
Do you buy it or not?

357
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,400
Don't waste our time.

358
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,880
I do.

359
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,920
If I don't buy tickets,

360
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,320
then what am I doing here?

361
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,680
Where to?

362
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,210
Nanjing.

363
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,340
No tickets.

364
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,540
Miss Qu didn't get the ticket.

365
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,080
Should we

366
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,520
take her home?

367
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,360
No.

368
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,400
Mr. Shen,

369
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,530
if we don't get her home,

370
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,680
she'll go to Gu Yanzhen.

371
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,290
He may have strong background.

372
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,210
But we're not afraid of him.

373
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,220
Since Manting wants to go,

374
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,800
let her go.

375
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,480
Mr. Shen,

376
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,480
you've been loving Miss Qu for so many years.

377
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,740
We all know that you do.

378
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,920
Now that she is leaving you for another man.

379
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,250
Aren't you sad about it?

380
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,570
Manting is no longer a little girl.

381
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,760
She has her own ideas.

382
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,160
If I force my views on her,

383
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,320
we would just drive her away.

384
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,920
Mr. Shen,

385
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,680
you're so considerate.

386
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,290
Send a ticket to her.

387
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,080
Tell our men in Nanjing to look after her.

388
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
Don't let her get in trouble.

389
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,930
Tell me about it in case anything happens.

390
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,360
Yes, Mr. Shen.

391
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,500
Did you hear it?

392
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,850
Gu Yanzhen is getting married.

393
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,880
The bride is General Dong's daughter.

394
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,320
It's said that she is pretty.

395
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,760
What a lucky man!

396
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,290
No wonder he's not coming back.

397
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,240
You!

398
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,880
You and Gu Yanzhen are close.

399
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,440
You were in the same dorm.

400
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,440
Now he's getting married.

401
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,100
Have you never heard about it?

402
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,780
Do you get the invitation?

403
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,220
What are you trying to say?

404
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,520
What is it?

405
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,380
You're not happy that he's getting married?

406
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,440
Good! Bravo!

407
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,800
Good.

408
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,640
You two can take a rest now.

409
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,720
Who wants to give it a try?

410
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,200
Me.

411
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,060
Whom do you want to fight with?

412
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,120
Him.

413
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,920
Come on.

414
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,080
I'm OK with it.

415
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,040
Come on.

416
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,360
Seriously?

417
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,400
Good.

418
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,040
Off you go.

419
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Here it is.

420
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,690
Help me put it here, please.

421
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,920
Excuse me.

422
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,120
Excuse me.

423
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,370
Coming through.

424
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,840
It's OK.

426
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Allow me.

427
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,840
Thanks.

428
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,520
Thanks.

429
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,160
It's OK.

430
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,120
Thanks.

431
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,760
Look.

432
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,640
Is that Qu Manting?

433
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,820
Is that her?

434
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,120
Hello?

435
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,240
Are you Miss Qu Manting?

436
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,280
No?

437
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,280
But you look a lot like her.

438
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,480
Ms. Qu.

439
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,760
Though you wear sunglasses,

440
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,220
I can still recognize you.

441
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,800
You look much pretty.

442
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,650
Prettier than the one in photos in the newspaper.

443
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,560
Thanks.

444
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,640
So beautiful.

445
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,360
Ms. Qu,

446
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,080
what's the purpose of your trip to Nanjing?

447
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,000
What are you going to do in Nanjing?

448
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,880
We are going to make an appeal to the government.

449
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,040
To show our stance against the Twenty-one Treaty,

450
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,520
and support the students' demonstration in Peking.

451
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,040
Yeah.

452
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,480
Then why do you go to Nanjing

453
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
instead of Peking?

454
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,720
Vice Minister Gu Zongtang's son

455
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,040
will be engaged in Nanjing.

456
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,560
Most of his colleagues

457
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,490
went to Nanjing.

458
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,560
So we are going there, too.

459
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,200
Yeah.

460
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,600
We are going to Nanjing, too.

461
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,440
Ms. Qu,

462
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,290
are you going to Nanjing

463
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,120
for the sake of Mr. Gu?

464
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,140
It's said that he's getting married.

465
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,530
The bride is Dong Huiseng's daughter.

466
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,840
Ms. Qu,

467
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,680
are you going to win him back?

468
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,000
Win him back?

469
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,560
Don't be shy.

470
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,480
We're all on your side.

471
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,480
Yeah. Yeah.

472
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,760
We'll support you.

473
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,880
Miss Dong is not as pretty as you.

474
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,800
What has she got to compete with you?

475
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,360
Right.

476
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Being born in a good family

477
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,920
is all she's got.

478
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,200
Yeah.

479
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Right.

480
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Thank you for your support.

481
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,280
Guys,

482
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,080
let's figure out a slogan

483
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,000
to cheer for Ms. Qu, OK?

484
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,800
OK. Good.

485
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,720
How about freedom for marriage,

486
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,740
hail true love?

487
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,560
Good! Bravo!

488
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,640
Freedom for marriage! Hail true love!

489
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,920
Freedom for marriage! Hail true love!

490
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,880
Freedom for marriage! Hail true love!

491
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,010
Freedom for marriage! Hail true love!

492
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,040
Don't worry.

493
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll do my best

494
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,280
not to let you down.

495
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,480
Ms. Qu.

496
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,280
We wish you good luck.

497
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Yeah.

498
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,600
Come on.

499
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,600
Take him back.

500
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,000
Mr. Gu,

501
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,000
it's settled.

502
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,600
Just face it.

503
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,340
If you dare to run away,

504
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,970
the bride's father,

505
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,280
instead of the master will pin you down.

506
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,920
You should meet with Miss Dong.

507
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,770
Maybe you'll feel something for her.

508
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,080
We met before.

509
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,440
Running nose.

510
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,760
And short as a dwarf.

511
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,760
I get goose bumps once I think of her.

512
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,360
That was years ago.

513
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
She's totally different now.

514
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,840
She is as beautiful as a blooming rose.

515
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
The suitors

516
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,560
are queuing up in front of her door.

517
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,960
Then she must have a long corridor!

518
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,000
Mr. Gu...

519
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,540
Alright, hush now.

520
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,840
I'm sleepy.

521
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,520
I'm going to bed.

522
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,380
Leave me alone.

523
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,679
What about tomorrow?

524
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,880
We'll see.

525
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,280
Hello, Mr. Gu.

526
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,160
Yes?

527
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,240
Mr. Gu,

528
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,920
the singer, Miss Qu, went to our mansion

529
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,720
a few days ago.

530
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,960
She wanted to see you.

531
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,640
Tell her that I'm not at home.

532
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,000
But, she is no longer in Shunyuan.

533
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,000
She took the train to Nanjing according to the newspaper.

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,400
And she's coming for you.

535
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,760
For me?

536
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,480
Are you sure about it?

537
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,740
Lu read the news for me.

538
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,850
It's what the newspaper tells.

539
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,640
Which train?

540
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,680
When does it arrive?

541
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,600
According to the newspaper,

542
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,640
it's 9 a.m. tomorrow.

543
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,720
Boss.

544
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,240
Boss.

545
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Are you finished?

546
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,840
Yeah.

547
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Yeah.

548
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,980
Clean it up.

549
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,490
Boss, got any job for us?

550
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,480
What do you mean? Boss.

551
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
A big deal.

552
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
This job

553
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,240
is tough,

554
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,420
and dangerous.

555
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Do you get it?

556
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,320
Boss,

557
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,600
you said we were to steal something.

558
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,040
If we are exposed,

559
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,720
can we do this?

560
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,570
Our target is the Japanese.

561
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,820
What'd you say?

562
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,760
Understood.

563
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,680
OK.

564
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,360
Do it quick and clean.

565
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,410
Trust it on us. Boss.

566
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:05,960
OK.

567
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,010
See you then.

568
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,360
See you, boss.

569
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,040
Mr. Gu,

570
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,500
aren't we going to meet Miss Dong?

571
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,820
What are we doing here?

572
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,850
Pick up a friend.

573
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,320
What?

574
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,480
A friend.

575
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,170
Don't worry.

576
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
I promised, didn't I?

577
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,450
We pick up a friend and we leave.

578
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,240
But...

579
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,200
But what?

580
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,480
OK, Mr. Gu.

581
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,240
What are you doing here?

582
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,120
To welcome you.

583
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
What are you doing here?

584
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,000
To rescue you.

585
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,080
Good.

586
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,920
Ms. Qu.

587
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,360
Come on.

588
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Come on.

589
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,880
Take him back.

590
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,000
Mr. Gu,

591
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,760
Miss Dong is waiting for you.

592
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,680
I'm sorry, Miss Dong.

593
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,720
I picked up a friend at the train station.

594
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,580
Sorry I'm late.

595
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,140
This is my friend, Qu Manting,

596
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,120
a famous star.

597
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,730
Manting,

598
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
this is Miss Dong,

599
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,760
my fiancée.

600
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,960
Miss Dong.

601
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,680
I've heard so much about you.

602
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,880
You're so beautiful.

603
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,810
Nice to meet you.

604
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,160
Take a seat.

605
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,600
Come here.

606
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,440
Thanks.

607
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,480
I asked someone to book

608
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,610
a table in this restaurant yesterday.

609
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
I told you before.

610
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,320
The steak here is delicious.

611
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,440
You'll like it.

612
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,120
As long as it's your choice,

613
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,000
I like it.

614
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,480
Ms. Qu is a singer.

615
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,720
Yeah.

616
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Then you must be familiar

617
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,400
with clubs?

618
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,020
If you're interested,

619
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,170
Yanzhen can take you there for fun.

620
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
He's a regular guest.

621
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,120
We met there.

622
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,480
I've received western education since I was young.

623
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,760
But my parents are traditional people.

624
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
They won't allow me to get in

625
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,360
places like clubs.

626
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,080
After all, we girls

627
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,180
should behave ourselves.

628
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,700
In such places like a club,

629
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,570
however famous you are,

630
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,240
you'll be despised by people.

631
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,370
You think so?

632
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,680
What a pity!

633
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
I was planning to

634
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,720
go to a club with Yanzhen.

635
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,240
Looks like you have to go home

636
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,640
and couldn't come along.

637
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,320
It's OK.

638
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,320
So we can catch up.

639
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,480
Ms. Qu and Yanzhen are so close.

640
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,840
Not as close as you two.

641
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,320
You're his fiancée.

642
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,880
His wife in the future.

643
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,530
You're closer, naturally.

644
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,720
Yanzhen,

645
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,640
don't call her Miss Dong anymore.

646
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,720
How detached it sounds!

647
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,520
Family rules.

648
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,850
We can't help it.

649
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Both our families

650
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,660
are traditionally courteous families.

651
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,140
Our ancestors all worked in the royal court.

652
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,800
We have strict family rules.

653
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,680
Though it's a different time,

654
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,460
when new rules and ideas are introduced,

655
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,480
we still have to stick to some family rules

656
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
and courtesies.

657
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,000
Yanzhen doesn't address me with my first name

658
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,330
because he respects me.

659
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,480
You have a point.

660
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,720
Then you should call him Mr. Gu,

661
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,580
instead of his first name, right?

662
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,560
Qu Manting!

663
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
Qu Manting!

664
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,010
It's really you.

665
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,680
I watched your movies.

666
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,440
Really?

667
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,640
You're so beautiful.

668
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,360
Thanks.

669
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,140
Can I have a signature?

670
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,360
Of course.

671
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,680
OK.

672
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,680
Thank you.

673
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,380
It's OK.

674
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:01,920
Let's go.

675
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,780
Sorry for that.

676
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,240
Looks like you're very famous.

677
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,640
I starred in a few movies.

678
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,840
They get me some fame.

679
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,960
Like you just said,

680
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,730
some companies invite me to sing for them occasionally.

681
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
But for women,

682
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,160
it's too hard to make a living.

683
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,560
Well, not as easy as your life.

684
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,480
You grow up in a good family

685
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,560
and live in dream.

686
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,640
I told you

687
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,960
not to work.

688
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
It's hard for you.

689
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,400
What can I do?

690
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,360
You're getting married,

691
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,440
and can't take care of me anymore.
