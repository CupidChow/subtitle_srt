00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,580
Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 20

4
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,140
Sorry for that.

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
Looks like you're very famous.

6
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
I starred in a few movies.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
They get me some fame.

8
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,320
Like you just said,

9
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,090
some companies invite me to sing for them occasionally.

10
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
But for women,

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,520
it's too hard to make a living.

12
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,920
Well, not as easy as your life.

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
You grow up in a good family

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,920
and live in dream.

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,000
I told you

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,320
not to work.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
It's hard for you.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
What can I do?

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,720
You're getting married,

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,580
and can't take care of me anymore.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Don't get me wrong.

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,729
We're just friends.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,440
He's so kind.

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,960
So he takes care of me.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,920
I know that

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
a man like Yanzhen

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,690
can take care of lots of people.

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,440
But only one stays

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,160
by his side.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Hold on.

31
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,940
Let me help you.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,160
It's OK. I can do it myself.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,800
Be careful.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,760
It's hot.

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,329
Open your mouth.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,040
Miss Qu, where do you want to go?

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,360
I'll listen to Yanzhen.

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
It's my first trip to Nanjing.

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,970
I want to travel around.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Ms. Qu, you're so energetic.

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,050
Aren't you tired after a long trip?

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,480
As long as you want to,

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,610
it doesn't matter to get tired.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm on to something else.

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,780
I have to go.

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,960
See you.

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,160
Miss Dong, are you finished?

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,730
Sit for longer, please.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,680
Miss Dong.

50
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,210
She is so endurable.

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,490
If it were me, I would've gone long ago.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
She's Dong Huiseng's daughter.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
You can't compare her with other girls.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,410
Originally,

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,370
she was engaged with

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,329
a childhood pal.

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,480
But once my grandpa gave out news

58
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,400
to get me a wife,

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,760
her family canceled her engagement

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,020
and reached out for me.

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,160
I don't know she is such a girl.

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Why didn't you tell me about it?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,930
I wouldn't have been so nice to her.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
You call that nice?

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,320
I was very nice.

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,120
Then let's not be nice.

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,880
My pay for a movie is high.

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,520
How much do you pay me for the drama just now?

69
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,650
You name a price.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,649
It's OK if you can't pay me in money.

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,680
Pay me by yourself.

72
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,880
Are you serious?

73
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,320
When you turned down Shen Tingbai,

74
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,480
I helped you out.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,720
Let's go.

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
Where are we going?

77
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,100
To get you out of the marriage.

78
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,280
My superior asked me

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,640
to express his gratitude for helping with the delivery.

80
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
When we deliver the medicine,

81
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,080
I'll send them back.

82
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Don't mention it.

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,040
Alright then.

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,640
Travel safely.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,440
Sure. Thanks.

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,220
The four of you should be careful.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,280
Get back here as soon as the medicine is delivered.

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,720
OK.

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,280
All right. Get on the truck.

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,810
Let's go.

91
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,880
Welcome!

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,610
Nice to meet you.

93
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,090
Nice to meet you.

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Darling,

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,280
you have only one luggage.

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,920
So you must need clothes.

97
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,240
Pick some.

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,240
Chi-pao?

99
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
Our Chi-pao is

100
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,540
made of the best cloth of Nanjing.

101
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,400
If you don't dress it,

102
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,880
you can gift others or merely for collection.

103
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
They're all nice.

104
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,920
Right.

105
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,120
How do you like the white one?

106
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,500
Beautiful.

107
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,400
How about this one?

108
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,960
Nice!

109
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,400
You like all the dresses I picked?

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
You're so perfunctory.

111
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,400
Silly!

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,160
I think dresses are all the same.

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
It's the one who puts it on

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,880
makes it different.

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,730
If that's what you mean,

116
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,290
I'd like to buy them all.

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,600
As long as you like them.

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,610
So generous.

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,100
As long as you like,

120
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
I can buy all the dresses

121
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,120
in the store for you.

122
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,080
Really?

123
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,200
Excuse me?

124
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,080
Pack all the dresses and accessories

125
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,680
in your shop

126
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,680
that suit this lady

127
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,240
for me, please?

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,000
OK.

129
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,960
You.

130
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,720
Get Mr. Gu and this lady two cups of tea.

131
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,440
Hurry up.

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,080
Those over there. And there.

133
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,160
And those on the upstairs.

134
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
Pack them all.

135
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,000
Very well!

136
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,840
Do you know me?

137
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,960
Of course.

138
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,120
You're Mr. Hu Liuweng's grandson,

139
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,040
Mr. Gu Yanzhen.

140
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,240
Everybody knows you.

141
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,920
I met you before

142
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,960
when I delivered dresses to your mansion.

143
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,400
And I read a lot about you on the newspaper recently.

144
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,060
What an honor that you actually come to my store!

145
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,300
How about this?

146
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,080
Can you go to the Hu Mansion for the payment?

147
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,920
Of course.

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
It's a great honor

149
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,220
that you come to our store.

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Do you need these dresses to be delivered to the mansion?

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,040
No need.

152
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,010
She's not living there.

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,480
After all,

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm getting engaged

155
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,960
with another girl.

156
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,050
I should show some respect to my bride.

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,280
Am I right,

158
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,960
darling?

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,930
So considerate!

160
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,520
So which hotel does the lady board at now?

161
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,850
I can send someone over.

162
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,480
I just picked her up at the train station.

163
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,810
We haven't decided yet.

164
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,280
Let them pack up.

165
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,920
We'll shop around.

166
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,200
But there are too many things.

167
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm afraid if you can carry them.

168
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,080
Look,

169
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,160
how many waitresses do you have?

170
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
Plus the ones on leave,

171
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
a dozen, give or take.

172
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,880
Good.

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,600
I want all of them

174
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,000
to go with us and

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640
carry the things we buy.

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,680
I'll give each of them 10 silver dollars.

177
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,810
Ten silver dollars?

178
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,000
It...it's...

179
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,520
What? No?

180
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
No, no. It's not that.

181
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,480
I'm afraid that they'll do something wrong

182
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,600
and disgrace you.

183
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,000
It's OK.

184
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,950
Just go shopping with us.

185
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,840
Alright.

186
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,520
I'm sorry, everyone.

187
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,140
The engine is not working.

188
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,560
You can take a rest over here.

189
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,620
I'll sign the bill.

190
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,920
OK.

191
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,280
The engine is not working?

192
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,720
How long does the repair take?

193
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,650
Four, five days.

194
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,690
Four, five days?

195
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,320
There's no other way.

196
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,920
OK, it's done.

197
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,720
Mr. Wu,

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,320
are there other vehicles going back?

199
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,080
Other buses?

200
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,000
There are no more vehicles to Shunyuan for today.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,560
Besides,

202
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,480
my truck can't be pulled over here.

203
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,440
What should we do?

204
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,900
We can't sit here and wait.

205
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,280
Let's take the train back.

206
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,480
Good idea.

207
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,840
There's a train

208
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,500
from Uiju County to Shunyuan.

209
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,640
You can take that one.

210
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,200
Really?

211
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
Let's take the train.

212
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,880
All right.

213
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,880
The train then.

214
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,080
I'll get the luggage.

215
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,480
I'm sorry, everyone.

216
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,080
Alright.

217
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,120
Alright.

218
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,680
See you then.

219
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,160
See you.

220
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,200
Here.

221
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Here's the water.

222
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

223
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,850
Wrong compartment.

224
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,360
Everything OK?

225
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080
It's OK.

226
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,220
He's getting water to the next compartment.

227
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,080
Sit down.

228
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,320
Do you get it?

229
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Four on this side.

230
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,080
And beyond that are the standard carts.

231
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,000
They have 3-5 men in each cart.

232
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,560
All dressed like civilians.

233
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,400
I guess

234
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,140
they're all armed.

235
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,280
There are two men guarding the freight cart.

236
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,480
We don't know how many are there inside.

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,460
The cart is locked from inside it.

238
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,620
We have to use guns.

239
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
Or we won't open it.

240
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,170
But once we use guns,

241
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,280
we're exposed.

242
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,650
Once we engage with the men inside,

243
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,050
the two men outside will

244
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,680
definitely hear the sounds.

245
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,140
And they'll call for help.

246
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,280
Then let's split up.

247
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,360
We do it at the same time.

248
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
You take care of the men inside.

249
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,960
I take care of the two outside there.

250
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,620
Open the door when you finish.

251
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,160
The next stop is Dandong.

252
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,240
After that is Baihe County.

253
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,040
Zhameng is waiting for us there.

254
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,960
Once he gets on, we'll do it.

255
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,200
OK.

256
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,560
Here.

257
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,120
Tired?

258
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,010
A little bit.

259
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,120
Then get some sleep.

260
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,890
Lean on me and take a nap.

261
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,080
It's OK.

262
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,760
What are you looking for?

263
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,480
Liangchen.

264
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
I have roasted chicken.

265
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,660
And steamed bread.

266
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,290
Do you want some?

267
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,460
I don't have appetite.

268
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,130
Maybe later.

269
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
Follow Takeda's men.

270
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,580
If Rong Mansion has their hands in it,

271
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,640
stay out of it for the moment.

272
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,210
When they get the goods,

273
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,840
we'll hijack it.

274
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,040
Ji Jin.

275
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,960
It's none of our business.

276
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,760
Stay out of it.

277
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,330
Who are they?

278
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,560
You...

279
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,400
Stop.

280
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,340
If you want to talk, talk here.

281
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,720
Excuse me?

282
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,080
There's an accident up ahead.

283
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,040
The railway is blocked.

284
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,200
We have to stay here

285
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,360
for a while.

286
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,180
The conductor asked me to give you a hint.

287
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,760
How long will it take?

288
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Well,

289
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,530
it's hard to say.

290
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,050
Three to five hours if we're lucky.

291
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,080
If we're not,

292
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,000
it could take one or two days.

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,520
What?

294
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,540
One or two days?

295
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,200
Hurry.

296
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,080
What's that sound?

297
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,010
Is that gunshot?

298
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,290
Don't panic.

299
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,980
Stay smart.

300
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,820
This train is not safe.

301
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,240
Hurry up.

302
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Take them away.

303
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,520
Leave them to me.

304
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,180
Be careful.

305
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,640
Go.

306
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,360
Go.

307
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,730
Junshan.

308
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,380
I need to use the bathroom.

309
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,040
OK.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,860
Excuse me, sir?

311
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,620
Can you please make way for me?

312
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,040
Hurry up.

313
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,730
Liangchen. Be careful.

314
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,400
Kid.

315
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,280
See you.

316
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,000
Are you all right, Liangchen?

317
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,320
It's OK.

318
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,000
Let's go.

319
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,120
Get them.

320
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,280
Come on.

321
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,960
Hurry up.

322
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
It's them.

323
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,480
Hurry.

324
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,120
They have our goods.

325
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,120
After them.

326
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,280
Split up.

327
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,440
Go.

328
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,250
Junshan and we were separated.

329
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,610
We're out numbered,

330
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,760
and unarmed.

331
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,920
We'd better

332
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,320
get back to the academy and report to the sergeant.

333
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
OK.

334
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Are you alright?

335
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm OK.

336
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,530
Let's go.

337
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,520
Will Song and Ji Jin be fine?

338
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,930
Yeah, they will.

339
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,600
Hurry.

340
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,840
Be careful.

341
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,720
Go.

342
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,440
Let go.

343
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,600
No.

344
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,640
Let go.

345
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,250
It's beautiful.

346
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,480
What?

347
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,740
I said it's beautiful.

348
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,820
That one is beautiful.

349
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,240
Gu Yanzhen.

350
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,060
I asked you to let go. Why didn't you do it?

351
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,040
I can't leave you there.

352
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,880
You were up there.

353
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,680
You could find some ropes, or wood,

354
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,880
and get me out of here.

355
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,180
It's better than both of us being trapped down here.

356
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
I...I didn't think so much.

357
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,040
Can we get out of here?

358
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,240
Yes.

359
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,080
Really?

360
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,200
How?

361
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,280
Waiting for help.

362
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
It's clearly

363
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,680
a hunter's trap.

364
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,520
He'll come from time to time

365
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,180
to check if there's anything.

366
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,520
How frequently will he come?

367
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,320
I don't know.

368
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,090
What if he doesn't come?

369
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
We'll die.

370
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,780
Are you hungry now?

371
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,760
You should have eaten the chicken on the train.

372
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,240
Well.

373
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,000
Did the photographers get it?

374
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,600
I think they did.

375
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,760
What will Dong Xiaowan react when she sees the newspaper?

376
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,920
I think

377
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,960
she will be mad.

378
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,960
When we get out,

379
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,760
let's find that journalist

380
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,090
and get the photos back.

381
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,440
Flowers!

382
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Flowers for sale!

383
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,960
OK. It's here.

384
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,080
Go in then.

385
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,320
Let's continue tomorrow.

386
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,400
I have lots of good ideas.

387
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,080
No need. It's enough.

388
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
That's enough.

389
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,560
Are you coming to me tomorrow?

390
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,960
We'll see.

391
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,160
Go in.

392
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,160
Do you want some flowers?

393
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,440
Qu Manting.

394
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,850
Thank you for today.

395
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
That's my friend.

396
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,600
That's it?

397
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,640
Yeah.

398
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,560
Go back now.

399
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,240
It's my fault.

400
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,520
I'm too charming.

401
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,320
I have to be modest later.

402
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,600
No need.

403
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,520
It's OK.

404
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,400
Thanks.

405
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,380
Huang Song told me that

406
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,320
you had a twin sister.

407
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,880
Yeah.

408
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,040
You look exactly the same?

409
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,360
Exactly.

410
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,160
I can't imagine

411
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,930
what you look like in women's outfits.

412
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,000
Shen Junshan.

413
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,300
If the hunter doesn't show up,

414
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,360
will we die down here?

415
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,970
No, we won't.

416
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,040
Really?

417
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,640
Yeah.

418
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,800
I'm here.

419
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,440
You'll be fine.

420
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,680
Shen Junshan.

421
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,360
Shen Junshan.

422
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,340
You wake up.

423
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,760
How lucky I am!

424
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,680
No chicken or roe deer,

425
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,200
but a young couple.

426
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Young couple?

427
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,040
I'm a man.

428
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,920
Man?

429
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,360
Sorry for that.

430
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,360
Look.

431
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,040
I can't tell.

432
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,800
Sir,

433
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,920
can you please

434
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
help us out?

435
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,560
Of course.

436
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,200
With you down there,

437
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
how am I going to catch wild animals?

438
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,800
You two

439
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,200
are so lucky.

440
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,800
There are wolves in the mountain.

441
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
And you didn't run into them.

442
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,330
We have guns. We're not afraid.

443
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,240
I'm talking about packs of wolves.

444
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,320
If you run into a pack,

445
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,440
the guns you have

446
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,600
won't protect you.

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,680
Sir,

448
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,040
now that you know that there are wolves,

449
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,600
why don't you move to places down the mountain?

450
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,600
Down there is the world of rich men and authorities.

451
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,840
And there are Japanese and Russians.

452
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
They're all the rule makers.

453
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
But we're the followers.

454
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,410
I'd rather stay above here.

455
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,560
Besides,

456
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
my wife is here.

457
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,880
I don't want to leave her alone.

458
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,240
She can go with you.

459
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
She can't.

460
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,800
It's here.

461
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,600
It's my home.

462
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,560
My home is warm.

463
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,820
Come in and have a rest.

464
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,280
Old woman,

465
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,600
I'm back.

466
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,930
They're our guests, lost in the mountain.

467
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,800
Come on in.

468
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,050
This is my daughter, Lingdang.

469
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,530
Nice to meet you, Lingdang.

470
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,200
She's quiet

471
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,520
and shy.

472
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,580
Can she hear me?

473
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,800
She can.

474
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,360
She's born like this.

475
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,680
Did you go to see a doctor?

476
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,920
We went to the provincial hospitals.

477
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,960
They didn't know what was wrong.

478
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,720
She doesn't cry much.

479
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,240
And she eats and sleeps like a normal kid.

480
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,400
Over time, I get used to it.

481
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,760
Come here.

482
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,370
I'll get you some water.

483
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,680
Come. Take a seat.

484
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
Sit down. Don't stand there.

485
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,440
A moment please.

486
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,700
I'll get you some food.

487
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,560
You stay here for the night.

488
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,160
I'll send you back tomorrow.

489
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,970
Thank you very much.

490
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,200
Don't mention it.

491
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,320
Take here

492
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,440
as your home.

493
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,500
I'll get you some food.

494
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,480
Thanks.

495
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,840
Lingdang.

496
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,120
Can I pat on your doggie?

497
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,199
Lingdang.

498
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,670
One pat.

499
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,409
Don't be afraid.

500
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,630
Look.

501
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,409
Your dog isn't afraid of me.

502
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,920
Lingdang,

503
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,080
who braids your hair?

504
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,960
It's ugly.

505
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,230
Let me braid it for you, OK?

506
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,920
You can braid hair?

507
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,180
I have a sister, remember?

508
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,920
All right. Lingdang.

509
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,250
You look pretty.

510
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,000
Let me get a mirror for you.

511
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,490
What is this?

512
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,000
What is it?

513
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,400
This is why

514
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
the Japanese are following us.

515
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,960
Why is it in my bag?

516
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,860
Do you remember

517
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
that a man

518
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,960
hit you down on the train?

519
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,560
Be careful.

520
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,000
Kid.

521
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,920
See you.

522
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,880
The Royal Seal!

523
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,450
Hush.

524
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,660
No more royal talking.

525
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
I heard that in recent years

526
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
maids and eunuchs

527
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,240
in the Forbidden City

528
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,360
stole treasures

529
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,410
and sold them on the market.

530
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,920
No wonder the Japanese

531
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,380
were tailing us like dogs.

532
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,920
It's such a big piece of gold.

533
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
It must be worth a lot.

534
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,800
It doesn't matter how much it is worth.

535
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,880
They must want the seal

536
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,040
for other purposes.

537
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,360
Dinner is coming.

538
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Come on.

539
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,200
Let's have dinner now.

540
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,880
Thanks.

541
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,120
Come here.

542
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,480
I don't know your name yet.

543
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
My surname is Wei.

544
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,280
Here.

545
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,360
Take some porridge.

546
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,420
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

547
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,080
Come on.

548
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,480
Take some while it's hot.

549
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,520
Thanks.

550
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,220
Why doesn't Lingdang eat?

551
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,600
She...

552
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,320
It's not dinner time for her.

553
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,560
She's punctual on dinner.

554
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,420
She doesn't eat earlier or later.

555
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
Lingdang is so distinctive.

556
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,280
Lingdang,

557
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,680
take a bite, will you?

558
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,370
She allows you to touch her?

559
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,720
She doesn't refuse.

560
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,520
But she never allows anyone to touch her.

561
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,450
Especially man.

562
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,890
It seems that

563
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,450
she likes you very much.

564
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,160
Really?

565
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,480
Lingdang.

566
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,600
Do you like me?

567
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,880
My house is small.

568
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,760
You two make do for the night.

569
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,480
Thanks.

570
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,560
Compared with living in the open,

571
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,440
your house is much better.

572
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:20,920
Alright.

573
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,160
Get some rest.

574
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,260
Don't stand there.

575
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
Aren't you tired?

576
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,040
I'm OK.

577
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,840
I'm not tired.

578
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,080
You sleep.

579
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,320
I'll warm up.

580
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,040
You haven't slept for 24 hours.

581
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,100
Get some sleep now.

582
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,120
Do you have a problem

583
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,600
sleeping with others?

584
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,840
One day when we go to war,

585
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,240
you'll have to cope with worse situations.

586
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,640
You sleep.

587
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,480
I'll be fine.

588
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,600
OK then.

589
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,240
Go to sleep.

590
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,840
OK.

591
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,920
With your clothes on?

592
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm cold.

593
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,640
No quilt?

594
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,330
I'm not cold.

595
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,220
Go to sleep.

596
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,170
What are you looking at?

597
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,920
I...I'm not.

598
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,640
You're really like a girl.

599
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,200
No wonder Mr. Wei couldn't tell.

600
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,240
Who...who's like a girl?

601
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,080
You sold your countrymen to the invaders.

602
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,040
You have no right to make money on this.

603
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,920
Did I ask you to speak?

604
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
- Did I ask you to speak? - Liangchen.

605
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,240
Shen Junshan.

606
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,160
Are you all right, Liangchen?

607
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,680
I'm OK.

608
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,320
Hurry.

609
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,480
Be careful.
