Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,380
Episode 26

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,080
Do you deserve a second chance?

5
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,440
If I fail again,

6
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
I'll kill myself.

7
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,400
Boss,

8
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,400
Lord Chengrui is outside

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
asking to see you.

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,720
This is your last chance.

11
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,329
The Royal Seal is in your hands, right?

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,320
I know you're working for the Japanese.

13
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,420
I don't care about other things,

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,079
but the Seal

15
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,400
is my ancestor's legacy.

16
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,079
It's of significant importance

17
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,560
especially now.

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,730
You cannot give it to the Japanese.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,820
Your ancestor?

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
Why should I care

21
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,920
about your ancestor?

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,480
Chengrui,

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,760
don't tell me you forgot.

24
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,080
You're a smart man.

25
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,500
Don't bring up things like ancestors or status

26
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,800
in front of me.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,660
I have nothing to do with them.

28
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm the head of the Japan COC.

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
The chamber's interest

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,840
is my priority.

31
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,360
Xianrong, since when you've become like this?

32
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,840
Stop it.

33
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,650
You just want the Seal back, don't you?

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,520
That's easy.

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Pay the ransom with gold and silver.

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Remember,

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,320
your whole family must come.

38
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
Both of you volunteer to

39
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
be Qu Manting's bodyguards?

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,720
-Yes. -Yes.

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
How come you two are so eager all of a sudden?

42
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,180
Gu Yanzhen,

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
give me a reason.

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,640
Sir,

45
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Ms. Qu Manting is a young lady,

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,920
but she's repeatedly made

47
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,520
patriotic anti-Japanese remarks in public,

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,320
condemning the Japanese

49
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,450
for their despicable acts in Feng'an.

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Her courage and spirit

51
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,220
are admirable.

52
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,060
Even stalking and assassination

53
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,460
can't change her mind.

54
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,200
What a heroine!

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,330
She's set an example

56
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,120
for me, our country and our people.

57
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,880
She's a role model for all soldiers as well.

58
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
Now she's in trouble,

59
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,200
as a soldier,

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,520
it's my duty

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
to protect her from being harmed.

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,880
Those are my heartfelt words.

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,410
I hope you can grant my request.

64
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,600
Huang Song,

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,460
what about you?

66
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,040
I've met her before.

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,050
Now that Liangchen isn't here,

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,480
I feel bored.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,280
Look at you two,

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,520
one is clumsy;

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,600
the other is unreliable.

72
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,000
Corporal.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,480
Yes!

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,200
Go

75
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,120
ask Shen Junshan to come here.

76
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes.

77
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,820
Sir,

78
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,200
why do you want to see him?

79
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,960
We can do it.

80
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,440
I don't

81
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,000
trust you two.

82
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,880
You can go with him,

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
or just leave.

84
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,400
So unfair!

85
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,730
Yanzhen.

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,520
Stop it.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,960
Sergeant Guo,

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
we'll go.

89
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,210
The more,

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,320
the merrier.

91
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,810
What's going on?

92
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,600
They all feel sorry for you?

93
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,920
They came to protect you.

94
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,720
So many!

95
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,720
Miss,

96
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,360
this is for you.

97
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,360
What is it?

98
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,640
Another auction!

99
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,600
Those invitations came every month.

100
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,320
Forget it.

101
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,050
It's boring.

102
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Have a seat.

103
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
Let me go get changed.

104
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,020
The Royal Seal?

105
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,580
That's what happened.

106
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
So you don't know who took it?

107
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,680
I'm not sure.

108
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,760
But I feel

109
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,610
the Japanese are involved.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,640
Yes.

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,250
Last time, on the train,

112
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,490
they were Japanese.

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,560
If the Japanese are involved,

114
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,490
it can't be good.

115
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
It's definitely more than just an auction.

116
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,140
If that's the case,

117
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,929
we should go and find out

118
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,950
what the Japanese are plotting.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,669
But,

120
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,909
we have no invitations.

121
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,720
Why...

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
Why are you staring at me?

123
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,600
I only have one.

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,760
It's natural for a superstar like you

125
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,000
to bring a few bodyguards, right?

126
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
I guess.

127
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,280
You said the Japanese are plotting something.

128
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
So it's risky to attend the auction.

129
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
Then why should I go?

130
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,880
What are you afraid of?

131
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,940
We'll protect you.

132
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,240
So extravagant.

133
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,520
It's a huge crowd.

134
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,770
You call this extravagant?

135
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,600
My driver's birthday celebration

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,060
had more people than this.

137
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,440
Miss Yuan, look here.

138
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,040
Miss Yuan.

139
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,760
Miss Yuan.

140
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,620
Look over here.

141
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,260
Miss Yuan,

142
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,320
do you think you and Ms. Qu Manting,

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,450
who is more popular?

144
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,120
Can you answer the question?

145
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Isn't that Vice Minister Gu's son, Gu Yanzhen?

146
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,840
And that man is

147
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,660
Shen Tingbai's brother,

148
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,520
the second son of the Shens.

149
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,040
How come they're here together?

150
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,840
Go have a look.

151
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,400
It may be a scoop.

152
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,930
Let's go.

153
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,800
Ms. Qu,

154
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,480
look here.

155
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,280
Ms. Qu.

156
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,040
Ms. Qu.

157
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu.

158
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
How do you feel about

159
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,440
coming to this event

160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,100
with Ms. Qu?

161
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,140
Can you tell us?

162
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,080
Mr. Gu.

163
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,640
Ms. Qu.

164
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
Didn't we agree to lay low?

165
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,440
Yes.

166
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
This is a low profile.

167
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,570
Junshan.

168
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,360
Excuse me.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,280
Come.

170
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,120
Chengrui,

171
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,600
this may be a trap.

172
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,000
Stay alert.

173
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,360
Take care of your mother.

174
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,120
Yes, father.

175
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,280
I've made arrangements.

176
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,800
OK.

177
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm relieved then.

178
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
Lord Rong's arrived.

179
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,520
OK.

180
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,480
Lord Rong.

181
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,480
Nice to meet you.

182
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
Lord.

183
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,880
Let's go.

184
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,280
Lord.

185
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Stick to the plan.

186
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,760
Yes.

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Are you clear?

188
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,120
Yes,

189
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,980
loud and clear.

190
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,400
Other things are less important.

191
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,660
Take as many as you can.

192
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
But you must get the Royal Seal.

193
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,520
I know. I will.

194
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,480
I know.

195
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,810
Consider it done, boss.

196
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,610
Let's go.

197
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,640
Look,

198
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,360
the two men talking on the left

199
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,400
is Yu Huimin from the Peking Finance Department,

200
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,060
and Gong Zizhen from the Education Department.

201
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,520
The one on the right

202
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,380
is Fang Dayou from the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

203
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
Those people talking in a small circle

204
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,340
are former royal members.

205
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,440
All of them

206
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,520
are powerful figures.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
Isn't that Mayor Bai?

208
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,570
So many people are here.

209
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,640
The situation

210
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,880
will be more complicated than we expected.

211
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Be extra careful.

212
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Hey,

213
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
you all came with me.

214
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,770
Don't make a huge scene.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,800
Listen,

216
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,560
you must...

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,240
You ungrateful...

218
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,100
ungrateful ingrates!

219
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,840
Invitation, please.

220
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,440
Welcome.

221
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,440
Hello,

222
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,740
invitation, please.

223
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,890
Welcome.

224
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,440
They are?

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,040
My entourage.

226
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,480
You don't expect me to carry

227
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,610
the stuff I bid back home alone, right?

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,660
The auction is about to begin.

229
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,680
You came in time.

230
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,440
Welcome.

231
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Welcome.

232
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,600
Please.

233
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,200
Hello.

234
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,120
You must be Ms. Qu Manting.

235
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,680
I am.

236
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,040
Where's the banquet hall?

237
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
I didn't find it.

238
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,160
Xue,

239
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,660
are you going to the banquet hall?

240
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,200
Yes.

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,940
I'm bringing Miss Yuan there.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Bring Ms. Qu with you, too.

243
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,920
OK.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,560
Ms. Qu,

245
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,820
follow me, please.

246
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
Go in from the back,

247
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,160
got it?

248
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,680
Yes.

249
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
OK. Go ahead.

250
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,640
Ladies, thanks for joining us tonight.

251
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,040
When the auction begins,

252
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,880
please bring your items

253
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,360
to the stage respectively

254
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,010
according to the number

255
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,120
on your wrist corsage

256
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,920
and give them to the auctioneer.

257
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,220
It's simple, isn't it?

258
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,320
Of course,

259
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
not everyone

260
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,060
can undertake such a task.

261
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,200
Only ladies like you who are

262
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,960
pretty, elegant and graceful

263
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,820
are qualified.

264
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,440
Well,

265
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,680
would you please

266
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,520
come and collect your number?

267
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,570
Let's go.

268
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,520
The auction

269
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,920
is in your hands, Mr. James.

270
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,840
Don't worry.

271
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
You can trust me.

272
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,560
Just now, I saw several

273
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,650
former royal members outside.

274
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,960
I fear if they see the items,

275
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,760
they'll make a scene.

276
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,770
No need to worry, Mr. James.

277
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,280
Guests we invited

278
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,960
won't cause any trouble.

279
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,000
Besides, there are guards

280
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,330
everywhere in the hall.

281
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,480
All troublemakers, if there's any,

282
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,410
will be taken care of immediately.

283
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,960
We won't allow anyone to sabotage the auction.

284
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,490
That's good. I'm relieved.

285
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,000
Is there any item you fancy?

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Of course.

287
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,080
I heard that item was exceptional.

288
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,560
Really?

289
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,040
Yes.

290
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,410
It seems that

291
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,800
the Japanese aren't the only problem.

292
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,200
The Royal Seal will be auctioned.

293
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,320
I bet those former royal members

294
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,780
are here for the Seal, too.

295
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
What should we do?

296
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,400
Tons of people are in the hall.

297
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,660
Let's canvass the area

298
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,280
before making our next move.

299
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,320
Let's split up

300
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
and come back in 10 minutes.

301
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,240
Let's go.

302
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:05,960
Let's go.

303
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
Find a chance

304
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,160
and kill her.

305
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,400
Yes.

306
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Since she is here,

307
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,819
Xie Liangchen may also be around.

308
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,000
Find where she is

309
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,609
and get rid of her as well

310
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,520
if you see her.

311
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,520
Yes.

312
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Are all items ready for the auction?

313
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
There are tons of guests.

314
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,140
No mistake is allowed.

315
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,280
Everything is arranged as you requested.

316
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,740
They'd better not show up.

317
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,640
But if they do,

318
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,440
they won't get out of here alive.

319
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,680
This time,

320
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,480
we cannot make mistakes.

321
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,240
You can rest assured.

322
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,420
Tons of the Japanese are guarding the aisle.

323
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,420
There are guards at all exits,

324
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,520
all armed.

325
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,460
The place is heavily guarded.

326
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,280
A few exits have been blocked.

327
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,080
No one is allowed to go near them.

328
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,530
The auction tonight

329
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,330
isn't as simple as it seems.

330
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,840
Is it a trap?

331
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,080
Items for the auction are many

332
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,210
and sensitive, too.

333
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,880
There must be one place more heavily guarded

334
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,810
than the others.

335
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,360
Listen,

336
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,000
let's split up into two teams,

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,960
one going upstairs;

338
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,220
the other downstairs.

339
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,280
First, get rid of the guards

340
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,080
at the exit.

341
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,560
By the way,

342
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,400
we don't know the structure of the building,

343
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,040
so

344
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,920
our priority

345
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,600
is to find the floor plan first.

346
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,330
Understand?

347
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,040
Move.

348
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,490
Who is it?

349
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,600
Who's inside?

350
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,850
What are you doing here?

351
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,400
I...

352
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,200
Well...

353
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
Hey, you...

354
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,860
See you in a bit.

355
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Is anyone here?

356
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,240
Come out.

357
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,520
My hands are itchy.

358
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,100
Yanzhen, lower your voice,

359
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,300
or others may find us.

360
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,040
Oh silly!

361
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,240
Huang Song,

362
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,840
Come here.

363
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,770
Help me, help me.

364
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,560
OK, yeah.

365
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
Hey, are you a guard?

366
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,600
I am.

367
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,460
Untie me first.

368
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,080
Untie me.

369
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,800
-Hurry. -OK, OK, OK.

370
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,880
Give me a hand.

371
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,080
What happened to you?

372
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,880
Someone hit me and I passed out.

373
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,480
Who the hell hit you?

374
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,240
I didn't see his face.

375
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,600
Untie me. Hurry up.

376
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
I remember someone said

377
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,040
to get rid of the guards first.

378
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,480
That's right.

379
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm kidding.

380
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,530
It's a joke. Come on.

381
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
He's fainted? Well.

382
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

383
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,260
Be careful.

384
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,000
OK.

385
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,280
I'm going to the second floor.

386
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,840
OK.

387
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,800
Hey,

388
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,050
have some rest here.

389
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,320
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,560
Boss.

391
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,040
Finished?

392
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,440
All of them.

393
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,040
Gu Yanzhen,

394
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,610
what are you doing here?

395
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,720
The auction is about to begin.

396
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
I'll pass.

397
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,840
What's wrong?

398
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,780
Not in the mood.

399
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,970
Yuan Pingting is also here.

400
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,340
Had I known she'd be here,

401
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
I wouldn't have come,

402
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,880
even if they paid me a fortune.

403
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,810
You've already taken their money.

404
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,760
I can return it.

405
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,020
I don't need it anyway.

406
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,320
You're so unprofessional.

407
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,560
What are you doing here?

408
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,080
To pee.

409
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,630
The bathroom is over there.

410
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,440
Come on.

411
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
I'll go with you.

412
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,340
What are you doing?

413
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
Let's go together.

414
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,340
I don't need you.

415
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,240
You pervert!

416
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480
I'm a pervert?

417
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,600
-Let go of me! -I won't look.

418
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Let me go!

419
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,040
Junshan.

420
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,380
Have you found the floor plan?

421
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

422
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,880
the auction will begin in 10 minutes.

423
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,520
It's about to begin.

424
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
What should we do?

425
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,670
Since we can't steal it,

426
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,600
we can't let the auction proceed.

427
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,410
It's around the corner.

428
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,640
Someone is here.

429
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,800
It's too noisy.

430
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,860
Can't do anything.

431
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,250
Go around it.

432
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

433
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,400
the auction

434
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,920
now begins.

435
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,320
Now, let's welcome our guest

436
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,560
to present

437
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,160
the first item.

438
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,440
What's wrong?

439
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,240
Someone else is here.

440
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,330
What do you mean?

441
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,520
Goodness!

442
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,880
So many!

443
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,580
Nothing has happened.

444
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,600
I...

445
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,800
You're always like this.

446
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
How did you get in?

447
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,560
I...

448
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,960
The door is open

449
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,160
so I came straight in.

450
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,840
It's open?

451
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,200
Yeah, so I came in.

452
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
This is gorgeous.

453
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,120
Is it?

454
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,600
Put it down.

455
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,330
Come with me.

456
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
Why should I go with you?

457
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Why?

458
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,570
I don't know.

459
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,980
You don't know?

460
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,410
If you don't go with me, I'll shoot you!

461
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
Put the gun down.

462
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,040
I put it down?

463
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,680
You put it down first.

464
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,810
Drop your gun first.

465
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,040
I won't.

466
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Are you sure?

467
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,280
Yeah.

468
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,280
Put it down.

469
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,400
Put that thing down.

470
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,720
Put it down, or I will shoot!

471
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,040
Drop your gun first.

472
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,840
No?

473
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Okay.

474
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,200
Okay.

475
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,200
Junshan.

476
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,840
Look.

477
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,260
What's wrong? The lights are off.

478
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,720
What's going on?

479
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,520
Please calm down

480
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,780
and remain seated.

481
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,520
It should be a circuit problem.

482
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,980
We'll fix it immediately.

483
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Fine, fine, fine.

484
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,480
Just a blackout. Let go.

485
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,200
No.

486
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,960
Father, mother,

487
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,720
don't go anywhere.

488
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,780
I'll go have a look.

489
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,800
Be careful.

490
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,300
Be patient.

491
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,780
We can make use of this situation.

492
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,770
What's going on?

493
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,820
Don't know yet.

494
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Stick to the plan.

495
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,440
Yes.

496
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,480
Junshan.

497
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,040
Liangchen,

498
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,700
Huang Song,

499
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,600
Got it.

500
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,450
What is this?

501
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,440
Look.

502
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,440
Why did you take their stuff?

503
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,370
It's not theirs.

504
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,880
The Eight-Nation Alliance stole it from us.

505
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,480
And this,

506
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,140
the Royal Seal.

507
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,740
How did you find it?

508
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,360
I have my own ways.

509
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,530
Let's get out of here first.

510
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,650
I'll take it.

511
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,960
Junshan.

512
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,080
Xianrong,

513
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,010
what are you doing here?

514
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,820
I came with my family for the auction.

515
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,240
And you?

516
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,440
I'm assigned to be Qu Manting's bodyguard.

517
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,120
She's here,

518
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,880
so here I am.

519
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,920
I see.

520
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,690
Where are you going?

521
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,490
The lights in the hall went off.

522
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,580
It's a mess inside,

523
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,520
so I came out.

524
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,580
It's not safe here.

525
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,400
You'd better not run around.

526
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,570
So glad you are here.

527
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,370
I was so scared just now.

528
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,720
Where's your family?

529
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,360
I don't know.

530
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,300
I got separated from them.

531
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,720
You should go back.

532
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,640
They may be waiting for you.

533
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,200
No.

534
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,240
The situation inside is out of control.

535
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,520
How about we go there to have a look?

536
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,400
I heard gunshots over there.

537
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,280
Gunshots?

538
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,680
Let's wait here then.

539
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,840
Alright.

540
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,160
Liangchen, let's go.

541
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,860
I'm still worried.

542
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,200
Why don't you go first?

543
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
I need to go back to check.

544
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,480
Soon they'll conduct a search for the losing items.

545
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,340
We two together are a huge target.

546
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,000
You leave with the items first.

547
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,480
I'll go check on Shen Junshan and the others.

548
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,000
OK.

549
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,280
Be careful.

550
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,440
I'm off.

551
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,360
You too.

552
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,760
Come on,

553
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
can you let go of me?

554
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,520
I'm suffocated.

555
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,560
I can't.

556
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,640
I'm scared.

557
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
You're scared

558
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,060
so you're taking advantage of me?

559
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,280
What is this?

560
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,580
What are you doing?

561
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,440
I got it.

562
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,960
Got what?

563
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:21,880
Look.

564
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,010
Be quiet. Lower your voice.

565
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,320
Where are Shen Junshan and Xie Liangchen?

566
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,580
Xianrong is here, too.

567
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,670
Shen Junshan left with her.

568
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Liangchen was worried about him

569
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,800
so he followed them.

570
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,710
Xianrong is here.

571
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,520
I saw her, too.

572
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,960
Weren't she with James?

573
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,880
Who's James?

574
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,850
The initiator of the auction.

575
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,920
Hide quickly.

576
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,880
You go first. Go now.

577
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,630
See you at our spot.

578
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,120
Hurry!

579
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,630
OK.

580
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,159
Quickly!

581
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,760
Go to the auction hall.

582
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
It's safer there.

583
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,460
I'll be with you later.

584
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,880
Be good.

585
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,480
OK?

586
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,160
You must be careful.

587
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,080
My lady.

588
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,920
My lady.

589
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,340
Calm down. Lord. Lord.

590
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Have you found her?

591
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,560
Not yet.

592
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,460
Father, what's wrong?

593
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,360
Your mother is missing.

594
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,400
Xianrong.

595
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,770
Xianrong took her away.

596
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,640
Block this area

597
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,560
and guard all exits.

598
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,520
All people at the auction

599
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,480
must be thoroughly searched

600
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,040
before leaving.

601
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,600
Yes.

602
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,020
The object isn't here.

603
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,920
This is a trap.

604
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,620
Then what should we do now?

605
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,200
The blackout wasn't an accident.

606
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,280
It was done on purpose.

607
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,880
Let's go.

608
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,960
This way, please.

609
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,680
How did you do your work?

610
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,360
I apologize for the inconvenience today.

611
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,220
How did this happen?

612
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,080
This way, please.

613
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,120
It's our fault.

614
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,760
My apologies.

615
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,480
You're so careless.

616
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,140
-This way, please. -Let's go.

617
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,040
Stay away from me.

618
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,970
He does not left.

619
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:43,840
He left.

620
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,720
I heard it.

621
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,880
Gu Yanzhen, knock it off.

622
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,760
Alright.

623
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,620
What about now?

624
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,800
He's gone.

625
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,320
Who is he?

626
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
A member of the Japan COC,

627
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,830
Jin Xianrong's man.

628
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
I almost got killed by him twice.

629
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,020
This is the third time.

630
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,800
Have you seen Huang Song?

631
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,260
I asked him to leave first.

632
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,640
The security is tight outside.

633
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,770
We need an exit plan.

634
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,770
What is this?

635
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,700
The Royal Seal.

636
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,450
Huang Song stole it.

637
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,960
What should we do now?

638
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,130
Have you found your family?

639
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,320
They must've left first.

640
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,120
Wait a minute.

641
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,420
Then we should leave, too.

642
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,860
Don't you need to wait for Qu Manting?

643
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,920
They might've left, too.

644
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,440
Alright.

645
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,920
Xianrong.

646
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,400
Junshan.

647
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Let me introduce.

648
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This is Mr. James,

649
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,680
a close friend of my father,

650
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,610
also the initiator of the auction.

651
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,680
Mr. James,

652
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,080
this is Shen Junshan,

653
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,210
also my good friend.

654
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,600
Hello.

655
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,160
Mr. James,

656
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,400
how come the auctions ends

657
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,040
before it even gets started?

658
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,850
Isn't the power is back?

659
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,420
A few thieves broke in.

660
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,600
For the safety of our guests,

661
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,760
I decided to end the auction.

662
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,330
What a shame!

663
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,520
Hope your loss isn't too big

664
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
and good luck catching the thieves.

665
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,800
I hope so.

666
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,720
Xianrong,

667
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,480
I have something else to do.

668
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,280
I'm off.

669
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,040
Please.

670
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,680
Goodbye.

671
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,960
She looks familiar.

672
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,280
Where have we met before?
