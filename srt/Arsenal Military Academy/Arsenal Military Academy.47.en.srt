Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 47

4
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
Gu Yanzhen, time for breakfast.

5
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,360
Remember.

6
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,760
Our mission today is to hold them there.

7
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,840
We take action when the main force does.

8
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,200
No one should open fire without my command.

9
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,480
Yes, Sir.

10
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes, Sir.

11
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,950
Sergeant,

12
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,950
it's not right.

13
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,070
What did you find out?

14
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,200
I calculated the time for a shift.

15
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
It's quite accurate,

16
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,560
which is not like the bandits' doing.

17
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,960
Besides,

18
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,720
their marches are clean and strong.

19
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,840
It's quite unusual.

20
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,880
It's me.

21
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,880
Gu Yanzhen?

22
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,000
Why did you come?

23
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Sergeant Lv asked me to tell you

24
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,520
something is wrong about the plan.

25
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,400
It's likely that we are the target.

26
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,760
We're set up.

27
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,680
Fire.

28
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,160
Stay down.

29
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Sergeant,

30
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,200
why do the bandits have regulated mortars?

31
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,680
Everyone,

32
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,400
give up the fight.

33
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,000
Now.

34
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,560
Fall back.

35
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,080
Fall back.

36
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Yes, sir.

37
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Yanzhen, take that way.

38
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

39
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,920
The rest of you, follow me.

40
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,400
Fire.

41
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,200
Watch out.

42
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,080
Junshan!

43
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,880
Forget about me.

44
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,640
Ji Jin!

45
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
Everyone, fall back to 10 o'clock.

46
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,760
Hurry.

47
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,480
Fall back.

48
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,160
Fall back.

49
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,240
Yes, sir.

50
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,800
Fall back.

51
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,000
We can't leave the wounded behind.

52
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,920
You go first.

53
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,800
Go.

54
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Gu Yanzhen,

55
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,560
you cover the rear.

56
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
The first squad, follow me.

57
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,720
Let's go.

58
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,480
Get on the truck.

59
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,080
Hurry.

60
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,760
Get on.

61
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,480
Bastards.

62
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,160
Come on.

63
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,680
Get on the truck.

64
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,480
Where is Ji Jin?

65
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Crap!

66
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,800
Ji Jin didn't catch up.

67
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,520
Junshan.

68
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,680
You'll get yourself killed.

69
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,960
Gu Yanzhen!

70
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,600
Hold on there.

71
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,800
OK.

72
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,720
If the information is right,

73
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,040
we still have a chance to

74
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
make another plan.

75
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,920
We might not be the one to lose.

76
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,760
Don't be silly.

77
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
How could they find us?

78
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,840
Why didn't the back-up come?

79
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,080
I guess our plan has arrived

80
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
first to the other side

81
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,200
before it came to us.

82
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,160
Besides,

83
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,840
we don't know whether

84
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,760
they are bandits or not.

85
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,680
It's not a bandits hunting.

86
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,960
It's murder.

87
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,880
Yeah.

88
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,680
Murder.

89
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,520
Our brothers didn't die in war.

90
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,360
They were murdered.

91
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,520
We have to bring justice to them.

92
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,320
Yeah.

93
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go to the Commander's mansion.

94
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,760
Yeah.

95
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,480
To the Commander's mansion.

96
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,040
We have to know why.

97
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,600
Let's go.

98
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,480
Stop!

99
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,240
Where are you going?

100
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,080
Sergeant Guo,

101
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
we're not afraid of being killed in war.

102
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,200
But we can't be killed in this way.

103
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,960
yes

104
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,000
We have to know why.

105
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,800
Listen to me.

106
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,160
Sergeant Lv and I are the ones who should go.

107
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,080
You guys stay put.

108
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,200
What do you want to do?

109
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,480
Sergeant Guo.

110
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,160
Our military action against the bandits

111
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,520
is totally a disaster.

112
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,040
Is it due to information breach

113
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,320
or inappropriate deployment?

114
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,920
The Commander's mansion has to give us a reason.

115
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
We ask for justice.

116
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,320
We ask for justice.

117
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,040
We ask for justice.

118
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,400
We ask for justice.

119
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,880
We ask for justice.

120
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,560
Stop it!

121
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,440
Lay down your arms.

122
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,560
Guo Shuting,

123
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,240
is that a mutiny?

124
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,440
We just want to know the fact.

125
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,600
Put the gun down.

126
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,080
All of you.

127
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,360
Guo!

128
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
Sergeant Guo.

129
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,520
Sergeant Guo.

130
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,120
Sergeant Guo.

131
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,000
Sergeant.

132
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,960
Sergeant.

133
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Sergeant.

134
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,360
Guo Shuting is suspicious.

135
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,320
He led students from the academy

136
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
to attack the stronghold without orders.

137
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
It has caused severe damage to my unit.

138
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,440
That's a lie.

139
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,800
All of us

140
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
were helping the Commander to crack the bandits.

141
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,080
Where are the bandits?

142
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
Guo Shuting took actions on his own.

143
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,840
The Double-wolf Stronghold is the 1st Regiment's

144
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,000
secret garrison.

145
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,360
Bandits?

146
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,440
You take your own guys as bandits?

147
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,240
Didn't you see their uniforms

148
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,960
and the arms they use?

149
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,960
We were just following orders.

150
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,840
Whose orders?

151
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,040
The Commander's?

152
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,920
Or the headquarters'?

153
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,960
Where's the commission?

154
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
Show me.

155
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,829
I see.

156
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,280
It was you

157
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,310
who planned all this on us.

158
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,040
What do you want?

159
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,349
According to investigation,

160
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,349
Guo Shuting colluded with revolutionary party.

161
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,720
He gave them our military intelligence,

162
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,320
and ordered Xie Xiang to poison Commander Zhang.

163
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,360
And this time, he provoked students of Arsenal Military Academy

164
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,480
attacking the 1st Regiment's garrison.

165
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,320
His crime has been proved.

166
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,600
And hereby sentenced to death.

167
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,800
Effective Immediately.

168
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,800
Here is Xie Xiang's confession,

169
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,600
Lv Zhongxin's accusation

170
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,280
and a joint letter

171
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,100
signed by Mayor Bai

172
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,520
and 47 military officials.

173
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,200
According to the Commander's mansion's orders,

174
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,100
the Arsenal Military Academy is to be blocked out

175
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,120
until the case is solved.

176
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,340
I believe most of the students

177
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,480
are innocent.

178
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,280
You're from Shunyuan.

179
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,200
And most are from rich families.

180
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,720
How could you abandon your families

181
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,480
and collude with the revolutionary party?

182
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,360
So

183
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,960
now you have a chance

184
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,000
to prove your innocence.

185
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
What crimes did Guo Shuting commit?

186
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
Who and where are

187
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,240
his accomplices?

188
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,320
If you report in his crimes,

189
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,320
you can contact with your family

190
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
and leave this place.

191
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,800
I have a word for you.

192
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,240
Just admit it.

193
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,760
Don't be stupid.

194
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,560
Don't think with emotion.

195
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,240
You have a bright future ahead of you.

196
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,200
You're very brave.

197
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,200
What are you doing?

198
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,480
Liang Yong.

199
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,600
What are you doing?

200
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,920
You wanna die?

201
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,000
Not about time.

202
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,080
I don't want to force you.

203
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,800
Many of you

204
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,040
are just common students.

205
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,960
You may not know any of his crimes.

206
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,200
So if you sign your name on

207
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,280
the letter reporting their crimes,

208
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,600
I promise

209
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,560
you can leave here.

210
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,800
I'll give you 24 hours to think about it.

211
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,800
If you can't think it through,

212
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,720
then you'll end up just like

213
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,480
Sergeant Guo.

214
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,440
Be careful.

215
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,600
Get in the car.

216
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,520
Easy, easy.

217
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,120
Be careful.

218
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,000
We'll be home soon.

219
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,760
Let them go.

220
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,200
They don't deserve to be our partners.

221
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,160
It's their choices.

222
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,680
Commander Song makes himself clear

223
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,080
that he wants to give us a lesson.

224
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think they just don't want to

225
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,280
sacrifice themselves.

226
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,040
It's normal.

227
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,800
It's normal?

228
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,160
Stop there.

229
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,880
Who is this?

230
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,280
Xie Liangchen, of the 7th batch,

231
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,280
Arsenal Military Academy.

232
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Liangchen?

233
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,760
Liangchen!

234
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,720
You're still alive.

235
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,240
Why are you here?

236
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,080
Why am I here?

237
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,560
Why am I still alive?

238
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,360
Don't you know that?

239
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Catch her.

240
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,960
Come on.

241
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,200
Let's see who got the gut.

242
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Put the gun down.

243
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,040
I just want to get them out of here.

244
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,640
As for me,

245
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,800
you can bring me to a trial or else.

246
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,200
I'll be there.

247
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,680
You must be dreaming.

248
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,800
Before I came here,

249
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,320
I sent a letter to

250
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,680
Commissioner Feng of headquarter.

251
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,760
I heard he was not so close with Deputy Commander Song.

252
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,200
If he sees me here,

253
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,200
he would be very curious.

254
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,080
Or maybe you want me to stay longer,

255
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,080
so I can make it clear with everybody

256
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,280
that

257
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
why I'm still alive

258
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,080
and what terms the man who saved me

259
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,720
and your Commander Song

260
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,760
have agreed on.

261
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,040
Let them go.

262
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,440
Wait.

263
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:15,840
Junshan.

264
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,320
Let's go.

265
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,440
Xiaoyu.

266
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,440
I've arranged it.

267
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,800
You can leave in a few days.

268
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,000
I...

269
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,280
I've sent men for Gu Yanzhen.

270
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,600
They haven't come back yet.

271
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,520
You have to be prepared.

272
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,160
Don't get involved in things here anymore.

273
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,760
Now that Song Xicheng and the Japanese

274
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,760
are the most powerful men in Shunyuan,

275
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,040
a few students like you

276
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,600
won't make any difference.

277
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,600
Xiaoyu.

278
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,480
Go now.

279
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,120
I want to be alone.

280
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
How many times have you lied to me?

281
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,400
This time,

282
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,760
I almost believed you again.

283
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,000
Shuting.

284
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,080
Shuting.

285
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,120
Gu Yanzhen.

286
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,360
Get up.

287
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,640
Gu Yanzhen.

288
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,680
Where are you?

289
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,680
Move!

290
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,160
Run.

291
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,720
Shuting.

292
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,080
I've revenged for you.

293
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,320
Song Xicheng,

294
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,440
when does the superior

295
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,800
appoint you as the Commander of Shunyuan?

296
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,080
How could I not know it

297
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
as the Commissioner?

298
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,480
The Commander Zhang died in an accident.

299
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,760
The commission from Peking hasn't arrived yet.

300
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,360
As the Deputy Commander,

301
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,320
I should take the office of the commander

302
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,480
in such a critical time.

303
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,080
It's all for the good of the military stability.

304
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,240
Why?

305
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,480
Commissioner Feng,

306
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,320
you have a problem?

307
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,160
I don't have time for your nonsense.

308
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,160
I just want to know

309
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,640
how Commander Zhang die?

310
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,480
What's going on with the attack

311
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,360
by the academy?

312
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,200
As for this,

313
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
I made it clear in the military report.

314
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,840
Do you want me to repeat it?

315
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,640
Well, I heard

316
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,840
Xie Liangchen didn't kill Commander Zhang.

317
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,560
It was the man

318
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,920
who wanted to replace him.

319
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,720
The attack of the 1st Regiment

320
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,640
was also this man's doing

321
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,720
in order to rule out different voices.

322
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,080
Absurd!

323
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,320
It's utterly nonsense.

324
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,040
If it's nonsense or not,

325
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
we'll find out soon.

326
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,360
Song Xicheng,

327
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,840
don't take that you can cover it all up.

328
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,600
The Commander is dead.

329
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,680
But I'm not.

330
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Find Xie Liangchen.

331
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,840
Find him before Song Xicheng's men do.

332
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,480
Yes, Sir.

333
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,960
Guards.

334
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,400
Guards!

335
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,440
Commander.

336
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,680
Go for Oda Xianrong.

337
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,320
Tell her

338
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,920
I'll give her

339
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
what she asked for.

340
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,200
Why are you here alone?

341
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,880
So grateful in this life

342
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,600
Don't be upset.

343
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,200
Don't be afraid.

344
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,640
I'm here.

345
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,840
In dream shall we meet

346
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,200
Hope in this life

347
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,600
We'll love and cherish each other

348
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,160
Till death do us part

349
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,040
Don't idle away your youth

350
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,360
Dreams never stop

351
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,000
Where is Ji Jin?

352
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,200
He's severely wounded.

353
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,680
I trusted him with a doctor

354
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,880
whom I know well.

355
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,160
Where are the rest?

356
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,000
Sergeant Guo is dead.

357
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,480
Xiaoyu...

358
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,480
I don't know where she is.

359
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,560
Those alive are severely wounded.

360
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,200
Their families took them away.

361
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
We're close

362
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,960
with Sergeant Guo.

363
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,600
People of the Commander's mansion

364
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,080
won't let us go.

365
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,560
Shen Junshan's family has great influence.

366
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,040
They won't dare to hurt him.

367
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,840
But the others are in danger.

368
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,120
What should we do?

369
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,920
Miss Oda,

370
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,160
Song Xicheng doesn't have enough seniority

371
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,040
and capability.

372
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,200
All he has is ambition.

373
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,200
He can't make people oblige.

374
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,920
Why should we help him?

375
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,200
Let the dogs fight with each other.

376
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,440
Wouldn't it be better?

377
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,800
What do you want?

378
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,640
How dare you break in our house?

379
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,040
I'm coming to see Chairman Shen.

380
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Mr. Shen is not at home.

381
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,680
Leave now.

382
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,080
Benzi!

383
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,680
Stop.

384
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,680
Miss Oda,

385
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,560
what brings you here?

386
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,400
Chairman Shen,

387
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,880
it's good to see you again.

388
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,200
What's your decision

389
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,960
on the mining contract?

390
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,680
That's between Lord Chengrui and me.

391
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,800
I don't see what it is to do with you.

392
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,920
I'm the only living soul

393
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,600
of Rong Mansion now.

394
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,880
Lord Chengrui's business

395
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,880
is my business.

396
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,520
It's not.

397
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,480
Now it is, I guess.

398
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,840
I want to terminate the contract,

399
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,480
no matter how much money I may lose.

400
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,200
Even it's all my property,

401
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,960
I will never collude with you Japanese.

402
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,560
I like your spirit.

403
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,320
But I don't know

404
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,080
whether your families

405
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,800
are as brave as you are.
