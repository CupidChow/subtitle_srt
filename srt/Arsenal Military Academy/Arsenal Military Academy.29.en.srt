00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,500
Episode 29

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,180
Who are you?

5
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
What do you want to do?

6
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,240
I come to find someone.

7
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,640
I'm here to find someone.

8
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,400
Junshan?

9
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,920
Stop.

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,780
That's the female dressing room.

11
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,780
What are you doing?

12
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,640
Get out.

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,800
Out.

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
I am sorry

15
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,900
for bothering you.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,970
Mr. Shen.

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Why are you at the backstage?

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,130
Could you tell me

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,680
who the girl singing

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
on the stage is.

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Xie Xiang.

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,700
What's wrong?

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,160
Xie Xiang.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,040
What about Xie Liangchen?

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
He's her brother.

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,520
Mr. Shen.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Are you all right?

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,040
All right.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,040
In Shunyuan, if you need a help,

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,000
just tell me.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,680
OK.

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Thank you.

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,440
Junshan.

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,610
It's really you.

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,340
Huang Song.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,520
Why are you here?

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
I came with Xie Xiang,

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,240
Xie Liangchen' s twin sister.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,290
How about let's have dinner together?

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,940
Liangchen will come, too.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,840
Sorry.

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,720
I can't join you.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,240
See you.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,640
Xie Xiang.

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,580
What's wrong with you?

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,050
Nothing.

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,960
You said you were not well

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
when Meng asked you.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,920
I just don't

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,820
want to have dinner with them.

51
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,640
Why?

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,170
You don't like them?

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,000
You performed really well.

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,900
I haven't sung for a long time.

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
I don't know music,

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,520
but I feel that you were good.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,079
The audiences said you were good

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,090
and pretty when the show ended.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,960
They are also eager to know your name.

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,480
Stop!

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,360
Who are you?

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,760
Stop! Stop!

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,800
Stop!

64
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,360
Stop!

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,960
Seize him.

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,040
Stop!

67
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,940
Bastard, stop!

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
You! Stop!

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,680
Stop!

70
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,480
Stop running.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,320
Stop!

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,720
He.

73
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
Stop! Seize him.

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,480
Chop.

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,640
You can't escape.

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,200
Stop!

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
Stop! Stop!

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,040
Stop!

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,560
How dare you run away?

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,160
Run away?

81
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,690
How dare you?

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Do you still want to run away?

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
Do you still want to run away?

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
Are you a good runner?

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
How dare you attack the police?

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,890
Wait and see.

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,160
Wait.

88
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Are you all right?

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,210
Are you hurt?

90
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
Stop. Stop picking them up.

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,159
Go.

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,320
Xie Xiang.

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,440
What...

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,090
Are you okay?

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,760
Is it serious?

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm fine.

97
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,320
I fell down.

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,720
- Nothing. - Are you okay?

99
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,600
What happened?

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,880
I don't know what happened exactly.

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,760
I saw him falling down,

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,020
so I wanted to help him.

103
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Are you all right?

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,440
Alright.

105
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,280
Let's go now.

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,890
I'm full now.

107
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,970
Are you full?

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,880
What happened just now?

109
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,610
Why did these police chase you?

110
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,680
I... I was posting slogans

111
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,290
with my classmates.

112
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,760
What slogans?

113
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,440
To object to the Twenty-one Treaty,

114
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,240
Japanese's occupation of Tsingtao,

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,880
the restoration of monarchy,

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,610
and the warlord dictatorship.

117
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,760
You object to so many things.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,280
Didn't I remind you?

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
Don't be involved in such things.

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
You are a student now.

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,240
The duty of students is to study.

122
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,920
These things are full of your mind,

123
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,780
so how can you focus on your study?

124
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,440
Also,

125
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,260
how long has it been since the last time you went home?

126
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,790
You didn't even write home.

127
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,480
Our sister is concerned about you.

128
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,120
If she knows

129
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,450
you aren't working hard

130
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
on your study,

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,530
she will hit you.

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Don't judge me so casually.

133
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
Alright.

134
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,560
Stop here.

135
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,380
He's young.

136
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,720
He.

137
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
What your brother said is right.

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,880
You are students now.

139
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
You can't change anything.

140
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
It's dangerous to

141
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,160
do this.

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,640
Even ants are concerned about their country.

143
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,820
We are students,

144
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,820
but we are

145
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,960
the most patriotic.

146
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,820
How dare you talk back?

147
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,400
Alright.

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,730
Alright.

149
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,280
You scared him.

150
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,159
I know you are patriotic,

151
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
which is a good thing.

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,010
This proves the result of your education.

153
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,440
But your patriotism should be with wisdom.

154
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,900
You can post these slogans

155
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,960
at night secretly.

156
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,260
Now you do this in the day

157
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,790
when the police can see you.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,330
There's no reason that they don't hit you.

159
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,760
Right.

160
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
Why didn't I think of that?

161
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,370
Look how stupid you are.

162
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
Our country must have been ruined

163
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,250
if it waits for your saving.

164
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,360
So,

165
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,480
there are people like you.

166
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,920
Alright.

167
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,840
Finish your meal.

168
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,100
Then go back to school.

169
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,040
By the way.

170
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,720
Song.

171
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
I have run out of my money.

172
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,900
I don't have money to survive.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,130
Can you give me some?

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,450
I have money.

175
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,210
Here.

176
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Are these enough?

177
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,040
Yes.

178
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,320
These can pay my bills for half a year.

179
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Thank you, Xiang.

180
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,180
No worries.

181
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,890
Don't waste your money.

182
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,760
Xie Xiang.

183
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
I am so sorry that

184
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,130
he borrowed your money.

185
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,580
No worries.

186
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,659
We are friends.

187
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Don't worry.

188
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,360
When I get payment this month,

189
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,880
I'll give it back to you immediately.

190
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,440
But

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,960
you gave him too much.

192
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I might not give you back at one time.

193
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't have urgent things to use money.

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Rest assured.

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,660
Huang Song.

196
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,400
You are gentle usually.

197
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
Why are you so serious when

198
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,980
you are with your brother, He?

199
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,120
We lost our parents

200
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,280
when we were kids.

201
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,520
I am his

202
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,780
elder brother.

203
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,549
Gradually, we get along in this way.

204
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,950
I understand.

205
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,909
Actually your life is not easy.

206
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,720
Now, it is much better.

207
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,760
My sister has married.

208
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,360
Her life is guaranteed.

209
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,760
Now I am studying at the military academy.

210
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Not only does it offer me food,

211
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,820
but it also pays me.

212
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,880
I will be an officer in the future.

213
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,410
Huang He enters school now.

214
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,520
If my parents know these in another world,

215
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,240
they must be very happy.

216
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,460
Huang Song.

217
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,120
Who is she?

218
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,620
Gu Yanzhen.

219
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
This is Xie Xiang,

220
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,680
Liangchen' s sister.

221
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
This is Gu Yanzhen.

222
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,540
Get to know each other.

223
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,960
You are Xiang, right?

224
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,520
I am your brother's roommate.

225
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,540
Then I am also your brother to some degree.

226
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,520
Call me brother.

227
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,900
Gu Yanzhen.

228
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Stop joking.

229
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,800
Xie Xiang.

230
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,960
Go in.

231
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,140
It's getting late.

232
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,520
Right.

233
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,120
Go in now.

234
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Can you go in?

235
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,690
What do you mean?

236
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,840
Nothing.

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,640
I go back to school.

238
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,560
Huang Song. Go.

239
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,640
OK.

240
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,080
Xie Xiang.

241
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,880
Gu Yanzhen and I will go back to school.

242
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,400
Go in.

243
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,080
See you.

244
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,280
It's too late.

245
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,200
You can't catch up with a tram.

246
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,720
Don't waste your time if

247
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,760
you want to go somewhere.

248
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,920
Otherwise the door of the dorm will be closed.

249
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,640
You can't go back.

250
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,100
What a pity homeless girl.

251
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,640
Ignore him.

252
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
Go in now.

253
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,480
See you.

254
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
Right, ignore me.

255
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,200
Go in.

256
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,440
See you.

257
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,000
See you.

258
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,330
What are you doing here?

259
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
What do you think?

260
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,520
Where is Song?

261
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,080
He's back.

262
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,680
My lady,

263
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,560
it's not safe that

264
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,960
you go back alone now.

265
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,300
Also, the way is far

266
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
and you are so beautiful.

267
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,360
Come on.

268
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,420
I'll send you back.

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,880
Didn't you say that my body is like a washboard,

270
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
and I look like a man from every view?

271
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
Did I say

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,760
such vicious words?

273
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,440
You did.

274
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,520
Get on the car.

275
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,180
No, thanks.

276
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,530
Are you angry again?

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,920
Put me down.

278
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,760
Gu Yanzhen,

279
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,720
you are a jerk.

280
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,520
What?

281
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,800
Jerk.

282
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
The jerk is taking you home.

283
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Get on the car.

284
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,760
Qiqi.

285
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,900
Qu Manting.

286
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,700
You come to see my brother?

287
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,250
Why are you here?

288
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,760
Today is my brother's birthday.

289
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,090
I come to send him a cake.

290
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,930
It's your brother's birthday?

291
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
Why I gave away

292
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
such a big secret accidentally?

293
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Did you give it to him?

294
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,080
Do you have anything else?

295
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,010
Go if you don't have anything else.

296
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,370
Do you have conscience?

297
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,160
I'll leave.

298
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,720
Bye.

299
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,040
What?

300
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,570
Today is your birthday.

301
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,660
You must have met Gu Qiqi at the door.

302
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,590
You are so smart.

303
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,880
The man that I love

304
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,340
is different from others.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,460
Today is also my birthday.

306
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
Our birthday is on the same day.

307
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,930
This is our destiny.

308
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,920
We are doomed to be perfect matches.

309
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,800
Stop it.

310
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Your words are garbage.

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,160
If today is your birthday,

312
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,320
everyone will be informed by you.

313
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,280
What?

314
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,480
I'm not lying.

315
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,600
Today is my birthday.

316
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,130
I just never celebrated it.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
It's also your birthday.

318
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,620
So I come to celebrate it with you.

319
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,120
Why didn't you celebrate?

320
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,210
My aunt passed away on my birthday.

321
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,040
My mom was sad every year.

322
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,480
So I didn't celebrate it.

323
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,660
You are so unlucky.

324
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
You are unlucky.

325
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
6 p.m. tonight,

326
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,320
I'll wait for you

327
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,520
at Wintersweet Restaurant.

328
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,120
I won't go.

329
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,320
Do you dare?

330
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,760
I said I wouldn't go.

331
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I'll wait for you.

332
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,170
That's useless.

333
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
I'll wait for you anyway.

334
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,600
So handsome.

335
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,540
I have booked the tickets.

336
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,800
4 p.m. this afternoon.

337
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,300
Is madam all right?

338
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,800
This is her chronic disease.

339
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,480
She's fine after taking medicines.

340
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,080
Mr. Shen asked

341
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
you to take them back right now,

342
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
and you go back after finishing

343
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,340
the business in Shanghai.

344
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,000
OK.

345
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,960
Don't tell Junshan.

346
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,160
Yes.

347
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,520
How about Ms. Qu's birthday?

348
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,320
She never celebrates her birthdays.

349
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
I have prepared her gift.

350
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
Give her later.

351
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,360
OK.

352
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,610
She is still with Gu Yanzhen every day?

353
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,280
Not every day.

354
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,180
They just meet once in a while.

355
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,720
I won't go.

356
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,740
Liangchen.

357
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,400
I haven't finished my homework.

358
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,730
Could you give me yours?

359
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,040
Thank you.

360
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
What are you going to do after class?

361
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,850
I have nothing to do.

362
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
How about hanging out with me?

363
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,000
Where are you going?

364
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,530
It's none of your business.

365
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
What do you think?

366
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,380
I don't have interest.

367
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
I have guessed it.

368
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,260
It seems that I can only ask Xiang.

369
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,680
She is too gentle to refuse me.

370
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,240
Xie Xiang is busy.

371
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,640
She doesn't have spare time.

372
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,760
How... how do you know?

373
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
Xie Xiang told me that day.

374
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,960
She told me her exam was coming,

375
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
so she would be very busy.

376
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,410
She cheated you.

377
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,100
How can she be busy?

378
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,160
She is available every day.

379
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,090
I'll go with you.

380
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,250
If only you said so earlier.

381
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,880
Right?

382
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,760
I'll wait for you outside.

383
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,360
Badass.

384
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,620
Gu Yanzhen.

385
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,640
Where are you going?

386
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,840
The class will begin.

387
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,490
It's Sergeant Guo' s class.

388
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,010
Where is this place?

389
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,490
Have we arrived?

390
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,360
Do you like it?

391
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,369
Is it beautiful?

392
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,040
I remember here.

393
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,520
Wasn't it only a roof?

394
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Who made a skate land?

395
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,680
You did?

396
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,720
Can you skate?

397
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,170
Of course I can.

398
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Follow me.

399
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
You don't believe it?

400
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,800
Have a try.

401
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,880
Can you skate?

402
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Of course I can't.

403
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,560
The why do you come here?

404
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,640
That's why I asked you to come

405
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,440
to teach me.

406
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,130
To be honest,

407
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
I haven't gone skating for long.

408
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,800
Don't blame me if I'm not a good teacher.

409
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,380
Help me to stand up.

410
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,680
Follow me.

411
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,760
Gu Yanzhen,

412
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,040
it occurred to me that I have something else to do.

413
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,900
I'll leave now.

414
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,620
Gu Yanzhen.

415
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,370
Happy birthday.

416
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,200
Junshan.

417
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,090
Junshan?

418
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,490
Junshan.

419
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I have something.

420
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,120
What?

421
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,200
Jin Xianrong

422
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,560
attended the anniversary celebration

423
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,290
of Hongtai COC with a Japanese.

424
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,660
It was said that...

425
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,450
I have known.

426
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,500
You have known?

427
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,500
Do you have anything else?

428
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,720
No.

429
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,040
Ms. Qu.

430
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,010
Could you

431
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,240
please tell me when your guest will arrive?

432
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,500
When should I serve up?

433
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,360
Wait for a while.

434
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,080
OK.

435
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,760
Excuse me?

436
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,960
Ms. Qu,

437
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
what can I do for you?

438
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,560
Serve up.

439
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,400
OK.

440
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,370
Happy birthday.

441
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,340
Qu Manting.

442
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,970
Happy birthday.

443
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,000
Gu Yanzhen.

444
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,820
I know you are busy so that you can't come.

445
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
Right?

446
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,140
It's alright.

447
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,930
Today is your birthday.

448
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
I don't blame you.

449
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,720
Cheers!

450
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,360
What?

451
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,970
Are you disappointed to see me?

452
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,120
Is it so obvious?

453
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,580
How do you know?

454
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,400
Look at the inside.

455
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,320
The decoration is so delicate.

456
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,450
You must be waiting for your loved one.

457
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,120
But he didn't come.

458
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,690
It's like a joke.

459
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,120
Come.

460
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,400
Get on the car.

461
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,940
Where are we going?

462
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,420
I'll take you to

463
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,840
a good place.

464
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,640
Come.

465
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,000
What is this place?

466
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,580
Why do you take me here?

467
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,740
In the past,

468
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,720
the four of us

469
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,320
often came here secretly.

470
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,530
We drank at here.

471
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,720
I,

472
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Huo Xiaoyu,

473
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,040
and...

474
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,880
And who?

475
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,760
A friend.

476
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,360
A friend?

477
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,880
I think these two must be

478
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,200
your loved girl

479
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,480
and your best bro.

480
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,600
How do you know that?

481
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Who am I?

482
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,080
The scripts that I read work.

483
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,800
Let me tell you.

484
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,280
The following scenario is

485
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,400
that the girl who you love

486
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,440
married your best bro.

487
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,120
Then your friendship has been broken.

488
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,340
So you live lonely without marriage

489
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,880
throughout your life.

490
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It can't be?

491
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,480
Are you really so tragic?

492
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,460
Yes, so tragic.

493
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
You are very pitiful.

494
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,760
Let me ask you.

495
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,960
Who are you waiting for tonight?

496
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,560
Waiting for a

497
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,840
lucky lad

498
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,240
whom I have

499
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,000
crush on.

500
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,580
And the result?

501
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,560
He doesn't have crush on you, right?

502
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,040
Don't be so sharp-tongued!

503
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,360
I am really sad.

504
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,160
Why can't I see your sadness?

505
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,320
I...

506
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Alright.

507
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,560
Wait for me for a while.

508
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,120
You won't be sad soon.

509
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,970
What are you saying?

510
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
What?

511
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
Happy Birthday To You

512
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,400
Happy Birthday To You

513
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Happy Birthday To You

514
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,520
Happy Birthday To You

515
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
What?

516
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
How do you know today is my birthday?

517
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,100
It must be Ms. Huo who told you.

518
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,680
I know many things.

519
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Come. Come up.

520
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,000
Come on.

521
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,900
Make a wish.

522
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,560
Alright.

523
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,400
And this is

524
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,040
a gift for you.

525
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,440
You also prepared a gift?

526
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,240
Of course I prepared.

527
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,220
I don't know the little girls' taste.

528
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,600
Hope you like it.

529
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,360
I like it.

530
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,200
Thank you.

531
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,560
Director Guo.

532
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,000
Don't call me Director Guo.

533
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,960
Just call me Guo.

534
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,120
Thank you.

535
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,800
Guo.

536
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,200
Come on.

537
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
What should I say?

538
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,040
We have the same fate.

539
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,560
Cheers!

540
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,980
I won't drink with you.

541
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,280
Why?

542
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,280
We are different.

543
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,690
Because I still have a firm belief.

544
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,560
I believe

545
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,000
one day

546
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
he will realize who is

547
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,280
the one loving him the most

548
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,400
and go back to me willingly

549
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,680
and fall in love with me.

550
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,240
Then,

551
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,250
I'll be in a white wedding dress

552
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,920
and stand in

553
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,160
a divine church with him

554
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,300
to hold our wedding ceremony.

555
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,360
We will live happily

556
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,360
forever

557
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,760
after that.

558
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
What do you think?

559
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,520
I think so.

560
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,080
It will be realized.

561
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,600
Cheers.

562
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,010
Happy birthday.

563
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,000
Thank you.

564
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,400
Guo.

565
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,360
Sir,

566
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,260
you are still here?

567
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,400
You have been here for a whole day.

568
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,260
Don't get cold.

569
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,780
I have alcohol.

570
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,500
Have a drink to warm your body.

571
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,880
No, thanks.

572
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,340
Go to get water?

573
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,480
Gu Yanzhen went home

574
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,170
to celebrate his birthday?

575
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,920
Is today his birthday?

576
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,400
Yes.

577
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,570
I saw his sister send him a cake.

578
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
He didn't go back.

579
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,480
He is sleeping on his bed,

580
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,340
just like a pig.

581
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,090
Alright.

582
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,740
See you.

583
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,710
The door of dormitory is closed.

584
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,960
I begged the gatekeeper for a long time,

585
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,420
but he didn't allow me out.

586
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
I can't buy a cake.

587
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,530
I only have this.

588
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,639
I didn't know it was your birthday.

589
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,860
I apologize to you.

591
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,760
Happy birthday.

592
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,000
Hope everything goes well with you.

593
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,929
Blow the candle.

594
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,040
You blew it.

595
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,760
And my apple is for you.

596
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,600
Now, you must know

597
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,460
that you owe me.

598
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,000
So don't be angry.

599
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,230
Who is angry?

600
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,250
Take it away.

601
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I mean the candle.

602
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,360
Did you wash it?

603
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,600
I forgot.

604
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,740
Where is my birthday gift?

605
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,890
Your gift is that apple.

606
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,800
Who gives others an apple as a birthday gift?

607
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,760
It is too late.

608
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,360
Where can I

609
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
buy a gift for you?

610
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,640
What about

611
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,620
I give you the button on the pants?

612
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,640
No.

613
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,240
Have your apple.

614
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,200
I'll go to bed.

615
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,660
Liangchen.

616
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,860
What's wrong with him?

617
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,000
You lost your button?

618
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,140
Where is it?

619
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,370
Seek it. Seek it.

620
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,680
If it isn't at the range, it must be at the dorm.

621
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,940
Seek it when we go back.

622
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
It's getting late.

623
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,480
Let's go back for dinner.

624
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,000
OK.

625
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,800
OK.

626
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,200
Let's go.

627
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,640
Go.

628
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,170
Yanzhen.

629
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,480
Gu Yanzhen.

630
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,600
Are you blind?

631
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,380
You don't look at your way?

632
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,960
Staring at me?

633
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,850
How dare you?

634
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,260
I'll break your legs if you still stare at me.

635
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,920
You father is stepping down.

636
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,120
You have nothing now!

637
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,560
Why are you staring at me?

638
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,480
Mate. Mate.

639
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,840
Calm down.

640
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,240
Mate.

641
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,280
I have heard that Peking is not peaceful.

642
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,730
I wonder whether that treaty has been signed.

643
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,540
It couldn't be signed.

644
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,960
If it has been signed,

645
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,690
Gu Yanzhen would be in trouble.

646
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,980
It's none of his business.

647
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,290
Didn't you hear that from Li Wenzhong?

648
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,600
Some of our classmates

649
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
call his dad a traitor secretly.

650
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,120
Negotiate with the Japanese if they have ability.

651
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,380
They are all snobbish,

652
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
who only judge others behind their back.

653
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,060
Liangchen.

654
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,480
I didn't see you talk for him usually.

655
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,120
I didn't talk for him.

656
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,050
I don't like them bullying others.

657
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,200
Let's go.

658
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,800
Wait. Wait.

659
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:18,840
Wait.

660
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,300
I am Huang He's classmate.

661
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,540
Huang He is in trouble.

662
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,660
I'll talk to you later.

663
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,580
You haven't asked for a leave.

664
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,040
Is the information exact?

665
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,560
Yes.

666
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,640
I am 100 percent sure.

667
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,640
It was him who killed the

668
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,970
21 military policemen.

669
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,680
It was him who corrupted Wu Bin's business.

670
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,440
And it was he who stole the treasures.

671
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,400
This man is very dangerous.

672
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,240
He was also in army.

673
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,280
His family is wealthy.

674
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,760
His brother killed someone with a gun at our COC.

675
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,680
What a lawless family.

676
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,120
Do as what you said.

677
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,440
Be quick.

678
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,640
Especially at the very moment of negotiation.

679
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,860
There's no room for a mistake.

680
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,000
And now Zhang Xihou is back.

681
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,080
He is a momus.

682
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes.

683
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,120
Liangchen.

684
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,640
Song.

685
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,320
What are you doing here?

686
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,450
I'm waiting for you.

687
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,320
You disappeared without a word in the daytime.

688
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,920
I didn't see you for a whole day.

689
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,360
It's lucky that Sergeant Lv left for a meeting

690
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,400
and Sergeant Guo was drunk.

691
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,480
So that no one found that you were absent.

692
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,810
What on earth did you do?

693
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,040
I did nothing.

694
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,640
You look very tired.

695
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,960
Song.

696
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,180
Tell me if you have something.

697
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,210
Nothing.

698
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,200
Don't worry.

699
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,240
Alright.

700
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Did you have dinner?

701
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,240
Yes, I did.

702
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,600
Go back to have a rest.

703
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,730
I took water for you.

704
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,780
Liangchen.

705
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Do you have money?

706
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,760
Money?

707
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,290
How much do you want?

708
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,410
I don't know either.

709
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,880
Song.

710
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,490
What on earth happened?

711
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,930
Nothing.

712
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,170
Alright.

713
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,920
I'll financially help you.

714
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,780
So don't worry.

715
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,280
Go back to have a rest.

716
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,920
OK.

717
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
Then I'll go back.

718
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,930
Why do you borrow money?

719
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,090
I need money now.

720
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,810
How much do you want?

721
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,720
I don't know.

722
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,540
Give me as much as you have.

723
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,400
Alright.

724
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,400
I can ask for two-month's pay

725
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,800
from Ms. Huo in advance.

726
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,620
I will give it to you tomorrow.

727
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,210
Xiaojun.

728
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,640
Thank you.

729
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,040
You are so kind.

730
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Stop it.

731
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,520
I'll leave now.

732
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,050
I will come to you tomorrow.

733
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,960
Take care.

734
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,800
Bye.

735
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,320
Bye

736
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,400
Father,

737
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
I have something to tell you.
