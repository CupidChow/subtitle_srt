Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 03

4
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not my room.

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
You guys are bad.

6
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,730
Why are you back so late?

7
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Is it cool?

8
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
So cool.

9
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
It's better than carrying logs.

10
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,960
Tomorrow,

11
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,360
I'll beat them all down.

12
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,600
Tomorrow,

13
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,440
I won't be the last one back.

14
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,720
Look at you.

15
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
Look at you.

16
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,020
I don't want to take the bath anymore.

17
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,320
Stand up.

18
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,820
Let me help you.

19
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,920
Come.

20
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,880
Ms. Huo.

21
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,620
Who are you?

22
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
It's me.

23
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,520
It's you.

24
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
When did you come back?

25
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,760
Not long ago.

26
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Where's Xiaojun?

27
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,409
I need to see her.

28
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,440
Over there.

29
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,840
I'll go see her first

30
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
and be back later.

31
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,440
Xiaojun.

32
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,090
Zhang, here you are.

33
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,080
Who is it?

34
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,120
You...why are you dressed like this?

35
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,440
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?

36
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,920
I don't want to be noticed.

37
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,240
Is it safe these days?

38
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,360
A few days ago, some punks stalked me.

39
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,690
I almost got kidnapped.

40
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,800
Stop it.

41
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
You must be paranoid.

42
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm not.

43
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,800
There are no punks here.

44
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Nobody knows you.

45
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,680
Take your glasses off.

46
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
Are you kidding?

47
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,409
I'm a superstar.

48
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,500
Everyone knows me.

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
You don't believe me?

50
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,960
Come and have a look!

51
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
Qu Manting is here! Qu Manting is here!

52
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,960
Qu Manting?

53
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,890
No one knows you.

54
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
Ridiculous!

55
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Don't people here read the news?

56
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,400
Come on.

57
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,040
People who come here to drink

58
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
can barely read.

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,240
Even if they could,

60
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,520
they'd all read political news.

61
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,120
Right now,

62
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,760
who has time to read gossips?

63
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,980
Give me some water.

64
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,840
You're a star.

65
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,340
The north is unstable.

66
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,370
Why didn't you stay in Shanghai

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,280
but came all the way to Shunyuan?

68
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,210
I have work to do.

69
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,040
My new movie will be filmed here.

70
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,080
It won't be filmed in Shanghai,

71
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,200
but in Shunyuan?

72
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
Mr. Shen invested it, right?

73
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,520
No way.

74
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,520
Why not?

75
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,280
He's helped you a lot.

76
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't offend him.

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
What has he done for me?

78
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm a star

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
not a social girl.

80
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,370
What's the difference?

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
You know what,

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,260
you should just marry him.

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
He's rich and powerful.

84
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,480
He's more than capable to support you.

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,400
It's chaotic outside.

86
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,960
Listen to me.

87
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,220
It's chaotic outside.

88
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,720
It's dangerous for you

89
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,400
to strive alone.

90
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,760
Enough. Stop it.

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
My parents almost talked my ears off.

92
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
Now you're nagging me, too.

93
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,840
Give me a break.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then go get married.

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,760
Look,

96
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,760
you won't have another chance like this.

97
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,440
Listen to me,

98
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
Shen Tingbai can't think straight,

99
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
so he's attracted to you.

100
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
When he comes around one day,

101
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,960
he'll be attracted to another woman.

102
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
I must thank her then.

103
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,720
Goodness!

104
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,700
He likes me so I must marry him?

105
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,480
Tons of men also like me.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,320
Besides,

107
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
I make a living on my own.

108
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,720
My money is hard-earned.

109
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,760
I can use it as I please.

110
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,090
Why should I rely on him?

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Without him,

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
you think you could sit here now?

113
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,720
You would've been kidnapped at Paramo.

114
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,720
How did you know that?

115
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,520
I...

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,120
I... That day, I...

117
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,120
meant to

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,720
introduce a friend to you

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,400
so I was there.

120
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,640
Why didn't you help me?

121
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,560
Stop blaming me.

122
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,440
I was almost scared to death.

123
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,040
How could I help you?

124
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
I couldn't beat him.

125
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,840
Also,

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
if I came to help you,

127
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,760
-how could Mr. Shen... -Go away.

128
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,680
play the hero?

129
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,420
Why are you here today?

130
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,520
Since you work here,

131
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,680
you must've known people at the Academy.

132
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,480
What's wrong?

133
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,400
You know,

134
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I investigated that bastard later on.

135
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,640
He went to the Academy at night.

136
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,560
You know how embarrassed I was that day?

137
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
He spanked me!

138
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,600
Why are you laughing?

139
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,930
It's embarrassing, OK?

140
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,920
If he falls into my hands,

141
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll gut him.

142
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,280
You?

143
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
I won't do it myself.

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Just tell me

145
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
when the school break is

146
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,280
and when he'll come home.

147
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,640
Speaking of the Academy,

148
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
I do

149
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,600
know someone.

150
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,280
You do?

151
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,030
Really?

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,080
Who is him?

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,909
Do I know him?

154
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,120
Is he a teacher or a student?

155
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,720
You...you don't need to know.

156
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,909
I'll help you ask around.

157
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,840
What's his name?

158
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,440
Gu Yanzhen.

159
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
You were in the well a whole day.

160
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,730
You may catch a cold.

161
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,690
I have medicine.

162
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,440
Here.

163
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Don't talk to me.

164
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,100
I need to calm down.

165
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,400
Whatever.

166
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,220
Will you show up on time tomorrow?

167
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm talking to you.

168
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,880
If you're late again,

169
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,340
we'll both be in the water.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,760
We'll see.

171
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,720
My brain is a mess now.

172
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,000
Lunatic.

173
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,160
Like I want to talk to you.

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,680
Morning.

175
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,240
Hi, morning.

176
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,100
See you in a bit.

177
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,680
Gu Yanzhen.

178
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,200
Wake up.

179
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,960
Get up.

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,480
Get up!

181
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,700
It's for your good.

182
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
Are you crazy?

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,960
Go away!

184
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,920
Let go.

185
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,960
Let go.

186
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,040
Have you done?

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,440
Say it!

188
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,040
Excuse me.

189
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,040
What now?

190
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,120
Let go!

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,610
You can't go.

192
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,960
You can't. You can't.

193
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,730
Watch and learn.

194
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,080
Stop.

195
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,570
You don't have something to do?

196
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
Sir, let me go.

197
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Close your mouth.

198
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,560
You're not busy, are you?

199
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,920
Sergeant Song.

200
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,640
You have a visitor.

201
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,200
OK.

202
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,610
You two behave yourselves.

203
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,800
Got it?

204
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,200
Yes, sir.

205
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, sir.

206
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,700
What are you doing?

207
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,800
Gu Yanzhen.

208
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Gu Yanzhen, I'll kill you!

209
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm exhausted. I need to rest.

210
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,680
Yeah.

211
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,280
They're arguing again.

212
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,120
What's happening?

213
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,960
You're welcome.

214
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,760
Ignore them.

215
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,400
They bicker every day.

216
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,560
I'll rip your head off, bastard!

217
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,280
They're fighting again?

218
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,800
Yeah.

219
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Let go.

220
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,680
They're fighting again?

221
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,520
Liangchen,

222
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,010
can you stop fighting against Gu Yanzhen?

223
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,760
You can't beat him anyway.

224
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,490
You always end up getting hurt.

225
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,680
I don't have a choice.

226
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,960
He's such a bully.

227
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Actually,

228
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,280
I think he's not that bad.

229
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,720
Are you blind or what?

230
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,680
He's a thug.

231
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,090
Alright.

232
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,600
Enough of him.

233
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,600
Our break is in two days.

234
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
What's your plan?

235
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
I...I'm going to visit my friend.

236
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,080
And you?

237
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm going to my sister's.

238
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,440
I see.

239
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,810
You said your sister got married here.

240
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,560
My sister and I,

241
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,440
together with my brother,

242
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,240
fled our hometown and came here.

243
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
I joined the army.

244
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,480
My sister got married.

245
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,210
My brother is studying in town.

246
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,900
He's in middle school now.

247
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,360
Really?

248
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,090
That's impressive.

249
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
My brother is the smartest in my family.

250
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,680
When I was young, my dad said

251
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,520
he'd sell anything at home

252
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
just so we could go to school.

253
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,250
Winning a scholar title

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,120
would bring honor to our family.

255
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,120
Sadly,

256
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,840
there are no such titles now.

257
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,820
Your brother is in middle school.

258
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,770
It's as good as winning that title.

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,330
What are you guys doing?

260
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,400
You're welcome.

261
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,760
That course is surprisingly interesting.

262
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,890
I'm surprised, too.

263
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,200
Xiaojun.

264
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
My friend is here.

265
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,520
I gotta go.

266
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,560
Bye-bye.

267
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,280
Goodbye.

268
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,690
Who is he?

269
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,600
Xiang!

270
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,560
It's me!

271
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,800
I miss you so much!

272
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,720
Let's go.

273
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,440
Let's go.

274
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,200
Do you miss me?

275
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,600
Of course I do.

276
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,720
Who is he?

277
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,610
Let's go.

278
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,640
How are you going?

279
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,970
Is your training tough?

280
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Can you handle it?

281
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,280
Who's your roommate?

282
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,370
Has he found out that you're a girl?

283
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Don't mention it.

284
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't want to talk about him.

285
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,170
What's wrong? Did he bully you?

286
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,960
We can talk about it later.

287
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Here's the thing.

288
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,220
I'll stay at your place for a few days.

289
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,280
It's school break.

290
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,829
My classmates have all gone home.

291
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,760
I don't want to be in the dorm alone.

292
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,400
The thing is

293
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,119
the fewer people know

294
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,400
your secret, the safer you are.

295
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,349
So I don't even tell my parents.

296
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,240
It's not appropriate for you to go to my home

297
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,960
as a boy.

298
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,609
What should I do?

299
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,000
I have an idea.

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,760
Follow me.

301
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,760
Mom.

302
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,640
Mom, I'm back.

303
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,600
Mom.

304
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Xie Xiang is here.

305
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Come here.

306
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,680
I haven't seen you for long.

307
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,360
How are you?

308
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,360
Are you in your break?

309
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,560
You're skinny

310
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,760
and tanned.

311
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
I had a lot of schoolwork to do

312
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,360
so I lost some weight.

313
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,520
You're a girl.

314
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,880
You should take good care of yourself.

315
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,560
Why don't you stay?

316
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,850
I'll cook some delicious food for you.

317
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,920
By the way,

318
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,690
how have your parents been?

319
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,090
It's been a long time since we last met.

320
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,080
-Back then, we were... -Mom.

321
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,650
Stop nagging, will you?

322
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,160
Xie Xiang will be staying with us for a while.

323
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,560
We're eating out tonight.

324
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,840
Why are you eating out?

325
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,800
It's expensive and unhealthy.

326
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,120
I've prepared enough food.

327
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,360
A friend invited us to dinner.

328
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,520
Who is this friend?

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,080
A boy or a girl?

330
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,680
A girl.

331
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,930
We're leaving, mom.

332
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,840
Let's go.

333
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,800
See you later.

334
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:20,800
Let's go.

335
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,760
Come back early.

336
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,400
My mom can't stop nagging me.

337
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,480
Moms are all the same.

338
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,740
You've met my mom, too.

339
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,100
Where are we going now?

340
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,520
Over there.

341
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,040
There's a high-end restaurant.

342
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,370
A high-end restaurant?

343
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,400
Who's paying?

344
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,280
So generous.

345
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,560
You don't need to know.

346
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,420
Just follow me.

347
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,360
How are you, ladies?

348
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,160
How many of you?

349
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,720
Hello.

350
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,640
Ms. Qu has reserved.

351
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,600
This way, please.

352
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,280
Thanks.

353
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,740
Xiaojun, here.

354
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,480
This way.

355
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,690
Where are you going?

356
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
You're late

357
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,290
for half an hour.

358
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,520
Even famous directors won't let me wait for long.

359
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,240
It's my fault.

361
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,650
Won't you introduce us?

362
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,480
This is my friend

363
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,080
Xie Xiang.

364
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,600
Xie Xiang,

365
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
this is Qu Manting,

366
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,400
the most famous star in Shanghai,

367
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,260
also my bestie.

368
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,480
Only in Shanghai?

369
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm famous all over the country.

370
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Xie Xiang, right?

371
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm Qu Manting.

372
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
I'm easy to get along with.

373
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,640
Just relax.

374
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,090
Your friend seems nervous.

375
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,040
Have a seat. Sit down.

376
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,560
Sit.

377
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,800
What's wrong?

378
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Look how cocky she is.

379
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,640
May I ask,

380
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,880
have we met before?

381
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,720
You seem familiar to me.

382
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,040
Impossible.

383
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,490
We've never met before.

384
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,520
Really?

385
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,420
Where are you from?

386
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,690
Are you also a local?

387
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,720
No.

388
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,240
I'm from Peking.

389
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,760
I've never come to Shunyuan before.

390
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560
Neither have I been to Shanghai.

391
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,760
I am familiar with your face.

392
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,300
But I can't remember where we've met.

393
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,760
Just let it go.

394
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,480
Order some food now.

395
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm starving.

396
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
Wait a minute.

397
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,490
There's another guest.

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,720
Who is it?

399
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,130
Who else could it be?

400
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,600
Mr. Shen of course.

401
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,600
He insisted on coming.

402
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,090
Mr. Shen, this way, please.

403
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,760
What's up now?

404
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,480
That's my classmate.

405
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,760
Hello.

406
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,130
Manting,

407
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,160
this is my brother

408
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
Shen Junshan.

409
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,260
He just came back from abroad.

410
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
You were playmates when you were young.

411
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,120
Do you remember?

412
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Shen Junshan.

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,920
I remember.

414
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,400
He used to follow you around

415
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
with snot under his nose, looking goofy.

416
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,770
You...you've changed dramatically.

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,730
You're like a whole new person.

418
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,620
You've changed a lot, too.

419
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,920
That night at Paramo,

420
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
I didn't even recognize you.

421
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,000
Let go!

422
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,160
Help me!

423
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,400
Please help me!

424
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,400
Help me!

425
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,480
I remember it!

426
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,250
Why didn't you help me that day?

427
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,240
You haven't introduced her.

428
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,810
Manting,

429
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,010
why don't you introduce us?

430
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
She's Xiaojun's friend.

431
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,160
She's...

432
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,130
She's...

433
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm sorry. I don't feel well.

434
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Please excuse me.

435
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,880
I'll go with her.

436
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,660
Let's order first.

437
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,080
Here.

438
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,880
Crap, crap, crap!

439
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,640
Shen Junshan is my classmate.

440
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,360
Did I seem odd just now?

441
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,980
He must've recognized me.

442
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,280
I don't think so.

443
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,360
Also,

444
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,240
you're wearing a dress and a wig.

445
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,090
I don't think he can recognize you easily.

446
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,000
Hey you,

447
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,400
why didn't you tell me

448
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,520
your celebrity friend would be here?

449
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,000
We met once at Paramo.

450
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,920
Last time,

451
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,020
I didn't get to introduce you two,

452
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,740
so I accepted her invitation.

453
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,160
So many things happened last time.

454
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,360
She wouldn't remember you.

455
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,160
You don't know.

456
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,800
I met her in the ladies' room before her show.

457
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,930
She thought I was a pervert and beat me.

458
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,640
You...you didn't tell me.

459
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,570
How would I know?

460
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,760
I'm doomed.

461
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,920
He must've recognized me.

462
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,080
What should I do?

463
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Just chill.

464
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
Don't scare yourself.

465
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,680
Calm down.

466
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,520
How about this?

467
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
You go home first.

468
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,480
And

469
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,010
I'll go back to talk to them.

470
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
Will it work?

471
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,680
It should be OK.

472
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,720
I'll tell them you're needed elsewhere.

473
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,760
Then I'll sound them out.

474
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm leaving then.

475
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,440
Take a stroll along the street

476
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,760
before you go back to my home.

477
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,490
I'll be back as soon as I'm done.

478
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,960
Don't be back too late.

479
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,690
Don't worry.

480
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,680
Be careful.

481
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,690
Stop the car.

482
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
Young master, what's wrong?

483
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,840
Nothing.

484
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,480
Let's go.

485
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,520
Here's the noodles.

486
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,920
Eat it while it's warm.

487
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,760
Eat. Come on.

488
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
Smells good.

489
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
So is Sheng Junshan

490
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,810
really your classmate?

491
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,880
He is.

492
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
You're so lucky.

493
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,520
Shen Junshan is well-educated and handsome.

494
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,320
I heard he came back from abroad.

495
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,290
If I could see him every day,

496
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,730
I'd be willing to be a man

497
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,400
or a corpse if I had to.

498
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,400
Enough.

499
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,680
I was almost scared to death.

500
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,920
Luckily, they didn't recognize me.

501
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,680
Relax.

502
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,800
I've observed them for you.

503
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,930
Your secret is safe.

504
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,800
You should see his stern face.

505
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,060
What is he like?

506
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,000
Is he super elegant and attractive?

507
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
A real gentleman?

508
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
You're helpless!

509
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,200
Tell me about it.

510
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Stop eating.

511
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,570
He's good-looking.

512
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
What does his family do?

513
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,760
His family seems powerful.

514
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,820
Rich and powerful.

515
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,440
Shen is a household name.

516
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,680
Shen Tingbai is the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

517
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,960
In Shunyuan,

518
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,480
he's influential

519
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,610
and well connected.

520
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,760
The Shens and the Qus have been friends for long.

521
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,360
Mr. Shen's loved Qu Manting since he was young.

522
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,620
Well, I don't get to see him too often.

523
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,000
Xiang,

524
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,360
I know from my dad

525
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,520
the news these days are all about

526
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,400
battles all over the country

527
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,360
and casualties.

528
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
It's scary.

529
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,240
You're a student at the Military Academy.

530
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,400
Will you be sent to the battlefield someday?

531
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,930
Aren't you afraid as a girl?

532
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,820
If your brother were still alive,

533
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,140
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

534
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,940
What are you doing?

535
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,620
Someone sent us

536
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
to teach you a lesson.

537
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,440
Someone sent you.

538
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,640
How much did they pay you?

539
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,280
I'm rich.

540
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
I can pay you more.

541
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,600
Sorry, sir.

542
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,640
I can't do this.

543
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,800
We have rules.

544
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
I'm afraid

545
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,740
I can't help you today.

546
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,880
Do it.

547
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,410
Wait, wait a second.

548
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Before you hit me,

549
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,280
can...

550
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,440
can you at least tell me who I offended

551
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,040
so that I could rest in peace?

552
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,160
The one you offended

553
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,040
is a powerful figure.

554
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,160
Shut up.

555
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,400
What's wrong with you?

556
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,320
How many times have I told you

557
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,340
not to reveal my identity?

558
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,120
Don't you know the rules?

559
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,300
You don't need to ask them.

560
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
I sent them here.

561
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,280
You humiliated me that day.

562
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,160
You should've seen this coming.

563
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,360
Had I known it was you,

564
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,490
I wouldn't have struggled so hard.

565
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,930
What do you mean?

566
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,800
Do it.

567
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,000
Run!

568
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,300
Hey pretty,

569
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,920
don't you know

570
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,000
it's dangerous

571
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,060
for a girl to hang out with three punks

572
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,660
in the street at night?

573
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
Why are you so close to me?

574
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,290
Get away from me.

575
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,810
Aren't you trying to

576
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
teach me a lesson?

577
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm right here.

578
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,960
Go ahead.

579
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,480
Why don't we call it a day?

580
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,380
Let's meet some other day.

581
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,280
OK. Sure.

582
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,080
Some other day?

583
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
If I let you go,

584
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,760
what will others think of me?

585
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,360
Then what do you want?

586
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,680
How about this?

587
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,720
Let bygones be bygones.

588
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,160
And now,

589
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,920
you give yourself to me.

590
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,240
What are you doing?

591
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,700
Don't do anything stupid.

592
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,490
Does this count?

593
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,570
Stop right there! Stop!

594
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,000
Hey you,

595
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,080
I...I swear I'll kill you someday!

596
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,360
Gu Yanzhen.

597
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,290
Where did you go?

598
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Who's in the dorm?

599
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,240
Zhu Yanlin.

600
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,800
Ask him to come.

601
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,320
OK.

602
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,880
Yanzhen.

603
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,040
I have heard

604
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,320
you have wine.

605
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,700
Put it down.

606
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,720
Need one more bowl.

607
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,480
Go get one.

608
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,620
I have one. I'll go.

609
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,660
I have one, too.

610
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,570
Hurry up.

611
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,760
I'm starving.

612
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
Sergeant Guo.

613
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,900
What are you doing?

614
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,360
I'm hungry

615
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,360
so I'm eating.

616
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,080
Well, I

617
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,040
happen to pass by

618
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
to get some water.

619
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,010
Give me some.

620
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,720
It's cold.

621
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,720
I like cold water.

622
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,040
Pour it.

623
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,840
What's wrong?

624
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,760
Don't you know drinking is prohibited at here?

625
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,290
I don't know.

626
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,660
I won't do it next time.

627
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,680
Next time?

628
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,490
There's a next time?

629
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,170
You'll be cleaning the toilet for a month.

630
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,400
It's...

631
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,840
Sergeant Guo.

632
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,860
The kettles...

633
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,920
Sergeant Guo.

634
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,920
Come.

635
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,040
You and Gu Yanzhen

636
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,170
will receive the same punishment.

637
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,240
Sir,

638
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,360
what did I do?

639
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,040
A bunch of brats.

640
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,949
What luck!

641
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:16,610
Liangchen.

642
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,610
Liangchen.

643
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,949
I want to die!

644
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,130
What's wrong with him?

645
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,460
Liangchen.

646
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,560
What's up?

647
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,719
Are you done?

648
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,600
Then get out!

649
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,760
I need to clean the toilet.

650
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,600
Go ahead.

651
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,679
I won't disturb you.

652
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,199
Right.

653
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,360
So strange.

654
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,060
What's wrong with him?

655
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,739
Gu Yanzhen,

656
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,120
why aren't you cleaning the toilet?

657
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,719
Why should I do that?

658
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,920
Why should you?

659
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,000
Sergeant Guo punished you

660
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
not me.

661
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,930
You got me into this.

662
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,090
I'm involved in by others, too.

663
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,040
Fine.

664
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,720
I'll stop, too.

665
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,260
Tomorrow, let's take the bath together.

666
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,290
I have an idea. Come with me.

667
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,840
Here.

668
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,320
Here. Here. Here.

669
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,240
Here.

670
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,970
It's your fault.

671
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,560
Your idea sucks.

672
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
You didn't check it.

673
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,480
Why are you blaming me?

674
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
How could I?

675
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,040
Shut up.

676
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,120
Still hold it.

677
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,240
Sir,

678
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,930
is there anything left?

679
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,180
There's only soup.

680
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,640
Nothing else?

681
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,320
None.

682
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
I'm full.

683
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,760
There's still a big one left.

684
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,120
No food again.

685
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,320
Hey, what's up?

686
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,300
You didn't eat?

687
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,120
Wait a minute.

688
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,760
No, thanks.

689
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,820
I'm not too hungry.

690
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,840
It's OK.

691
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,320
It's about to expire.

692
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Take it with medicine

693
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,280
so you won't have a diarrhea.

694
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,560
Thank you.

695
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,290
I'm leaving.

696
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,460
Liangchen.

697
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,680
I knew you must be here.

698
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,930
You didn't eat, did you?

699
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,680
I have some food in the dorm.

700
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,720
Go with me.

701
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,720
No, thanks.

702
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,800
I just ate.

703
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,480
What did you eat?

704
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,280
Biscuits.

705
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,400
Give me one.

706
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,240
I can't.

707
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,560
It's expired.

708
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,130
You may have a diarrhea.

709
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,680
It looks OK.

710
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,160
Sit.

711
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,800
OK. Thanks.

712
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,560
Impressive!

713
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,960
Good job! Well done!

714
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,890
That's amazing.

715
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,340
What are you doing?

716
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,180
Liangchen.

717
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,180
Liangchen.

718
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,010
What are you guys doing?

719
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,720
Xie Liangchen.

720
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,130
Are you alright?

721
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,400
Gu Yanzhen,

722
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,800
bring him to the health centre.

723
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,400
Me?

724
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Why should I do it?

725
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Are you refusing?

726
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,650
Let's go.

727
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,480
I can go there myself.

728
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Come on. Let's go.

729
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,560
Come.

730
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,250
How did you get hurt?

731
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,280
I was hit by a wood chopper during training.

732
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,010
Does it hurt?

733
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,240
Yeah.

734
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Take off your clothes.

735
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,480
Let me see your wound.

736
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,120
Sir,

737
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,930
may I keep my clothes on?

738
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,920
Why?

739
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,130
I'm not used to undressing in front of others.

740
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,040
For a young man like you,

741
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,200
you're quite shy.

742
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,160
With your clothes on,

743
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,560
how can I check your wound?

744
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,090
What if your bones are hurt?

745
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,680
My bones are fine.

746
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,080
It's just a small bruise.

747
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,720
Can you give me some gauze, iodine

748
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,560
and medicine?

749
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,080
I can take care of my own wound.

750
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,800
Your wound

751
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,280
needs to be washed

752
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,640
and disinfected first.

753
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,280
Hurry up.

754
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,170
Where are you going?

755
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,080
Are you crazy?

756
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,660
How about this?

757
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,760
You take this back

758
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,520
and help him disinfect the wound

759
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,650
before dressing it.

760
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,800
If he's in pain

761
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
or he has other symptoms,

762
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
bring him to me.

763
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,330
Can't you knock?

764
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,280
Are you crazy?

765
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,480
Why did you come back?

766
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,160
None of your business.

767
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,440
Like I care.

768
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,580
