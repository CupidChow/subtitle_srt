Episode 41

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
Xiang!

5
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,240
Xiang, thank god.

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,920
Mom,

7
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
I'm OK.

8
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
How did you escape?

9
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Did you get hurt?

10
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,200
Anything wrong?

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,240
I'm fine, mom.

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Don't worry.

13
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,880
How did you know this?

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,320
Where is my dad?

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,360
He is still waiting at the police station.

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
A friend of you

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,040
came here for a photo of you,

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
so we knew that.

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,200
My friend?

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,960
Which one?

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,400
The Mr. Gu,

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Gu Yanzhen!

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,040
Gu Yanzhen?

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,480
Where is he?

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,120
He

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,650
must still be looking for you outside.

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,040
Mom,

28
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,500
I need to go out for a while.

29
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,440
Xiang!

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,079
Sir,

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,000
stop!

32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,680
Sir!

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
Sir!

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,440
To the police station.

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,120
No. No way.

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Nobody is working now.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,220
Don't stop me from making reward.

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
I can give you more!

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,440
Is…

40
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,200
Is this you?

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
Is she you?

42
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,840
Right?

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
It's me.

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,079
God bless me!

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,280
I found her!

46
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,120
Get on!

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,079
I'll bring you to the one who wants you.

49
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,010
Hurry up! Get on!

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
Sit still!

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,560
Wait!

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,600
Sit down.

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,800
Where…

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,340
Where are you taking me to?

55
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,240
Where is it?

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
Almost there!

57
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,760
Sir!

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,920
Sir!

59
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,890
The one you want is here!

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,720
So grateful in this life

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,880
You're here with me

62
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,920
Wind brings back the memory

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,240
In dream shall we meet

64
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Hope in this life

65
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,520
We'll love and cherish each other

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,720
Till death do us apart

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,600
Don't idle away your youth

68
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Dreams never stop

69
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,440
So grateful in this life

70
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,480
You're here with me

71
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,720
Wind brings back the memory

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
In dream shall we meet

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Gu Yanzhen.

74
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,880
Hope in this life

75
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,920
Gu Yanzhen.

76
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,880
We'll love and cherish each other

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Till death do us apart

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,720
Don't idle away your youth

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
Dreams never stop

80
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Gu Yanzhen!

81
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,600
Gu Yanzhen!

82
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
Xie Xiang...

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,920
So grateful in this life

84
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,720
You're here with me

85
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,320
Wind brings back the memory

86
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,400
In dream shall we meet

87
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,360
Xie Xiang...

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Hope in this life

89
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,400
We'll love and cherish each other

90
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,400
Xie Xiang...

91
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,440
Till death do us apart

92
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,040
Don't idle away your youth

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,520
Dreams never stop

94
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
Sir, your flowers.

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,520
Thank you.

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,640
Welcome next time.

97
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,360
I want some flowers.

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Welcome, sir.

99
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,080
What kind do you like?

100
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,440
I'd buy those

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,500
which you commend.

102
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,000
Then, will that be

103
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,040
a gift?

104
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,300
Yes, to my girlfriend.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
To girlfriend?

106
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,440
Well, look,

107
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,159
what about this bunch of lilies?

108
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,720
These just arrived this morning.

109
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,520
They can last ten days.

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
Or the roses?

111
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,320
Girls love roses too.

112
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,360
Well,

113
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
how about the yellow roses?

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,680
Or,

115
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,200
or this bunch of roses.

116
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,659
This one is blooming well.

117
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,540
And you could add some…

118
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,560
Mr. Li!

119
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,640
Why are you here?

120
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,040
Who are you?

121
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
I haven't seen you for a long time.

122
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
Come, let me tell you something.

123
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Who…who are you?

124
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,210
Something important, come on!

125
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
Xianrong,

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
there is no more time for your task.

127
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,760
It has been a year after you came to Shunyuan,

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,440
but there is no progress on your task.

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,610
The leadership is already disappointed.

130
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
It's not good

131
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,730
for you to keep delaying it.

132
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes.

133
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,669
I got it.

134
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,669
Still no specific location?

135
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,120
The Russian has died,

136
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,549
and the map is a fake one.

137
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,400
That translator

138
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,640
can only draw a general location.

139
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
Maybe he really doesn't know anything.

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,520
No one can survive that kind of torture.

141
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,000
This is classified now.

142
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,440
I heard that the translator has escaped.

143
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,520
You should bring him back as soon as possible.

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
Yes.

145
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,330
I've already sent someone to do it.

146
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,640
And the real map,

147
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,520
should be found soon too.

148
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,640
Yes.

149
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
They are the geologists

150
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,320
sent by Mr. Yamamoto.

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,080
They will cooperate with you next.

152
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,960
Please don't worry.

153
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,050
I will find the map as soon as possible.

154
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,920
Mr. Li,

155
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,640
is that one just now your friend?

156
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,860
My neighbor next door.

157
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,760
Where is he?

158
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,800
Went back home.

159
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,640
But, his flowers…

160
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,900
I can bring them to him.

161
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,760
- Alright, thank you. - Give them to me.

162
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,440
Wait.

163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,860
Your hand got hurt?

164
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,900
It's not a big deal.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm fine.

166
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,660
Wait a second.

167
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,990
Let me bind it up for you.

168
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,560
You...

169
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,040
You can bind up injuries?

170
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,920
Not so well.

171
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,090
But it may be like wrapping up the flowers.

172
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,720
Alright.

173
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,800
That's it?

174
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,760
This is so ugly.

175
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,940
Don't touch it!

176
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,680
I think it's pretty.

177
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,960
Trust me.

178
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,480
I never tell lies.

179
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,190
Let me bring you some water.

180
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,130
I'm not thirsty.

181
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,840
Well,

182
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,930
are you busy in a moment?

183
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,000
No.

184
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,320
Well,

185
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,740
don't you want water?

186
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,560
No.

187
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
And any food?

188
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,400
No.

189
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,930
Then, could you help me with some work?

190
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

191
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Are we familiar?

192
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,160
Sure.

193
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,690
I can even remember you.

194
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
You are Mr. Li Wenzhong from Baihua Company.

195
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,000
Just help me move something.

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,160
It's easy. Wait.

197
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,040
But, I got hurt!

198
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,160
I have done what I should do.

199
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,320
What else?

200
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,280
No.

201
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,340
Thank you for this.

202
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,460
Nothing at all.

203
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,280
But,

204
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,320
do you have

205
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,280
such a heavy workload every day?

206
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
No.

207
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,880
These are for a month.

208
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,520
What?

209
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,240
Mr. Li,

210
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
you are indeed a soldier.

211
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,520
So tall and so strong.

212
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,280
You can even

213
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,340
finish the work for a month in one day!

214
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Thank you!

215
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,190
It should be me who say this.

216
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,760
Let me treat you the dinner.

217
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,120
You treat me?

218
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,480
Do you have money?

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,600
Sure.

220
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,280
Look.

221
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,400
Fine.

222
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,090
Let me change my clothes first.

223
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,480
Is that heavy?

224
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,160
No. I'm used to it.

225
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,650
I always forget things.

226
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
This can help me.

227
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,960
Let's go.

228
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,450
Let me treat you.

229
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,240
Walk this side.

230
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,370
Or you'll fall down.

231
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,240
How about I treat you…

232
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,200
noodles?

233
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,400
No.

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,520
What about dumplings?

235
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,800
I want western food.

236
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,240
But that'll be expensive.

237
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah.

238
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,960
Your treat.

239
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,720
Yes.

240
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,680
But I can't afford western food.

241
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,920
Then I treat you.

242
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,520
No, no.

243
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,640
We had a deal.

244
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,740
I should treat you.

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,380
Noodles, alright?

246
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,120
You know what, if you bully her again,

247
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,180
I'll beat you up...

248
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,800
Wenzhong!

249
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,120
Let's go have dinner.

250
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
I have had.

251
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,880
What?

252
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,900
Well, I'm leaving now.

253
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,040
My mom made ginseng soup.

254
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,170
Get up and have some.

255
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,640
Why soup again?

256
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm so tired of that.

257
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,760
She said you are in poor health now

258
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,890
and you need energy.

259
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,240
Have it now.

260
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,840
Take it easy.

261
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Look what you did.

262
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,210
What are you looking at?

263
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,400
What?

264
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,270
There is the soup too!

265
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,880
Enough.

266
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,240
I'm a patient, OK?

267
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,410
I don't think so.

268
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
You're so energetic.

269
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,980
Even stronger than me.

270
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,349
What's wrong?

271
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,000
Does it hurt again?

272
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,560
No.

273
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,690
Let me see that.

274
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,170
It's not necessary.

275
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,080
Let me see!

276
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,000
Hands off!

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
My mom will see this!

278
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
So what?

279
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
You know what,

280
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,880
your mom likes me so much.

281
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,930
She looked at me as if

282
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,000
she was looking at her future son-in-law.

283
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
Don't flatter yourself.

284
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
That's real!

285
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,440
So many things happened these days.

286
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
How about you find a temple to worship?

287
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
Can you talk seriously?

288
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm not kidding.

289
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,480
Do you know who did that?

290
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
I heard that

291
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,810
it was the Japanese.

292
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,960
Japanese?

293
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
Was it because

294
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,360
they had known I went

295
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,450
to the hospital to save people?

296
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,600
If it were really them,

297
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960
they could have just killed you,

298
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,220
why did they catch you?

299
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,200
Maybe it was

300
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,690
because of that boy.

301
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,480
There was a boy

302
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
who escaped together with us.

303
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,800
I always thought he had some secrets.

304
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,040
He gave me an address and told me

305
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,240
to find him after I recovered.

306
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Since they have known your place,

307
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,800
then it's not safe here now.

308
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,440
Do you have any relatives or friends

309
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,520
out of town

310
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,660
who can shelter your parents?

311
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,000
Or I can help you.

312
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,420
My grandma is living in Hangzhou.

313
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,320
I'll discuss with my parents later.

314
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,320
We should find it out.

315
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,100
At least we should know

316
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,200
who we offended and

317
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,740
what troubles we caused.

318
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,680
You'd better go back to Shunyuan with me.

319
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,140
Under this circumstance,

320
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
the Academy is safer to stay.

321
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,880
Don't worry,

322
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
I'm here with you.

323
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,240
I won't let you

324
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,900
be in troubles alone anymore.

325
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,760
Gu,

326
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,600
you're up.

327
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,360
I need some walks.

328
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,080
I've been lying too long.

329
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,240
Young people are always in good health.

330
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,080
Yanzhen,

331
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,360
don't be too careless.

332
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,440
You will get cold in the living room.

333
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,280
You'd better go back to lie in bed.

334
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm fine, Mrs. Xie,

335
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,000
and it doesn't matter.

336
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,880
Mom,

337
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,210
he is not that delicate.

338
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,210
The one who was kidnapped is me!

339
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,880
And,

340
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
can you stop calling him Yanzhen?

341
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,530
Can you call him Gu like my dad does?

342
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
That's not appropriate.

343
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,240
I like it.

344
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,740
None of your business.

345
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,100
I think that

346
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,960
"Yanzhen" sounds kinder.

347
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Mrs. Xie is right.

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,080
Yanzhen,

349
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,960
what do you want for dinner?

350
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,560
Anything is fine.

351
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,160
I'll go.

352
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,000
What about Sichuan cuisine?

353
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,460
He doesn't eat spicy food.

354
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,340
Well, how about Shanghai cuisine?

355
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,400
That will be great!

356
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,340
Are you all right?

357
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,880
I saw the news in the newspaper.

358
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
I'm so worried about you!

359
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,400
You are…

360
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,940
Hello, Mr. Xie,

361
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm Xiang's friend,

362
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,760
Shen Junshan.

363
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
Shen Junshan?

364
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,760
I think you are familiar.

365
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,440
I met you once

366
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,760
in Shunyuan

367
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,840
before.

368
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,480
Right! I remember.

369
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,340
You're Chairman Shen's brother.

370
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,040
Right?

371
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,200
Yes.

372
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,480
Come on,

373
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
come in please.

374
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,560
Here.

375
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,200
This way.

376
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
Mom, why is that?

377
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,160
What have you done?

378
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,400
You're a girl!

379
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
How can you be so dissolute?

380
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm not!

381
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm not blind!

382
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,240
You!

383
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,320
Thanks.

384
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,720
This time is in a hurry

385
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,650
and I didn't inform you.

386
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,680
It was because I saw

387
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,800
the news of

388
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,100
Xiang's matter in the newspaper.

389
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,520
I was so anxious

390
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,660
that I didn't even prepare gifts.

391
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,170
Mr. and Mrs. Xie,

392
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,360
please

393
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,280
forgive my

394
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,740
impoliteness.

395
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,920
Mr. Shen,

396
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,200
how did you

397
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,720
get to know Xiang?

398
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,360
Mr. Xie,

399
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,360
you can just call me Junshan.

400
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,920
Didn't

401
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,840
you remember?

402
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,130
Last time at my family's party,

403
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,760
Xiang's face

404
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,280
was dirty by the cake.

405
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,300
It was me who took her to clean.

406
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,000
Since then,

407
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,670
we've known each other.

408
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes, right, I remember.

409
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,650
You are a student from the Academy.

410
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,600
Well,

411
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,000
you should be a

412
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
classmate of Gu.

413
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,440
Yes,

414
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,760
we are classmates.

415
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,360
What a coincidence.

416
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,960
Yes,

417
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,120
it is.

418
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,040
And we are friends too.

419
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,200
Good friends.

420
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,960
I should go to prepare the dinner.

421
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,340
It's rare that two of Xiang's friends

422
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,480
are here in our house,

423
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,740
then how about hot pot?

424
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,160
Great!

425
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,360
That'll be nice.

426
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,280
OK.

427
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,920
I'll go prepare for it.

428
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,450
Stay to have dinner with us.

429
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,100
I'll go help my mom.

430
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,320
Xiang,

431
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,780
what's wrong with you?

432
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,600
No!

433
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,160
I…

434
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
Didn't I tell you that

435
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,880
you should be honest and bounden?

436
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,760
You're a girl.

437
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,620
How can you swing between two men?

438
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,960
Mom!

439
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,680
I didn't! I…

440
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,560
Stop it.

441
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,520
After dinner,

442
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,160
you should

443
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,720
ask that Mr. Shen

444
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,560
to leave.

445
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,340
I like Gu Yanzhen.

446
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,400
He is so nice.

447
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
Don't you dare bully him.

448
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,680
What are you waiting for?

449
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,400
Go do some work!

450
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,000
Now!

451
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,640
Let's start our dinner!

452
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,960
Yes.

453
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
Well, help yourself.

454
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,620
Yes, right.

455
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,240
You should eat

456
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
by yourself.

457
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
The scallion,

458
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
coriander,

459
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,450
and the seasoning are all here.

460
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,280
Come on.

461
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,640
Eat. Enjoy yourself.

462
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,960
Bye-bye.

463
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,720
Mr. Xie,

464
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,360
Mrs. Xie,

465
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,440
that's it.

466
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,180
Thanks for the dinner.

467
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,610
You're welcome.

468
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,600
Could

469
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,920
Xiang walk me out

470
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,560
please?

471
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,560
Alright.

472
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,800
Xiang,

473
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,440
you walk Mr. Shen out.

474
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,760
OK.

475
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,920
Let's go.

476
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,640
See you.

477
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,720
See you.

478
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,160
When

479
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,520
did you know this?

480
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,800
Long time ago.

481
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,400
How long?

482
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
I don't remember.

483
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,490
Was it during the Mask Ball?

484
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,900
I've already known

485
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
at that time.

486
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,930
You have to go back to Shunyuan now.

487
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,920
I'll buy the tickets.

488
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,720
I'll go back with you.

489
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,480
No.

490
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,210
Don't say no.

491
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,240
This is not a trivial matter.

492
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,480
You will need my help.

493
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,400
Alright,

494
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
it is late now.

495
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,020
Go back and rest early.

496
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,120
We have

497
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,050
many things to do tomorrow.

498
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,800
See you.

499
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,840
What are you doing here?

500
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,770
Waiting for you.

501
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,800
What?

502
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,450
Don't want him to leave?

503
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
Stop your nonsenses.

504
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Look at you,

505
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,360
so upset.

506
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,640
I'm not.

507
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,000
You can never talk well.

508
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,920
Fine,

509
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
you can.

510
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,320
We have to

511
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,440
find that boy when we are back there

512
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
and figure it out.

513
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,920
Yes.

514
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
I can go with you.

515
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,680
Get on.

516
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,900
No, thanks.

517
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,200
Come on.

518
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,760
It is here.

519
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,200
Come in.

520
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,890
You knew that I'll come for you?

521
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,080
They won't

522
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,360
let me escape so easily.

523
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
So I guessed

524
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,080
if you are in danger,

525
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,880
you may come to me.

526
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,930
You knew that I'll be in danger?

527
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,040
Well…

528
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,010
Why did they arrest you?

529
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,100
What have you done?

530
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,880
My father

531
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
is doing business of leather.

532
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,280
I have been staying in the north with him when I was a child.

533
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,400
Then gradually

534
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,380
I could speak their language.

535
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,200
They are…

536
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,480
Russians.

537
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,960
Yes.

538
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,520
One of my friends

539
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
offered me a job

540
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
to be a translator

541
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
for a Russian

542
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,720
called Evan.

543
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,560
He said he was a painter

544
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,960
and just came to Shunyuan.

545
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,290
He wanted to walk around

546
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,210
but he couldn't speak Chinese.

547
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,170
So he asked me to accompany him.

548
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,250
And he would pay me a lot.

549
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,440
So, I said yes.

550
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,960
Then I stayed

551
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,440
with Evan for the next month

552
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,240
for collecting culture around.

553
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,840
Then?

554
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,560
Then it was over,

555
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,360
he paid me.

556
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,000
And we haven't

557
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,640
been in touch since then.

558
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,000
But sooner,

559
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,160
one day when I was resting

560
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,200
in my rental,

561
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,410
some people broke in and caught

562
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,320
me without saying anything.

563
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,320
And they

564
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,440
kept torturing me.

565
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,600
They were

566
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Japanese?

567
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,960
What did they ask you?

568
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,680
They asked me

569
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,760
what did we do

570
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
and where did we go

571
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,210
when I was with Evan.

572
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,920
And they wanted me

573
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,290
to tell the details about the address.

574
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,520
I remember

575
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,160
that they asked

576
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,090
if I had seen any map painted by him.

577
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,320
Map?

578
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,300
I thought it was weird too.

579
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
So I have been

580
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,280
thinking about this these days.

581
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
When I was being Evan's translator,

582
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,600
I thought he was not only a painter.

583
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,540
Then what is he?

584
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,290
I don't know either.

585
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,560
But I

586
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,490
had never seen him draw a painting.

587
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,890
What's more,

588
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,930
where he went

589
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,240
were not beautiful places,

590
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,700
but some deserted wildernesses.

591
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,420
And he was like finding something

592
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,760
here and there.

593
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,760
So I guessed

594
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,720
he might be a geologist.

595
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,720
Geologist?

596
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,280
Yes.

597
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,560
What have you told the Japanese?

598
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,600
They tortured me so bad

599
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
that I almost told them all of these.

600
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,680
But,

601
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,190
here's a thing I didn't.

602
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,850
What's that?

603
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,949
Evan rented a flat for a long time

604
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,880
except for his residence.

605
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,320
But he seldom went there.

606
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,020
And I only went there once.

607
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,400
Where is it?

608
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,770
It's at West Fourth Street, No. 45,

609
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,670
Room 204.

610
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,800
What's your plan next?

611
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,960
I know this is very important.

612
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,880
I can't trust others.

613
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,889
I haven't told anybody and didn't leave.

614
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
But now,

615
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,840
I have told you about this.

616
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,230
I can leave in peace now.

617
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,480
Don't bother.

618
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,460
You have saved my life.

619
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,440
I can't take more benefits from you.

620
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,160
Take it.

621
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,840
Look at your wounds

622
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,880
Besides,

623
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,680
you will need money in Shanghai.

624
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,720
Thank you.

625
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,240
Ms,

626
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,320
I have found out

627
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,960
that the Russian

628
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,040
used to rent

629
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,520
a flat in Shunyuan.

630
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
Except for his residence,

631
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,700
there is another flat?

632
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,480
Yes.

633
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,960
Call up men

634
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,540
to check it out.

635
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,620
Take cover!

636
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,240
Shoot!

637
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,600
I got the map!

638
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,240
Let's go!

639
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,480
Leave now!

640
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,840
After her.

641
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,500
Go! I'll cover you!

642
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,360
Go help Xie Xiang!

643
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,220
I'll cover you!

644
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,760
You want this?

645
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,120
Give me that,

646
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,180
and I'll let you go.

647
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,680
Get it by yourself if you want it!

648
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,520
Xie Xiang!

649
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,120
Come here!

650
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:57,880
Let's go!

651
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,360
Now!
