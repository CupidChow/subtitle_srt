Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 08

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,160
Yanlin.

5
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
you did the things

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,080
these days?

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,720
What things?

8
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,450
I don't know.

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,400
We didn't.

10
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,680
I'm not kidding.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,440
What?

12
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,780
I'm asking you.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,400
- What happened? - I don't know!

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,720
If you could get to them,

15
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,880
why didn't you kill them?

16
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
Kill?

17
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,120
Are there no laws

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,220
and no government?

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
You always talk about killing,

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
but have you ever killed anyone?

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,770
Government?

22
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,880
Laws?

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,410
If there were a government,

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,480
why could foreigners

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,410
come to our land to kill our people?

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
If there were a law,

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,200
we wouldn't even have

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
no courage to punish them.

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,320
Yes,

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,880
Gu Yanzhen, I know

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,680
your family are all high-ranking officials.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,840
Your father was sent by the Peking government

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,640
to supervise Feng'an province.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
How awe-inspiring!

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,960
But where is your father

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,960
when the Japanese

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,290
came to set fire in our factory?

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,640
He sneaked back to Peking!

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,880
What?

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,520
Do you dare to say it again?

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,200
So what?

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
Your father is the government's stooge!

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,340
Zhu Yanlin!

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Stop that.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,980
Zhu Yanlin!

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,520
Calm down.

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,480
Zhu Yanlin!

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,330
Don't be a bastard here.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,170
Why don't you do that yourself?

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,840
Right.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,040
I didn't.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,930
But at least I didn't make fun of it.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,720
I took it seriously.

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Let's go, Yanlin.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,120
Right.

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,860
We have nothing to say to them.

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,480
Let's go.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,920
Stop there!

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,680
What did you mean by that?

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,880
What's wrong with us?

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
You're fine.

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,930
Besides,

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,920
the four student leaders

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,490
who were kept in the prison,

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,760
died.

66
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,200
Do you know how they died?

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
They were burnt to death.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,720
There were so many people in the prison.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,079
But only them.

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,640
Only them were burnt to death.

71
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,600
What?

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,960
Are you kidding?

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,740
What happened?

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,640
Last night,

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,220
the prison was on fire.

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,640
The four student leaders

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,280
who broke into the Japanese COC to catch the murderers

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,160
were all dead.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
This has been known for long.

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,890
Don't you know that?

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,040
We don't.

82
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,220
What were you doing when the Japanese

83
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,360
broke into the prison

84
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,620
to kill our people?

85
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,740
You were using the itching power to the Japanese

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,040
and putting laxative into their meals!

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Murderers!

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Don't let them go!

89
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Don't let them go!

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,480
Don't let them go!

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Don't let them go!

92
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,600
We can't allow our fellow to die with grievance!

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,130
Back off!

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,000
If we

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,640
let them go today,

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
we will be the sinners in this country.

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,080
We can't release them!

98
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,480
Yes! Don't let them go!

99
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,980
What are you doing!

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
What do you want to do?

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,800
They are the murderers!

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,890
The seven workers and the child

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,880
in the factory

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,920
and the four student leaders

105
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,010
were all killed by them!

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,770
They are the murderers!

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
You can't let them go!

108
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,240
No!

109
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,760
No! No!

110
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,620
Keep them here!

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
You can't let them go!

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,040
Shut up!

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,520
You shouldn't be involved in this.

114
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,360
But we must!

115
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,320
Every man is responsible for the rise and fall of his country!

116
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,440
For our country! For our country!

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,370
For our country!

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Why did we join the army?

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,680
We want to defend our country

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,260
against foreign insults.

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,720
If

122
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,280
we can't even punish the killers

123
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,090
of our fellow citizens,

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
we will be guilty of our country

125
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
and of our military uniform!

126
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,020
Obedience is the first duty of a soldier.

127
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,200
I obeyed the order from the

128
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,240
Commander and the Government

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,640
to let them go.

130
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
But this is a wrong decision.

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
Since it is wrong,

132
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,600
we shouldn't obey it.

133
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,400
We need to see Sergeant Lv

134
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
and Sergeant Guo.

135
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
We don't trust you!

136
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,880
We don't trust you!

137
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
Go back there now!

138
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,100
Put your guns down!

139
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,240
Guns down!

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,580
What are you doing?

141
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,010
Do you want to rebel?

142
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,560
The question should be for you.

143
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,490
What do you mean?

144
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,040
The Japanese are

145
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,840
known to be the murderers.

146
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,940
There are so many people watching us.

147
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,640
How could you let the murderers go

148
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
in front of them?

149
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,040
Sergeant,

150
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,370
we can lose our reputation.

151
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
But what about our

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
dignity?

153
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,040
I was ordered by the Commander

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,440
and the...

155
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,920
The government, right?

156
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,680
Where is the

157
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,640
official documents?

158
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,600
Don't tell me it was

159
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,440
someone's verbal command.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,720
Sergeant,

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,880
you don't need to be smart.

162
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,200
But you can't be stupid.

163
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,440
Are you so willing

164
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
to take the blame for others?

165
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,850
Mr. Song, don't forget that...

166
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,840
Shut up!

167
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Put the guns down now!

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,920
Guns down! Guns down!

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,640
Back off!

170
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,560
Back off!

171
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,420
Are you insane?

172
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,050
Put the gun down!

173
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,400
I told you to put the gun down!

174
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
Song Huaping,

175
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,360
are you sure you want to be a traitor?

176
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Who is the traitor?

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,159
You!

178
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,080
I'll kill you!

179
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Do you dare?

180
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Sergeant Song,

181
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,840
do you dare to kill your students

182
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,970
for these Japanese?

183
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,280
Go back now!

184
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,520
Take him away!

185
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,580
Don't touch me.

186
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
I can walk myself.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
Stop gathering here.

188
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,240
If anyone tries again,

189
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,280
I'll shoot him.

190
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
Go! Go! Go!

191
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,840
Let's go.

192
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,840
Back off!

193
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,400
Step back!

194
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,480
Step back!

195
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,160
Don't let them go!

196
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't let them go!

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,549
Don't let them go!

198
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Can you ride this?

199
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
Sure.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,240
My brother taught me

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,240
in Peking.

202
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,040
What a junk!

203
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,880
Watch out!

204
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,400
They are too arrogant!

205
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,720
You must apologize to me!

206
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,200
You!

207
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,800
Qiqi!

208
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,810
What are you going to do?

209
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,960
Take care.

210
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,640
Shen Junshan?

211
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,580
Xie Liangchen?

212
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,770
What are you doing here?

213
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
Are you drying your clothes?

214
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,480
Yes.

215
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,920
I have no time

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
to do this during the day.

217
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,600
Let me help you

218
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
No, I can handle this.

219
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,080
I'm fine.

220
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,880
Thank you.

221
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,800
Well.

222
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,920
You were not here in the morning.

223
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Do you know what happened at school?

224
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,220
What happened?

225
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
Sergeant Song

226
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,960
released the three Japanese.

227
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,290
The Japanese COC sent a car to pick them up.

228
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,120
Really?

229
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,520
The students were so angry

230
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,200
that they almost fought the guards.

231
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,460
Gu Yanzhen was almost killed by Mr. Song.

232
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,540
What about you?

233
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,690
Did you get hurt?

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
I'm fine.

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
Xie Liangchen,

236
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,250
please do me a favor.

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
What's it?

238
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,520
Don't tell anyone you've seen me today.

239
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,160
OK.

240
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,920
Thank you.

241
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,160
Nothing at all.

242
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,240
Leave it to me.

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,680
Thank you.

244
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,240
Shen Junshan,

245
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,850
what were you out for today?

246
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,360
Something personal.

247
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,440
Is this a secret?

248
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,800
Kind of.

249
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,360
Then I won't tell anyone.

250
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,920
Thank you.

251
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,700
Don't be so polite.

252
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,180
You've helped me a lot.

253
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,880
And this is not a big deal.

254
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,340
Liangchen,

255
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,560
Gu Yanzhen was looking for you just now.

256
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,280
What for?

257
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,010
I don't know.

258
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,080
Junshan,

259
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,460
did you go out just now?

260
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,800
I...

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
This is my bag.

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,800
I dried it.

263
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,520
Then I'm leaving now.

264
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,240
- Bye. - Bye.

265
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,330
Let's go.

266
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,240
Junshan,

267
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,560
I was looking for you.

268
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,280
What for?

269
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,160
Follow me.

270
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,240
I'll tell you.

271
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,020
Take my bag please.

272
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,520
Hurry up.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,680
Come on.

274
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,840
Xie Liangchen!

275
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,960
Are you giving a birth?

276
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,480
Hurry up!

277
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,810
I need to use the toilet!

278
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
Come on.

279
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,200
Gu Yanzhen!

280
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Why did you throw my boots into the trash can?

281
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,680
Are they yours?

282
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,480
We live in the same room,

283
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
who else can they belong to?

284
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,160
You are so short

285
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
with such big feet?

286
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,300
None of your business!

287
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,560
You threw other people's stuff without permission.

288
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Can you be polite?

289
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,730
I threw them because

290
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,280
they looked like trash.

291
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,600
So what?

292
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,040
You!

293
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,960
Anthomaniac.

294
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,020
Liangchen,

295
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,840
what happened to you two?

296
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,800
Did they fight again?

297
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,240
I don't know.

298
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,520
May be.

299
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,680
Guys! Good news!

300
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,599
The Japanese who came to our school yesterday

301
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,930
were all burnt to death!

302
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Is that real?

303
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,720
Really?

304
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,240
Let me see.

305
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,079
What's that?

306
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,880
What happened?

307
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,339
Ji Jin, read it out!

308
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,480
The Japanese arsonist and his twenty-one fellows

309
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,440
were all burnt to death.

310
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,680
Who did this? When? Where?

311
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,880
Ji Jin,

312
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
does it answer these?

313
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,000
Wait, let me check it.

314
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,080
It doesn't say.

315
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
But it's the Minduo Newspaper

316
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,920
and it is written by Zhang Yuzhi.

317
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,840
It must be true.

318
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It can't be wrong.

319
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Now it's spreading outside.

320
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,320
Less than ten miles out of the city,

321
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,480
on the way to Wangzhuang,

322
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,640
the Japanese in the car

323
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,970
were all burnt to ashes.

324
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,120
Today's newspapers have been sold out.

325
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,880
This one

326
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,600
is borrowed from the

327
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,530
entrance guard.

328
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,660
Don't break it.

329
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,180
They burned our students,

330
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,770
and now they have become charcoal in the fire.

331
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,200
God bless us!

332
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,160
Screw it!

333
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,800
If the God really blessed us,

334
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,560
the students wouldn't have been killed.

335
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,320
I think,

336
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,010
this must be done by someone

337
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,570
who was chivalrous.

338
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,200
That's right.

339
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,680
I wonder who did this.

340
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,200
He must be a hero!

341
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,960
Ji Jin.

342
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
Give us the newspaper.

343
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,200
We want to read it too.

344
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,720
Don't snatch!

345
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,880
I borrowed it!

346
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,280
Be careful!

347
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,480
Yes.

348
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,560
Yes.

349
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,200
It's all my fault.

350
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,400
Anybody?

351
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,680
Sir.

352
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,560
Go call Lord Chengrui.

353
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,000
I want to meet him.

354
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,160
Yes, sir.

355
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Kazuo Sato is here.

356
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
That's all for today.

357
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,780
You can go home now.

358
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,680
What for?

359
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,640
Lord,

360
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
Kazuo Sato from Japanese COC

361
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
wants to see you.

362
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,260
He is waiting outside.

363
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,840
How ironic.

364
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,730
Now a business man from a small country

365
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,600
can see me at will.

366
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,080
He said he had reasons.

367
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,840
Tell him I'm not comfortable.

368
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,250
I can't deal with other things now.

369
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
My lord, your medicine.

370
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,720
Too bitter!

371
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,730
You take this for me.

372
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,080
Let me help you.

373
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,460
It's more bitter to drink spoon by spoon.

374
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,240
Go find out who did that.

375
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,400
Kazuo Sato said

376
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,210
it was Shen Tingbai.

377
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,600
Don't be so sure.

378
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
The Japanese are so hated.

379
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,000
Almost all the people want to kill them.

380
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,080
Right.

381
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,400
Besides,

382
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,980
Ms. Xianrong was back.

383
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,210
When did she arrive?

384
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,240
I just got the information

385
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,370
that she has arrived in Peking.

386
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,320
Why did she come back?

387
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,000
She is Hideyuki Oda's daughter.

388
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,160
And Kazuo Sato is the retainer of Hideyuki Oda.

389
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,660
Now Kazuo Sato has messed things up in Shunyuan.

390
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,160
Maybe Ms. Xianrong

391
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,480
is back to

392
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,480
replace him now.

393
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,640
So that's another reason

394
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,360
why Mr. Sato wants to see you now.

395
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Beware of it.

396
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,680
Tell me if she arrives in Shunyuan.

397
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,240
Yes.

398
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,960
Go now.

399
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,240
Sorry, Mr. Sato.

400
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,000
Lord feels unwell

401
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
and doesn't meet visitors.

402
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,840
Please go back.

403
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,280
Well,

404
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,640
excuse me.

405
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,660
Are you looking for me?

406
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,480
Jin Xianrong?

407
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,850
Why are you here?

408
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,080
Why can't I be here?

409
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,180
Are you surprised?

410
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,600
Sure.

411
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,140
I was confused when my classmate said

412
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,970
there was a girl looking for me.

413
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,480
What do you think Shen Junshan

414
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,810
has to do with that girl?

415
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,940
That girl is so beautiful.

416
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,480
I think

417
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,320
their relationship must be special.

418
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,450
When did you arrive?

419
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,360
Not long.

420
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
I came to see you

421
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,080
as soon as I arrived in China.

422
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,330
Are you touched?

423
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I remembered that

424
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,320
you were studying medicine.

425
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,840
Why do you

426
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,800
turn to be a soldier?

427
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,400
Junshan,

428
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,920
you've changed a lot.

429
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,600
You too.

430
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,720
Why are we

431
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,460
still standing here talking?

432
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,040
What do you want to eat?

433
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,500
Choose whatever you like.

434
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,920
Then I have to think about it.

435
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,600
Ji Jin,

436
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,480
you are Junshan's best friend.

437
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
What do you think?

438
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,840
I don't know.

439
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,080
But I know that Junshan studied in Britain before.

440
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,740
Judging from the girl's dress and temperament,

441
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,090
she should be his former classmate in Great Britain.

442
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,000
Classmate?

443
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,880
Then we still

444
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,440
have the chance.

445
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,020
Let's go and say hello.

446
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Why?

447
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,160
Look,

448
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,300
we are Junshan's classmates now.

449
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,240
Now his friend is here,

450
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,680
we should go and say hello to her.

451
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
Yes.

452
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,680
You should also treat her to dinner

453
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,920
to do the honors.

454
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,360
And ask her about age,

455
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,040
family,

456
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,440
and boyfriend by the way.

457
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,080
Ji Jin,

458
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,160
I don't think he has any female friend.

459
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,760
I never saw her.

460
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,530
It's the first time.

461
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,860
How is the food?

462
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,240
It's good.

463
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,040
Junshan.

464
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,680
Tingbai!

465
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,770
You are here too.

466
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,320
This is?

467
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,840
This is my classmate in Britain, Jin Xianrong.

468
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
This is my elder brother, Shen Tingbai.

469
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,520
And this is his fiancee, Qu Manting.

470
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,420
Hey, stop making fun of me.

471
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,920
I'm not his fiancée

472
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,240
Aren't you?

473
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,360
Sure, I'm not.

474
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,880
Fine.

475
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,280
This is Ms. Qu Manting,

476
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,400
not my brother's fiancee.

477
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,200
Screw you!

478
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,600
Ms. Jin,

479
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,890
nice to meet you.

480
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,280
Nice to meet you, Mr. Shen.

481
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,740
I've heard a lot about you.

482
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,280
How do you know me

483
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,720
when you just arrived in China?

484
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,960
My father and brother

485
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
are doing business in China.

486
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,440
They often mentioned you.

487
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,040
I wonder who they are?

488
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,400
They used to live in Peking

489
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,050
and just moved to Shunyuan.

490
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,640
You must not know them.

491
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,640
What a pity.

492
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,440
It doesn't matter.

493
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,370
I'm in China now.

494
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,800
There will be many chances for us to meet.

495
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,560
Well,

496
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,250
come and visit my family

497
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,160
whenever you have time.

498
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,720
I'm Junshan's friend.

499
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,080
You don't need to call me Ms. Jin.

500
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,040
Just call me Xianrong.

501
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,490
Then don't call me Mr. Shen from now on.

502
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,880
Just call me Tingbai

503
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,940
like Junshan does.

504
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,820
Okay, Tingbai.

505
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,800
So Mr. Shen

506
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,560
and Ms. Jin,

507
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,120
are we done here?

508
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,930
I got something to do. See you soon.

509
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,500
Let me walk you.

510
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,760
Sorry.

511
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,330
Then we're leaving now.

512
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Bye.

513
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,340
Don't touch me!

514
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,040
See you.

515
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,400
Xianrong,

516
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,940
have a seat.

517
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,720
Ms. Qu

518
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,650
doesn't seem to like your brother.

519
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,290
That will be better.

520
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,010
I don't like her either.

521
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,880
But your brother seems to like her a lot.

522
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
Love is a thing

523
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,320
that is easy to come and go.

524
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,200
Especially one-sided love.

525
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,460
It won't last long.

526
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,560
My brother is smart.

527
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,940
He will know it.

528
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,700
You seem to understand love well.

529
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,130
Isn't that true?

530
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,010
This varies from person to person.

531
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,200
The tougher the person,

532
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,920
the more likely he is to be stubborn.

533
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Love is difficult to define.

534
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
What are you laughing at?

535
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,800
Nothing.

536
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,480
Do you think I've changed a lot?

537
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,500
Nearly four years have passed

538
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,450
since the last meeting.

539
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,840
Four years

540
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,100
are enough to change someone's life.

541
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,680
I hope you haven't changed so much.

542
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,740
I like the Jin Xianrong you used to be.

543
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,920
Then I have to think about

544
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,650
what Jin Xianrong looked like before.

545
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,800
How long are you going to stay this time?

546
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,730
I don't know.

547
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
I may stay a long time.

548
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,130
There are many things to do.

549
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,440
What are they?

550
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Business and personal affairs.

551
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,920
Fine.

552
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,400
Tell me if you need any help.

553
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,720
Sure.

554
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
You are my only friend in China.

555
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
I'm happy to help you.

556
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,400
And I will ask for your help if necessary.

557
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,960
Cheers.

558
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,120
Could I send you home?

559
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
No. I didn't even see my family

560
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,400
before I came to meet you.

561
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,480
My family must be waiting for me.

562
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,560
You can walk me home

563
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
if you want to.

564
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,140
But you should be responsible

565
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,040
if they misunderstand that.

566
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,320
It's coming.

567
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,440
Don't think that I'm satisfied with only a meal.

568
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
Not simple like that.

569
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,210
Go home and have a good rest.

570
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,280
Bye.

571
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,200
Bye.

572
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,560
Ms. Oda.

573
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,930
Let's start.

574
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,800
Ms. Oda.

575
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,760
What do you mean by this?

576
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,650
I've done it so thoroughly.

577
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,580
Haven't you understood what I meant yet?

578
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,920
My father meant that

579
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,120
I took over everything here.

580
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,320
You and your family should go back to Japan now.

581
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,130
This letter is from my father.

582
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,340
You can read it if you are interested.

583
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,040
And the tickets are ready,

584
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,650
you can leave tomorrow.

585
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,040
How could you?

586
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,640
I have established everything here.

587
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,920
Without me,

588
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,200
the place will be still under Russian control.

589
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,640
What are you?

590
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,000
I'll go find General Kawajima

591
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,120
and Mr. Oda.

592
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,260
I don't believe it.

593
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,200
I will never believe that

594
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,160
Mr. Oda would hand his family

595
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,320
over to a girl

596
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,480
who can only play around.

597
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,280
I have given you a chance.

598
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,460
If you do something wrong,

599
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,520
you have to pay the price.

600
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,360
This is the whole story.

601
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,740
The police have been investigating.

602
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,120
But they didn't find

603
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,650
any evidence of Shen Tingbai's involvement.

604
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
We also made an undercover investigation,

605
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,260
but didn't find anything either.

606
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,040
The direction is wrong.

607
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,770
Of course nothing can be found.

608
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,360
You mean...

609
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,020
Kazuo Sato is not an idiot.

610
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,680
Before he did this,

611
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,120
he must have known that Shen Tingbai would retaliate.

612
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,920
So he must have kept an eye on him.

613
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,240
He was so crazy about it.

614
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,080
He wouldn't let it go

615
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,010
if he found anything related to it.

616
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,720
But he has no action,

617
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,400
so it can't be Shen Tingbai.

618
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,600
Maybe Shen Tingbai did it so secretly

619
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,610
that no one has noticed yet.

620
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,720
No matter how secretive he was,

621
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,920
there couldn't be no any doubtful point

622
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,440
under Kazuo Sato's surveillance.

623
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,600
If so,

624
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,560
it will be harder to find out.

625
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,360
There are many suspects in Shunyuan

626
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,240
who could do it.

627
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,050
But we still have to.

628
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,480
The accident happened less than half an hour

629
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,240
after they got out of the Academy.

630
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,900
It should have been prepared.

631
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,900
He must have followed them from the Academy.

632
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,120
Well.

633
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,960
Find some people to disguise as journalists,

634
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,690
and ask the vendors and pedestrians on the street

635
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
about if anyone has ever seen the car

636
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,850
and the people in it.

637
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,340
Besides, although the car

638
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,120
was badly damaged,

639
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,490
it's still worth checking.

640
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,960
Go find a specialist

641
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,520
to search the model and factory of it.

642
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,850
And where it is from.

643
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,000
This kind of car couldn't come from

644
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,360
an ordinary civil organization.

645
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
And after that

646
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,400
they even didn't take the damaged car away.

647
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,480
But they blew up the car instead.

648
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Obviously, they were short of hands

649
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,640
and had no one to help.

650
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,120
Yes.

651
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,920
And the students in the Academy,

652
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,100
especially those who made trouble that day.

653
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,420
Go find out their family background.

654
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,240
Focus on those who are wealthy,

655
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,240
know how to drive,

656
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,300
and have anti-Japanese sentiments.

657
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,240
Yes.

658
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,080
Besides,

659
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,210
you dress up as a Chinese businessman.

660
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,240
Find a radical newspaper

661
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,880
to publish an article

662
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,560
about finding those patriots.

663
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,380
Anyone who provides information

664
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,720
will be rewarded.

665
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,880
Yes.

666
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,640
My father and the leaders

667
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,240
of the army are very concerned about this.

668
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,040
We must find the murderer.

669
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,520
Better to be a mistake

670
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,360
than to let it go.

671
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,680
Is that clear?

672
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,640
Yes.

673
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,200
Go.

674
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,000
Yes.

675
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,720
Again.

676
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,560
Kids,

677
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,960
you have been here for the whole night.

678
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,360
I changed it to plum juice for you.

679
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,840
Go back home after you finish it.

680
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,560
Can I

681
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,880
have a glass of wine?

682
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,040
No way.

683
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,060
You are kids and can't drink wine.

684
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,160
Go back home early after it.

685
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,760
You parents must be worried.

686
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,600
We've been here for so long,

687
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,720
and have drunk so much of it.

688
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,480
Qiqi,

689
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
when can we stop drinking?

690
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,100
I followed him a long way that day,

691
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,080
and he disappeared near here.

692
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,080
According to his age,

693
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,440
I guessed he must be a student

694
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,210
of the Academy like my brother.

695
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,360
We should

696
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,040
keep waiting for him here

697
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,840
and we can meet him sooner or later.

698
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,480
Student of the Arsenal Military Academy?

699
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Then you should go ask your brother.

700
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,250
Don't wait here any longer.

701
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,000
We can't talk to others about it.

702
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,600
Now the police station, the Japanese,

703
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,650
so many people are looking for him.

704
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,810
My brother can't keep a secret.

705
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,600
I don't trust him.

706
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,440
So why do you want to find him?

707
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,440
What will you say if you find him?

708
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,040
I don't know.

709
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,720
I just

710
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,880
want to see him.

711
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,920
I think he is like

712
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,160
the hero in the legendary.

713
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,760
Brave.

714
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,800
Righteous.

715
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,130
Full of the chivalrous.

716
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,840
Forget it.

717
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
I'll have another drink.

718
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,720
Welcome, Mr. Gu.

719
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,440
Come in.

720
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,300
My brother is here!

721
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,480
What would you like to drink?

722
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,240
Whiskey.

723
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,920
Let's go now!

724
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,840
Let's go!

725
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:22,970
Hurry up!

726
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,080
Are you all right?

727
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,280
Are you blind?

728
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,940
What's wrong with her?

729
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,440
I'm fine.

730
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Kids,

731
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,380
you shouldn't have come here.

732
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,720
Take the money to buy some sweets for yourself.

733
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,520
I'm sorry.

734
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,650
You seem to be in a good mood.

735
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,200
Is it about Miss Jin?

736
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,840
Nonsense. We are just friends.

737
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,920
All great love

738
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,240
- begins with being friends. - It's him!

739
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:33,720
It's him!

740
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,580
He is the one I told you yesterday!

741
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,440
The one you said yesterday...

742
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,240
Hush.

743
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,690
Let's get out first.

744
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,920
Let's go.
