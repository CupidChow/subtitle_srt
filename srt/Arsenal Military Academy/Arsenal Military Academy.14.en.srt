Episode 14

4
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,670
Come out now.

5
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,470
Open the door.

6
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,280
Open the door.

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,759
Come out. Open the door.

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,280
Come to explain to us.

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,680
Come out.

10
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,920
Come out.

11
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,759
Come out.

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Come out.

13
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,360
Don't hide inside.

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,160
What you did is extremely immoral.

15
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,890
Come out now.

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,920
You beasts.

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
You'll pay for it with your lives.

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,240
Look.

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,170
Come out now.

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,680
Look at it.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
-Give us justice. -Take a photo.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,000
Come! Come!

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
A life for a life.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,760
Look. What's wrong?

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,690
Why there's no one dealing with it?

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,360
Come out now!

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,600
Come out.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,079
Come out.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,160
Come. Now!

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,640
Mei.

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Come.

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
Come out.

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,200
Miss,

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,720
we are journalists. Can I interview you?

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Why are you kowtowing here?

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Are you a family of the victim?

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,640
Why don't you come there

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
if you really want an explanation?

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
The murderer was not from Shunyuan COC.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,800
It was a Japanese.

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,680
You've got it wrong.

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,640
Why do you say that?

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,079
What do you know?

44
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,560
Who are you? What's your relation with the victim?

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,440
Are you a member of Shunyuan COC?

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,360
I don't know. I know nothing.

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,079
Please. Miss.

48
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,120
I don't know. Miss.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,600
Miss.

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,290
Let's go.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,360
Look.

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,480
Come out.

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,010
Come out now.

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,240
Wu Bin?

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,760
Sir.

56
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Sir.

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
Can you tell something to us?

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,400
Sir.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Sir, are you a member of this family?

60
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,960
No, I'm not.

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,290
My surname is not Wu.

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
I am just a gatekeeper.

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
Gatekeeper?

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,060
Please tell something to us, sir.

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
I really don't know.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,040
I've worked here for less than half a year.

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,360
Who knows this family

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,200
did such hideous business?

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,320
Well, sir.

70
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,440
Don't be scared.

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,540
I am a journalist from Light News.

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,490
I come to ask for some information.

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,560
Journalist?

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,079
You have come here many times.

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,440
I have told you that

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,920
I know nothing.

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,880
Sir, sir.

78
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,000
Could you tell me,

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,600
do you know Chairman Shen of Shuanyuan COC?

80
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,079
I am just a gatekeeper.

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
How can I know a chairman?

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
Sir, please have a look.

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,100
We have a photo.

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,040
This is him.

85
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
Do you know him?

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,800
No.

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,480
Sir.

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,320
Who often come here?

89
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,400
Women.

90
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,080
And their fair-weather friends.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,160
Sir.

92
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
Anyone else?

93
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,360
And some Japanese speakers.

94
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,320
-Japanese? -They always come at night. -Record it.

95
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Japanese?

96
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,880
They were in robes

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,240
when they came.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,200
They spoke Japanese.

99
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,400
I don't know whether they are Japanese or Chinese.

100
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,360
Good morning.

101
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,440
Morning.

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,800
You came back at daybreak.

103
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,330
Why don't you sleep longer?

104
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,440
The presses who supported us

105
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,560
have changed their minds

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,490
since Zhang Yuzhi had died.

107
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,920
Our enemy did such thing menacingly

108
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,320
with accuracy and speed.

109
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,600
It seems that the new chairman of the Japanese COC

110
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
has some tactics.

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,040
It was a nice time when Sato was in office.

112
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,970
We lived a better life at that time.

113
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
Do you need my help?

114
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
No.

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
If negotiation works,

116
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,960
leave the force.

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
I am a decent businessman.

118
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,920
Yes.

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,580
A decent businessman.

120
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,040
I'll go back to school after breakfast.

121
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Go back early.

122
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,810
Take care in school.

123
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,560
Ben.

124
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,540
What's going on at the COC?

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
People have gone.

126
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,360
They've gone?

127
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,480
You'll know it on the newspaper.

128
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,180
God knows where they got these information,

129
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,200
but they have done us a big favor.

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,300
Someone is helping us.

131
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,720
But not them.

132
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,960
You haven't finished your lunch.

133
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,820
I won't have it.

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
Ben. Take my clothes.

135
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,840
Mr. Tao.

136
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,960
Ticket,

137
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,720
address,

138
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
money and recommendation letter

139
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,520
are here.

140
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,320
You can go there when you get to Shanghai.

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,240
Tell them

142
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
Miss Qu recommended you.

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,200
Thanks, Mr. Tao.

144
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,360
Thanks, Miss Qu.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,930
You're welcome.

146
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,560
You also helped us.

147
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,960
Please.

148
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,280
Don't come.

149
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,080
Please.

150
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,960
I don't know.

151
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,000
I know nothing.

152
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,800
I know nothing.

153
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,500
What are you doing?

154
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,800
You are facing journalists,

155
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,080
not rapists.

156
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm sorry. Sorry.

157
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,440
You need to perform with your feelings.

158
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
With feelings. Do you understand?

159
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,340
Now your character is Wu Bin's lover.

160
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,240
Your lover

161
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
was a trafficker.

162
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
He was an evil with a lot of sin.

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
He killed everyone,

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
but treated you very well.

165
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,080
He died now,

166
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,040
but the real criminal is at large.

167
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,240
And the police

168
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,120
is punishing the innocent.

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,800
How do you feel now?

170
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,760
Grieved.

171
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,680
And?

172
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
I'm angry.

173
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,080
What else?

174
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,480
Scared.

175
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,600
Right.

176
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,200
Scared,

177
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,680
grieved,

178
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
angry

179
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,159
and a bit reconciled.

180
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,420
Put yourself into this story.

181
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,520
OK.

182
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm grieved.

183
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm angry.

184
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm scared.

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,440
OK. I know.

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,400
I'll perform another time.

187
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,330
Please take time

188
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,840
to calm down.

189
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,360
Take a photo now.

190
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
And come back to perform later.

191
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,320
OK.

192
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,080
Go. Go.

193
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,120
You are so professional.

194
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
Where is Wu Bin? Is he ready?

195
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Yes. Yes.

196
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,000
Manting.

197
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,850
He doesn't look like Wu Bin.

198
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,280
Not too bad.

199
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,760
No...

200
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,789
The picture was very bloody on the newspaper.

201
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,450
We can't even see his feature.

202
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,440
Where is the photographer?

203
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Photographer!

204
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,680
Come.

205
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,880
Miss Qu.

206
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,120
Take a photo of this man.

207
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,650
Only his profile is enough.

208
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,800
Make it a little blurred.

209
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
I see.

210
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,080
Go.

211
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,010
This way please.

212
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
When the photo comes out, tell them

213
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320
his forehead is not like Wu Bin's.

214
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,560
Let them cover the forehead

215
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,680
to make it like an old photo.

216
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,160
Don't make it like a new one. Do you know?

217
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,640
Rest assured.

218
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
I asked the master in Baohua to help.

219
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,640
Next one.

220
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,800
Next one.

221
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,640
Here I am.

222
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,640
What will you play?

223
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,250
I will be playing the housekeeper.

224
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,040
House...

225
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,200
Sir, is your character a gatekeeper?

226
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
What gate?

227
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,320
Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper. Sir.

228
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Will I be paid?

229
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,880
Yes. Yes.

230
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,160
OK. Alright.

231
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,290
As long as you pay me.

232
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,450
Do you remember your lines?

233
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,280
Yes.

234
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,520
You can start.

235
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
I know nothing.

236
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,560
I've worked here for less than half a year.

237
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,560
I don't know anyone.

238
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,840
I...

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Cut!

240
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,560
You are not supposed to just recite the lines.

241
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
Put your feelings in it.

242
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
What feelings?

243
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
You are scared!

244
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,520
You want to make it clear with this family.

245
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,580
Aren't you scared?

246
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,360
You have been working

247
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,360
for such a family,

248
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,560
it makes you ashamed.

249
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,680
But you should show your kindness and honesty.

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,320
Then the audiences are more likely to believe it.

251
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,800
I can perform to be honest.

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,280
But I'm not scared.

253
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,540
Sir, we are just cheating others.

254
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,890
If we are exposed by others,

255
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,840
you will be put in prison.

256
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,100
Are you scared?

257
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
No.

258
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,240
Great.

259
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,450
Don't expect to get a penny from me.

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm scared.

261
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm scared.

262
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Another time.

263
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,920
Manting.

264
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,640
He has left.

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,640
Have you contacted Manager Huang?

266
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,400
Yes.

267
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,720
You know what.

268
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,090
That's miraculous.

269
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,890
I read newspapers at a cafe.

270
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,040
What you guessed is

271
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,680
almost right.

272
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
Shunyuan city

273
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,200
is not big,

274
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
but it has dozens of presses.

275
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
There are many

276
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,640
reports everyday.

277
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,160
Even Minduo News was used

278
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,360
to report news without investigation.

279
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Not to mention these small presses.

280
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,040
People gathering at the door of Shunyuan COC have gone.

281
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,500
Few journalists are left.

282
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,880
Most of the families of victims

283
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
are waiting in front of the police station.

284
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
But, several newspapers say

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
these are Mr. Shen' s tricks

286
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,400
to cover his sin.

287
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,520
It's not strange.

288
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,050
Let them say what they want.

289
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
They didn't get the news,

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,280
so of course they would analyse the thing

291
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,640
from another view.

292
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
It is not hideous that there are voices,

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,530
but there is only one voice.

294
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
Let them guess around.

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
Everything is possible.

296
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,600
Compared to a patriotic Chinese businessman,

297
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,320
people are more likely to hope

298
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,440
the conspirator

299
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,970
is the brutal Japanese.

300
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,520
Great.

301
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,080
I have been in this industry for many years.

302
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,560
This is not the worst.

303
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm not scared of them on such things.

304
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,440
Hello?

305
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,840
Mr. Shen comes.

306
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
He comes to thank me.

307
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,920
Let him in.

308
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,460
Liangchen.

309
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,800
You are working so hard these days.

310
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
Always practicing more.

311
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,880
Otherwise I will be the last one every time.

312
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,720
That's embarrassing.

313
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,880
I should say thank you for

314
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,480
practicing with me every time.

315
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,160
No worries.

316
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,560
A good way to kill time.

317
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,280
Go back and take a shower.

318
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,520
Have a good rest.

319
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,560
OK.

320
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,960
I'll go in now.

321
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,400
OK.

322
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,440
Have a good rest.

323
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,680
Oh no!

324
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,960
No water?

325
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,320
Liangchen.

326
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
What are you doing?

327
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,680
Water supply was cut off when I was washing my hair.

328
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,720
Do you still have water?

329
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Wait a moment. I'll check it.

330
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,180
I don't have water as well.

331
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
What can I do?

332
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,740
Go to the public bathroom.

333
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
The water is offered a whole day there.

334
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,200
Public bathroom?

335
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,450
What are you waiting for? Go there.

336
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,060
Is anyone here?

337
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,640
Is anyone here?

338
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,440
You are back.

339
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,760
I read the newspaper.

340
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,160
The problem of your family has been settled?

341
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,240
The innocent is the innocent.

342
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,500
We shouldn't have been involved in this.

343
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,120
The innocent is the innocent.

344
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,380
We shouldn't have been involved in this.

345
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,080
What's wrong with him?

346
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,900
Huang Song.

347
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,290
Where is Xie Liangchen?

348
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,200
He is taking a shower.

349
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,210
At the public bathroom?

350
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,520
Yes.

351
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,160
The water supply is cut off at our dormitory.

352
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,880
Shen Junshan went to the public bathroom as well.

353
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,680
Shen Junshan went there as well?

354
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,540
Xie Liangchen?

355
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,360
It's you?

356
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,760
Gosh!

357
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,240
Are you kidding me?

358
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,210
I'm sure that I locked the door.

359
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,450
What should I do?

360
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,640
Run?

361
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,560
No.

362
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,440
I will pass him if I run.

363
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,840
I'll be seen.

364
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
Wait for him to leave?

365
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
Jesus!

366
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
He will find out if he looks this way.

367
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,800
I must die anyway.

368
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,200
Are you alright?

369
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,600
Nothing.

370
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,770
It's little hot.

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
I feel a kind of dizzy.

372
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,160
Dizzy?

373
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,440
I help you go out.

374
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,520
No!

375
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,320
Don't bother.

376
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,840
I'll be fine later.

377
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,360
It was not my brother who made the burst.

378
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,690
Didn't you read newspapers today?

379
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,240
Forget it.

380
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,170
These are all circumstantial.

381
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,240
Anyway, it was not my brother

382
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,560
who did it.

383
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,240
Please trust me.

384
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,240
I trust you.

385
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,920
We are friends after all.

386
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,380
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

387
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,920
I won't.

388
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,280
I never think that way.

389
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,800
That's fine.

390
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,200
Do you need me to scrub your back?

391
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,160
No!

392
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,200
What should I do?

393
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,280
What are you watching?

394
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,720
No. I'm taking a shower.

395
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
Have you watched enough?

396
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,090
Who is watching you?

397
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,320
Can't I stand here?

398
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,200
You are taking a shower with your clothes on?

399
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,920
Yes.

400
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,800
I like taking a shower with my clothes on.

401
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
I like it.

402
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,840
Crazy guy.

403
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,160
Be quick.

404
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,820
It's so hot.

405
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,010
Aren't you afraid to have a sunstroke?

406
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Who is out there?

407
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,480
Is someone out there?

408
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,280
Is someone out there?

409
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,050
I am Li Wenzhong.

410
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,600
Open the door for me.

411
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,680
I am locked inside.

412
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Can't you open it?

413
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,720
Just stamp the door from outside.

414
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,380
You can stamp it from outside.

415
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,240
Where are you going?

416
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,480
Are you going to get the key?

417
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,680
Please be right back.

418
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,080
I'm waiting for you here.

419
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,480
Please be right back.

420
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,340
He's really a good friend.

421
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,700
You have known it for long, right?

422
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,240
Not for long.

423
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280
Alright.

424
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,610
I have known it for long.

425
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,400
How did you know it?

426
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,560
Did you...

427
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,480
Did you...

428
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,060
What do you want to say?

429
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,800
Did you peep me?

430
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,080
Who peeped you?

431
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,920
Is your figure worthy of my peeping?

432
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,800
Shut up.

433
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,460
I'll stop here.

434
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,800
Except you,

435
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,680
does anyone else know it?

436
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
I'm asking you.

437
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,040
You asked me to shut up.

438
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,440
Gu Yanzhen.

439
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,520
Alright.

440
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,440
Do you have to look like

441
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,450
that I did something to you?

442
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,920
Actually,

443
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,280
you should be nice to me.

444
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,880
Also,

445
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,250
it was not me who asked you to come here.

446
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
As a girl,

447
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,640
you dress like a boy at the Military Academy

448
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,040
and live in a dorm with me.

449
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,680
Coincidentally, we met before.

450
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,760
How do I know what your attempt is?

451
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
Under such situation, I didn't expose you.

452
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,780
Shouldn't you be grateful for me?

453
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,240
I have attempt on you?

454
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,620
Actually you don't have to be shy.

455
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,460
Many women have attempt on me.

456
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,640
But few of them

457
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,300
put it into practice like you.

458
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,760
You have been lukewarm

459
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,280
to me these days,

460
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,240
but

461
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,930
I know this is your tragedy.

462
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,760
Play hard-to-get. I know.

463
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,400
This is what you girls like.

464
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I am right?

465
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
Look, you are laughing.

466
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,280
Actually,

467
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,460
you don't need to take the chance.

468
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
You can tell me straightly

469
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
if you have attempt on me.

470
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,040
Don't be shy.

471
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,240
Please let me finish.

472
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,400
I am a reasonable person.

473
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,800
In fact, the thing that happened today

474
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,400
is not bad for you.

475
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
We don't need to keep secrets to each other.

476
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Tell me what you want.

477
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Of course,

478
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,040
I may refuse you.

479
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,920
After all, we should be careful on

480
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,480
the flesh and marriage.

481
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,660
What are you doing?

482
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,770
What are you doing? Xie Liangchen.

483
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,020
What are you doing?

484
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,080
Are you crazy?

485
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
You are too young.

486
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,160
Gu Yanzhen.

487
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Gu Yanzhen!

488
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,160
Gu Yanzhen!

489
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,800
Shut up. I am here.

490
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,000
What's up, beauty?

491
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
Who is there?

492
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm here to meet Gu Yanzhen.

493
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,960
Who are you?

494
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,480
I am Gu Yanzhen.

495
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,680
You are really cheeky.

496
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,760
Ask Gu Yanzhen to come down.

497
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,680
You are having fun of me?

498
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,010
Do you dare to come down?

499
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,240
Ji Jin.

500
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,400
The beauty says that.

501
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,240
Don't make her too embarrassed.

502
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Right. Ji Jin.

503
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
If you have gut, go down.

504
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,560
The beauty has gut,

505
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,650
but I don't have.

506
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,200
Who of you has gut

507
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,280
can go down to check for me.

508
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,000
You go down.

509
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,600
I don't dare.

510
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,660
I am not Gu Yanzhen.

511
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,400
My god. She comes up.

512
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,660
The beauty comes to me.

513
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,280
Ji Jin, you are really fortunate.

514
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,540
Go, let's receive her.

515
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,330
She really comes up.

516
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Hello, I am...

517
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,240
Celebrity!

518
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,320
Where is Gu Yanzhen?

519
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,040
Gu Yanzhen?

520
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,400
I can't make it clear with you.

521
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,660
Where do you want to go?

522
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,600
What? What's your problem?.

523
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,800
Gu Yanzhen is there.

524
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,160
Gu Yanzhen!

525
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,920
Open the door!

526
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,970
Can someone strong stamp it for me?

527
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,920
Who will take the responsibility if it's broken?

528
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,640
I will.

529
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,400
Hurry.

530
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,530
Why do you come to me?

531
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,520
You...

532
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Are you all right?

533
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
I am all right.

534
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,600
If you don't ask me here,

535
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,640
I would kill him

536
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,370
I'm not talking about this.

537
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,090
Well, what are you going to talk about?

538
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,880
Forget it.

539
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,320
I won't ask.

540
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,050
What on earth do you want to say?

541
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,560
I'm here to tell you that

542
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,160
I'll give a charity show at Paramo tomorrow

543
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,320
to raise money for the family of the dead labors.

544
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,920
You are invited.

545
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,780
Why? To cover Shen Tingbai's sin?

546
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,660
How do you know?

547
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,760
It is obvious.

548
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,480
But why don't you change a place?

549
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,720
Aren't you afraid others' rumors

550
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,240
if you do such thing at his place?

551
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,440
I'm not afraid since I did nothing wrong.

552
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,080
A lot of work need to do tomorrow.

553
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,880
Come earlier.

554
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,020
Do you think there will be audiences?

555
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,440
Bumpkin.

556
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
You will know how charming and popular

557
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,320
the top-one female star is tomorrow.

558
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,400
You'll go?

559
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,800
I don't have time to talk nonsense with you.

560
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,720
It seems like I beg you to come.

561
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
You mustn't be late tomorrow.

562
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,840
Do you hear me?

563
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,520
OK.

564
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,120
Our enemies responsed quickly.

565
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,080
They used the journalists to fight back.

566
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,940
Additionally,

567
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,360
some of those sent by us

568
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
to stir up troubles

569
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,840
are missing,

570
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,170
and some are suffering.

571
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,060
The police begins to investigate

572
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,800
the identity of the labors' family.

573
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,600
It's not easy for us to disguise.

574
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,920
Our disguise just happened.

575
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,170
We didn't expect to destroy him through this.

576
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
Do you find the woman

577
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,200
who calls herself "Wu Bin's lover"?

578
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
No.

579
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,440
If she has been controlled or

580
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,720
sent out of Shunyuan by them,

581
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,160
finding her is a quite hard thing.

582
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,960
Don't give up.

583
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,420
Can't we find someone like her

584
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,360
to disguise, just like what they do?

585
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,080
The photo doesn't show the man's face clearly,

586
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,480
but the woman's face is

587
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
very clear.

588
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,000
Many journalists have seen her.

589
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,930
So it's hard to falsify.

590
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,920
They must have preparation to avoid it.

591
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,720
Is everything going well of the charity feast?

592
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,480
It's ready.

593
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,560
That celebrity

594
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,680
is influential.

595
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,120
We will lose the game if

596
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,520
Shen Tingbai explains it clearly to the public

597
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,920
with this chance.

598
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,960
I know.

599
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
She can not organize

600
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,820
this feast successfully.

601
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,720
If it's required,

602
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,440
can we

603
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,600
kill that female star?

604
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,520
It depends.

605
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,200
Don't leave future troubles

606
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
if you kill her.

607
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,000
Don't be like Sato,

608
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,080
did nothing well

609
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,280
and beaten down by others.

610
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,760
OK.

611
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,620
Do you have anything else?

612
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,320
This is the result of

613
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,520
the case of the burnt military vehicle.

614
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,280
Finally, we find

615
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,120
there is no doubt that

616
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,000
the murderer is among them.

617
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,170
If we want to confirm it,

618
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,490
they must be arrested and questioned.

619
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,760
But several of them

620
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
have special identity.

621
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,120
It's hard to arrest the alive ones.

622
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,650
It's better to kill them all

623
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,400
to comfort our dead soldiers.

624
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,440
You decide it.

625
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,640
Yes.

626
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,040
I'll leave

627
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,840
if you don't have anything else.

628
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,040
Wait a moment.

629
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
Anything else, my lady?

630
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,880
Leave this matter

631
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,680
to me.

632
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Give me all the files about this case

633
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
that you have.

634
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,260
Don't keep anything to yourself.

635
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,360
Do you understand?

636
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,150
Yes.

637
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,480
What's wrong?

638
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,230
Miss Qu.

639
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,670
Just now,

640
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,480
a dozen of drunk men entered.

641
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,840
They beat people when they came in,

642
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,400
and damaged all the things.

643
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
Our chefs and waiters

644
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,120
were hurt by them.

645
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,960
Drunk men?

646
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,570
How did drunk men do such thing?

647
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,969
Where is the police?

648
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,040
Did the police come?

649
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,720
Yes.

650
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,640
They took all the people.

651
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,400
The injured chefs and waiters

652
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,660
were sent to hospital.

653
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,040
But this is useless.

654
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,000
What about our dinner?

655
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,280
Manting!

656
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,120
Manting!

657
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,520
What's up?

658
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,520
The vehicle full of wine and food turned over.

659
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,240
The wine bottles were broken.

660
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,480
The food can't be cooked.

661
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,240
What happened to you?

662
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,360
A car crashed into us suddenly.

663
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:21,960
Also,

664
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,160
when I took the tram here

665
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,290
to deliver the costumes and the props,

666
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,360
the bag was burning

667
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
with no reason.

668
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,340
The costumes were all burned.

669
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,520
Alright.

670
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,620
Seems that they did it on purpose.

671
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,040
So

672
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,240
what should we do now?

673
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,460
The dinner will begin within 4 hours.

674
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,720
Well,

675
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,040
now

676
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,920
I'll call

677
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,400
the other restaurants to

678
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,640
borrow some staff.

679
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,320
OK. Do it.

680
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,160
Go.

681
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,980
It must be the Japanese who did it.

682
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,530
Luckily, the dancers are not injured.

683
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,600
Clean here now.

684
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,760
When the helpers come,

685
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
we still have time to prepare.

686
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,440
OK.

687
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,000
Miss Qu.

688
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,410
What's going on?

689
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,060
They thought of our solution.

690
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,320
Some people made a mess

691
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,050
at the restaurants close to us.

692
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,600
They are busy enough now.

693
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,640
Also,

694
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,460
all of the dancers that I chose for you

695
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,560
can't come tonight.

696
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
What should we do now?

697
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,080
Perhaps,

698
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,000
I can make more calls.

699
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,880
Don't bother.

700
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,050
They can think of what you think of.

701
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,360
Do I get to a wrong place?

702
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,040
The scene is big.

703
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,600
Mr. Gu.

704
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,320
Some people made troubles in the afternoon.

705
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,050
They broke all the things here.

706
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,370
So will you fail to have your feast?

707
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,890
Then I'll leave.

708
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,480
You can't.

709
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,220
We must have the feast.

710
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,200
You should think of an idea

711
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,880
to help me.

712
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,840
So at this very moment,

713
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,440
do you have some good advice?

714
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,080
Go to borrow chefs.

715
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,160
You can borrow some

716
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,200
from the small restaurants.

717
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
I don't believe all chefs in Shunyuan

718
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,060
were sent to hospital.

719
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,320
Also,

720
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,200
ask someone to buy wine sets,

721
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,040
cutlery, tables, chairs

722
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,160
and all the things needed for a feast.

723
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,090
I'll try my best.

724
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,280
Tao,

725
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,320
hurry to buy things.

726
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,880
Food and wine.

727
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,680
It doesn't matter how much it costs..

728
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,440
Yang,

729
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,900
bring my clothes and jewelries from my home.

730
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,080
Wait.

731
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,050
We don't have enough staff.

732
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,480
Who will make the cleaning?

733
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
We don't even have waiters at night.

734
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,320
Why are you looking at me?

735
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,370
I was hurt severely.

736
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,320
Don't expect me to clean.

737
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,000
You don't have class today, do you?

738
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
Ask some students to help.

739
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,560
Your school motto is

740
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,840
"Be united and protect our nation".

741
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,440
Tell them, there is a chance.

742
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,800
Yang,

743
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
come to Tan Xiaojun.

744
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,120
Ask her to find some

745
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,000
pretty girls from her school.

746
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
Those who perform on the stage can't be ugly.

747
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,240
Go.

748
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
OK. Manting.

749
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,640
So... I...

750
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,000
Go now.

751
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
Go.

752
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,760
Go.

753
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,060
So what will you do?

754
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,480
I'm sitting here to wait for these bastards.

755
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,120
I'll use my gun to kill those who

756
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,560
come to make troubles.

757
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,600
What? He has known that...

758
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,080
you are a girl?

759
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,560
Goodness!

760
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,090
Can you make your voice low?

761
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,640
Why are you so careless?

762
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,400
What will you do next?

763
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,560
I don't know.

764
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,560
So...

765
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,000
How about you go back to Peking

766
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,960
during the winter break

767
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
and never go back.

768
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,080
I can't do that.

769
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,520
What?.

770
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,440
Now that he has known it,

771
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,640
how can you disguise?

772
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,960
Only he knows.

773
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,680
It's more dangerous.

774
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,640
Think of it.

775
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,180
He didn't tell at first, so

776
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,800
he must have his intentions.

777
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,640
He won't.

778
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,440
He is really annoying,

779
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,160
but he can't...

780
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,020
Everyone is good in your opinion.

781
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,160
I have my own standards.

782
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,640
Stop talking rubbish!

783
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,720
Everyone knows Gu Yanzhen is a playboy.

784
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,480
Indeed, he has a wealthy family

785
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,320
and a handsome look.

786
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,080
But

787
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,000
you will suffer for the rest of your life

788
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,860
if you are with him without a name.

789
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,400
Nonsense!

790
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,560
You will pay for

791
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,890
your stubbornness.

792
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,880
Junshan?

793
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,800
Liangchen?

794
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,920
Why are you here?

795
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,370
I should ask you.

796
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,570
Why are you dressing like this?

797
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,920
Someone came to make troubles.

798
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,200
The waiters were hurt.

799
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,800
Qu Manting asks us to help.

800
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,400
And you?

801
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,400
I am a guest.
