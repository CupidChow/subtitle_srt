Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 13

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,440
Back now?

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,160
Didn't you hear me?

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,400
If I didn't intercede with Sergeant for you,

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
you would have...

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,690
Where are you going?

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,560
What?

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,479
Don't force me to it.

11
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,240
Will you go or not?

12
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,080
I won't!

13
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,800
Will you go?

14
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,960
I say no.

15
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,360
Will you?

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,480
I won't.

17
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,480
Let's have lunch at canteen.

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,000
OK.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Yanzhen.

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,840
Why Xie Liangchen hasn't arrived?

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
What is she doing?

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Stand up. I will go.

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,240
The night after tomorrow, pick me up

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,440
at half past seven in front of the hotel.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,400
Be well-dressed

26
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,280
to make you look lively.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,840
Bye.

28
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,560
Why don't you send it to him yourself?

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
Please help me to send it.

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,400
You are to go there.

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,520
We can go together.

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,610
You have nothing to do after class.

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,680
I went there in the morning,

34
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,740
so I won't go again.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,320
I bought some fruits

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,520
and a portion of porridge.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
It is said that it can relieve coughing.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
Let him take it.

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,320
You bought porridge?

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,120
You are quite good to Junshan.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,800
After all, he always takes care of me.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,600
You can go now.

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
The porridge will be cold if you arrive late.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,400
OK.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,480
Let me change my clothes first.

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,160
Thank you.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,720
Here.

48
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,040
Yours

49
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
and mine.

50
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,600
Come.

51
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,880
Have it.

52
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,600
Gu Yanzhen?

53
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,880
What are you thinking about?

54
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,970
Where is Liangchen?

55
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,040
He's at Shen Junshan's place to look after him.

56
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,840
He really has a lot of spare time.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
He should do so.

58
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,360
Shen Junshan is a patient now.

59
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,090
Does a patient have a priority?

60
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,970
It makes sense that patient has some priorities.

61
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,240
You guys. Hurry.

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,160
Here.

63
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
What?

64
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,800
Eggs.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,920
I know they are eggs.

66
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,880
I mean why do you give me eggs?

67
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,290
You ate nothing at noon.

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,720
You will be hungry.

69
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
I don't want them.

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
Gu Yanzhen, take them.

71
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Don't be shy.

72
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,159
Have them.

73
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,960
Come on.

74
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Zhu Yanlin was caught

75
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,120
by the sergeant for playing cards at dormitory.

76
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,740
The punishment is soaking in cold water.

77
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,160
Doing so under such cold weather,

78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,640
he will have a cold.

79
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,800
What?

80
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,920
What do you mean?

81
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,360
What were you saying?

82
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
Soaking in cold water under such cold weather,

83
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,680
nobody can bear it.

84
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,480
Sir.

85
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,480
Don't.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,520
Get your hands off me.

87
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,280
Don't.

88
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,120
Stop.

89
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,320
Stop.

90
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
Jump down.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,720
I...

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,320
What?

93
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,520
You are back.

94
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
I have a fever.

95
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
I am sick.

96
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,080
I'm sick.

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
So what?

98
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
I want porridge.

99
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,000
Then have it.

100
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
I want porridge.

101
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
Buy porridge if you want.

102
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Why do you tell me?

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,930
I want the porridge that you buy for me.

104
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
You buy it for me!

105
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,720
Xie Liangchen.

106
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,320
Did you hear what I said?

107
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
I did.

108
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,600
Why do you do nothing?

109
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,280
It's none of my business that you are sick.

110
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,040
Your disease must be psychosis,

111
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,840
which can't be cured by porridge.

112
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,920
Give it up.

113
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
Get up to drink water.

114
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,560
Warm water can help you recover.

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,860
It's none of your business that I'm sick.

116
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,040
Whatever.

117
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,100
Do you think I want to take care of you?

118
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,280
Why didn't you go in?

119
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,320
The ward is too small.

120
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,520
The air won't be good with many people.

121
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,720
You think too much.

122
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,160
Junshan has been almost recovered.

123
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,520
He can go back to school next week.

124
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,200
Really?

125
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,580
That's wonderful.

126
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,400
Why do you buy one more?

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
For yourself?

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Are you better?

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,060
Let me have a check.

130
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
You still have a fever.

131
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,520
Get up to have medicine.

132
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
Do you have medicine?

133
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,480
Yes.

134
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,240
Today I bought

135
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,960
febrifuge.

136
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,220
Come to have medicine.

137
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,690
How can I have medicine with an empty stomach?

138
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,400
I bought porridge.

139
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,160
Get up to eat.

140
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,000
I won't eat what Shen Junshan doesn't want.

141
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,240
That's not...

142
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,960
Whatever. Leave it.

143
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,340
I can't open it.

144
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
Is it a little cold?

145
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,600
No.

146
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,040
No?

147
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,960
Let me check it.

148
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,000
No.

149
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,120
I said no.

150
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
It's a little cold.

151
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,320
I'll warm it up in kitchen.

152
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
It's not cold.

153
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
Your illness will be severer

154
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,680
if you have cold food.

155
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I must have it.

156
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,040
Whatever.

157
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,520
I bought apples today.

158
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,440
Do you want one?

159
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,220
Let me wash one for you.

160
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,240
You don't want it?

161
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Don't forget to have medicine.

162
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,770
I'll have a wash now.

163
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,880
The class is over.

164
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,320
Thank you, sir.

165
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,080
Stop looking.

166
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,560
I didn't do it on purpose.

167
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,440
Thanks.

168
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,370
You are welcome.

169
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,620
What's wrong with you?

170
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
Junshan, wait for me!

171
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,640
Wenzhong.

172
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,240
How are you feeling these days?

173
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
Much better.

174
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,960
You

175
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,520
just escaped a disaster.

176
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,890
Luckily, you didn't go to the timber mill.

177
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,520
I'm so regretful for missing

178
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,720
such an exciting thing.

179
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,780
You will have a chance.

180
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,040
By the way,

181
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
we'll have a health examination this afternoon.

182
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,850
Have you heard of it?

183
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
Health examination?

184
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,120
Yes.

185
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
I don't know that.

186
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,680
A free examination of the Peace Hospital.

187
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,560
It is said that all of us should go.

188
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,680
I heard it when I passed the health centre.

189
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,120
We made a health examination when

190
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
we entered the school, didn't we?

191
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,120
What's wrong?

192
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,800
Nothing. Let's go.

193
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,560
Go.

194
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,960
We have intense strength training,

195
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,360
so it's better for us to have another check.

196
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,280
There is no harm that we have it more times.

197
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,920
Right.

198
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,280
Xie Liangchen.

199
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,720
It's time for examination. Where are you going?

200
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,380
I have something to deal with.

201
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,840
Stop.

202
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,290
Where are you going?

203
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,040
I have to go out

204
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,880
for something urgent.

205
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,410
Do you have a note for leave?

206
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,360
No.

207
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,370
You are not allowed without a note.

208
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,120
I really have something urgent.

209
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
Sergeant Lv and Sergeant Guo are not here.

210
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
I can't find them.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
Can you let me out now and

212
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
I give you the note after I'm back?

213
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,600
No.

214
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,330
You are not permitted to go out.

215
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,560
Sir,

216
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,800
please let me out.

217
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,920
Don't waste your time.

218
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,780
There is no chance that you go out.

219
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,520
Sergeant Guo.

220
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,840
Sergeant Guo.

221
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
A student has something.

222
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,120
What?

223
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,700
He wants to ask for a leave.

224
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,720
What's the reason?

225
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,300
He says urgent thing happened in his family.

226
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,840
Your family is in Peking, isn't it?

227
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
It's my friend's family.

228
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,760
There's something urgent in my friend's family.

229
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Look,

230
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,920
don't ask for a leave

231
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,720
if you don't have serious things.

232
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,960
The Peace Hospital

233
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,520
must be outlandish.

234
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,960
It will do the free examination

235
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,000
for all of you.

236
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,560
And they sent a lot of

237
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,720
mixed files.

238
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,560
How about

239
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,200
you help me

240
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,680
to sort these files

241
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,620
and send the files to them?

242
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,960
Sir,

243
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,440
I really have something urgent.

244
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,600
I'll give you the note

245
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,080
after finishing the works.

246
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,920
Sir.

247
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,680
Alright.

248
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,400
It's a deal.

249
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,040
Bye.

250
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,680
Sergeant Guo.

251
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,200
Sir.

252
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,520
These are the files of the students.

253
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,600
OK, put them here.

254
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,480
It's time for the examination.

255
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,760
Where are you going?

256
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,900
What are you doing?

257
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,320
Line here.

258
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,200
Be quiet.

259
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Line here.

260
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
Move forward.

261
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
So many items?

262
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,600
Yes.

263
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,960
Gu Yanzhen.

264
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Gu Yanzhen.

265
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
Is Gu Yanzhen here?

266
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,560
Sir,

267
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,040
Gu Yanzhen is not here.

268
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,240
Maybe he went to the toilet.

269
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,890
Went to the toilet?

270
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,920
He must be

271
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
sleeping at the dormitory.

272
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
What are you laughing for?

273
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,880
You

274
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,800
find him back.

275
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,560
Yes, sir.

276
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,760
Zhu Yanlin

277
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,280
Yes!

278
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,349
Come in.

279
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,800
Gu Yanzhen.

280
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,330
Why are you still sleeping?

281
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,600
Get up.

282
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,000
Gu Yanzhen.

283
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,700
If you still don't go to the examination,

284
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,800
your consequence will be bad

285
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,680
when Sergeant Lv finds it.

286
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,300
No one can help you.

287
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
What were you saying?

288
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,560
Health examination?

289
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,840
I said our school organized a health examination.

290
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,120
Where is Xie Liangchen?

291
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,480
He is lining at there.

292
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,080
Gu Yanzhen.

293
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,120
Gu Yanzhen.

294
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,600
Gu Yanzhen.

295
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
Huang Song?

296
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Is Huang Song here?

297
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
He went to ask Gu Yanzhen to come.

298
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,580
Only three of you are left.

299
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,360
Li Wenzhong.

300
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,040
Yes!

301
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
Shen Junshan.

302
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,960
Yes!

303
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,840
What's your name?

304
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,600
Sir?

305
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,560
My name is Xie Liangchen.

306
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
Where's your form?

307
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,160
I don't know.

308
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
Maybe they forgot yours.

309
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,840
Now,

310
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,520
you come in.

311
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
I'll give you one.

312
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Come in.

313
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,600
Hurry.

314
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,360
Do you hear it?

315
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,240
Chop.

316
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,330
What? Are you blind?

317
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,980
What are you doing?

318
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,690
Gu Yanzhen, are you insane?

319
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,440
Why the students here are like this?

320
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,920
Stop!

321
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,720
What's wrong?

322
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
Stop it!

323
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,200
Stop!

324
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,760
Stop it.

325
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,800
He hit me.

326
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,240
He swore at me and hit me.

327
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,080
Who did swear at you?

328
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
He hit you?

329
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,290
Please repeat the last action.

330
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,090
The thing is that

331
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,240
he... he

332
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,480
pinched me

333
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,280
with his fist.

334
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,890
His strength was ten times more than this.

335
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,920
He hit you like this?

336
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,320
He... he kicked me first.

337
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,040
He kicked me first.

338
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
I didn't kick you.

339
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,880
Shut up!

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,880
Look at you.

341
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,240
How undisciplined you are!

342
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,920
The school is ashamed of you.

343
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,680
Who swore at you?

344
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,080
Did you hear it?

345
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,560
Shen Junshan and he swore at me.

346
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,920
Who did swear at you?

347
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,760
You'd better make it clear.

348
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,020
Xie Liangchen told me.

349
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
I didn't.

350
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,040
You did. You did.

351
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,720
When did I...

352
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,440
Shut up!

353
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,800
All of you

354
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
are grounded.

355
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,880
Sir.

356
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,080
I didn't fight.

357
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,610
You are grounded with them.

358
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,640
Take them to

359
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,080
leave here.

360
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,600
Go.

361
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,240
Save me.

362
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,720
Am I grounded?

363
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,720
Wait for me.

364
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,280
Sir.

365
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,200
So... how about the examination?

366
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
Are you still thinking of it?

367
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
How pathetic I am!

368
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,760
Sir, sir.

369
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,480
Hurry. Don't waste time.

370
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,480
Junshan. Why did this happen?

371
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,720
Hurry up. Release him.

372
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,360
The leaders are waiting to question him.

373
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,820
Please wait a moment, sir.

374
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,600
Go.

375
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,600
What on earth is this place?

376
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,400
Don't worry.

377
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,410
We are arriving.

378
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,600
Miss Oda.

379
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
Mr. Wu,

380
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,440
thank you a lot.

381
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,560
It was my fault.

382
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,360
I should have followed what you said earlier

383
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,760
and left the timber mill.

384
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,320
The police and Arsenal Military Academy are targeting you.

385
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,180
So we are doomed to have troubles.

386
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
It was not your fault.

387
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,730
Thank you, Miss Oda.

388
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,040
I have to ask you one thing.

389
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,600
You must tell me the truth.

390
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,400
Yes.

391
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,560
After you were arrested,

392
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,800
did you say anything you shouldn't say?

393
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
No.

394
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Absolutely no.

395
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,240
I am loyal to you.

396
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,050
I won't give anything away even I will die.

397
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,240
That's good.

398
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,640
I know you

399
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,560
won't say anything wrong.

400
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,560
That's why I save you out.

401
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
Thank you for saving me.

402
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,040
And I need your help with

403
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,320
one more thing.

404
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,040
With pleasure.

405
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,440
Do you understand?

406
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,480
Yes.

407
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,330
I'll do what you ask me to do.

408
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,960
Miss Oda.

409
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Mr. Wu,

410
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,920
thank you a lot.

411
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,880
Miss Oda.

412
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,760
You promised me.

413
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,600
Don't worry.

414
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
The money is prepared.

415
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,960
Going to England or America,

416
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,600
it depends on you.

417
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,880
Thank you.

418
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Thank you.

419
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Send Mr. Wu back to have a rest.

420
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,960
Thanks.

421
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,320
How's everything going at the police station?

422
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,280
Everything is ready.

423
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,140
Go back to do your work.

424
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,080
Yes.

425
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,740
How's the health condition of these labors?

426
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,000
Most of them have skin disease.

427
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,400
They have tinea

428
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,840
and ulcers on the hands and feet.

429
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,800
A few of them have plague.

430
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,320
The situation is not good.

431
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,360
Also, they have been malnourished for long.

432
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,890
So they have poor immunity.

433
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
I think

434
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,480
we should apply to

435
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
transfer those who don't have

436
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,930
infectious diseases as soon as possible.

437
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,760
We are lack of helpers now.

438
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,130
I'll have a check tomorrow.

439
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
What happened?

440
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,530
Is there an earthquake?

441
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,320
It's not like an earthquake.

442
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,490
It seems that there are some troubles.

443
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,040
Are our staff at the scene?

444
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,520
Yes. Jijun came there.

445
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
Take more staff there.

446
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,160
Take cameras.

447
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
We need the most authentic and touching photos.

448
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
We'll publish them on the newspaper tomorrow.

449
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,920
Yes.

450
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,600
Also,

451
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,600
someone needs to be at

452
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,280
the police station and the town hall.

453
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,040
Report to me if something happens.

454
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
I have sent our staff there.

455
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,840
But there's still nothing back.

456
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,080
That's crazy.

457
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,760
How crazy it is!

458
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,360
Sir, who do you think did it?

459
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,600
The English, the Russians

460
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,530
or the Japanese?

461
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,560
Anyone of them is possible.

462
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,720
People change when the nation is at stake.

463
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,040
Every evil comes to bully us.

464
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,240
Even many Chinese

465
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,000
are helping our enemies.

466
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,480
I hope it was not our men who did it.

467
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,360
So cruel.

468
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,280
Only a few survived

469
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
of these people.

470
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,080
Others' flesh is blurred due to the burst.

471
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,040
We can't even identify them.

472
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,920
Mr. Zhang.

473
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,240
Mr. Zhang.

474
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,760
Hurry.

475
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
Have a look at the door.

476
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,720
What's wrong?

477
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,380
A dead... a dead is at the door.

478
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,560
This...

479
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,720
Look, Mr. Zhang.

480
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,400
Who is he?

481
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Is he still alive?

482
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,080
No.

483
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,600
There is something in his hand.

484
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,960
Give it to me.

485
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,840
It's been a long time.

486
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,170
Why hasn't she come out?

487
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,760
Just stay here and wait.

488
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
How can you get the bonus without a report?

489
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
I don't believe she doesn't come out today.

490
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,640
All of you stay here.

491
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,900
How long shall we wait?

492
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,050
Wait here even for three or four hours.

493
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,600
Tao.

494
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,840
Have you finished?

495
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,640
You are doing something so slowly.

496
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,320
Manting,

497
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
it's not my fault.

498
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,970
It's too messy here.

499
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,280
I'll be ready soon.

500
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,650
We'll go when I am ready.

501
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,600
So slowly.

502
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,920
Manting,

503
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,050
where are you going?

504
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,440
I'll go to find Shen Tingbai.

505
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,560
You can't go. Please listen to me.

506
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,960
It's useless that you go.

507
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,680
This thing has drawn much attention.

508
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Many people died.

509
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,320
There is also Wu Bin's claim to Mr. Shen,

510
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,560
so it is useless that you go.

511
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,240
Everyone has believed the expected result.

512
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,370
It couldn't be Shen Tingbai who did it.

513
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,520
Now the problem is not whether you trust him.

514
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,280
The result has almost been established.

515
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,520
You can't reverse the situation.

516
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,440
Stop talking.

517
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,120
You're noisy.

518
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,240
It is no use for you to come,

519
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,960
and you will put yourself in danger.

520
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,760
You...

521
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,800
Why are you so stubborn?

522
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,680
Is it Qu Manting here?

523
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,360
How come?

524
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,560
It is her.

525
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,320
Miss Qu. Miss Qu.

526
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,960
Oh my god!

527
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,960
I'm scared to death.

528
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
Why are there so many people?

529
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,240
Manting, it won't work.

530
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Mr. Shen wanted to explain it

531
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
at Shunyuan COC.

532
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,440
Suddenly, there was stir among the people

533
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,570
who were at the door.

534
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,360
The door of the COC almost was broken.

535
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,420
It mustn't be Shen Tingbai who did it.

536
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,800
Obviously, someone is leading the public.

537
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,720
Can't you tell it?

538
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,480
Manting,

539
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,880
leave these things.

540
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,120
What can we do?

541
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,560
We can't still live here.

542
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,520
We must leave.

543
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,650
How can we leave under this situation?

544
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,320
So don't take the chance.

545
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,850
Come to prepare.

546
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,640
I...

547
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,360
Manting,

548
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
be careful.

549
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,400
OK.

550
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,000
Hurry. Hurry.

551
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,160
Go. Go. Go

552
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,360
Time's up.

553
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,160
You can go.

554
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,010
I'm starving after being here for a long time.

555
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,330
Could you tell me

556
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,160
what happened last night?

557
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
Go now.

558
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
Don't care about others.

559
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Liangchen.

560
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,880
The atmosphere doesn’t seem to be good.

561
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,480
What are you doing?

562
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,540
What are you doing?

563
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,300
Can't you see something wrong happened?

564
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Stop!

565
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,540
What are you doing?

566
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,600
Put it down.

567
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,880
I find that you are active

568
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,150
when you watch the fun.

569
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,280
I tell you

570
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,630
not to discuss this thing

571
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,230
before the result comes out.

572
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,340
Junshan. Come with me.

573
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,400
What's wrong?

574
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,730
I'll tell you on the way.

575
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,679
Your accuracy is bad.

576
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,150
Liangchen, let's go.

577
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,800
Let’s go check it out.

578
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,720
Miss Qu.

579
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,800
Mr. Zhang.

580
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,600
Thank you very much

581
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,120
for seeing me at this time.

582
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Miss Qu.

583
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,160
You saved

584
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,960
my life in Shanghai.

585
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,520
How can I decline the one

586
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,440
who saved me?

587
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,360
It was the past,

588
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,720
which is not worthy to mention.

589
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,520
Mr. Zhang.

590
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,880
I admire your character

591
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,940
and talent so much.

592
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,680
It was not a favour that I did for you.

593
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,480
I did it under the Chinese conscience.

594
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,600
Yes.

595
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,160
So today

596
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,200
you come to me to...

597
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,320
You must have known it.

598
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,400
It's not me who wants to meet you.

599
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
I'm just a middle person.

600
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,920
Mr. Zhang.

601
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,520
Sorry for that.

602
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,780
Please don't mind.

603
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,410
He comes out.

604
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,320
Mr. Zhang.

605
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,560
These are a part of my industries.

606
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,740
Our Shens have been running Shunyuan COC for years.

607
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,680
The industries that we operate are various.

608
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,440
The little profile

609
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,600
of selling labors

610
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,120
can't compare to

611
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,360
that made in other industries.

612
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,640
This

613
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,690
is the autopsy result given by the police.

614
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
It shows that

615
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
it had been more than 12 hours

616
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,160
from Wu Bin died

617
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,240
till the time when they came to autopsy.

618
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,200
This means that

619
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,200
when you found him yesterday,

620
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,760
he had been dead for at least 4 hours.

621
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,840
So,

622
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,120
he couldn't crawl

623
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,880
to your door and

624
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,880
give you the letter

625
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,300
that discloses me.

626
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,540
So what you mean is that

627
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,600
someone sent him here?

628
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,960
He must be sent here.

629
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,480
But,

630
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,880
why did the one who sent him

631
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,240
disguise the scene like that

632
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,320
he walked here?

633
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,760
Mr. Zhang.

634
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,840
You have your own judgement.

635
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,880
I think you have realized that

636
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,920
this whole thing is an intrigue.

637
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
And a very cruel intrigue.

638
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,480
They are using your anger

639
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,160
and bet that you will be blind

640
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,560
for the so-called truth.

641
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,060
Unluckily,

642
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,410
their move is right.

643
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,520
But,

644
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,960
we found the manuscripts

645
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,880
that Wu Bin wrote to his friends

646
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
at his house.

647
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,800
And we have checked the handwriting...

648
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Mr. Zhang.

649
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,520
Wu Bin was an evil traffickers.

650
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,680
His organization

651
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,360
must be an evil one.

652
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,640
It's not hard

653
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,880
for those people to

654
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,440
force or cheat Wu Bin to write or

655
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,840
falsify such a letter

656
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,760
to frame me.

657
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,240
I am also very grieved for

658
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,760
the accident of temporary hospital.

659
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
But what makes me more grieved is that

660
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,200
the real criminal is at large

661
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,920
and the wicked sow discord,

662
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,080
making the dead cannot rest in peace.

663
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,120
Our nation is at stake.

664
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,520
If we don't be united

665
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,680
but let the wicked

666
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,660
continue what they are doing,

667
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,880
there will be no hope

668
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,440
for our country.

669
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,320
Dad.

670
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,210
You haven't gone to bed?

671
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,840
I see the lights in your study room are on,

672
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
so I come in.

673
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,460
You still have articles to write?

674
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,920
I might do something wrong.

675
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,240
But luckily,

676
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,100
there is a way to make up for it.

677
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,600
Have a rest now.

678
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,120
OK.

679
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,280
The world is changing.

680
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,560
The criminals are furious.

681
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,360
- The editor-in-chief was murdered. - Give me one.

682
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,490
Keep the change.

683
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,920
Come and see.

684
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,240
The world is changing.

685
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,080
Give me one.

686
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,880
Zhang Yuzhi was attacked.

687
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,800
What happened?

688
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,440
They are too unruly!

689
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,440
Man...

690
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,920
Manting,

691
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,240
perhaps, we

692
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,520
leave.

693
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,080
Where can we go?

694
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,760
You rush to leave

695
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,900
when there is trouble.

696
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,360
These bastards want to

697
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,680
get smart with me?
