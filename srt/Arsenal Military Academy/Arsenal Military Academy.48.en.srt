Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,460
Episode 48

4
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,800
No. 23, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

5
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,120
You think I can't find that place?

6
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,440
Oda Xianrong.

7
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,160
Don't you dare!

8
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,960
Why don't you go

9
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
and meet your family.

10
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,680
Left, right, left.

11
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,900
Left, right, left.

12
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,140
Left, right, left.

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,420
Left, right, left.

14
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,780
Left, right, left.

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,020
Left, right, left.

16
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,340
Left, right, left.

17
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,579
Left, right, left.

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,980
Left, right, left.

19
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,210
Commissioner Feng,

20
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,960
what do you mean?

21
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,000
I should ask the same.

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,360
You are the Chairwoman of Japan COC.

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,090
Who gives you the right to arrest civilians here?

24
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,400
The bombing of Jinhua Hotel

25
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,570
caused a great damage to us.

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,500
But the saboteur hasn't been caught yet.

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,840
Days ago,

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,960
Fujiwara Ichiro was killed.

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,650
You refused to look into it.

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,320
So I have to take things in our own hands.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,160
The paperwork is delivered to your office.

32
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,290
Commissioner Feng,

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
didn't you receive it?

34
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,540
What about Chairman Shen?

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,360
He's willing to come to my house as a guest.

36
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
Am I right,

37
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,620
Chairman Shen?

38
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,850
Who is it?

39
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,240
It's me.

40
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,200
Zhu Yanlin.

41
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,400
Please.

42
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,080
Sergeant Lv and my brother

43
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,350
were taken by Oda Xianrong.

44
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
Is the news reliable?

45
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,320
Yes.

46
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,640
Oda Xianrong and her men went to my house

47
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,900
and took my brother with them.

48
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,560
Then,

49
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,640
we can't await our doom.

50
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,060
Since Mr. Shen and Sergeant Lv were taken in,

51
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,570
the guards outside have been doubled.

52
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,580
First, we have to make it clear

53
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,760
where my brother and Sergeant Lv

54
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,880
are held.

55
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,220
Don't move.

56
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,930
Sergeant Lv.

57
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,920
Opportunity

58
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,770
doesn't often occur to you.

59
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,120
So seize it when it does.

60
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,260
Chairman Shen.

61
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,940
It's as well to know which way the wind blows.

62
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,000
Sergeant Lv,

63
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,960
you're a man to your name.

64
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,920
Strong as a horse.

65
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,760
However,

66
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,660
whoever comes here

67
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,160
even it's a dead man

68
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
opens his mouth.

69
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,330
Sergeant Lv,

70
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,520
as long as you do as I told

71
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,240
and replace Song Xicheng,

72
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,870
you'll get all you want,

73
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,450
including power

74
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
and pleasure.

75
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
The city will be under your control.

76
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,920
Why do you choose to suffer in here?

77
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,040
You've got him under your control.

78
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,280
What do you want me for?

79
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,440
Oda Xianrong.

80
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,010
What do you mean?

81
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
The way you took power is brutal.

82
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
Your capability can't make people oblige.

83
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm just using you.

84
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
What's up?

85
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
You still want to work with me?

86
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,880
Oda Xianrong.

87
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
You are kicking down the ladder now?

88
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
The fox is sad at the death of a hare.

89
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,610
Even animals feel the sadness.

90
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,680
A man like him

91
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,170
doesn't deserve to live in this world.

92
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,100
But you're different.

93
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,280
Sergeant Lv.

94
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,860
You're the late Commander's right hand man.

95
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,460
Compared with him,

96
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,770
you're more capable of taking Feng'an

97
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
and Shunyuan under control.

98
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,760
Sad for you.

99
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,080
I never boast my loyalty

100
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,480
for my whole life.

101
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,600
To die a hero is crap.

102
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,860
As long as one can live,

103
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,520
who wants to die?

104
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,040
Even if one day Song Xicheng takes the power,

105
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,920
he is still a Chinese.

106
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,360
Who are you?

107
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,680
You're nobody.

108
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,900
Find anything?

109
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,400
Not yet.

110
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
We can't wait any longer.

111
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,000
The longer we wait,

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,660
the more dangerous for people in there.

113
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,760
Hurry up on the plan.

114
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,620
Xie Liangchen.

115
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,480
Come on.

116
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,400
I have been here before.

117
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,160
I draw the map according to my memory.

118
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,020
But now it seems

119
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,920
there are a lot more guards here.

120
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,280
We have to be careful.

121
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
- OK. - OK. - OK.

122
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,960
Gu Yanzhen and I will go in from the front door.

123
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,820
Yanlin, you take watch over here.

124
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,040
Junshan,

125
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,640
you go there

126
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
and get in from the rear.

127
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
Guards change shift in 10 minutes.

128
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,770
That's when they get lousy.

129
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,060
We take actions on your shoot.

130
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,040
We count it on you.

131
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
OK, trust me for that.

132
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,380
Looks like Sergeant Lv is not only good at drilling,

133
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,200
but also a good orator.

134
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,840
I just speak of the truth.

135
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,490
Unlike you. Sweet talks but evil mind.

136
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,520
How do you think, Chairman Shen?

137
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,970
Anything you want to share with us?

138
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,860
I shouldn't have left Chairman Shen in the cold?

139
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,600
I guess you don't want to be ignored, right?

140
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,170
Then let's get started.

141
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,640
Crap!

142
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
It's Sergeant Lv.

143
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,320
We can't wait anymore.

144
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,720
Move out now.

145
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,160
Go.

146
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,800
First squad. Follow me.

147
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Let's go.

148
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,200
Go.

149
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
How is it, Chairman Shen?

150
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,660
Now you don't think you're deserted, right?

151
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,520
Sergeant Lv,

152
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,160
you're a man to your name.

153
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,640
Strong as a horse.

154
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
What do you think?

155
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,930
Anything you want to share with us now?

156
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,280
Go.

157
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,280
Wait a minute.

158
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,210
Something is wrong.

159
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,730
I think something is wrong.

160
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,760
Since you've given on yourself,

161
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,210
then there's no need for me to hang on to it.

162
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,920
The name of the academy is arsenal.

163
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,660
It means weapons to wipe out everything.

164
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,170
Unless the enemies are destroyed,

165
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,020
the arsenal never goes empty.

166
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,760
The hope never dies

167
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,330
and it carries on in people's mind.

168
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,930
Brilliant name!

169
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
Let me see

170
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,960
how you're going to carry on

171
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,760
the hope and spirit.

172
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,680
Sergeant Lv,

173
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
stop struggling.

174
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,880
Once one gets in here,

175
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,160
unless I let him go,

176
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,320
otherwise,

177
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,280
no one gets out alive.

178
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,560
Protect Miss Oda.

179
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,000
Whatever. Fire.

180
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,109
Let's go.

181
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Go.

182
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
Go and have a look.

183
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,680
Yes.

184
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,040
Interesting!

185
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,880
They've come to get killed.

186
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,620
Chairman Shen,

187
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,860
you must be thinking they're coming to save you.

188
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,620
But they only come to get themselves killed.

189
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,160
In our homeland,

190
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,470
one's life and death

191
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,240
aren't on your hands.

192
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,810
You're so sure about it.

193
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,080
Then let's see.

194
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,520
Guards!

195
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,840
Move.

196
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Fire.

197
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,440
Hold it there.

198
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,280
Fire.

199
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,200
Keep firing.

200
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,480
Come on.

201
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,960
Fire.

202
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,280
They're about to break in.

203
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
We're stuck here.

204
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,520
Fire.

205
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,520
Fall back.

206
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,320
Fire.

207
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,100
Go.

208
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,480
Suppress them.

209
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
Go to hell.

210
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,080
They just can't stop, huh.

211
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,920
Keep firing.

212
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,320
Come on.

213
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,320
Come on.

214
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,200
Hurry up.

215
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,760
Come on.

216
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,480
This way.

217
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,280
This way.

218
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,340
Lieutenant General Miyazawa,

219
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,540
please rest assured.

220
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,600
This time, we will

221
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,500
destroy the enemies once for all.

222
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,960
Do as you've planned.

223
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,600
Yes.

224
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,400
Run!

225
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,960
Stay down.

226
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,100
Hold on for a moment.

227
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,030
Buy us some time.

228
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,600
Do they fall back or not?

229
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,320
Not yet.

230
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
The fire is strong.

231
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,720
What should we do now?

232
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,770
I don't know.

233
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,250
Where do the mortars come from?

234
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,490
Keep firing.

235
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,520
Lieutenant General Miyazawa,

236
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
it's dangerous here.

237
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,880
Please take cover someplace safe

238
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,280
and wait for my good news.

239
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,440
Now you see

240
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,680
I'm right.

241
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,480
Take them back to the lab.

242
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,600
Yes.

243
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,640
Ms. Huo,

244
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,480
I see

245
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,280
what you mean.

246
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,400
The students are so young,

247
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
yet they're brave.

248
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,160
I respect them.

249
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,210
Don't worry.

250
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,880
Though I'm as low as nobody,

251
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,140
I'm definitely

252
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,000
not a coward.

253
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,890
I have guns and mortars.

254
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,360
Ms. Huo,

255
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
tell me what you need.

256
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,880
In Shunyuan City,

257
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,000
except for Lord Rong,

258
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,220
I'm never afraid of

259
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,160
anyone in my life.

260
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,100
On behalf of the students,

261
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,970
thank you, General Pei.

262
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,340
Whatever.

263
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,880
Go.

264
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,400
Go.

265
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,160
Go. Go.

266
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,520
Guys, follow me.

267
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,170
Let's go.

268
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,600
I...

269
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,720
Xiaoyu.

270
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,080
What do you think?

271
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,760
The mortars are right on time, right?

272
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,960
What brings you here?

273
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,160
I can't let the Japanese

274
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,620
rampage about in our home.

275
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,100
Director Guo wouldn't allow it.

276
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,360
They've had their day.

277
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,880
Let's go.

278
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,320
Go.

279
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,840
Go.

280
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,080
Go.

281
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,600
Go.

282
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,280
I got something.

283
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
They're coming at us.

284
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,280
Damn it.

285
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,960
Hold on there. Hold on.

286
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,280
Xiaoyu.

287
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,440
Are you OK?

288
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,920
Yeah.

289
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
Did you fire the mortar?

290
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,800
I did.

291
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,100
Go get them out.

292
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,920
Ji Jin,

293
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,720
you go get Yanlin.

294
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,280
OK.

295
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,640
You two, follow me.

296
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:58,960
Let's go.

297
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,020
Xiaodao, Zhameng,

298
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,560
you two stay here with the students.

299
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,800
Watch out for their back-ups.

300
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,320
OK.

301
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
We move together.

302
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,090
Let's go.

303
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,240
Benzi, let's go.

304
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
There they are.

305
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,840
Follow me.

306
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,640
Let's go.

307
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,210
You Chinese people.

308
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,560
Come on.

309
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,830
You go first.

310
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,440
Leave him to me.

311
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,320
Go.

312
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,040
Come.

313
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,640
That was slow enough.

314
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,880
Mr. Shen.

315
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,850
Put the gun down.

316
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,270
Put the gun down.

317
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,900
I'll let your master live.

318
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,650
Put the gun down.

319
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,480
Get them out.

320
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,600
Come on.

321
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Go. Go.

322
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,850
Let's go.

323
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,360
Go.

324
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,440
Let's go.

325
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,960
Junshan,

326
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,520
I never expected that

327
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,880
things would get this far.

328
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,280
I imagine endless times

329
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,280
and picture how happy

330
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,040
we'll be together.

331
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
That we end up like this today

332
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,040
is all because of you.

333
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,680
It's all because of

334
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
you ignorant losers

335
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,520
who pushed me to the dead end.

336
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,400
Junshan,

337
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,080
talk to your brother.

338
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,140
Let's build a new Shunyuan together.

339
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,560
Isn't it nice?

340
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,880
Why can't you just

341
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,000
stop dragging me behind

342
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,370
and undermining me?

343
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,400
Why do you do this to me?

344
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,880
Because we're Chinese.

345
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,140
We don't betray our homeland.

346
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,640
Mr. Shen.

347
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,160
OK.

348
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,000
Now you're all here.

349
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,200
I underestimated all of you.

350
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,200
Xie Liangchen.

351
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,240
Xie Xiang.

352
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,760
Xie Xiang.

353
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,600
If it weren't you,

354
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,700
Junshan wouldn't have given up on me.

355
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,560
If it weren't you,

356
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,240
I wouldn't have gone this far.

357
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,960
If it weren't you,

358
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,020
Junshan wouldn't have given up on me.

359
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,560
Junshan.

360
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:26,960
Junshan.

361
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,680
Junshan, tell me.

362
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,240
Why do you love her instead of me?

363
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,200
Oda Xianrong.

364
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,680
So goes your plan.

365
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,920
Give it up.

366
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,400
I never had the chance to choose.

367
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,960
All I did was arranged by others.

368
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,570
Including killing.

369
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,360
Enough.

370
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,360
The deaths of

371
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,440
so many Chinese are on your hands.

372
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,770
Though you're still alive,

373
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,480
in my heart,

374
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,640
you're already dead.

375
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm dead?

376
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,760
Yeah.

377
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,170
I died long time ago.

378
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,440
I said that

379
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,680
no one gets out alive

380
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,010
without my permission.

381
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,000
Come.

382
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,000
Fire at me.

383
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,520
I've planted bombs

384
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,680
in this room.

385
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,500
Put it down.

386
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,080
Open fire.

387
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,080
Oda Xianrong.

388
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,440
Kill me.

389
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,400
They're innocent.

390
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,889
It's not the right time

391
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,360
to play hero.

392
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,920
I can kill you though.

393
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,240
It's worth to die

394
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,260
together with you.

395
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,880
Back off.

396
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,920
Fall back.

397
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,920
Go.

398
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,760
Go.

399
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,080
Mr. Shen.

400
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,720
Let's go home.

401
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,560
I thought you wouldn't come back.

402
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,400
I heard you want to open a steel factory.

403
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,930
And start a family, too?

404
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,730
Let's say goodbye here.

405
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,080
I don't know when we can meet again.

406
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,000
Take care.

407
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,640
You, too.

408
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,200
OK.

409
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,600
I know what you're going to say.

410
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,330
Don't worry.

411
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,600
I'll take care of her.

412
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,400
See you.

413
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,200
Hurry.

414
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,560
Come on.

415
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,400
Speed up.

416
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,460
You're not ladies.

417
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,570
They're probably better than you.

418
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,920
The Arsenal Military Academy is for the best.

419
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,560
Faster.

420
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,640
Do you know why

421
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,300
the academy is named arsenal?

422
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,920
Come on.

423
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,340
The arsenal

424
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,250
means weapons to wipe out everything.

425
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,400
Unless the enemies are destroyed,

426
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,060
the arsenal never goes empty.

427
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,890
The hope never dies.

428
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,800
The spirit carries on and on.
