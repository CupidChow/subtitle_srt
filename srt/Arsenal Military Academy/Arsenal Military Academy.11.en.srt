00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 11

4
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,900
Does Nianqing know it?

5
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,920
She doesn't know.

6
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
She was in a coma.

7
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,200
I told her that

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,520
I did it.

9
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,160
So it's the reason

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,490
you married her, right?

11
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,600
What's up?

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,960
Ms. Huo.

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,930
We found him.

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
What?

15
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,880
Jiang Hao

16
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,520
was at the west warehouse.

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,720
Zhameng was watching him with Xiaodao.

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm so sleepy.

19
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,800
Go back then.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Don't follow me.

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,040
It's boring to go back alone.

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,960
You tell Aunt Yu

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
that I want to work here.

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,440
Nope.

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,120
There is no place

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,640
to have a star like you here.

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,360
Waiter!

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,620
- Ms. Huo! - Aunt Yu!

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
You called her Ms. Huo?

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,640
Don't get it wrong!

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,160
Liu!

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,720
What happened?

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,490
What's going on?

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,200
Nothing.

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,079
I'll go now.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,720
You should call her aunt Yu.

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,320
I'd like to do that.

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,200
Let me go!

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,240
Let me go!

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,340
You bastard dare to kidnap me!

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,920
Who sent you here?

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,760
Let me go! Now!.

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,520
Ms. Huo.

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,800
Who are you?

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,170
What do you want?

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Jiang Hannian.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,200
No wonder I can't find you.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
Why did you change your name?

49
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,170
Are you afraid of your enemies?

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,540
How do you know my name?

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,800
I tell you.

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Let me go now.

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,840
Otherwise,

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,300
you'll get in big trouble.

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,720
Xiaodao.

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Open your eyes.

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,520
Who are you?

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
I don't know you.

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,600
What do you want?

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Over the past decade,

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,520
you have done so well

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
and have been the Peking envoy.

63
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,610
But your nature didn't change.

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,370
You committed many crimes.

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,620
It's justice for the mass to kill you.

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
What are you doing?

67
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Do you want money?

68
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,200
I can give you a lot of money.

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Please.

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,920
Please don't kill me.

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,140
Do you remember Pei Nianqing?

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
Pei Nianqing?

73
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,160
Pei Nianqing?

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,220
I don't know Pei Nianqing.

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,100
I really don't know Pei Nianqing.

76
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,600
Then think about it

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,640
in hell.

78
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,440
What?

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Do you have something for me?

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,520
Where is he?

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,320
In hell.

82
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,280
Not here anyway.

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,980
I mean where the corpse is.

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,800
In the west warehouse.

85
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,780
Pei Nianqing was dead.

86
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,920
Jiang Hao was also dead.

87
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,050
You should let it go.

88
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,700
Nianqing's life was ruined by it.

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
How can I let it go?

90
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
I've killed him for you.

91
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,960
He is the last one.

92
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,880
Nianqing.

93
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,920
May you have the peace.

94
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,000
Look at you, so weak.

95
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
Sergeant Guo.

96
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Do you drink?

97
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,520
No, I don't.

98
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm asking

99
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,280
can you drink?

100
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes.

101
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Come. Come here.

102
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,880
Come.

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,840
Sergeant.

104
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,440
When did you come?

105
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,960
I've been watching you for half a day.

106
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
As a man,

107
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,440
you must learn to drink.

108
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,920
Wine is a good thing.

109
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,560
Sergeant.

110
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,960
Why do you like drinking so much?

111
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,460
Because I'm bored.

112
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,960
You are not happy.

113
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
How do you know?

114
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,360
I guessed.

115
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,720
I tell you.

116
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,760
I am very happy today.

117
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,720
Because today is my great day.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,120
Seriously?

119
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
Sergeant.

120
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,160
You are in an old age.

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,680
You still marry a concubine?

122
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Boy!

123
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
I'm old.

124
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,240
I won't have any concubine.

125
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,560
Then, are you getting married

126
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,360
in this old age?

127
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,500
You misunderstood me.

128
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,480
Today

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
my foe is dead.

130
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,460
It deserves to be celebrated.

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,840
But,

132
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,520
I didn't kill him by myself.

133
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,420
I have been looking for him for so many years.

134
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,040
Finally, he died today.

135
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
But he wasn't killed by me.

136
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,080
I didn't kill him by myself.

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know whether I am happy

138
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,480
or disappointed.

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Sir...

140
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,320
Sergeant

141
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,060
Don't take it serious.

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,240
It's good your foe

143
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
is dead and you get to know it.

144
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
You are so old.

145
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,120
Your foe is certainly not young.

146
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,240
Maybe in a few years,

147
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,500
he will die of illness.

148
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Then you will be more disappointed.

149
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,360
In your eyes, am I

150
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,880
nothing but an old man?

151
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,920
Anyway, I guess

152
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
you are not young.

153
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,340
What are you doing, sergeant?

154
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,760
Today this old man

155
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,320
will give you a lesson.

156
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,960
Sergeant.

157
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,970
Do you want to fight with me?

158
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,760
Yeah.

159
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,520
No. Sergeant.

160
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,410
My physical strength is not as good as theirs.

161
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,340
But I was trained with kung fu.

162
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,720
Are you sure?

163
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
Cut the crap.

164
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,360
Come on.

165
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,560
Alright.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,360
Let's make a deal first.

167
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
On the arena,

168
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,760
no distinction between the old and young.

169
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,000
If I hurt you,

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
don't blame me in the future.

171
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,600
Come on.

172
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
I... I didn't get ready.

173
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,600
Again.

174
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,200
How about it?

175
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,490
You win. You win.

176
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Come on.

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
I can't. I can't.

178
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
You win. You win.

179
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
I lose.

180
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,120
I tell you.

181
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,240
If you

182
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,320
get any trouble at school,

183
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,400
come to me.

184
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,560
I will protect you.

185
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,640
Sergeant.

186
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,640
Take care

187
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,360
of yourself.

188
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,880
You are old

189
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
and not married yet.

190
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,760
You are living a bad life.

191
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,610
What are you talking about?

192
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,320
Am I old?

193
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
I'm not old yet.

194
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,120
Come.

195
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,720
Come.

196
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,600
Come. Turn around.

197
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,280
Look at me.

198
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,080
Am I old?

199
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
I tell you.

200
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
I'm not young as before truly.

201
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
When I was young,

202
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,360
many girls loved me.

203
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,600
Do you know it?

204
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760
Don't you believe it?

205
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,560
You are bragging.

206
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,600
Bragging?

207
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Sergeant Guo.

208
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,280
Drinking is forbidden in the school.

209
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,080
You shouldn't take students to drink.

210
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,040
I am going to report you.

211
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,570
What are you talking about?

212
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,440
Don't pretend to be decent.

213
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,200
I tell you.

214
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,760
You get over the wall to drink every day.

215
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,280
Don't you think I know it?

216
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
Yeah.

217
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Am I right?

218
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,600
Alright.

219
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,000
You... You...

220
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
Get up.

221
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,520
Come here, boy.

222
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,640
You, go back with him.

223
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,360
Take him back. Do you hear me?

224
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,240
Don't move.

225
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,760
The smell of alcohol stinks.

226
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,520
The smell of alcohol?

227
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,720
Why can't I smell it?

228
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,820
Wipe your face.

229
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
Don't drink too much

230
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,640
if you can't.

231
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,360
Hands.

232
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,440
Tired?

233
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,960
Sleep now.

234
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,480
I should take off my clothes.

235
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,720
What's going on?

236
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,099
What happened?

237
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
I can't untie it.

238
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,589
Why are you so stupid?

239
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,360
Do you need help?

240
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,840
Yes.

241
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,240
You said it.

242
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,570
Don't blame me when you wake up.

243
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,360
What?

244
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,000
You'd better sleep in your clothes.

245
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,080
It feels bad.

246
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
I told you to wear it.

247
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,890
Take off your shoes.

248
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
Socks, socks.

249
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,120
Why are you taking off my socks?

250
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,680
You will feel better.

251
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,080
Gu Yanzhen.

252
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,440
What?

253
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,160
Gu Yanzhen.

254
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,280
What?

255
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,800
Gu Yanzhen.

256
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,720
Are you crazy?

257
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Gu Yanzhen.

258
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,760
Gu Yanzhen.

259
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,040
Let me tell you a secret.

260
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,080
In fact,

261
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,920
I am a woman.

262
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,480
I know.

263
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,410
My name is Xie Xiang,

264
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,980
not Xie Liangchen.

265
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,280
Xie Liangchen is my brother.

266
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,000
Stop it.

267
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,240
Let me finish.

268
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,120
Two years ago,

269
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,240
On the day he came to register at Arsenal Military Academy

270
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
there was an accident

271
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,120
and he died

272
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,800
So,

273
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,400
I was very sad.

274
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,000
I had no desire to eat every day.

275
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
I couldn't sleep.

276
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,560
Can you understand me?

277
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Certainly you can't understand me.

278
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
You never lost a brother.

279
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,560
I also had my hair cut,

280
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,840
though it doesn't look good.

281
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,720
Does it look good?

282
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
It doesn't look good. Right?

283
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,040
I have to do get along

284
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,000
with roommates like you.

285
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,240
Do you know you snore loud?

286
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,320
It's really noisy.

287
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,120
I'm so unfortunate,

288
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,640
really.

289
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Don't go too far.

290
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,970
I've got bad temper.

291
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,600
I was beat by Sergeant Guo

292
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,000
just now.

293
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
Do you know it?

294
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,520
I know.

295
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,040
I have no sister either.

296
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
I know.

297
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,120
How do you know everything?

298
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,730
Because you're stupid.

299
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,880
You are rude!

300
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,380
Xie Liangchen.

301
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,440
I tell you.

302
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,920
Though you are drunk,

303
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,320
you'd better not push me.

304
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,090
You scolded me. You apologize.

305
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,540
Apologize!

306
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,080
Apologize!

307
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,440
OK. OK. Stop it.

308
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,680
Go to sleep now.

309
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,160
Apologize!

310
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,920
Apologize!

311
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,080
Alright.

312
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,320
You are

313
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,160
my boss

314
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,200
I listen to your orders. OK?

315
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Go to sleep.

316
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,640
Be good.

317
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,560
Hello?

318
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,800
Hello. Manting.

319
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Have you read today's newspaper?

320
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,040
No. What's up?

321
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,480
Read it now.

322
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,530
It pissed me off.

323
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,840
Do you see it?

324
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,960
Do you see it?

325
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
Yes. I see.

326
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,480
What are you mad at?

327
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,520
It's common.

328
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,000
It really angered me.

329
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,090
Look at them!

330
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,320
Shameless man and woman!

331
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,800
Alright, stop it.

332
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,840
If this is true,

333
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,600
I have to thank this lady surnamed Bai.

334
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,560
What? Wait!

335
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,520
Stop your rambling.

336
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,800
Manshu will leave for Beijing today.

337
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
I have to send her off.

338
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,480
Alright.

339
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,810
I haven't finished yet!

340
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
What time will my father arrive?

341
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,160
He should have arrived now.

342
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,050
Maybe the train is late.

343
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,360
He comes back so soon.

344
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,800
Shouldn't he stay a few days more?

345
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,560
I don't know.

346
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,760
But the situation in Peking is not good.

347
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,890
It is better for him to come back early.

348
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,730
Brother.

349
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,040
I want to ask you about someone.

350
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,720
He should be your classmate.

351
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,960
He is a little shorter than you,

352
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,960
with big eyes

353
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
and high nose.

354
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,040
The hair is also shorter than yours.

355
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,560
He is whiter

356
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,080
and more handsome than you.

357
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,200
Do you know him?

358
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,760
- What's his name? - No.

359
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,620
- Don't you know him? - No, I don't.

360
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,840
Brother!

361
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,200
Think about it.

362
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,880
There must be someone.

363
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,080
Think carefully.

364
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,160
Nope.

365
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,920
Please.

366
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,120
Give me my coat. Now.

367
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,000
Brother!

368
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,250
Where are you going?

369
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,680
You should behave well at their home.

370
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
If you need any help,

371
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,480
go to find your aunt.

372
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,840
Try to get along well

373
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,000
with your cousins. Don't be capricious.

374
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,800
If you have no money,

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
call me at once.

376
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,760
Don't take part in

377
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,680
the work-study programs.

378
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,600
Our family

379
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,200
can afford your expense.

380
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,440
I know, mom.

381
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,400
You have repeated it many times.

382
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,560
By the way,

383
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,720
my sister said that she would send me off.

384
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,240
Where is she?

385
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,770
Alright.

386
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,080
Don't wait for her.

387
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,210
She never goes home,

388
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,280
and doesn't regard us as her family.

389
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,240
When you get school,

390
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,840
don't say she is your sister.

391
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,010
It is a shame for you.

392
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,280
You...

393
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,280
Dad, don't say that.

394
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,800
All right. Go now.

395
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,320
Go.

396
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,760
Goodbye then.

397
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,720
Ms. Qu! Ms. Qu Manting!

398
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
Ms. Qu Manting.

399
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,680
Ms. Qu.

400
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,040
Have you read the newspaper?

401
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,160
Do you know the relationship between

402
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,320
Mr. Shen Tingbai and Ms. Bai Biyun?

403
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,120
I heard they got together

404
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,880
and would be engaged.

405
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,520
Is that true?

406
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,080
Ms. Qu.

407
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,960
Did Shen Tingbai and you

408
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,360
officially break up?

409
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
You have stayed in hotels these days.

410
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,240
Are you alone?

411
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,720
Is Mr. Shen with you?

412
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,800
Ms. Qu.

413
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,840
Ms. Qu.

414
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,600
Can you answer me?

415
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,130
What are you doing? Go away.

416
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,640
Let's go.

417
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,000
Who is this?

418
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,440
Who is it?

419
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,480
Are you stupid?

420
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,400
You should have left.

421
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,880
What?

422
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Were you waiting for an award?

423
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,840
I was controlled.

424
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
How could I leave?

425
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,480
What?

426
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Did Shen Junshan's brother abandon you?

427
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,800
You seem depressed.

428
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,960
You are mistaken.

429
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,160
I was not abandoned by him.

430
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,520
He always pesters me.

431
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,780
I don't like him at all.

432
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,940
Congratulations.

433
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,040
He won't pester you again.

434
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,840
I am happy for that.

435
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,040
Stubborn.

436
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,240
What?

437
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,240
You despise him.

438
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,160
Why do you take me as a shield?

439
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,000
Well.

440
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,690
Afraid of being hunted?

441
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,360
He has many helpers in the police station.

442
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,320
So powerful.

443
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,040
So you are afraid of the police.

444
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,970
No wonder Shen Junshan always bullies you in school.

445
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
Who told you I was bullied

446
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
by Shen Junshan?

447
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,440
Everyone in Mountsouth Tavern knows it.

448
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,560
Don't you know it?

449
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,400
He is better than you

450
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,320
at all aspects.

451
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,580
It's disdainful to compare with him.

452
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,360
What about now?

453
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,500
Are you stirring me up?

454
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,440
Let's go.

455
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,360
Mr. Shen.

456
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,600
Ms. Qu is here.

457
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,480
I have something to tell you.

458
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,400
Sorry but I'm busy.

459
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,720
I have no time to talk with you.

460
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,920
Baby. Let's go now.

461
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,200
Baby.

462
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,920
I want to stay with you longer.

463
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,980
Let's go upstairs.

464
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,920
So exciting.

465
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,520
Sir.

466
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,850
He is Gu Zongtang's son.

467
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,890
He intended to kidnap Ms. Qu

468
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,520
last time in Paromo.

469
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,000
It was also him

470
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,080
with Ms. Qu in Bazi Village.

471
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,680
Should we...

472
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,600
She is being childish.

473
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,330
Wait until she gets over it.

474
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,760
Let's go.

475
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Master.

476
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,560
Mr. Zhu.

477
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,960
Where's my brother?

478
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,090
Didn't he come back?

479
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,450
He was attracted by a woman.

480
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,240
What?

481
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
My brother

482
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,080
was obsessed with a female star.

483
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,640
Female star?

484
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,600
Was it the female star

485
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,120
who was intimate with Shen Tingbai

486
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,240
at the banquet last time?

487
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't know.

488
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
It seems to be her!

489
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,600
Check it out.

490
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,120
Yes.

491
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,120
Dad.

492
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Don't worry about my brother.

493
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,680
It's common for him to change his dates.

494
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,240
It's abnormal though it's common.

495
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,640
Besides,

496
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,650
this woman is not ordinary.

497
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,760
Shen attached great importance to her.

498
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,640
For her, he broke into

499
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,120
Japanese Chamber of Commerce

500
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,680
and killed the Japanese.

501
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,360
The two brothers of Shen

502
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,960
are so awesome!

503
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,720
My daughter.

504
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,520
You should be more reserved.

505
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,780
A good man is defined by his cultivation.

506
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Is it time for piano lessons?

507
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Is the teacher here?

508
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,920
Yes.

509
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,360
Go now.

510
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,440
Master.

511
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,200
You must be tired these days.

512
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,000
The Japanese captured Qingdao and Wei County.

513
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,170
Germany can't repulse it anymore.

514
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,920
So Germany is willing to give Jiaozhou Bay

515
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
back to China.

516
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,980
But Yuan Shikai and his officials

517
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
have no courage to accept it.

518
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Cowards.

519
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,340
Sir, don't be angry with them.

520
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,480
Take a rest

521
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,560
for a few days.

522
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,200
Don't care about it.

523
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,650
Was everything alright

524
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,820
when I was off here?

525
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,340
Anyway it's peaceful.

526
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,960
But days ago,

527
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,680
the Arsenal Military Academy

528
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,800
stealthily released the Japanese Samurai

529
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,060
who killed innocents.

530
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,680
But when they got out of the city,

531
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
they were ambushed and all dead.

532
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,000
Do you know who did it?

533
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,730
I don't know.

534
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,040
Many people are

535
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,720
investigating this issue.

536
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,120
I don't want to interfere too much

537
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,850
to incur unnecessary trouble.

538
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,330
You did it right.

539
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,970
Besides,

540
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,200
The Japanese COC said

541
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,250
Kazuo Sato has returned Japan.

542
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Back to Japan?

543
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,000
It's what the Japanese COC said.

544
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,120
According to gossips,

545
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,960
he was murdered by

546
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,540
the new president.

547
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
Who is the new president?

548
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,210
I don't know.

549
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,920
The new president

550
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,760
hasn't shown up in public.

551
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,600
But it is said that

552
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,080
it's a woman.

553
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,720
It gets more interesting.

554
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
By the way, Zhu.

555
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
One more thing I need you to check.

556
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,200
An envoy from Beijing

557
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
disappeared after he arrived Shunyuan.

558
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,200
His name is Jiang Hannian,

559
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,460
forty-five years old.

560
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,040
This is his file.

561
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,040
Go to the police station to find Director Wang.

562
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,520
Tell him

563
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,250
it's an order from Beijing.

564
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,080
We must find this man,

565
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,140
whether he be alive

566
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,360
or dead.

567
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,920
You woke up.

568
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,810
I thought you would sleep for a day.

569
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,640
Well...

570
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,280
Was I drunk

571
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,720
last night?

572
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,760
Yes.

573
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,920
Did I

574
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,080
get mad and

575
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,880
say anything inappropriate?

576
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,760
What do you  think?

577
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,360
What did I say?

578
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Your brother,

579
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,850
and your father.

580
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,840
And,

581
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,560
your sister.

582
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,360
Did I say anything else?

583
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,360
Your expression...

584
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,440
What?

585
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,420
Are you hiding any secrets

586
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,120
from me?

587
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Of course not.

588
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,300
Xie Liangchen.

589
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,240
I warn you.

590
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,600
Don't get drunk afterwards,

591
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,810
especially with Sergeant Guo.

592
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,560
He is an old goat

593
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,760
who always harasses Huo Xiaoyu.

594
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,520
Don't drink with him.

595
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,320
Aren't you afraid?

596
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,720
What should I be afraid of?

597
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,600
I am a man.

598
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,360
Are you safe as a man?

599
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,540
Is there no danger for men?

600
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,440
Tell you what,

601
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,760
it's a chaotic society.

602
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,240
Have you heard that?

603
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,420
You will suffer for it.

604
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Mr. Lv.

605
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,480
Mr. Lv.

606
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,760
Bo Xun.

607
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,080
We haven't met for days.

608
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,640
The Arsenal Military Academy has recruited new students.

609
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,720
Congratulations to you.

610
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,680
Thank you.

611
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,560
But it's totally

612
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,360
a mess.

613
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,600
It's not a good place.

614
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,960
Because you are so capable

615
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,200
to handle the mess.

616
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,240
It is not a common place

617
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,040
that anyone can control it.

618
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,400
It shows your excellent capability.

619
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,200
Bo Xun. Thanks for compliments.

620
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,240
What's up?

621
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,090
It never rains but it pours.

622
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,880
The case of the Japanese who were killed

623
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,740
is not done yet.

624
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,920
There is another emergent case.

625
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,800
The special envoy from Peking

626
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,600
is missing

627
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,940
before we meet him.

628
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,400
You know Shunyuan is chaotic.

629
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
British, Russian, Japanese

630
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,440
and local ruffians, hooligans.

631
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,740
How can I figure out his whereabouts?

632
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,220
They asked me to find it out in a month,

633
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,080
whether he was alive or dead.

634
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,040
It's a big trouble, isn't it?

635
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,570
Special envoy from Peking?

636
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,420
Who's he? Do I know him?

637
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,840
Jiang Hannian.

638
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,480
Jiang Hannian?

639
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,560
Yes.

640
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,640
He changed his name.

641
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,120
He used to

642
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,560
be named

643
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,400
Jiang Hao.

644
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,400
Jiang Hao?

645
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,080
What?

646
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,320
Do you know him?

647
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,240
He was my colleague

648
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,040
in the Inspection Squad.

649
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,680
Really?

650
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,920
Bro.

651
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
Tell me whatever you know.

652
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,480
Did he

653
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
have foes in Shunyuan?

654
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,440
Why did he leave?

655
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,960
I don't know.

656
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
There were many people in the Squad.

657
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
I had no personal relationship with him.

658
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,600
There was nothing unusual about his departure.

659
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,240
Really?

660
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,120
How about this?

661
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,760
I'll help you ask around when I get back.

662
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,600
I'll notify you if there is any information.

663
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,120
Good.

664
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,640
Bro, thank you for that.

665
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,970
You're welcome.

666
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
I have a question.

667
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,400
Do you know

668
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
Jiang Hao was killed?

669
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,160
I killed him.

670
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,770
Where is the corpse?

671
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,080
Fed the dog.

672
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,920
How do you know his whereabouts?

673
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,440
I have my ways.

674
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,640
It's not you.

675
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,080
It's Huo Xiaoyu.

676
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Tell her that

677
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,200
the police

678
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,180
are investigating it.

679
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,660
Let her be careful.

680
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,320
Ms. Xianrong.

681
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,360
How do you get time to be here?

682
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,560
I want to see Junshan.

683
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
I brought him some snacks.

684
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,680
He was called away by the Sergeant.

685
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,600
Well...

686
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,440
Could I take it to him for you?

687
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,520
Alright.

688
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,320
Thank you.

689
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,720
You're welcome.

690
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,480
I'm leaving.

691
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,600
Goodbye.

692
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,400
Goodbye.

693
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,960
You are here.

694
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,680
It's for you.

695
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
What is it?

696
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,760
I don't know.

697
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,680
May I open it

698
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,120
to show you?

699
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,160
OK.

700
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,640
Ms. Jin

701
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,840
asked me to give it to you.

702
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,080
I thought you were not here.

703
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,160
So I took it for you.

704
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
I have a question.

705
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,400
Are you two

706
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,800
in love now?

707
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,280
We are common friends.

708
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,610
She gave you this. It means more than that.

709
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,200
How about it?

710
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,000
Want some?

711
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
Sure. Thank you.

712
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,120
So delicious.

713
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,520
This is for you.

714
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,760
I will take this.

715
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,160
Sword is

716
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,920
the important weapon for soldiers.

717
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,250
Different from blades,

718
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,040
swords tricks are heavy and fierce,

719
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,240
wielded forcefully.

720
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,880
Less changes but more power.

721
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,860
In the era of cold weapons,

722
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,160
the soldiers went into battle with armor.

723
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,840
With thick edge and high weight,

724
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,300
swords were more trending

725
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,840
than light blades.

726
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,840
Swords can break

727
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,800
the armor easily

728
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,960
so as to inflict injury or death.

729
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,400
You may find it strange.

730
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,720
It is the era of firearms now.

731
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,260
The bullet has already take your life

732
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,320
before your sword chops down.

733
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,420
Why should we practice sword?

734
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,400
I want to tell you,

735
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,920
I don't want you to practice the skills,

736
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
but the courage.

737
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,200
The ancients went into battle,

738
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,720
face to face.

739
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,280
When a sword splits down,

740
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,730
the blood could be sprayed into mouth.

741
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,400
It would

742
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,280
frighten the cowards

743
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,080
and get them breakdown.

744
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,610
If they get distracted,

745
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,170
they will lose their lives.

746
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,840
To be a qualified soldier,

747
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,440
you must face the death

748
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,120
and fear in a straight way.

749
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,640
Otherwise,

750
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,400
it's rather unpractical

751
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,440
even with many theories

752
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,640
and skills.

753
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,920
Good.

754
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,120
Does anyone

755
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
want to come forward and have a try?
