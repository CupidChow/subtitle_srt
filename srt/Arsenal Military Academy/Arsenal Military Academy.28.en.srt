Episode 28

4
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Junshan.

5
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,960
Junshan.

6
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,400
Where is he ?

7
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,640
I don't know where he is.

8
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Where can he go at night?

9
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,640
Liangchen.

10
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,280
Come.

11
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Ji Jin, this way.

12
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
They cook ribs today. Why don't you take some?

13
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,280
I don't want to eat today.

14
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
Give me if you don't like.

15
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,280
Why did you come back so late last night?

16
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,720
I am asking you.

17
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,640
Stop it.

18
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,760
He was taking care of Junshan in my room.

19
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,880
What?

20
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,960
Junshan.

21
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,000
Junshan.

22
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,600
Here. Sit here.

23
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,079
Why does he leave?

24
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,160
He is weird these days.

25
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Get away from me, OK?

26
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,440
I don't.

27
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,280
Have your dinner.

28
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,120
No!

29
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,640
I'll leave.

30
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,480
I lost my appetite suddenly.

31
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
I'll leave too. I don't want to eat.

32
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,120
Liangchen.

33
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,760
We often use the skill of wrestling

34
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,040
in kickboxing.

35
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,950
We put emphasis on the strength,

36
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,760
and how to use your strength.

37
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,640
It's wise to follow the strength

38
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,040
and it's stupid to go against it.

39
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,720
If you want to achieve this,

40
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,960
you must know the law of

41
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,200
human's movement and strength

42
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,560
and the key skills to attacking.

43
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,880
Gu Yanzhen.

44
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
Gu Yanzhen. Wake up.

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,920
Right, right.

46
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,240
It makes sense.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,159
You almost fall in sleep.

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,960
Stand up to cheer yourself up.

49
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,640
Stand up.

50
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,280
Come.

51
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,960
For example,

52
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,240
when your enemy use the left hand

53
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
to attack your right shoulder,

54
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,640
he must move

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,880
to the right of your body.

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,400
At this moment, knowing the rule of the movement

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,640
is pretty important.

58
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,080
You can borrow and use his

59
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,760
strength in his direction

60
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,760
to break his tactics.

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,480
OK.

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,200
Let me show you.

63
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,480
Attack my right shoulder.

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,760
Why did you hit me so hard?

65
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,760
Don't laugh.

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,600
Legs are also important.

67
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,760
Hands and feet should be used together.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,040
The movements of hands,

69
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,640
scratching, grasping, pushing and holding,

70
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
are just for defensive.

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,280
The strength from legs are

72
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
more powerful.

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,080
So,

74
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,600
when fighting against your enemies,

75
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,120
don't ignore your lower limbs.

76
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,240
And knowing their law of movement

77
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,400
is helpful for you,

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,120
even if your rival is a deceiver.

79
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,960
OK.

80
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,760
Who want to have a try?

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,520
Shen Junshan.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,640
You

83
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,280
have a try with Xie Liangchen.

84
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,960
OK.

85
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,680
Sir,

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
how can I win him?

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,880
I ask you to have a try,

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,760
not take a risk with your life.

89
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,720
Stand up.

90
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,120
Liangchen.

91
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,160
Be careful.

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Liangchen.

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,400
Come on.

94
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,280
Junshan.

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,240
What are you doing?

96
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,080
What are you doing?

97
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,440
Do you want to celebrate the New Year here?

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,040
Come.

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Sorry.

100
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,800
What's wrong?

101
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,640
What happened?

102
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,240
Go to the health centre.

103
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,040
Sir,

104
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,760
let me company him.

105
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,280
Go.

106
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,680
How absurd!

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,640
OK.

108
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,080
Who is the next?

109
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,960
Li Wenzhong.

110
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,680
You and Ji Jin have a go.

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,520
Go.

112
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,040
Come on.

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,800
Is it painful?

114
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,280
Sir,

115
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,080
is he all right?

116
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,200
He's OK.

117
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,150
He'll be fine after a while.

118
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,640
Let me do it, sir.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,789
Alright.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,789
Tell me if you need help.

121
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,320
I'll do it myself.

122
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,760
Junshan.

123
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,960
Did I do something that offends you?

124
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,760
Why do you look like

125
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,080
you hate me?

126
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,920
I don't.

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,760
You do

128
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,600
in these days.

129
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,480
Gu Yanzhen said

130
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,080
he likes you.

131
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,560
That's nonsense.

132
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,320
Don't you know Gu Yanzhen?

133
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,200
He speaks what he wants.

134
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,040
Don't believe what he says.

135
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,760
Ignore him.

136
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,560
So it is not true?

137
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
Of course not.

138
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,000
What's wrong with you?

139
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm tired.

140
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll leave now.

141
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,960
But your nose is bleeding.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,120
Junshan.

143
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,600
What are you doing?

144
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,720
I'll go back home for several days.

145
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,040
Please help me to ask for a leave.

146
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,000
Tell them I'm sick.

147
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,840
You are sick?

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,560
Junshan.

149
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,000
Where is he going?

150
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,840
He told me that he would go back home.

151
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,520
Why is he so weird recently?

152
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,640
Yes.

153
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,640
He is avoiding to see me these days.

154
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,760
Why are you looking at me?

155
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,840
What?

156
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,160
Nothing.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,480
You…

158
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,600
Wait.

159
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
What does he mean?

160
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
Brother.

161
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,400
You are back.

162
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,320
It's good that

163
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,760
you are back.

164
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,200
I don't need to find you at school.

165
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,920
This is an invitation from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

166
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,040
They invite us to have a dinner.

167
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,120
Oda Yukihide?

168
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,240
Oda Yukihide comes.

169
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,400
Seems that he is very unsatisfied with

170
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,480
that new chairman.

171
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,360
The identity of the new chairman hasn't been clear now?

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,040
I only know the she is a woman.

173
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,080
And she's Oda Yukihide's daughter.

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,640
A woman?

175
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,800
There will be a dinner the day after tomorrow.

176
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,480
You go with me.

177
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,040
OK.

178
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
Dress well.

179
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,680
You may go now.

180
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,080
Liangchen.

181
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,440
Where are you going?

182
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,560
Xiaojun came.

183
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,640
She is waiting for me at the door.

184
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,960
Why does Xiaojun come to you?

185
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,200
I don't know.

186
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,520
And you?

187
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,080
You go out again?

188
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,880
You are always going out these days.

189
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,440
What happy thing do you have?

190
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,880
You look so delighted.

191
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
It's a secret?

192
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,000
Where is Xiaojun?

193
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,040
Liangchen.

194
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,280
Who told you that Jun came here?

195
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,080
Ji Jin told me that he saw her.

196
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,600
It's alright.

197
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,440
I'll wait for her here.

198
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,440
You can leave for your things.

199
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,640
OK.

200
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,000
See you later.

201
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,560
Xiang.

202
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,200
Why did you hide here?

203
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,920
Why do you come with him?

204
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm scared to death.

205
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,960
What?

206
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,960
He comes to my school every day.

207
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,080
He asks where Xie Xiang is.

208
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,600
I almost create a fiction with lies.

209
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,320
If you don't appear, he'll call the police.

210
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,640
What does he want to do?

211
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Who knows?

212
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
He says nothing to me.

213
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,640
Do you have something to do at noon?

214
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,320
Come with me.

215
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
I haven't had lunch.

216
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,560
Why are you still thinking of lunch?

217
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,160
-I'm hungry. -I don't...

218
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,680
Stop!

219
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,600
Check whether my car was scratched off.

220
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,440
Where are you going?

221
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,760
It's none of your business.

222
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,560
Xiaojun. Let's go.

223
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,520
What do you want to do?

224
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,760
Mr. Gu.

225
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,080
We'll go back to school.

226
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,920
If you go this way,

227
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,080
can you take us there?

228
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,040
No problem.

229
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,840
Get on the car.

230
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,680
We can go on our own.

231
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,440
No, thanks.

232
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,680
What's wrong with you recently?

233
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,720
You are showing a long face.

234
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,600
Who offended you?

235
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,400
Did you tell Shen Junshan

236
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,200
that you like me?

237
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,520
Yes. It was me.

238
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,920
Are you crazy?

239
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,760
I didn't tell a lie.

240
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
I think you did it on purpose.

241
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,480
I just tell the truth.

242
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,720
Don't you like me?

243
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,640
No, I don't!

244
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,600
Go.

245
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,760
Stop your quibble.

246
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,040
It's here. Here.

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,720
Qiqi?

248
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,960
Brother?

249
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,560
Thank you.

250
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,160
What are you going to do?

251
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
I... I want to find someone in your school.

252
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,480
Find someone?

253
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,160
Who do you find?

254
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,640
Xie Liangchen.

255
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,880
Xie Liangchen?

256
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,840
How did you know him?

257
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,360
That's a secret.

258
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,840
Stop.

259
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,440
You are not allowed in.

260
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,120
Sir…

261
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
He's not at school.

262
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,080
Could you please help me give him this?

263
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,920
Tell him I give it to him.

264
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,880
You can't open it.

265
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,840
Childish.

266
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,440
Xie Liangchen. You are back.

267
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,720
Hey.

268
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,320
What's that?

269
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,200
Cookies.

270
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,800
I baked them myself.

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,720
Nice?

272
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,280
Will you give him the cookies?

273
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,000
Did he offend you?

274
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,400
No.

275
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,480
Then why do you harm him?

276
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,040
Is the food you cooked not poisonous?

277
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,920
I...

278
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,520
Give me back.

279
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,360
Go away.

280
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,000
Huang Song.

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Xie Xiang.

282
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,080
Xiaojun told

283
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,920
me that you were looking for me.

284
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,760
Do you have something?

285
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,920
What are you doing these days?

286
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,520
I have something in association of our school.

287
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,560
I have been busy.

288
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,120
Why do you come to me?

289
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,760
Actually, nothing important.

290
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,240
This is for you.

291
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,109
What's this?

292
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,310
A little gift.

293
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,440
It's so beautiful.

294
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,360
Thank you.

295
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,280
You're welcome.

296
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,600
You can go for your business.

297
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,520
Then I'll go.

298
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,560
OK.

299
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,280
See you.

300
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,200
Bye.

301
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,240
See you.

302
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,040
See you later.

303
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,920
Bye.

304
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,440
Miss,

305
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,200
your wound has been putrefied.

306
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,680
It may be painful.

307
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,680
Miss.

308
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,360
It's finished.

309
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Take the kimono to me.

310
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,480
Yes.

311
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
It's been three years since we separated in Tokyo.

312
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,040
Mr. Shen.

313
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,480
Nice to meet you again.

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,760
You look still glorious

315
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,480
after three years.

316
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm old.

317
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
How I can be energetic like you?

318
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,920
I know how successful you are

319
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,040
these years

320
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
in Shunyuan.

321
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,920
You have passion and wisdom.

322
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,000
Your future must be very promising.

323
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,440
Now the situation is bad,

324
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,040
so it is difficult to do business.

325
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,520
You are experts with good tactics.

326
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,920
Without passion and gut,

327
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,560
I can do nothing.

328
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Is your father all right?

329
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,040
Yes, he's quite healthy.

330
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,520
Thank you for caring for him.

331
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,560
He's my old friend.

332
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,920
I admire his character and

333
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,960
knowledge so much.

334
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,560
It's pitiful that

335
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,480
I can't meet him

336
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,080
this time.

337
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,480
My father is aged,

338
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,520
but he still likes drinking.

339
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,000
So his temper is not very good.

340
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
You may not have a delightful

341
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,240
time if you meet him.

342
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,640
Mr. Shen.

343
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,560
Let me introduce

344
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,960
my daughter.

345
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,560
She's the chairman of Japanese COC,

346
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Oda Xianrong.

347
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,320
Xianrong.

348
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,480
You knew each other?

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,320
Nice to see you again.

350
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,600
We are in the same city.

351
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,320
We must have a chance to meet again.

352
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,640
Junshan.

353
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,360
Hello.

354
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,760
Is this your brother?

355
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,080
Yes.

356
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,080
He is my brother.

357
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Junshan.

358
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,120
This is Mr. Oda.

359
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,760
I mentioned him to you.

360
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,360
Nice to meet you.

361
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,720
Please have a seat.

362
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,720
Mr. Shen.

363
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,360
Are you familiar with this flavour?

364
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,760
I haven't drunk it for three years.

365
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,280
I really miss it.

366
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,600
Brother.

367
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,320
I have something to deal with.

368
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,360
I'll leave now.

369
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,640
Mr. Oda.

370
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,880
I'm so sorry.

371
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,120
See you.

372
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,200
Xianrong.

373
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,560
Show Mr. Shen out.

374
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,520
No, thanks.

375
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,120
Xianrong.

376
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,480
Junshan.

377
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,520
Junshan.

378
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,880
Junshan.

379
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,960
Let me explain it.

380
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,080
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

381
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
I'm afraid that after you know this,

382
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,120
you would never talk to me.

383
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,960
Did you kill these labors

384
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
who were caught by Wu Bin?

385
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,000
Did you kill Zhang Yuzhi

386
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,800
from Minduo News?

387
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
Did you kill Lingdang's father,

388
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,320
that hunter?

389
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,480
Junshan.

390
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,360
And me.

391
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,640
On the birthday of the madam of Rong Mansion,

392
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,680
it was you who sent that man to kill me?

393
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,440
I didn't.

394
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,480
I just asked him to stop you

395
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,680
going to the feast.

396
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
I didn't mean to kill you.

397
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,760
You did a lot of evil things.

398
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,560
Do you think I can

399
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,960
still make friends with you?

400
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,480
But what can I do?

401
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,160
I have no choice.

402
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,640
I sympathize with your sufferings.

403
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,480
But this is not the reason for your sins.

404
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
I just want to tell you that

405
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,440
you lie to me.

406
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,040
I don't blame you.

407
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,280
But we have different views.

408
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,960
We were born to be enemies,

409
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,200
not friends.

410
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,920
You want to be an enemy of mine?

411
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,960
I just hope I

412
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,800
never meet you again.

413
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,840
The moon stirs the sad night

414
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,360
Fingers tell a sad story of the keyboard

415
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,640
The beautiful shoes are in the closet

416
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,080
But you are singing to the wind

417
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,960
The light yellowed the memory

418
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,320
Which captures the blur image

419
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,720
I am trapped in the dream

420
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,960
And I lost my way

421
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,600
The tango is under the moonlight

422
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,880
I just want you to hold my hand

423
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,000
Please don't say goodbye

424
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,040
Tonight belongs to us

425
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,560
The tango is under the moonlight

426
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,240
Now follow my beat

427
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,320
Be gentle to me before we separate

428
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,800
Hope the night can stay longer

429
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,960
You don't need to send me.

430
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Mr. Huang, thank you.

431
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,120
Miss. Qu, it's late.

432
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,040
Let me send you back.

433
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,160
Otherwise my boss will make

434
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,240
me suffer if he knows.

435
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,040
No, he won't.

436
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,880
Don't bother.

437
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,360
Go back now.

438
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,480
I can call a taxi.

439
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,640
Let me send you home.

440
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,560
OK.

441
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,200
Then I'll go.

442
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,200
Goodbye, Miss. Qu.

443
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,560
Farewell.

444
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,320
Alright.

445
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,880
Mr. Guo.

446
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,040
Why do you come out? It's late.

447
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,920
To deal with some business.

448
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm here to listen to your songs.

449
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Really?

450
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,920
I am here every day this week.

451
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
But I only see you today.

452
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,280
You are a real fan.

453
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,560
To be honest,

454
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,760
your voice is beautiful.

455
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,400
Thank you.

456
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
Are you being tracked these days?

457
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,360
It seems not.

458
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,760
Be careful.

459
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,080
Perhaps I can send you home

460
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,280
everyday

461
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,600
after your show.

462
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
What do you think?

463
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
No, thanks.

464
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,120
I really appreciate it.

465
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,040
But it will bother you.

466
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,000
Nothing bothers me.

467
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,200
I have nothing to do at home.

468
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,400
If you feel guilty,

469
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,960
you can take me as your driver

470
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,080
or bodyguard.

471
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,800
At the end of this month,

472
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,480
You can buy me some good drinks.

473
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,720
Who will hire a driver who drinks every day?

474
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,320
It makes sense.

475
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,480
I won't drink when I drive for you.

476
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,080
Good evening.

477
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,800
What happened?

478
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,920
Are you still angry with me?

479
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,800
I don't want to talk to you.

480
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,360
Why?

481
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Because you are annoying.

482
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,880
I know I was wrong.

483
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,720
I was just kidding.

484
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,840
Don't be angry.

485
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,520
Well, have an apple.

486
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,000
Hurry.

487
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,400
Take my apple.

488
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,800
Then stop being angry.

489
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,760
OK.

490
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,640
I don't blame you this time.

491
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,840
You forgive me?

492
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,120
Your sister hasn't forgiven me, right?

493
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,520
Could you help me to talk to her for me?

494
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,120
Please forgive him.

495
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,560
He knows he was wrong.

496
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,360
He didn't do this on purpose.

497
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,360
Alright.

498
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,000
For you sake,

499
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,040
I forgive him.

500
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,640
Really?

501
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,360
I am generous.

502
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,520
Are you happy?

503
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Give me a kiss.

504
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,720
Miss,

505
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,320
I cooked some noodles.

506
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Have a taste.

507
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,200
I have known

508
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,360
what you experienced before.

509
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,560
Others don't care about you.

510
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
But I do.

511
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,040
Why are you crying?

512
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,640
There's nothing to be sad about.

513
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,160
From today,

514
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,040
I won't cry for anyone.

515
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,160
Mr. Qi.

516
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,680
Please help us.

517
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,480
Don't worry.

518
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,360
I'll go to the south when I'm ready.

519
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,320
Thanks for your trust.

520
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,600
Our family and the treasures

521
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,600
will be safe

522
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,400
as long as I am here.

523
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,560
You are a really good friend.

524
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,600
Our country is at stake.

525
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
We should be together.

526
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,080
Alright.

527
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,680
Take care of yourself.

528
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,040
Farewell.

529
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,960
Take care.

530
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,520
I'll leave now.

531
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,040
OK.

532
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,000
Please.

533
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,680
I didn't get this even

534
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,920
I put a lot of efforts.

535
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,240
I can't believe you got it easily

536
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,720
and you gave it to others.

537
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,040
You also asked my staffs to help you.

538
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,960
Don't you go too far?

539
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,120
Why do you need that?

540
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,800
Sell it for money.

541
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,080
Did they find you again?

542
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,280
Listen.

543
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,000
Everything they did is illegal

544
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,080
and they will be sentenced to death.

545
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,920
It's dangerous that you

546
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,080
are with them.

547
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,760
Who else shall I be with?

548
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,150
You?

549
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,800
Forget it.

550
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,400
I'll stop here.

551
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,120
Wait for me.

552
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,160
What?

553
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,040
Nothing important.

554
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,840
Just a little gadget.

555
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,200
Song.

556
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,240
Where are you going?

557
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,080
You don't have lunch?

558
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,400
I

559
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,400
have a date.

560
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,320
I'll go out for lunch.

561
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,840
With whom?

562
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,240
Your sister. Xie Xiang.

563
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,320
Alright.

564
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
I have to stop here.

565
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,400
I'll leave.

566
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,800
See you.

567
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,880
You go in.

568
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,680
Huang Song.

569
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,920
Why are you here?

570
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:24,800
Xie Xiang.

571
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
I come to you on purpose.

572
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,120
Come to me?

573
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,760
For what?

574
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,840
A troupe from Beijing comes here.

575
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,760
This afternoon, they will perform

576
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,760
Ro...

577
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,240
Romeo and Juliet.

578
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,120
Right.

579
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,200
Romeo and Juliet.

580
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,320
I got two tickets

581
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
from my classmates.

582
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,000
Really?

583
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,680
Thank you.

584
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,080
Since I came to Shunyuan,

585
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,280
I haven't watched any performance.

586
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,640
I'm happy you like it.

587
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Let's go and watch.

588
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,040
Let's have lunch first.

589
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,760
I'm starving.

590
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,720
What?

591
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,680
Have lunch together?

592
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,320
Let's go.

593
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,360
Let's go for lunch.

594
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,760
Alright.

595
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,880
When you go down the stage,

596
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,040
follow her.

597
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,840
Don't be out of the light area.

598
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,120
Come. Assemble.

599
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,880
Assemble.

600
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,200
Come. Listen.

601
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,700
Tell them don't waste time.

602
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,560
Be ready!

603
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,000
Remember,

604
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,120
put your feelings in it.

605
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,440
Alright.

606
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,000
OK.

607
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,000
Well...

608
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,840
This is a musical.

609
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,240
So you should put yourselves in it.

610
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,680
Excuse me.

611
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,880
Excuse me.

612
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,480
Brother Meng?

613
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,520
Xie Xiang.

614
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
You send her to hospital.

615
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,160
The rest of you go back to rehearsal.

616
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,000
Go back now.

617
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,220
Alright.

618
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,040
Why are you here?

619
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,760
I know that there will be a performance.

620
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,680
So I come.

621
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,560
But I didn't think you are casts.

622
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,640
I know you are studying in Shunyuan.

623
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,400
It's been some days since

624
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,360
we began to perform here.

625
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,400
I didn't see you here.

626
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,000
It's surprising that I meet you here.

627
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,000
This is...

628
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,160
My friend.

629
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,520
Nice to meet you.

630
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,600
My name is Huang Song.

631
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,840
You can call me Song.

632
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,840
I am Liangchen and Xie Xiang's friend.

633
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,200
You know Liangchen?

634
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,400
Liangchen and I... I...

635
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,800
By the way,

636
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,120
what happened just now?

637
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,080
Don't mention that.

638
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,760
Look,

639
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,920
they are waiting for us at here.

640
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
Lvli got hurt when rehearsing.

641
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
So where do you think

642
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,840
I can find someone to replace her?

643
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,520
You go with me.

644
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,880
Brother Meng.

645
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,120
Chop. Chop.

646
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,880
Excuse me.

647
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,720
Excuse me.

648
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,600
Chop. Chop.

649
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,840
Here she is.

650
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,320
Bei.

651
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,120
Give her Lvli's spare costume.

652
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,600
Hurry.

653
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,360
Brother Meng, Yunyi.

654
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,400
I can't.

655
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,400
Why you can't.

656
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,080
The show must go on.

657
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,400
You've performed before, haven't you?

658
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,640
Yunyi. Hurry. Comb her hair.

659
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,560
Wanying.

660
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Give her some makeup. Hurry.

661
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,840
But I haven't performed for one year.

662
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,400
Please be quick.

663
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,280
Stop struggling.

664
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,160
Meng has delivered the order.

665
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,000
You must be on the stage.

666
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,720
Just perform.

667
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,240
Why do you come to Shunyuan to give shows?

668
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,880
Our sponsor that Meng introduced is from Shunyuan.

669
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,400
He supports us

670
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,080
more than 10 shows in Peking.

671
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,280
To repay him,

672
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
we came to Shunyuan.

673
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,080
What's up?

674
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,000
Are you nervous?

675
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,720
I haven't been on stage for long.

676
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,520
It's alright.

677
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,360
You can do it.

678
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,400
Lights on, the night is deep

679
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,840
Breeze blows through windows and doors

680
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,600
Ask from the bottom of the heart

681
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,240
Is the love true

682
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,880
The look in your eyes

683
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,400
Is engraved on my heart

684
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,760
Crystal clear like the moon

685
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,080
Yearnings deepen

686
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,000
So grateful in this life

687
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,080
You're here with me

688
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,960
Wind brings back the memory

689
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,520
In dream shall we meet

690
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,840
You're here, Mr. Shen.

691
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,160
Where is your brother?

692
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,400
He has something suddenly.

693
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,440
He asked me to come here

694
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,320
to say "sorry" to you.

695
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,000
So let's

696
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,120
have a seat.

697
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,200
OK.

698
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,280
Till death do us part

699
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,360
Don't idle away your youth

700
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,400
Is that Shen Junshan?

701
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,440
Dreams never stop

702
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,280
So grateful in this life

703
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,040
You're here with me

704
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,240
Wind brings back the memory

705
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,920
Yearnings deepen

706
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,680
Mr. Shen. I have something to do backstage.

707
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,440
I'll have a look. I'll be back.

708
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,080
Hope in this life

709
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,040
We'll love and cherish each other

710
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,680
Till death do us part

711
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,520
Don't idle away your youth

712
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,000
Dreams never stop

713
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,120
Xie Xiang.

714
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,120
You did a really good job.

715
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,560
Did you see the audiences' reaction?

716
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,840
We didn't see the impassioned scene

717
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,220
in Peking.

718
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,960
You're amazing.

719
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,960
-I'll go to change my clothes. -Come on.

720
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,880
You are really great.

721
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,240
Who are you?

722
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,160
What do you want to do?

723
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,720
I come to find someone.

724
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm here to find someone.

725
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,240
Junshan?

726
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,920
Stop.
