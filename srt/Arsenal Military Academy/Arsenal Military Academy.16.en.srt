Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 16

4
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Don't be hurried.

5
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,039
Wait a moment.

6
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,400
Chick.

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,080
Wait for me.

8
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,680
Chick.

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
Wait for me. Don't go.

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,960
A poem says that "how do singers know our national crisis.

11
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,420
They are still drown in the entertainment".

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
Our country is at stake,

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
facing a serious crisis.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,440
You joined the army at this time.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,330
You are setting a good example for others.

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,480
There are many ways of patriotism,

17
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,960
as long as we want and do.

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
You studied in Japan.

19
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Learning knowledge

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,480
is also a kind of patriotism.

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,120
Good eyes.

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
There is a saying of Hanfeizi that

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,520
when there is peace, the traitors are favoured,

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,240
and when there is a crisis, the loyal take the place.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,000
We never lack of the intelligent

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
from the past to the present.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,520
But

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,240
we lack of someone like you,

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,400
who dares to contribute

30
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,680
to our country now.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
Now that you think highly of Military Academy,

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,090
why don't you join the army?

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,440
That's the meaning of my return.

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,320
Really?

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,800
That's wonderful.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
Maybe we can be schoolmates.

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,400
Probably.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,600
Now our country is in danger,

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,800
which matters the future of our people.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Study?

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,890
What's the use of study?

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,380
You can't say that.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,960
It is still useful

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,240
to learn the advanced knowledge.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,120
Is it entirely useless of our

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,900
long-term study in Japan?

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,080
Japan is near us and our cultures have similarities.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,680
What we should do is studying

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
from each other to make progresses.

50
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,120
Xie Liancheng

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,840
has a different idea?

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,960
We are peers.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,400
Just have a casual talk during the boring trip.

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,480
You are welcomed to show your idea.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
I think

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,400
Japan gained a complete victory in the Sino-Japanese War,

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
then it conquered Korea.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
What's more, it beat Russia in the northeast.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Japan has been invincible in Eastern Asia.

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,920
Japan's territory is not large,

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,860
but it is puffed up with ambition.

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,300
Under this situation,

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,520
I don't think it's right

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,680
to hold the idea of

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,420
studying from each other.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,880
He's right.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,480
You are right.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
I didn't do a deep study.

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,250
Just say something casual.

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,810
These years,

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,530
reports of demise of nations are everywhere.

72
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,390
That's not fresh to the public.

73
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,480
But most people just blow off some steam.

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,160
They all talk books away,

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,280
but few of them

76
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,890
put them into practice.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,480
10 years ago,

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
our government helped Japan against Russia,

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,680
which was cooperating with a wolf against a tiger.

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,560
You joined the army

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,720
in the north

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,400
during this stirring time.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,659
Obviously,

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,600
you are not a talker.

85
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,060
I'm flattered.

86
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
After arriving in Peking,

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,260
we'll have meetings with students in there.

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,180
You are welcomed to join us

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,500
if you have interests.

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,280
Thank you.

91
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,400
If you are available,

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
come to my house.

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,330
Is there something?

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Look at it.

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,880
Your affair with that actress

96
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,680
takes up a lot of space.

97
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,800
I can't be relaxed even when reading newspapers.

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,480
Really?

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Let me check their photo technique.

100
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,500
So bad! I don't look handsome.

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,080
Is this your important thing?

102
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
I'll go back now.

103
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Wait a moment.

104
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Have a seat.

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,370
Your mom has arrived in Peking to see your sister.

106
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
I am leaving for Peking today.

107
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,960
Don't make troubles

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,200
during this time, OK?

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,400
Peking?

110
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,010
I'll go with you.

111
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,920
Why?

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm bored.

113
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,100
There's no interest staying here alone.

114
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Can you feel bored?

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,400
Wait for me. I'll pack up my belongings.

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,800
The train is leaving in the afternoon.

117
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,570
Xiang, you are back!

118
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,760
Give me.

119
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,200
It's mine.

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,810
Xiang, you are back.

121
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,280
You push me.

122
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Go there.

123
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,520
Check.

124
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
Xiang, you are back.

125
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
How are you?

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,040
You become darker and thinner.

127
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
Are you overwhelmed at school?

128
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Mom.

129
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Keep it.

130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
I am slimmer.

131
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
What slimmer?

132
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,770
Is the food in your school not good?

133
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,960
Pretty good.

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,960
Xiang.

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Feng'an is not peaceful now.

136
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,800
I know from your dad that

137
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,360
the Japanese have submitted the Twenty-one Demands

138
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,840
to the government,

139
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,020
and sent more reinforcements there.

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,080
Meanwhile, the students are always

141
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,960
parading on the streets,

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,400
claiming that the war is coming.

143
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,560
Your dad and I are so worried.

144
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,240
There is no difference in terms of study.

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,100
You don't have to stay in Feng'an.

146
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,159
Mom.

147
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,480
By the way.

148
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Mr. Sun has left Nanking, and he is teaching

149
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
in Zhongshan Medical University.

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,380
Your dad visited him just now.

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,240
Can you

152
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,159
study in Peking?

153
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,200
Mom,

154
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
I want to stay in Feng'an.

155
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,760
But...

156
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,480
Mom,

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,440
I know what I'm doing.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,730
Please let me study in Feng'an.

159
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,330
My brother left us in there.

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,490
I'm always thinking

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,840
I can be closer to him.

162
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,480
Xiang.

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,200
Xiang.

164
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,400
Open the door.

165
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,800
Hi.

166
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,600
Xiang.

167
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,290
Who is out there?

168
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
Someone on a wrong path.

169
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,290
Someone on a wrong path?

170
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
The one is still here. Come.

171
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,800
Open the door.

172
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,920
Mr. Xie.

173
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,410
Nice to meet you.

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,320
Who are you?

175
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,900
He is my classmate.

176
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
You are studying at a girls' school.

177
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,160
Why do you have a male classmate?

178
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,320
Tan Xiaojun is my friend.

179
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,360
Through her,

180
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,180
I made friends with Xie Xiang.

181
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
This time,

182
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,160
I deal with some business with my father here.

183
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,360
So I come to visit you specially.

184
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,720
I apologize if I offend.

185
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,360
I see.

186
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,640
Come in.

187
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,240
Thank you.

188
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,360
This is...

189
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,840
Nice to meet you.

190
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,720
He is Xiaojun's friend.

191
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,280
Xiaojun's friend?

192
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,960
I am also Xie Xiang' s friend.

193
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,900
Sorry for my abrupt visit.

194
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,760
This is a gift for you.

195
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Come. Come in.

196
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,240
Come, have a seat.

197
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,560
Please.

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,360
After you.

199
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,080
OK.

200
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,800
Tell me

201
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,680
who this boy is.

202
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,360
He is just a friend of Xiaojun's.

203
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,420
Why does Xiaojun's friend come here?

204
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,080
You are a good liar.

205
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,920
Tell me the truth.

206
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,210
Are you in a relationship with him?

207
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
You don't want to come back

208
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,520
because of him?

209
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,120
Mom, what are you saying?

210
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm in a relationship?

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,640
Even though I'm in a relationship,

212
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
I won't be with him.

213
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,680
So why does he come here

214
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,010
and bring a lot of gifts?

215
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,280
How can I know?

216
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,960
Yunzhi.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,730
Could you bring us some tea?

218
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
OK.

219
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll ask you later.

220
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,080
Your father is Vice Minister Gu?

221
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,520
He often mentioned you to me.

222
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,720
He told me that you, the mainstay of

223
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,200
the Peking academic circle and education,

224
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,930
have a wide range of knowledge.

225
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,600
And you are a good example

226
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,280
for our young generation.

227
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,680
I also admire you so much.

228
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,360
I read carefully all of the articles

229
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,160
written by you on North Sea Daily

230
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,680
and Eastern Morning News.

231
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Especially the latest one, the one about

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,130
primitive accumulation of capital in Western society,

233
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,080
is really amazing

234
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,720
and thought-provoking.

235
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
My father brings that newspaper

236
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,280
to Peking especially

237
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,080
to let the politicians

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
who don't fulfil their duties

239
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,760
know what

240
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,960
inspiring good advice is.

241
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,280
I'm flattered.

242
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,640
Is Gu Yanzhen crazy?

243
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
Where did he find these?

244
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,920
Mr. Gu

245
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,240
is the one who I respect the most.

246
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,490
The Japanese pressed us to sign unequal demands.

247
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,920
It was Mr. Gu who helped us

248
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,500
to reverse the situation.

249
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,680
If there are more officers

250
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,320
like Mr. Gu,

251
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
the future of our country

252
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,480
will be hopeful.

253
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,720
Thank you.

254
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,160
I'm telling the truth.

255
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,680
My father always says that

256
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
he is just an ordinary officer,

257
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,200
but the intelligent people

258
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,410
like you are the hope of our nation.

259
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
Especially during the turbulent days,

260
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,960
even 100 politicians

261
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,490
can't equal one intellect.

262
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,120
Since politicians can only balance the conflict

263
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,520
based on the existed situation temporarily.

264
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,280
But people like you

265
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,240
guide us to a brand new

266
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,000
and right way in dark.

267
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,560
Pickthank.

268
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,360
Mr. Gu.

269
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,160
Just call me Yanzhen.

270
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
Mr. Gu,

271
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,600
how did you get to know

272
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,240
our Xiang?

273
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,840
We met at a trip

274
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,400
organized by Xiaojun.

275
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,880
I see.

276
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,760
Have you been to Feng'an?

277
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,720
No.

278
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,480
You are from the south?

279
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes.

280
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,340
I'm from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu.

281
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,740
It's no wonder that

282
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,400
you are elegant,

283
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,520
which makes you distinguished from others.

284
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,580
Since Jiangsu cultivates beauties.

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,460
From the moment I entered,

286
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,280
I have known that there must be

287
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,200
a well-educated hostess

288
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
in this family when I saw

289
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,760
the furnishing in this house.

290
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,400
What a sweet boy.

291
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,480
Yes.

292
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,960
Stay here for lunch.

293
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,490
I'll cook good food for you.

294
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm preparing lunch now.

295
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:16,760
No!

296
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,280
Thanks.

297
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm looking forward to your cooking.

298
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Thank you a lot.

299
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,460
Come, have a cup of tea.

300
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,320
OK.

301
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
Who asks you to come here?

302
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,730
Why are you here?

303
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm here to visit your parents.

304
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Who asks you to do this?

305
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,760
It's normal that

306
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
I come to visit them

307
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,680
for we are close friends

308
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,880
and living under one roof.

309
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
Don't you think so?

310
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,440
You...

311
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,240
Hush.

312
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,640
Be quiet. Don't let your parents hear.

313
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,760
Rogue.

314
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,680
I know.

315
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,140
You are on purpose.

316
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,020
You can tell it.

317
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,960
You just want me to suffer.

318
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
I could have been enjoying my break

319
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,160
if you were not here to bother me.

320
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,680
It's weird that

321
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,480
you are not happy when seeing me.

322
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,130
I thought you missed me.

323
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,700
You think too much.

324
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,320
Actually,

325
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,920
I just want to visit

326
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,200
the parents who

327
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
bring up a daughter...

328
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,280
the parents who

329
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,960
bring up a daughter disguising herself

330
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,760
like a man to study at a military academy.

331
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,290
It's none of your business.

332
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,960
Go back immediately after lunch.

333
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,520
Do you hear me?

334
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,580
Depends on my mood.

335
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,440
Gu Yanzhen!

336
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,200
Alright. I know.

337
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,920
Your parents don't know that

338
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,050
we have been living together for long.

339
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,840
Why would your dad ask me to stay?

340
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,640
I have no excuse to stay.

341
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,640
Mind your words.

342
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,010
Who has been living together with you?

343
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,120
You look quite good in the lady's dress.

344
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,560
You don't expose anything.

345
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,360
But man's wear suits you better.

346
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,720
Xiang.

347
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,640
Mr. Gu, come for lunch.

348
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,520
OK.

349
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,560
I'm going to have lunch.

350
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,620
Will you go with me?

351
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
We didn't know you would come today,

352
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,880
so we didn't prepare anything special.

353
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,940
These are homely dishes. Quite good.

354
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,680
Here's another dish.

355
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,920
Come.

356
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,640
Have a seat.

357
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,200
OK.

358
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
These are all homely.

359
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Help yourself.

360
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
Smells good.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,160
I should behave well

362
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,160
for this is my first time to come.

363
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,320
But I may wolf down

364
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,640
since the dishes are so inviting.

365
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,800
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

366
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Help yourself.

367
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,460
Make yourself at home.

368
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,760
Can you drink?

369
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,680
Yes.

370
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,760
I have no reason to refuse it

371
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,080
even if I can't drink much.

372
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,810
That's good.

373
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,800
Let me do it.

374
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,080
Xiang,

375
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,380
how can you let our guest do it?

376
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,480
Leave it to me.

377
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,829
Dad.

378
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,720
Come.

379
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,680
Mr. Xie, toast to you.

380
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,520
Wish you and Mrs. Xie

381
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
healthy and well-off.

382
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,880
Thank you.

383
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,280
Sit down.

384
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Come, have a seat.

385
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,800
Also have a taste

386
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,040
of the dishes.

387
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,240
OK. Thank you so much.

388
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,840
You are welcome.

389
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
I'm happy that you love my cooking.

390
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I don't know whether you like this flavour.

391
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,160
So delicious.

392
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
Mrs. Xie, you are able to run

393
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,160
a restaurant in Peking with this skill.

394
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,600
I just cook as usual.

395
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,640
That can't be called as "skill".

396
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,800
Mrs. Xie, what I said is the truth.

397
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,480
I tasted the dishes made by

398
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,280
the royal chefs of Qing Dynasty.

399
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,480
I think

400
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,140
you are much better than them.

401
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,320
Really?

402
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,960
That's enough.

403
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,960
You performed too much.

404
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,760
Xiang.

405
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Mind your manner.

406
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,640
Mom,

407
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
how can you stand

408
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,850
his exaggerated words?

409
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,680
This is courtesy.

410
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
He's not like you.

411
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,320
Look at you.

412
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,780
You are not restrained during this year.

413
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
Xie Xiang is too young

414
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,290
to understand this.

415
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,370
She's not young.

416
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,360
You are not much older than her.

417
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,360
But

418
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,560
you speak and behave

419
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,640
much better than her.

420
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,280
It's our fault that she is like this.

421
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,440
Yes.

422
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,160
Have a taste.

423
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,440
-Help yourself. -OK.

424
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,960
Who lets you in?

425
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,720
Get out.

426
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,080
Is this your room?

427
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,480
So small.

428
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,360
Of course it's smaller than your mansion.

429
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,120
Get out.

430
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm asking you to get out.

431
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,540
Mr. and Mrs. Xie, I must leave now.

432
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,480
See you.

433
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,970
You will spend more days in Peking, right?

434
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,000
Hope to see you next time.

435
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,960
OK.

436
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
I'll miss here for

437
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,920
Mrs. Xie' s cooking is amazing.

438
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,800
Xiang,

439
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,240
show Yanzhen out.

440
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,320
Why do I have to show an adult out?

441
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,720
Please be courteous.

442
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,600
This is his first time to be here,

443
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,660
and he is our guest.

444
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,280
Do you think it's polite to treat him like this?

445
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Right.

446
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,120
Alright.

447
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
I'll show him out.

448
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,920
Don't you go?

449
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,290
Mr. and Mrs. Xie.

450
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,560
See you.

451
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,260
Have a nice day.

452
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,120
See you.

453
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,840
Let's go.

454
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,120
Hello, Hong.

455
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,080
Why do you go so fast?

456
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
Alright, you go alone.

457
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,440
Don't be so hardhearted.

458
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,120
I saw you off at the train station when you left.

459
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,170
You talked nonsense at my home!

460
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,450
Did I go to your home?

461
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,360
You are welcomed to come.

462
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,440
Meaningless conversation.

463
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
I'll stay in Peking for several days.

464
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
I treat you meals.

465
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,880
No, thanks.

466
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,960
Don't be too polite.

467
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,320
I'll be waiting for you at here

468
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,250
at 8am tomorrow.

469
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,560
I'll find you at your home

470
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,920
if you don't come.

471
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,400
Gu Yanzhen,

472
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,760
don't go too far.

473
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,100
I'll take it as a "yes".

474
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
See you tomorrow.

475
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,050
What's going on?

476
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,250
Don't worry.

477
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,620
Everything is under our control.

478
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,140
Where are these students?

479
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
They've arrived.

480
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,080
Our men have gone into their march,

481
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,740
keeping a close watch on them.

482
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,240
When they get to Peking,

483
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,200
no one of them can live.

484
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,970
Now that these students

485
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,840
don't know what it means

486
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,880
and come to death in Peking,

487
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,770
we'll send them to hell.

488
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,840
He asked me to come but he is not here?

489
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,200
Run?

490
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,120
How dare you run?

491
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,120
Dodge?

492
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
Dodge?

493
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,440
Dodge?

494
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,800
Dodge?

495
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,980
I'll give you a bigger one.

496
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,160
How old are you?

497
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,280
Still play such childish game with kids?

498
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,680
Aren't you embarrassed?

499
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,120
I didn't come back for one year.

500
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,720
There's no change in Peking.

501
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,010
What change can it have?

502
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,720
I'll go back

503
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,760
if you don't have other things.

504
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,360
My mom is waiting for me to have lunch.

505
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,920
Good.

506
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,640
I'm hungry now.

507
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,300
Let's have lunch at your home.

508
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,020
You don't want me to go?

509
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,760
That's easy.

510
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,210
You accompany me to eat something.

511
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,440
Rogue.

512
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,280
I have put up with

513
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,960
this word.

514
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,180
What do you want to eat?

515
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,900
Hotpot is the best partner

516
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,370
of the cold weather.

517
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,300
He Restaurant?

518
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,460
Or Tan Restaurant?

519
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,680
Or we go to eat roast duck?

520
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,080
Lucky Here

521
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
or Cheap Tavern?

522
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,520
Choose one.

523
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,440
Give me some advice.

524
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,840
Don't be silent.

525
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,920
Barbecue, sheep soup

526
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,840
or western food?

527
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,120
French

528
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
or Japanese dish?

529
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,580
I want soya bean milk and fried bread.

530
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,500
Can you change to another one?

531
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,920
I can't eat these.

532
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,280
Whatever.

533
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,800
Enjoy your lunch.

534
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,440
Thank you.

535
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,840
This is not for people.

536
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
Stay hungry if you don't eat.

537
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,600
Nice to meet you.

538
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,530
I'm Lin Xianwei.

539
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,280
Nice to meet you.

540
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,120
I'm Chen Rong.

541
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,200
This is Lu Yong, my classmate.

542
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,130
Nice to meet you.

543
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,570
Nice to meet you.

544
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,600
They are our main members.

545
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,850
Nice to meet you.

546
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,880
Are all our members here?

547
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,440
No.

548
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
To guarantee our safety,

549
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,080
only those most important ones come.

550
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Others are awaiting orders at the rest area.

551
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,760
OK.

552
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,920
This is not a good place for talking.

553
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,650
Let's go to Lu Yong's house now.

554
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,160
Is it convenient to go there?

555
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,680
Yes.

556
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,640
There's no other one at my house.

557
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,860
It's a quiet place.

558
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,080
It's a safety zone.

559
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,840
Our classmates

560
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,640
are also waiting for us at there.

561
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,440
OK.

562
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Let's go. OK.

563
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,720
Go.

564
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,370
Where is this place?

565
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,180
Would you like to go in?

566
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,530
Is someone living here?

567
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,320
No.

568
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,360
Why is it so clean?

569
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,420
The servants come to clean every once in a while.

570
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,680
Come.

571
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,220
Is this your family photo?

572
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,200
You looked quite good when you were young.

573
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,880
Of course.

574
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,450
I don't have my mom's photo.

575
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,930
This may be the last one.

576
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,360
Your mom...

577
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,040
She passed away

578
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
when I was eight.

579
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,720
I'm sorry.

580
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,760
You don't need to apologize.

581
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,050
Don't show me this expression.

582
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,900
My stepmother treats me well.

583
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,040
My mother was different.

584
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,120
The things in this house

585
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,250
were all the weapons she used to hit me.

586
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,540
My mom also always hits me.

587
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,820
Only mom does this,

588
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,720
which proves that she loves you.

589
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,400
Really?

590
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,700
Your mom is beautiful.

591
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,360
Yes.

592
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,690
She spent her whole life on beauty.

593
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,240
She fulfilled her wish by

594
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
leaving us at her most glorious age.

595
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,120
Take it for me.

596
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,420
Give me that when we get to school.

597
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,410
Why don't you keep it yourself?

598
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm afraid that I lose it.

599
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,780
Don't blame me if I lose it.

600
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,720
Do you dare?

601
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,440
Xianwei.

602
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,160
Everybody,

603
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,520
welcome back.

604
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,080
Calamity is the touchstone of a man.

605
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
On behalf of the students in Peking,

606
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,050
I thank you a lot.

607
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
Chen Rong,

608
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,920
this is what we should do.

609
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,080
Now our nation is in danger.

610
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,040
Our young generation should do our best

611
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,970
to protect our country and people.

612
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,810
So many music instruments.

613
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,780
Can you play the piano?

614
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,040
Of course.

615
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,560
Who am I?

616
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,810
Is there anything I don't know?

617
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,560
Play it for me.

618
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,480
Why do I listen to you?

619
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,340
You were bragging.

620
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,890
My mom didn't have hobbies,

621
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,410
but she liked celebrating birthdays.

622
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,960
She bought music instruments on her birthdays.

623
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,440
In our family,

624
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,520
"happy birthday" means "I love you".

625
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,450
But she could dance.

626
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,900
Does it still work?

627
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,160
I don't know.

628
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,360
Can you dance?

629
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,680
Yes.

630
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,200
Dance with me.

631
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,400
Why do I listen to you?

632
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
Everybody,

633
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,440
the Twenty-one Demands

634
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,970
put forward by the Japanese

635
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,490
is a shame of our nation.

636
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,960
Looking back at the shames during our

637
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,920
hundreds of years' of history,

638
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,050
none was equal to the one we are facing.

639
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,360
If it goes on,

640
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,320
our nation will disappear soon.

641
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,120
Parades

642
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,040
and protests

643
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,800
are everywhere

644
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
in Guangzhou,

645
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,560
Shanghai, Hong Kong,

646
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
Nanking and Wuhan.

647
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,960
So,

648
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,000
we go back from Japan

649
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,670
to join the students in Peking

650
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,370
to make our voice heard,

651
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,000
telling the weak government

652
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,400
that we never compromise.

653
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Never compromise.

654
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,460
Never compromise.

655
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,680
The route of our parade is

656
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,920
going north from the west crossing of Legation Street,

657
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
and passing Wealth Road, Horse Lane

658
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,240
and North Street,

659
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,210
getting to Tan Restaurant.

660
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,360
We should contact the students in every school.

661
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,760
Wear our school uniforms and make slogans.

662
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,700
The slogans must accord with our subject

663
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,160
which is objecting to the Twenty-one Demands and

664
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,220
the Japan's occupation of Tsingtao.

665
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,280
Chop.

666
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,600
Students who studied in Japan have signed.

667
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,440
We are nobody now,

668
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
but we should have great ambitions.

669
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,680
The blood letter can prove this.

670
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,720
Hurry. Let's go.

671
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,520
Lu Yong!

672
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,560
Go.

673
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,960
I'll kill you.

674
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,720
Lin Xianwei,

675
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,000
are you all right?

676
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,600
All right.

677
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,250
We are patriotic students.

678
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,480
These are killers sent by the Japanese.

679
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,440
Lu Yong.

680
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,480
Lu Yong.

681
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Lu Yong.

682
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,400
Lu Yong.

683
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,280
Hurry.

684
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,640
How dare you arrest me?

685
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,440
Are you blind?

686
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:53,960
Go.

687
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,320
Hurry.

688
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,700
What are you doing?

689
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,920
Don't touch her.

690
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,640
Do you want to die?

691
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,340
Stop wasting time on talking.

692
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,200
Arrest them.

693
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,040
Go.

694
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,970
It was the Japanese.

695
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,320
Didn't you see that?

696
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,560
The Japanese killed my classmates. Go.

697
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,220
Be quick. It was the Japanese.

698
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,200
Go up. Chop.

699
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,840
Hurry.

700
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,320
Hurry.

701
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,960
Go in.

702
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,960
Go up.

703
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,840
What should we do?

704
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,220
Go to Song Maogong.

705
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,920
Yes.

706
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,960
We didn't kill anyone.

707
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,090
It was the Japanese.

708
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,800
My classmate is still alive.

709
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,440
Be quiet.

710
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,760
Sir?

711
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Are you all right?

712
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,840
I'm fine.

713
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,770
My family will be worried about me.

714
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,130
Don't worry.

715
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,530
Let me think of a way.

716
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,640
Xie.

717
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,440
Why do you pretend to be a man?

718
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,200
I have my difficulty.

719
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,880
You don't need to worry any more.

720
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,280
It has nothing to do with you.

721
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,880
You'll be released when they make it clear.

722
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,580
When did you meet these students?

723
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,120
When I was on the train to Peking.

724
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,400
Don't contact them frequently.

725
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,970
Follow me out later.

726
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,640
They are good people.

727
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,480
We can't leave them here.

728
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,120
There are many good people.

729
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,130
How can you take care of all of them?

730
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,040
Alright.

731
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
It's fine that you want to save them.

732
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,380
When I go out, I'll think about it.

733
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,980
But you must promise me

734
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,440
to follow me out.

735
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,320
Instead of catching

736
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,780
the murderers, you police

737
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,000
prison us with no reason.

738
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,720
Is there still justice?

739
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
We are patriotic students

740
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,160
who studied in Japan.

741
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,760
Let us out.

742
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,960
Why do you arrest us without a reason?

743
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,400
You don't have right to prison us.

744
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,280
Let us out.

745
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,140
You don't have right to prison us.

746
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,800
So noisy!

747
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,720
Let us out.

748
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,080
Be quiet!

749
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,280
Stay quietly.

750
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,880
And you.

751
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,810
Don't make mess.

752
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,940
Why don't you students

753
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,560
live a peaceful life

754
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,680
instead of making trouble all day?

755
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,610
What do you want?

756
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,740
It takes me a lot of time

757
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,540
and strength to catch you.

758
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,880
Do you still want to go out

759
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,480
after this big event when

760
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,880
many people lost their lives?

761
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,960
They were not killed by us.

762
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
No. The Japanese did it.

763
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,000
We didn't kill others. Let us out!

764
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,800
The victims are our classmates.

765
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,240
Why should I trust you?

766
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,520
We have evidence.

767
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,760
Evidence?

769
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,240

770
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,040
Let us out!

771

Calm down. Is there still justice?

772
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,930
When is the hearing?

773
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,620

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,450
Three to five days at least.

One or two years can also be possible.

777
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,400
Don't hurry.

778
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,000
You! You are flunkies!

779
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,680
You are traitors!

780
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,800
