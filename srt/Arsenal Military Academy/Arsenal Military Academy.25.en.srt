Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,500
Episode 25

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,920
Sir.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,520
Come in.

6
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,840
Sir, you asked for me?

7
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,840
We have

8
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,050
a glorious yet difficult task for you.

9
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,440
You must spare no efforts

10
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,520
to complete the task successfully.

11
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Yes.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Consider it done.

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,759
But sir,

14
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,620
what's my task?

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
You must protect

16
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,759
Ms. Qu Manting 24/7.

17
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,920
What?

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,650
Protecting her?

19
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,480
Why?

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
Here's the thing,

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,960
Ms. Qu Manting

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,760
offended the Japanese

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,240
to safeguard the national

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,570
interests and dignity.

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,000
Her life is at stake.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,840
You must protect her 24/7.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,480
But why me?

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,160
Why can't it be you?

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,560
Qu Manting,

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
what are you up to?

31
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,610
Are you picking on me again?

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
-I... -Watch your attitude!

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,079
Where are your manners?

34
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,340
What have I taught you?

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Sorry, Sergeant.

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Give this task to others.

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,100
You know my grade is only average.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
Protecting Ms. Qu is such an

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,000
important and risky task.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,079
It's beyond my capability.

41
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,610
Soldiers must obey orders.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
My exam is coming soon.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,760
When you finished your task,

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
you'll be given a pass

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,880
for your exam.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
Can that work?

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,620
I'm your sergeant.

48
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,480
It's my call.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
Don't you like Gu Yanzhen?

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,780
Why didn't you ask for him?

51
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:07,880
You...

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,120
Listen,

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,120
I suggest you

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
be careful with what you say.

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
I might have said something

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,960
that offended you once.

57
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,079
Is this some sort of revenge?

58
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,400
I swear

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm in desperate need of your help.

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
I'll listen to you.

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,800
I won't trick you.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
The hell you say!

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,640
Sir,

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,920
please reconsider it.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,880
I'm not up for the job.

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,400
Enough.

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,700
Obey the order!

68
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,840
Yes.

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,960
What do you think our Academy is?

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,579
Some random person

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,850
can just take away my students?

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:48,920
Sergeant Lv,

73
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
thank goodness, you're here.

74
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,480
You're absolutely right.

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,079
I'm a student at the Academy.

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
My duty is to protect our nation

77
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,240
as well as our people.

78
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm not some bodyguard.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,240
This is...

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Let me introduce.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,440
This is

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,130
Qu Huaishu's daughter,

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,880
Qu Manting.

84
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,400
Hello.

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,160
I believe you all know my father.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,640
We're

87
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,240
acquaintances.

88
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,680
What brings you

89
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,520
here today?

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,740
Let me explain,

91
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,320
someone is stalking her.

92
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,520
She wants our Academy

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
to send students to protect her.

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
She has been stalked?

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
Sending our students

96
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,360
to protect her isn't enough.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,560
We should report this to the police

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,640
and have them investigate it

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,760
and find the stalker.

100
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,000
Adopting passive defense alone

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,280
isn't the wisest.

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,320
Correct.

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,880
Let's

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
treat this task

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,920
as an exercise.

106
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,440
Yes.

107
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
That's a good idea.

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,240
Thank you,

109
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,960
but that's unnecessary.

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,159
So far, it's just

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,570
my speculation.

112
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,640
There's no need to make a fuss.

113
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,370
Xie Liangchen alone is enough.

114
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,720
But Ms. Qu,

115
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,000
he's at the bottom of all courses.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,200
I'm afraid he isn't able to protect you.

117
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,480
Sir,

118
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
my fitness test score is low,

119
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
but all my other scores are high.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,400
I trust him.

121
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,680
I have faith in him.

122
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,360
The thing is we've known each for a while

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,090
so it's easy for us to get along.

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,200
Well...

125
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Alright.

126
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,590
If you have other needs,

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
feel free to let me know.

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,480
Thanks.

129
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,060
Xie Liangchen,

130
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,160
go make preparations

131
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,120
and leave with Ms. Qu.

132
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,170
When can I come back?

133
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
Only when Ms. Qu's safety is guaranteed,

134
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
can you come back.

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Yes.

136
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,720
Well...

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,400
Thank you both very much.

138
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,159
Sorry to bother you.

139
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,159
I'm leaving then.

140
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,360
Thanks.

141
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,440
Let's go.

142
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,840
Oh well,

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
what can I say?

144
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm too charming.

145
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,350
Nobody can resist my charm.

146
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
What on earth do you want?

147
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,150
I want you to protect me.

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,060
Give me a break.

149
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,740
You don't need my protection.

150
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,200
I know you're plotting something.

151
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,000
Smarty,

152
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,850
you're wrong this time.

153
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,440
Look,

154
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,600
I have something great for you.

155
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,320
Go back.

156
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,940
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

157
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,760
Junshan,

158
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,530
where are you going?

159
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm going to get some water.

160
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,080
Wait a minute.

161
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll go with you.

162
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,040
No, no.

163
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,560
I have something else to do.

164
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
I'll go later.

165
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,490
What are you looking at?

166
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,580
What's their problem?

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,400
Are they insane?

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,900
Gu Yanzhen,

169
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,280
can you talk to Qu Manting?

170
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,840
She likes you. Tell her to pick you to be her bodyguard.

171
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,760
Why me?

172
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,210
She likes me,

173
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,680
so what?

174
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm handsome.

175
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,640
Tons of people

176
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,720
like me.

177
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,120
You...

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,640
Are you jealous?

179
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,760
Of course not.

180
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't want to be her lackey.

181
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,480
Really?

182
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,130
I'm done talking to you.

183
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,850
Did you hear that

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,680
someone brought a coffin

185
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
to Her Ladyship in the Rong Mansion?

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,160
Ms. Qu, welcome.

187
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,600
Ms. Qu.

188
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,840
How come there is no people here?

189
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,700
Why would people come in daytime?

190
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,440
Ms. Qu,

191
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,280
what brings you here today?

192
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,340
I'm here to see Tao.

193
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,090
Let me go get him for you.

194
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,880
Thank you.

195
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,370
You're welcome.

196
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,160
I heard it.

197
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,280
It's gone viral.

198
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,440
Who is that person?

199
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,160
So bold.

200
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,500
Don't know.

201
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,530
It's said that Lord Rong adopted a girl

202
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
but she was kidnapped

203
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,120
by a trafficker.

204
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Considering what happened,

205
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,020
she wasn't kidnapped.

206
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,140
I bet they sold her to the trafficker.

207
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,400
They sold her?

208
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,460
I also know that girl's name is Xianrong.

209
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,120
She seems

210
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,370
to be a Japanese.

211
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,640
Xianrong?

212
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,240
Xianrong.

213
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,200
Xianrong.

214
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,960
What are you doing here?

215
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,090
I came to check on you

216
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,740
and brought you some food.

217
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,960
Thanks.

218
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,120
Hey,

219
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,130
I have something to ask you.

220
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,760
What is it?

221
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,960
Have you

222
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,120
been seeing the Japanese lately?

223
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Someone saw you in the Japan COC.

224
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,640
I went there

225
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
for business.

226
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,880
I thought so.

227
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,360
Right now,

228
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
you should be careful

229
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,440
when doing business with them.

230
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,960
I know.

231
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Who told you that?

232
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,930
Someone in the chamber?

233
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
A friend passed by there

234
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,160
and saw you.

235
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,440
I'll go put them down.

236
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,960
Wait a minute.

237
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,480
OK.

238
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,100
Xie Liangchen.

239
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,180
Xie Liangchen.

240
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,240
Stop yelling!

241
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,610
Come down right now!

242
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,200
Ms. Qu,

243
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,360
do you still remember me?

244
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,840
You are...

245
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,480
We met once in Panshan.

246
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,280
You were there with Shen Junshan, right?

247
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,880
No wonder you look familiar.

248
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,400
Your surname is...

249
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,960
It's Jin.

250
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,530
Hello, Miss Jin.

251
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,880
Long time no see.

252
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,680
You've become prettier, Ms. Qu.

253
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,560
You're not bad yourself.

254
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,540
What's wrong with you?

255
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Hi, Xianrong.

256
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,480
Are you looking for Junshan?

257
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,140
I just saw him going upstairs.

258
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,200
OK.

259
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,960
You guys talk,

260
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,490
I'll go wait for him inside.

261
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,890
What's her name?

262
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,440
Jin Xianrong.

263
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,770
Haven't you met before?

264
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,680
Jin Xianrong.

265
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
Have you obtained the objects?

266
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I have.

267
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,840
Miss Jin has left.

268
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Retreat.

269
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,280
Retreat.

270
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,920
Xianrong?

271
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,880
Gosh, it's her!

272
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
What's wrong?

273
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,400
You know

274
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,060
that incident happened in the Rong Mansion

275
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,880
a few days ago?

276
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,040
I heard about it.

277
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,920
I heard someone brought a coffin to the birthday celebration.

278
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,850
Do you know who brought the coffin?

279
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,600
Who was it?

280
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,600
Don't tell me it was her!

281
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,280
It was!

282
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,380
There were more than that.

283
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,400
After the coffin arrived,

284
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,880
a bunch of men broke in

285
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,920
and started stabbing people.

286
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,960
Luckily, I was smart,

287
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,420
otherwise, I'd die there.

288
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,570
I heard from them

289
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,240
their leader's name

290
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,080
was Xianrong.

291
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,200
Are those Japanese?

292
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,130
How would I know?

293
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,010
Their Chinese were fluent.

294
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,390
But they used Japanese swords.

295
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,660
Gosh!

296
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,790
Where are you going?

297
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,660
I have to tell Shen Junshan.

298
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,480
You have no evidence.

299
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,840
How would he believe you?

300
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,960
You're the evidence.

301
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,600
Me?

302
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,160
Come on.

303
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,280
If she really is the one behind the attack,

304
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,480
she'll kill me!

305
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,720
Why would I report her? I don't want to die.

306
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,360
Besides,

307
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,080
I came to you for another business

308
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,640
more important than this.

309
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,170
Let's go.

310
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,960
What?

311
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,120
You'd better behave yourself,

312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,280
or I'll report to Director Guo.

313
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Don't drag me.

314
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,800
Where are you taking me?

315
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,060
You don't need to know.

316
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,920
Stop it.

317
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,640
You've crossed the line.

318
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,980
Qu Manting.

319
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,320
How could you do this?

320
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,440
Shut up.

321
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,620
Don't you know me well enough?

322
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,040
I need a favor.

323
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,440
What is it?

324
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,440
Why did you bring me here?

325
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,480
It's for your good.

326
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,930
What do you mean?

327
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
I've prepared a gift for you.

328
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,000
Half of the young ladies in Shunyuan

329
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,530
are all at this racecourse.

330
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,440
Tell me if there's anyone you like.

331
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,680
I'll fix you two up.

332
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,560
Are you a matchmaker now?

333
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm trying to help.

334
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,540
Those escorts I introduced you

335
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,240
aren't your type.

336
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,200
Okay, fine.

337
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,460
I know your bar is high.

338
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,320
Ladies here are different.

339
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,760
They're all good-looking

340
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
and from prominent families.

341
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,900
Any one of them is good enough for you.

342
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,360
Should I thank you?

343
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,120
You're welcome.

344
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,320
You just won't let Gu Yanzhen go, right?

345
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Ms. Qu,

346
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,290
please let me go.

347
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,800
You can go talk to Gu Yanzhen.

348
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,120
Why are you torturing me?

349
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,800
I don't care.

350
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,520
Only when you find your Miss.right

351
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,650
can I feel relieved.

352
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
I can't pick a random one.

353
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,880
You have nothing to worry about.

354
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,280
I can introduce them to you.

355
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,400
I don't know them.

356
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,800
You will after you see them.

357
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
I don't like them.

358
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,860
Affection can be cultivated.

359
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,050
Listen to me,

360
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,800
your sergeant assigned you to me.

361
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,130
Before we get this done,

362
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
you won't be able to go back.

363
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,120
You're evil!

364
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,780
Come, let's go have a look.

365
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,880
Manting.

366
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,520
What do you think, Qianqian?

367
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,320
Looking good?

368
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,420
Not too bad.

369
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,450
You're late.

370
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
Let me introduce.

371
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,760
This is my friend

372
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,620
Zhao Qianqian.

373
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,480
Hello.

374
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,040
What's going on?

375
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,680
Move! Step aside!

376
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,320
Qiqi.

377
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
Get out of the way.

378
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,760
Move.

379
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,080
Are you OK?

380
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,610
Are you alright?

381
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,360
Are you OK?

382
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,440
It's scary.

383
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,690
Let's go.

384
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,250
We can have a rest there.

385
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,920
Don't ride the horse.

386
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,450
Let's go.

387
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,650
Let's go.

388
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,800
What's wrong with you?

389
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,460
Didn't you say you could ride?

390
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,600
I could.

391
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Only a little bit.

392
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,360
You...

393
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,160
When I was little, I rode the horse in my dad's arms.

394
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,520
Hadn't it been for him,

395
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,240
you would've been dead, you know?

396
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,640
If anything bad happened to you,

397
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,080
what should I say to your parents?

398
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,040
Enough, Qianqian.

399
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,800
Calm down.

400
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,450
Everything is fine now.

401
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,560
Why don't you introduce us?

402
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,080
I've never met her before.

403
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,090
This is Qiqi, my cousin.

404
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,240
And this is

405
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,080
Qu Manting.

406
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,120
Weren't you eager to see her?

407
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,760
Ms. Qu,

408
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,010
nice to meet you.

409
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,000
You know me?

410
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
I've heard your songs.

411
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,400
Perhaps,

412
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,500
we may be relatives in the future.

413
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,840
You're my alleged sister-in-law.

414
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,440
Alleged sister-in-law?

415
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,560
Who's your brother?

416
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,440
She's

417
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,109
Gu Yanzhen's sister.

418
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,560
His sister?

419
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,369
The one and only?

420
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,740
Come here, you. Come here.

421
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,440
So you're my sister, too.

422
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,349
Sister.

423
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,720
Sister is too formal.

424
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,829
Just call me Manting.

425
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,440
Manting.

426
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,760
Can you two behave like ladies?

427
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,400
Oh, come on.

428
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,460
We're just joking.

429
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,600
Who is this?

430
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,450
Thanks for your help today.

431
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,280
It's nothing.

432
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,560
It's not.

433
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,680
We all saw it.

434
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,760
That horse ran wild

435
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,720
and charged towards us.

436
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,340
Without you,

437
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,160
she'd be dead.

438
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,400
Come.

439
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,940
Let me introduce you guys.

440
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,240
This is

441
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,340
a straight-A student at the Arsenal Military Academy,

442
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,400
also my good friend

443
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,960
from Peking, Xie Liangchen.

444
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,720
Come and say hi.

445
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,600
He's a soldier.

446
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,800
Qiqi,

447
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
say thank you to Mr. Xie

448
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
for saving your life.

449
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,080
No need.

450
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,280
-What are you waiting for? -Have we met before?

451
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,440
Come and thank Mr. Xie.

452
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,700
Why aren't you moving?

453
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,030
Are you alright?

454
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,440
Is he dead?

455
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,800
It's none of your business.

456
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,400
Leave now!

457
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
What should we do?

458
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,400
Not your concern.

459
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,080
Run!

460
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
I know!

461
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
You know nothing about

462
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,000
what happened to Shen Junshan that night,

463
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,130
and you saw nothing.

464
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,100
Don't go for him again

465
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,200
and don't tell anyone about it.

466
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,720
Got it?

467
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,170
You know each other?

468
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,600
We don't!

469
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,050
Then why are you so excited?

470
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,120
I mean...

471
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,280
I mean it reminds of the Arsenal Military Academy.

472
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,210
My brother is also a student there.

473
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,540
Xie Liangchen, right?

474
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
My name is Gu Qiqi.

475
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,280
Hello.

476
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,240
Hi.

477
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,420
Eat the kebabs.

478
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,180
I remember you.

479
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,880
Don't worry.

480
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,010
I won't tell anyone.

481
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,480
Last time, at school,

482
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,800
you saved me once,

483
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,040
and you saved me again today.

484
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,880
I owe you two lives already.

485
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,080
Hey,

486
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,560
remember that man you hit with a rock?

487
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,320
Is he dead?

488
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,840
Hush.

489
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,720
Don't worry,

490
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,920
others can't hear us.

491
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,400
Tell me, is he dead?

492
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,720
No.

493
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,400
How come?

494
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,320
How did he survive after such a heavy blow?

495
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,640
He's quite lucky.

496
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
You wish him dead?

497
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,680
Of course. He's a bad guy.

498
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,440
For a little girl like you,

499
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,040
you sure are cruel-hearted.

500
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,280
I'm not little.

501
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,680
I'm 16 years old.

502
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,960
I can get married in the village.

503
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,400
Miss Zhao, can you roast it?

504
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,440
I can.

505
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
You can do it yourself.

506
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,960
I don't want to be near the smoke.

507
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,840
I heard from Qu Manting

508
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,320
that you came to find a date.

509
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,660
Do you have anyone in mind?

510
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,200
What do you think of me?

511
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,040
I know I like you.

512
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,730
I think we're destined to meet each other.

513
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,920
Last year, my mom hired a fortuneteller

514
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,760
who said I'd bring good fortune to my future husband.

515
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,220
Whoever marries me will be the luckiest man.

516
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,890
No wonder you're Gu Yanzhen's sister.

517
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,920
Of course.

518
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,560
Ms. Qu,

519
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,680
here.

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,600
Thanks.

521
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,960
Goodness!

522
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,520
I'll get fat after eating this.

523
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,380
You can have it.

524
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Believe it or not,

525
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm telling the truth.

526
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,880
You know,

527
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,340
that fortuneteller has never been wrong.

528
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,200
Last year, he said that my brother

529
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,880
would get into trouble at the beginning of the year.

530
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,810
Then before the first month ended,

531
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,400
he was beaten by my father

532
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,040
and almost died.

533
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,930
Did your dad beat him often?

534
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,640
He did,

535
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,650
but not anymore.

536
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,000
The thing is my brother dares to fight back now

537
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,140
and he can run fast.

538
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,920
Qianqian,

539
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,600
why didn't you tell me

540
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,160
you were related to the Gus?

541
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,010
We aren't too close.

542
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,880
Besides,

543
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,860
are you really in love with my cousin?

544
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,920
Of course I am.

545
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,700
Then, I wish you good luck.

546
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,080
My cousin isn't an ordinary man.

547
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,800
I know.

548
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,760
That's what I like about him.

549
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,600
I've spent some time

550
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,930
with the fortuneteller

551
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,560
and learned a few things.

552
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,410
Do you want me to read your palm?

553
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,160
Forget it.

554
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
I see.

555
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,560
You're doomed

556
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,720
to have tons of wooers this year.

557
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,760
You can tell that from the back of my hand?

558
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,440
Of course.

559
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,620
I'm good at reading the back, too.

560
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,400
How about you take your clothes off and let me see?

561
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,860
Don't even think about it.

562
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,330
You're quite talented.

563
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,060
Just so-so.

564
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,210
Get down.

565
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,960
Go.

566
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,320
Qianqian,

567
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,920
come here.

568
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,200
Get down.

569
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,360
Come here.

570
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,360
Qiqi.

571
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,300
Liangchen.

572
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,970
Let's go.

573
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,380
I've seen that man.

574
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,760
He works for Jin Xianrong.

575
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,220
A few days ago, he tried to kill Shen Junshan.

576
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,520
What should we do now?

577
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,940
Go back to the Academy.

578
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Don't be upset.

579
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,840
This place is fun.

580
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,490
Let's go play together.

581
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,600
Come on.

582
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,160
Junshan,

583
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
I have something to tell you.

584
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,040
What's up?

585
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,930
Come with me.

586
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,570
You're leaving?

587
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Fine, fine, fine.

588
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,280
We can go together.

589
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,960
He left to date.

590
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,920
Not enough people.

591
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Forget it.

592
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,600
I'm begging you.

593
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,440
Please go with you.

594
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:04,960
Pass.

595
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,960
-No. -I'm upset.

596
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,890
Go drink with me.

597
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,300
We've finally got out.

598
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,880
It's still early in the morning.

599
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
Let's drink. I'm in a bad mood.

600
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,160
-Drink with me. -No.

601
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,760
-I won't. -Please.

602
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,160
Still no.

603
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll drink with you next time.

604
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,960
No can do.

605
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,920
Let's go.

606
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,420
-No. -Brother.

607
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,300
-I said no. Don't touch me. -Brother!

608
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,440
-Brother! -Brother.

609
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,920
You scared me.

610
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
What are you doing? Let go!

611
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,600
I almost got killed today.

612
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,160
So terrifying!

613
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,240
Let go of me.

614
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,160
I won't.

615
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,280
Qiqi,

616
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,040
when did you come back?

617
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,900
I just got back.

618
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,280
So did dad.

619
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,720
Dad is back!

620
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,320
Brother,

621
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,480
your good days are ending.

622
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,240
Ji Jin,

623
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,320
where's Junshan?

624
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,800
Xianrong dragged him out.

625
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,920
When?

626
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,480
Just now.

627
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,200
Where did they go?

628
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,800
That way.

629
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,400
Qu Manting,

630
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,330
give me your car.

631
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,400
Where are you going?

632
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,560
Where are you going?

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,680
Didn't you see your car got stolen?

634
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,000
I can give it to him.

635
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Tell me the truth.

636
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,410
Be honest. Come.

637
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,200
Are you not

638
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,130
worried at all seeing me like this?

639
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,000
Let go.

640
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,480
Hey,

641
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,000
behave yourself.

642
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,800
Didn't you see

643
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,560
him pulling the trigger?

644
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,800
I was so scared.

645
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
Why did you bring me here?

646
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,530
I want to tell you something

647
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,170
about myself

648
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,800
and my family.

649
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,060
Before I speak,

650
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
I hope you can forgive me.

651
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,880
I didn't mean to lie to you

652
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,300
or keep anything from you.

653
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,840
Most of the times,

654
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
I don't even remember.

655
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,120
I'm not an overseas Chinese.

656
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,740
This isn't the first time I came to China.

657
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm Japanese

658
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,320
but I was born and raised

659
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
in China.

660
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,940
When I was eight years old,

661
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,020
my father was hired to work in the Rong Mansion,

662
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,720
but he died accidentally.

663
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,520
Lord Rong sympathized with my mom and me,

664
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,640
so he took us in

665
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,420
and adopted me.

666
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,620
I thought a brand-new and better life

667
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,700
would await us,

668
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,540
yet Lord Rong's wife,

669
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,810
Her Ladyship

670
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,100
suspected that

671
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
my mom and her husband had an affair,

672
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,340
so she made our life hell.

673
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,800
My mom couldn't bear it.

674
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,080
She got sick,

675
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,000
and passed away afterwards.

676
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,120
Then I was kicked out of their mansion.

677
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,970
I had to live on the streets for a while.

678
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,480
Then I met my current parents

679
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,660
who took me in.

680
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,240
The incident

681
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,320
happened in the Rong Mansion

682
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
was your doing?

683
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,860
I don't know who I should hate.

684
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,520
I can't kill that woman.

685
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,250
I don't know whom I should take revenge on.

686
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,080
I'm so useless.

687
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,890
It's not your fault.

688
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,720
Junshan,

689
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
I lied to you

690
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,050
because I'm ashamed of myself.

691
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,380
Nobody wanted me when I was young.

692
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,420
I was afraid you'd look down on me.

693
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,040
Junshan,

694
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm sorry.

695
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,690
You didn't lie to me.

696
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,320
You don't

697
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,320
owe anyone an explanation.

698
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,690
The past is the past.

699
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,160
Junshan,

700
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,120
I have something to tell you.

701
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,320
What is it?

702
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,320
It's about Jin Xianrong.

703
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,800
Are you sure you know everything about her?

704
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,600
What's wrong?

705
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
She's bad.

706
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,800
I think she was the one who brought the coffin

707
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,720
to the birthday celebration in the Rong Mansion.

708
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,980
-And Qu Manting... -I already knew that.

709
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,320
You do?

710
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,420
Then how come you...

711
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Xianrong did that

712
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,880
for a reason.

713
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,160
I fear she'll harm you.

714
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,960
She won't.

715
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,680
But what if she did

716
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,210
collude with the Japanese?

717
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Xianrong

718
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,400
is my old friend.

719
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
I know what kind of

720
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,840
person she is.

721
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:40,960
But...

722
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,360
Enough

723
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,940
Liangchen,

724
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,560
I don't know why

725
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,660
you're so biased against her,

726
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,500
but the truth is she's having a hard life.

727
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,380
Don't ever say that again.

728
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,700
Liangchen,

729
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,880
wait.

730
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,970
What did you say to Junshan?

731
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,160
Junshan is smart,

732
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,570
maybe too smart.

733
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,320
He always

734
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,720
tends to believe what he sees

735
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,720
and his own judgment.

736
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,880
Poor man.

737
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll find evidence against you.

738
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,600
I hope

739
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,960
you can live that long.

740
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,100
Let's wait and see.

741
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,409
Come, you drink first.

742
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Let's play a game.

743
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,960
Xiaojun.

744
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,540
What took you so long in the bathroom?

745
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,730
I knew they'd known each other.

746
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,600
Really?

747
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,510
They just met.

748
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,469
You know what,

749
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,670
it was Director Guo who asked me to protect

750
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,600
Qu Manting 24/7.

751
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,560
Except politicians,

752
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,630
even patriotic businessmen aren't qualified

753
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,480
to hire us to protect them,

754
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
not to mention a singer like her.

755
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,920
Sergeant Guo

756
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,600
abused his power

757
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,480
for his own benefit.

758
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,490
I'll report him.

759
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,520
What?

760
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,820
Stop drinking.

761
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Don't you know you get drunk easily?

762
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,880
Let me take a sip.

763
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,440
No!

764
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,480
Here, have some water.

765
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,960
I already paid. It can't be wasted.

766
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,520
No!

767
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
You'll get drunk.

768
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,040
Give me a drink.

769
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
Here, it's free.

770
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,180
My treat. My treat.

771
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,840
Farewell time, trackway side

772
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Green grass spreading up high

773
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,360
Two brothers drink.

774
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,160
Six, six, six.

775
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,180
Five classics.

776
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,320
Seven and eight.

777
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,000
Night breeze sighing; light flute crying

778
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,600
The sunset is far beyond the hills

779
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,440
Go ahead.

780
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,920
At the edge of the sky and the corner of the land

781
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,640
Friends have gone their separate ways

782
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,500
How have you been all these years?

783
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,200
Is that a question?

784
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,480
I want to know.

785
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,800
I'm fine.

786
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Have your parents treated you well?

787
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,120
That's another question.

788
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,840
Come.

789
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,040
Again. One more time.

790
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,440
Begin.

791
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,840
Two brothers...

792
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,200
Two brothers drink.

793
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,000
Five classics.

794
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,800
Six, six, six.

795
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,720
You drink.

796
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,370
It's my turn.

797
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,480
Are you married?

798
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,880
No.

799
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,920
Really?

800
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,720
You're still single at this age?

801
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,050
Why are you all saying this?

802
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,440
Am I that old?

803
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,080
Am I?

804
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,400
You are old.

805
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,420
Do you have girlfriends at least?

806
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,360
When I was young,

807
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
I was a ladies' man.

808
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,740
I was charming.

809
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,640
I had tons of girlfriends.

810
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,120
Were you in love with anyone?

811
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,800
Yes.

812
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,460
Then why didn't you marry her?

813
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,880
She's gone.

814
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,920
She...gone...

815
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,960
How many questions have you asked?

816
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,480
You fouled!

817
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,000
You finally figured out!

818
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,440
Gosh, so slow.

819
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,480
Let's play again.

820
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,560
OK. Come on.

821
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,360
Five classics.

822
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,280
Six, six, six.

823
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,640
Eight horses.

824
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,820
You can't always lose. Here.

825
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,040
He really said that?

826
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,040
He seems to be really

827
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,480
into Xianrong.

828
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,250
Are you jealous?

829
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm jealous?

830
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,840
You tell me.

831
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,120
According to my knowledge of you,

832
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,220
Shen Junshan is supposed

833
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,120
to be your type.

834
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,980
How come you aren't attracted to him?

835
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,330
Something doesn't feel right.

836
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,080
How?

837
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,800
I can not describe it.

838
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,720
I feel he's afraid of me.

839
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,920
Afraid of you?

840
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,240
You're paranoid.

841
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,200
Let's talk about you.

842
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,440
You know Xianrong is heartless.

843
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,220
Why did you pick a fight with her?

844
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,550
I was worried that she might hurt Junshan.

845
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,080
Waitress.

846
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,880
I need to go.

847
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,490
Give me a refill.

848
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,680
Be careful.

849
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,610
Luckily, it missed the target.

850
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,360
Be careful.

851
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,340
How come you're always careless?

852
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,800
Ms. Huo, don't blame him.

853
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,380
He didn't pick a fight.

854
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,600
He only did that

855
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,440
to save me.

856
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,080
Alright.

857
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,180
It's just a scratch. I'm fine.

858
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,770
You said someone was stalking you.

859
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
I guess it's true.

860
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,880
I knew it.

861
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
We should pay more

862
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
attention to it.

863
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,680
After all,

864
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,560
we can't be lucky every time.

865
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,760
Am I a jinx?

866
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,640
Here comes the devil.

867
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,480
Thank you, Captain He.

868
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,000
Ms. Huo.

869
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,580
Captain He.

870
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
I'll bring the body back.

871
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,780
If something comes up, I'll let you know.

872
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,180
Thank you, Captain He.

873
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,370
You're welcome.

874
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,680
He

875
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,650
just left like this?

876
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,800
Ms. Huo,

877
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,960
a man died in your bar!

878
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,020
They won't question you or anything?

879
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,360
I pay them tons of money every year.

880
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,220
How dare they

881
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,000
question me for such a trivial matter?

882
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,320
A trivial matter?

883
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,840
It's a man's life.

884
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,800
Enough.

885
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,160
In this bar,

886
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,280
people die

887
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,160
almost every month.

888
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,330
Don't listen to him.

889
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,530
Don't worry.

890
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,810
I'll take care of it.

891
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,530
Let me take you back.

892
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,760
No need.

893
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,920
I can go back myself.

894
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,120
How will you go back?

895
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,040
Let me give you a ride. My car is outside.

896
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,520
OK.

897
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
I'm leaving then.

898
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,440
Take care.

899
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
Let's go, Xie Liangchen.

900
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,040
You go ahead.

901
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,800
I'm fine.

902
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,160
Leave with Manting.

903
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,290
I'll have someone take her back later.

904
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,680
Thank you.

905
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,560
Be careful.

906
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,240
You too.

907
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,560
You saw what happened.

908
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,690
Stay out of trouble.

909
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,160
I will.

910
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,480
Liu,

911
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,160
you take Xiaojun back.

912
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,840
OK.

913
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,930
Let's go.

914
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:42,880
Sister,

915
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,610
I'm leaving.

916
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,120
Boss,

917
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,800
we caught him.

918
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,020
What did he say?

919
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,970
He said nothing.

920
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,460
He killed himself.

921
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Where's the body?

922
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,260
In the west warehouse.

923
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,320
Boss.

924
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,980
Take off his pants.

925
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,200
Boss,

926
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,140
he's Japanese.

927
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,000
Dump him outside the Japanese Chamber.

928
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,400
Got it.

929
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,520
Telegraph Watanabe.

930
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,280
Tell him to leave for Liaoxi immediately.

931
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,840
I need him at the auction.

932
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,440
Boss,

933
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,650
please give me another chance.

934
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,520
Do you deserve a second chance?

935
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,880
If I fail again,

936
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,320
I'll kill myself.

937
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,840
Boss,

938
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,840
Lord Chengrui is outside

939
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
asking to see you.

940
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,160
This is your last chance.
