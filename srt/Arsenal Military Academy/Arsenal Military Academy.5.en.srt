00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 05

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,840
I heard a few days ago,

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,440
when Ms. Qu was in Club Paramo,

6
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,039
she almost got abducted.

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,440
We're in troubled times now.

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,080
Bandits are rampant.

9
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,600
You should be more careful

10
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,400
when going outside.

11
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,880
Tingbai will protect me.

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,200
Don't worry.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,250
Be careful when you go outside.

14
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Or just stay at home if possible.

15
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,600
I can send more bodyguards to protect you.

16
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,760
Don't listen to him.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,360
If he really wanted to hurt me,

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,890
he wouldn't say it out loud.

19
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,240
Right now,

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
the Japanese are in power.

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,400
No one dares to fight

22
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
against them except you.

23
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,140
You should be careful.

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I'll fight against them if I have to.

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,720
But I will never bow and scrape to the Japanese

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,980
not in a million years.

27
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,600
What?

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,720
You looked like an adult when you were a kid.

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
How come you're so childish now?

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm not childish.

31
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,220
You wouldn't understand.

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,560
Listen,

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,880
just take good care of yourself,

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,080
okay?

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,079
Stop it!

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,730
Don't touch my head.

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,490
So annoying!

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,200
Don't forget to dance with me later.

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,079
We'll see.

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
Miss,

41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,800
can you do me a favor?

42
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,850
Please tell the man outside

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
that I need more time.

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,079
Don't wait for me.

45
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,680
OK.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
Thank you.

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
He said it's OK,

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,160
and he isn't in a hurry.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,360
You can take your time.

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,040
He will take you to the lounge for makeup after you finish.

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,800
Alright,

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,680
thank you.

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,130
Sure. You can continue.

54
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,510
Chairman,

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,640
should we teach Shen Tingbai

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,680
a lesson?

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,320
The Shens have run business in Shunyuan

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
for generations.

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,320
Shen Tingbai is well connected.

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,640
We can't mess with him for now.

61
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,450
Then we can start

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,810
with the people related to him.

63
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,159
Obviously,

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,650
he cares about that woman a lot.

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Act with caution.

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,650
Don't make a huge scene.

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,040
If the military steps in,

68
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,200
the benefit

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,640
won't belong to us totally.

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,400
It's such an honor

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
to have the Mayor and

72
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,760
Vice Minister Gu here.

73
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,540
Don't be so polite.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
Your father and I go way back.

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm also gratified to see

76
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,480
you grow up.

77
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,400
Like father, like son.

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,680
Mr. Shen is so lucky to have a son like you

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,740
who can take over the family business

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,400
so that he can retire at an early age.

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,120
We do envy him.

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
Mr. Gu's son

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,800
is outstanding.

84
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
Everyone's known him

85
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,090
shortly after he came here.

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,520
Mr. Gu,

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Yanzhen is in Shunyuan, too?

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,220
Why didn't you mention it?

89
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,880
Let's not waste time

90
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,280
talking about that brat.

91
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,600
Youngsters

92
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,040
are always naughty.

93
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
As long as we educate them well,

94
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
they'll be fine.

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,120
I hope so.

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
Excuse me for a while.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,680
Alright.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,320
Dad,

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,520
you said that the Shens and us are friends,

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,960
but why haven't I met him before?

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,080
You grew up in Peking

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,560
and went to Britain later.

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
It's normal that you don't know him.

104
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,970
He is the eldest son of your Uncle Shen.

105
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,920
Well,

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,200
don't you remember Uncle Shen

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
who gave you the mink?

108
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,240
I remember.

109
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,000
One year during the Spring Festival,

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,360
Uncle Shen came to visit and brought presents.

111
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
He gave my mom

112
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,360
a white mink coat.

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,080
Then he asked me what I wanted.

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,800
I said I wanted a living mink.

115
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,320
Then the next year,

116
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,980
he really came and gave me one.

117
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,720
I was afraid that it would get cold,

118
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,960
so I put it on the cage

119
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
beside the stove,

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,960
and cover it with thick cotton.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,640
Then the mink died shortly after that.

122
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,120
If you like it,

123
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,720
I can have my people send you another one.

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,240
Really?

125
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,760
I just returned home.

126
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,560
I don't know anybody

127
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,360
or have any friends, either.

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Later on,

129
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,080
you can ask me for the first dance

130
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,840
so that

131
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,770
we can be friends

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,770
and then I can accept your gift.

133
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,680
What's wrong?

134
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
You're a gentleman,

135
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm a lady,

136
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,280
so you should obey my order.

137
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,540
You can't turn me down.

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,680
And,

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
it's rude to refuse a lady.

140
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
You won't do that,

141
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,440
right?

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
I don't know if I

143
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,680
have the honor to

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,960
invite Ms. Bai for a dance?

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
Sure.

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,280
Mr. Shen and Ms. Bai

147
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,340
really look like a perfect match.

148
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,720
They just like

149
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
the people from a painting.

150
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,200
She is the Mayor's daughter,

151
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,440
who is beyond commoners.

152
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,640
Ms. Du,

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,730
men like your cousin with such appearance

154
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
and family status,

155
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
can only be matched by Ms. Bai.

156
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,280
Others are

157
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,880
laughing stocks.

158
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,640
Sadly, there are so many people

159
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,690
who overestimate themselves.

160
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Ms. Qu,

161
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,200
do I have the honor

162
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,920
to invite you for a dance?

163
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,730
Are you jealous?

164
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Of whom?

165
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,520
Shen Tingbai.

166
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,400
He's pursuing me,

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,730
not the other way round.

168
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,680
Have you never fallen in love with anyone?

169
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,240
No.

170
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,360
And you?

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Well,

172
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,680
me either.

173
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,560
Then we're even.

174
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,730
I helped you out,

175
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,720
and please don't bother me anymore.

176
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,520
Bother?

177
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
Why do I need to bother you?

178
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
Gu Yanzhen,

179
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,400
this isn't over!

180
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,170
You are so petty.

181
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,730
Yeah, you pissed off the wrong one.

182
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,320
Great Bravo!

183
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,920
Nice.

184
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,040
Excellent.

185
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,280
Ms. Xie.

186
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,560
Ms. Xie!

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
Sorry, I'm sorry.

188
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,160
I heard that

189
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,090
Mr. Shen's youngest son

190
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,780
is at the Academy, too.

191
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
He spoke on and on about that

192
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,970
the whole night.

193
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,850
Now the whole world knows that.

194
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,840
The two sons of Mr. Shen,

195
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,600
one is a patriotic businessman,

196
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,120
the other is a passionate officer.

197
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,880
So great.

198
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,000
Dad,

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,960
don't try to test me.

200
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,960
There is no need

201
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,840
to joke around in front of me.

202
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,480
How is the relationship between you two?

203
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,280
So-so.

204
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,160
Neither have we talked,

205
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,220
nor have we fought.

206
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,280
Remember,

207
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,400
keep a distance from him.

208
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,600
The Shens have crossed the line.

209
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,540
If they go on like this,

210
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,010
they'll get into trouble sooner or later.

211
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,280
Dad,

212
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,880
are there still decent people in your eyes?

213
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,100
I don't care about others,

214
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,240
but you're my son,

215
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,140
of course I care about you.

216
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,880
It's OK to make small mistakes,

217
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,400
but you should know

218
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,890
what's right and wrong.

219
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,840
I don't need you to grace our family,

220
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,280
but don't cause trouble at least.

221
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,410
Right and wrong?

222
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Dad, you think too much of yourself.

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,600
Whether it's right or wrong

224
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,520
is not your call nowadays.

225
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,530
But don't worry,

226
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm not interested in these things.

227
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,840
Zhao,

228
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,600
come with me.

229
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,160
Yes.

230
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,760
Young master,

231
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,280
with all due respect,

232
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,800
you shouldn't talk to your father like this.

233
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,120
Actually,

234
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,920
Mr. Gu has been upset these days.

235
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,520
The Japanese are sending more troops to Feng'an.

236
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,980
Although he is the Vice Governor of Feng'an,

237
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,200
he has no troops

238
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,680
or money in his hands.

239
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,880
Zhang Xihou, Bai Peiyong,

240
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,160
and people like them

241
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,620
all have evil intentions,

242
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,410
let alone those above them.

243
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,920
The military is also in disarray.

244
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,480
And the students

245
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
always launch marches

246
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,740
and petitions.

247
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,900
Mr. Gu hasn't slept well for days.

248
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,840
Look,

249
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,980
you've finally come back,

250
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,680
please don't upset him more.

251
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,880
Mr. Zhao,

252
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,490
who taught you to say these?

253
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,520
Pretty classy.

254
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
No one taught me.

255
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,970
The more you see,

256
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,600
the more you understand.

257
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,160
Mr. Gu's life isn't easy.

258
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,820
Please be considerate of him.

259
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,960
Fine, I got it.

260
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,620
Wait, Mr. Zhao,

261
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,050
I need you to check something for me

262
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,280
that

263
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,740
if there was a Ms. Xie in Shen's party tonight

264
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
who was around eighteen

265
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
and might've

266
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
come with her family.

267
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,640
OK.

268
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,100
I'll let you know as soon as I have the result.

269
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,160
Here.

270
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,520
Hi.

271
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,420
Take off your clothes.

272
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,280
What?

273
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,240
It is broken.

274
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,690
Let me stitch it for you.

275
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,810
That's fine.

276
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,300
Take it off.

277
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,760
Xiaojun,

278
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,010
bring me the sewing box.

279
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,040
OK.

280
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,530
The noodles smell good.

281
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,109
The Academy you work at

282
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,589
let their staff walk around

283
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,040
with holes in their clothes?

284
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,000
The salary they pay

285
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,840
isn't enough for me to drink.

286
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,970
If they pay you more,

287
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,720
you can even

288
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,720
clear out a liquor store.

289
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,720
I made a suit for you.

290
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,610
You can try it later.

291
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I can fix it if it doesn't fit you.

292
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,720
Why did you make it?

293
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't even have

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,960
a place to put it

295
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,940
and I have no chance to wear it.

296
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,780
The seventh day

297
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,520
is Nianqing's birthday.

298
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,170
Are you going to see her in this?

299
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,480
How time flies!

300
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,360
Twenty years

301
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,620
passed in a blink of an eye.

302
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,880
Well,

303
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm full.

304
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,140
I need to go.

305
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,480
I haven't finished yet!

306
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,410
That's fine.

307
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,480
I'm so sorry.

308
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,960
Take off your clothes.

309
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,690
Let me check.

310
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,680
Doctor,

311
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,530
may I keep my clothes on?

312
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,580
What are you doing?

313
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,890
Why are you here?

314
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,760
I don't want to live with you.

315
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,890
Can't you knock?

316
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,700
Liangchen,

317
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,840
not bad at all!

318
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,240
You've progressed a lot.

319
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't want to be at the bottom every time.

320
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,640
Practice makes perfect.

321
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,760
But the bullets I have

322
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,690
are running out.

323
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,080
Don't worry.

324
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,760
You can use mine.

325
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,690
I'm waiting for you to say this.

326
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,740
Huang Song,

327
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,770
did you hear that

328
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,960
the field training is coming soon?

329
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,440
Who said that?

330
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,480
When?

331
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,480
Soon I guess.

332
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,520
A friend of mine is working in the Mountsouth Tavern.

333
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,960
He heard it from the soldiers who drunk there.

334
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,220
Then that's possible.

335
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,280
I have no experience.

336
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I won't do it well.

337
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,760
It's ok.

338
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,600
Don't worry.

339
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
You still got me.

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,920
I can't promise you other things.

341
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,980
But if you follow me

342
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,800
you'll be safe out there.

343
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,770
You always brag.

344
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,480
Let's go.

345
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm really nervous about the field training.

346
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
I'll be counting on you.

347
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,300
But don't worry, I will...

348
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,160
Sorry, my bad.

349
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Are you blind?

350
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,400
I was in a rush.

351
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,560
Wait,

352
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,840
you are so skinny,

353
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,320
but

354
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,320
your chest muscle is huge.

355
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,400
Lunatic.

356
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,160
Really?

357
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,440
I don't even notice that.

358
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,100
Liangchen,

359
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,320
let me touch it.

360
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,680
Let me see how big it is.

361
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
What are you doing?

362
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
He is a man.

363
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,360
I just want to touch it.

364
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,080
You want to touch it?

365
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,000
Is it true?

366
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,080
Let me touch yours.

367
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,200
Come here, let me touch it.

368
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,860
I just want to see how big it is.

369
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,620
Let me touch yours.

370
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,660
Liangchen!

371
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,840
Go away!

372
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,560
Liangchen!

373
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,960
Ms. Qu.

374
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,400
What do you want to do?

375
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,040
Am I your prisoner?

376
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,280
I came back for work.

377
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
I have no time to waste on you.

378
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,080
Sorry, Ms. Qu.

379
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,440
Mr. Shen has ordered us

380
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,320
to protect you.

381
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
You can go outside

382
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,680
only if you tell us where you're going

383
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,140
and I will inform Mr. Shen.

384
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,330
We'll send you there once it's all set.

385
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,000
You said the same thing yesterday.

386
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,860
And you let me wait for a whole day.

387
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,480
There was a march at the place

388
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,600
you wanted to go yesterday.

389
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,480
It was not safe.

390
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,100
What about the day before yesterday?

391
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,400
There was also a march.

392
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,080
So there is

393
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,600
march every day, right?

394
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,240
Yes.

395
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,840
Workers' mood has been unstable recently.

396
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,600
Maybe

397
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,400
it's because of the weather.

398
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,130
Why don't you say it's the moon?

399
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,400
Just tell me

400
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,040
when their mood will become stable.

401
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,840
Judging from the current situation,

402
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,040
no day is safe enough.

403
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,080
Then I can't go outside forever?

404
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
You'd better not.

405
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,300
If you insist on going out,

406
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,840
just tell us where you want to go.

407
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
And we'll make

408
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,330
some arrangements to ensure your safety.

409
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,120
Let's go back.

410
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,160
Those guys must have done it on purpose.

411
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,800
Yes.

412
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,100
Even a fool can tell it.

413
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,840
Sure.

414
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,340
Everyone knows it.

415
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,040
But maybe he is right.

416
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,860
It's not safe outside.

417
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,490
Shunyuan is in anarchy.

418
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,410
Shanghai is better.

419
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,680
No.

420
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,080
If we keep staying here,

421
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
when will we finish the work here

422
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,800
and go back to Shanghai?

423
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,400
The filming site is funded by the Shunyuan COC.

424
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,640
Without Mr. Shen's permission,

425
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,520
none of us can start the filming.

426
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
I know a place suitable for filming.

427
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,240
You go

428
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,000
tell Director Lu.

429
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,480
You,

430
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,540
go pack my clothes.

431
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,320
You think I can't get out of here?

432
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,440
Stupid!

433
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,920
This is your first real military exercise.

434
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,480
I hope you can take it seriously.

435
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,890
You're going up against

436
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
professional soldiers who've

437
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
experienced the war.

438
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,960
Any carelessness

439
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,200
will bring you failure.

440
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,360
Remember,

441
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,000
only the one who respects

442
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,250
every exercise will survive the real war.

443
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
How long will it take?

444
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,640
Soon, I guess.

445
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,810
Drive steadily.

446
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,140
I want to have a nap.

447
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,680
OK.

448
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,060
It's such a rough road.

449
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
Why should we go there for filming?

450
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,760
Well,

451
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,080
there's something wrong with the original filming site.

452
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
Now we're going to the old house

453
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,560
of Manting's family.

454
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,320
Manting grew up there.

455
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,180
The scenery is beautiful.

456
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,560
Mr. Sanada,

457
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,000
ahead is the restricted military zone.

458
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,880
Go after them.

459
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,960
According to the rules,

460
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,890
you're all dead.

461
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,240
Let me ask you,

462
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,160
where is your headquarters?

463
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,300
Liangchen,

464
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,080
that's not enough.

465
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
You should be tougher.

466
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,680
Tougher?

467
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm asking you!

468
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,940
How can we speak if we are dead?

469
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,820
Are we zombies?

470
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,410
Let's go.

471
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,220
Go to the dead soldiers' camp.

472
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,080
Hey punk,

473
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,330
this isn't over.

474
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,080
You have a problem?

475
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,320
Liangchen,

476
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,090
it's just the two of us here.

477
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,460
What can we do even if we

478
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,810
know where their headquarters is?

479
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,220
You said you were a master in the wild,

480
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,040
yet we got lost at the beginning.

481
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:42,920
No.

482
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,200
We didn't get lost.

483
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,610
They must've gone lost.

484
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,600
They said the gathering place was here,

485
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
yet none of them is here now.

486
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,520
Who knows whether the way you led is right or wrong?

487
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,320
Maybe we came to the wrong place.

488
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,890
That's impossible!

489
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Are those from

490
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,560
Shen Junshan's team?

491
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,800
It's fierce.

492
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,360
Get down!

493
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,960
What's wrong?

494
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,890
We all use blanks

495
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
for the exercise.

496
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,040
But the gunfire came from

497
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,520
real bullets.

498
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,080
Then who are they?

499
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
Bandits?

500
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,760
Japanese?

501
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,400
Russian?

502
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,330
Anyone is possible.

503
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,800
Let's go check it.

504
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,360
OK.

505
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,560
You're insane.

506
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,240
Bastard!

507
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,240
Catch them!

508
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,320
The shots

509
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,680
weren't fired by our people.

510
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,760
Liangchen,

511
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,400
how about I go have a look

512
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,160
and you go find our team?

513
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,640
No way.

514
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,080
It's dangerous for you to go there alone.

515
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,960
Don't worry.

516
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll be careful.

517
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,160
Take care.

518
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,440
Mr. Sanada, we shot one.

519
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,100
But the woman escaped.

520
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,960
You must catch that woman.

521
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,050
Yes, sir!

522
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,680
Yang.

523
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,290
Let's go.

524
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,800
Are you all right?

525
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,920
I can't run anymore.

526
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,520
You go first.

527
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,080
No,

528
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,120
we should go together.

529
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,000
There is no time.

530
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,960
Hurry up, Yang.

531
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,920
Wait. Calm down.

532
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,770
Listen to me.

533
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,530
They're here for me.

534
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,810
They won't harm you.

535
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Listen to me.

536
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,720
You keep running with Tao.

537
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,520
Do what I said.

538
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,000
Manting.

539
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,320
Go!

540
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,080
You really don't know my ability

541
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
if I don't teach you a lesson, right?

542
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,400
Junshan!

543
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,699
Huang Song?

544
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,230
Ji Jin?

545
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,770
Why are you here?

546
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,360
It's so nice to see you.

547
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,670
What happened about the gunshots just now?

548
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,320
We also followed the gunshots

549
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,380
all the way to here.

550
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,960
Where is Xie Liangchen?

551
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,000
Wasn't he with you?

552
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,860
The gunshots didn't sound right,

553
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,960
so we decided to split up.

554
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,840
He went to find you.

555
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,150
I met Zhu Yanlin on the way,

556
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,560
so we came together.

557
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,570
I got separated from Li Wenzhong.

558
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,760
Where are you going?

559
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,120
Gu Yanzhen.

560
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,200
So

561
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,200
you didn't see Xie Liangchen?

562
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,200
No.

563
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,530
Junshan.

564
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,360
What should we do now?

565
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,520
Should I go report this

566
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,080
to the headquarters?

567
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,010
It'll be too late to wait for

568
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,920
the backup.

569
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,640
Besides,

570
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,800
we don't know who and how many people

571
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,660
we are against.

572
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,020
How about this?

573
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,640
Ji Jin,

574
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,680
you go back to report this first.

575
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,860
Huang Song,

576
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,160
you go with Zhu Yanlin.

577
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,600
Let's go find Liangchen separately.

578
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Let's go!

579
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,000
OK.

580
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,840
Junshan, take your gun.

581
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,360
Let's go.

582
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,380
Xie Liangchen!

583
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,300
Xie Liangchen!

584
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,180
Xie Liangchen!

585
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,100
Hold tight!

586
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,650
Who is it?

587
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,560
It's me, me.

588
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,240
Me.

589
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,770
Li Wenzhong?

590
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,640
Ji Jin?

591
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,330
Why are you here?

592
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,850
I've finally found you.

593
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,080
Go away.

594
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
You don't know how dangerous it was.

595
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,000
There were gunshots everywhere.

596
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,520
And I got separated from Zhu Yanlin.

597
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,320
I thought I'd never see my dad again.

598
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,250
Enough, enough.

599
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,670
Man up, will you?

600
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Wait! Wait for me!

601
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,660
Gu Yanzhen!

602
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,120
Gu,

603
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,800
Gu Yanzhen!

604
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,520
Gu Yanzhen!

605
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,120
Gu Yanzhen!

606
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,160
Does it hurt?

607
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,360
You said

608
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,930
someone pushed you off.

609
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,610
Did you see his face?

610
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,920
I passed out after I

611
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,160
fell into that pit.

612
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,420
I didn't see anything.

613
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,560
You said there were others in the forest.

614
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,370
Maybe one of them did it.

615
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,840
But why didn't he kill you

616
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,680
or catch you?

617
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,560
Maybe

618
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,740
it was one of us.

619
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,080
One of us?

620
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,920
Everything is possible.

621
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,560
One should never intend to harm others,

622
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,160
but should always guard against the harm others might do to him.

623
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,420
Be careful from now on.

624
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,460
You're quite skilled at dressing the wound.

625
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,480
Have you learned it?

626
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,880
I used to be a war surgeon.

627
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,960
Really?

628
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,160
Then did you see a real war?

629
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,220
You will as well in the future.

630
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,880
In the future,

631
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,040
people all over China may see

632
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,570
the war with their own eyes.

633
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,360
Thank you.

634
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,240
Not a big deal.

635
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,400
It's going to rain.

636
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Let's go back now.

637
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Your wound needs to be treated, too.

638
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,880
Come here.

639
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,200
Stand up.

640
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,800
Let's go.

641
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,920
I'll carry you.

642
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,480
Come on.

643
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,640
Quickly.
