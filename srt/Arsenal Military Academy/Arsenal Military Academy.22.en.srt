Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 22

4
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,640
Excuse me,

5
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,530
which is Xie Liangchen's room?

6
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,680
Over there.

7
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,680
Thanks.

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,610
You're welcome.

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,480
Come in.

10
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,600
Ms. Huo.

11
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,640
How did you get hurt?

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,480
Bad luck I guess.

13
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,920
Thank you for coming.

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,260
I know you're busy.

15
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,079
Not at all, I should come.

16
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
Luckily,

17
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,450
You've made it back.

18
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
I was worried about you.

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,120
Be careful in the future.

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,280
I will.

21
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,960
I've granted Xiaojun's leave.

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,079
She'll take care of you.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,010
Thanks a lot.

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,040
Don't mention it.

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,720
Lie down.

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,360
You need to rest.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm fine.

28
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,720
Be good.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,880
Fine.

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
Thanks.

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,920
Feel better now?

32
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,480
Alright,

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,480
now that you're safe, I can stop worrying.

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm leaving.

35
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,040
Bye, Ms. Huo.

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,320
Take care.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,650
The patient is recovering.

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,760
But he needs more nutrition.

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,420
And he still needs to rest.

40
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,560
Thank you, doctor.

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,800
We'll need to keep him here for a few more days.

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,280
OK.

43
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,480
Junshan.

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,690
How can you still laugh?

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
I'm back alive.

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,280
Can't I laugh?

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,770
Does it hurt?

48
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,340
Not so much.

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,640
Liar!

50
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,130
What exactly happened?

51
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,520
You were sent to escort medicine.

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
Why were you hunted?

53
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,680
I don't know, either.

54
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,800
I guess their aim is not us.

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,000
There is something on Xie Liangchen

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
that they want.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,740
So they followed us

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
to get it back.

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
Where is it now?

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
Who has it?

61
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,980
I fear they'll come to hurt you again.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Liangchen has it.

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,220
We'll give it to Sergeant Lv once he arrives.

64
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,120
That's good.

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
An innocent man gets into trouble

66
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,060
because of his wealth.

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,280
Right now,

68
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,820
safety is everything.

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,720
You're right.

70
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,800
Are you hungry?

71
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,200
It's lunchtime.

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
I'll buy you some food.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm a bit hungry.

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Wait for me.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll be back soon.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,240
OK.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,900
The door is open

78
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
so I didn't knock.

79
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Do you need help?

80
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,480
Yeah.

81
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Thanks.

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,760
Here.

83
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,880
Thank you.

84
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,120
How's your wound?

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,920
I got shot in the thigh.

86
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,690
It'll heal in a few days.

87
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,920
You got shot?

88
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,450
Will it leave a scar?

89
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
I guess so.

90
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,040
What a pity!

91
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm a man.

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,600
Having a scar is no big deal.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,930
I'm not like your girls.

94
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,920
You're good-looking.

95
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,620
You're as pretty as a girl.

96
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,320
It'll be a shame

97
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
if you're disfigured!

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,290
Luckily, your leg took the hit.

99
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,480
You came to check on Junshan?

100
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,520
How is he?

101
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,020
The same as you,

102
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,160
pretending that it's not a big deal.

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,920
I'm worried sick!

104
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,800
You boys

105
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
are all alike.

106
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,160
You want more?

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm good.

108
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,680
Thank you.

109
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Are you OK?

110
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm fine. I'm OK.

111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,440
Don't move. Don't move. I'll call the nurse.

112
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,040
Nurse.

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,000
Nurse.

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
Hello, may I help you?

115
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,040
Please bring me another quilt.

116
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,680
OK.

117
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
Are you scalded?

118
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm fine.

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
Is your leg OK?

120
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,680
Yeah.

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,880
Where's the towel? Dry your hands.

122
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,080
Under the bed. I can get it myself.

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,960
Thank you.

124
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,840
Thanks.

125
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,640
You're welcome.

126
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,900
Thank you. Let me do it.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,200
OK.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

129
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,360
I was clumsy.

130
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:06,960
It's OK.

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Look, it's all changed.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,080
I shall leave then.

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,930
I need to buy lunch for Junshan.

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,320
Go ahead.

135
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,600
Do you want something to eat?

136
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,240
No, thanks.

137
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,120
Xiaojun went back to get my lunch.

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,120
Alright then.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Get some rest.

140
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
See you later.

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,080
Bye.

142
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
Bye.

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I saw Jin Xianrong outside just now.

144
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,250
What was she doing here?

145
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,840
She came to visit.

146
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,250
I don't believe she could be that nice.

147
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
What's for lunch?

148
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,800
Smells good.

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,920
Great!

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
This is it.

151
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,560
Inform Mr. James,

152
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
2 p.m. this afternoon

153
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,850
at Jinhua Hotel.

154
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,920
Yes.

155
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,040
Finished.

156
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,850
Are you full?

157
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
I'm going to explode.

158
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,340
Here, wipe your mouth.

159
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,460
I'll go wash these.

160
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,880
Be careful.

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,600
Shen Junshan,

162
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,920
why are you here?

163
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
I came to check on you.

164
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,360
How do you feel?

165
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm better now.

166
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,440
Hey,

167
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,000
did you call your family?

168
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,480
No.

169
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,360
My parents are back home.

170
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,960
I don't want to trouble them.

171
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm fine anyway.

172
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
No need to worry them.

173
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,010
Then who's been taking care of you?

174
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,320
My friend

175
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,080
Tan Xiaojun.

176
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,620
You've met her before.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,680
She

178
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,880
is your

179
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,440
girlfriend?

180
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,650
She's just a friend.

181
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,060
Isn't your sister at school in Shunyuan?

182
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,530
Why didn't she come?

183
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,600
She...

184
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
She didn't know.

185
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I didn't tell her.

186
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,610
She's too young.

187
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,040
Fine.

188
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm going back.

189
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,440
You should rest.

190
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,200
OK.

191
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,240
Thank you.

192
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,400
Gu Yanzhen,

193
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,720
Why you're back?

194
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,410
Did I come at the wrong time?

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,280
I'm leaving.

196
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,560
Have some rest.

197
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,760
OK.

198
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,840
Hey,

199
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,410
have some sleep.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,130
Don't talk too much.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,680
Step aside.

202
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,120
Why are you two standing at the door?

203
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm going out.

204
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,720
Where are you going?

205
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
My stomach hurts.

206
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,320
Need to use the bathroom.

207
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,240
Come on in.

208
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,520
You just came back?

209
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,170
Shouldn't you be in Nanjing for your engagement?

210
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,080
I managed to get out.

211
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,840
Will you get into trouble?

212
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
The news said

213
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,040
your fiancee's family is powerful.

214
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,280
Are you worried about me?

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,160
You don't need to tell me.

216
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,960
It's fine.

217
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
How's your wound?

218
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Is it OK?

219
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,680
I'm fine.

220
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm starving.

221
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,610
Do you have anything to eat?

222
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,160
You didn't bring me any gift

223
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,320
but asked me for food?

224
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
Seriously?

225
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,130
I was on the train for hours.

226
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,640
As soon as I heard you were in hospital,

227
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,960
I came immediately.

228
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
I didn't have time to eat.

229
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,560
Stay here.

230
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Let me go check.

231
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,500
Be careful.

232
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,490
Don't worry.

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
Liangchen,

234
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,040
it's OK.

235
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,780
They aren't coming for us.

236
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,360
I'm here.

237
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,290
No need to worry.

238
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,680
Lie down.

239
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,280
Mr. Gu,

240
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,360
it's unsafe outside.

241
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,490
Where are you going,

242
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,040
Mr. Gu?

243
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,160
What's happening out there?

244
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,040
Workers of the Dadong Company are making a fuss.

245
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,700
The Military Police have arrested many of them.

246
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,360
It's OK. Nothing to worry about.

247
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Then I'll go back to my room.

248
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,440
Do you have a knife in your bag?

249
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,970
Let me peel an apple for you.

250
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,840
Did you see Gu Yanzhen's face?

251
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,560
I thought he was going to

252
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,120
have steam coming out of his ears.

253
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,680
I bet he's in love with you.

254
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
What do you think?

255
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm talking to you.

256
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
Is it lost?

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,040
No.

258
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,960
The yellow bag.

259
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,580
The yellow bag?

260
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,000
The one I told you.

261
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,320
Those Japanese

262
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,400
were after us for it.

263
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,480
Isn't it inside?

264
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,800
Where is it?

265
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Is it on the floor?

266
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
No.

267
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,130
Check under the bed.

268
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,480
Nothing.

269
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
Check again.

270
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,880
It's not a big room.

271
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't see it here.

272
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,310
Maybe you didn't put it in your bag.

273
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,910
Perhaps Shen Junshan has it.

274
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,520
Impossible.

275
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,560
I saw it just now.

276
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,280
Thanks.

277
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Go have some rest.

278
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,880
You must be tired after the trip.

279
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,800
I will.

280
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,160
What's wrong with you?

281
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,840
You want to die?

282
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Are you blind?

283
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,240
What's your problem?

284
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,200
-Are you looking for trouble? -You want to pick a fight?

285
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,880
Can you afford it?

286
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,840
You're dead!

287
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,400
Speak!

288
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,760
What's your problem!

289
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,240
Crap!

290
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,760
It's lost.

291
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,920
How come?

292
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,440
You said

293
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,760
You've never left this room.

294
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,940
That bag couldn't disappear itself.

295
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,560
Think again.

296
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,360
Who else has come besides me?

297
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,880
Ms. Huo,

298
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,000
Gu Yanzhen,

299
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,440
Shen Junshan,

300
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,040
and Jin Xianrong.

301
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,040
Ms. Huo.

302
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,740
Well, it's not her.

303
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,280
Gu Yanzhen and Shen Junshan wouldn't take it.

304
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,940
It could only be Jin Xianrong.

305
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,800
What on earth is in that bag?

306
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,040
It's important.

307
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,760
Other things

308
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,170
are in Warehouse 18.

309
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,500
Have your men pick them up.

310
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,880
It's always a pleasure to do business with you.

311
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,240
Well, I'm thinking

312
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,880
whether I should continue our cooperation or not.

313
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,340
What makes you think that?

314
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,440
Your ambition is big.

315
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,720
I don't want to

316
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,880
hold a candle for the devil.

317
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,240
Devil is quite

318
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,800
a strong word.

319
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,040
Strong or not, I fear if it's true.

320
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,040
If

321
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
you have no intention to cooperate,

322
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,440
then

323
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,040
stop wasting my time.

324
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,880
Mr. James,

325
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm confused.

326
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
It's fake.

327
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,840
Mr. James...

328
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,800
Boss,

329
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,880
were we set up?

330
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,920
Did those

331
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,260
Military Academy students do it?

332
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Those people on the train did it.

333
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,160
What should we do now?

334
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,400
Just let it go?

335
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,480
Of course not.

336
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,440
Whoever they are,

337
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,780
they're simply handymen.

338
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,580
That bag must have been

339
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,560
in the Rong Mansion now.

340
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,400
Are you saying...

341
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,890
The third day next month

342
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,680
is Her Ladyship's birthday.

343
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,440
Prepare a gift for me.

344
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,240
I'll go pay my respects.

345
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,440
You lose.

346
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,320
Drink.

347
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,560
Fine.

348
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,820
I'm not scared.

349
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,800
Drink.

350
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,120
I quit.

351
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,440
What?

352
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
You can't quit because you're lost.

353
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,880
It's boring.

354
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,680
Are you jealous?

355
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,120
Jealous of whom?

356
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Stop pretending.

357
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,360
Xie Liangchen and Shen Junshan

358
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,960
went missing for days

359
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,530
and came back together.

360
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,680
You just came out from the hospital, right?

361
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,810
Don't be upset, Gu Yanzhen.

362
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,000
Clearly, we're both fools.

363
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,800
Here, to two fools.

364
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,560
Cheers!

365
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,160
Who is a fool?

366
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,960
Me.

367
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm a fool.

368
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,120
Why do I feel you said that to me?

369
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,600
No.

370
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,250
I was talking to myself.

371
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,020
Actually, things aren't what you think.

372
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,340
Then tell me the truth.

373
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,900
Never mind.

374
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,540
What are you doing?

375
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,720
Don't leave me hanging.

376
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,370
You have a big mouth.

377
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,680
What did you say?

378
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,900
Who has a big mouth?

379
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,800
Gu Yanzhen.

380
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,880
Sit back.

381
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Miss. Qu.

382
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Stop right there!

383
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,000
Stop now!

384
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,720
Stop right there…

385
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,680
Blood!

386
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,740
Somebody help!

387
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,220
What did you do?

388
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,240
I...

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't look good.

390
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,560
I can't be took photos.

391
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,240
Sir,

392
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,400
are you OK, sir?

393
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,600
Doctor.

394
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Doctor, how is he?

395
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,960
He's still unconscious.

396
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,420
We gave him four stitches.

397
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,720
Right now,

398
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,920
he's stable.

399
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,040
He's fine. He's OK. Don't worry.

400
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,100
Is his life at risk?

401
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,130
I don't think so.

402
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,560
When will he wake up?

403
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,600
He'll

404
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,570
wake up tomorrow morning at the earliest.

405
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,420
Thank you, doctor.

406
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,880
I'm sorry.

407
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,960
We'll pay for his medical bills.

408
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,280
Who wants your money?

409
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,240
If anything happens to my husband,

410
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,520
I'll destroy you.

411
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,200
The doctor said he's fine.

412
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,040
That's his opinion.

413
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,760
My husband's head is injured.

414
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,960
What if he becomes a fool,

415
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,160
he loses his mind or becomes paralyzed?

416
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,000
Who will support our whole family?

417
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,120
Who will take the responsibility?

418
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,000
Stop yelling.

419
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,280
Are you done?

420
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,680
The doctor said he's stable.

421
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,040
Why are you cursing your husband?

422
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,600
You...

423
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,980
This is a hospital.

424
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,700
Bring your argument outside.

425
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm telling you

426
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
this isn't over.

427
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,160
Ridiculous!

428
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,520
What a shrew!

429
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,280
You're no better yourself.

430
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,560
It was his fault.

431
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,840
You shouldn't have hit him.

432
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,040
He took photos of me.

433
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,840
Aren't you a star?

434
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,920
A photo can't kill you.

435
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,520
Stars also have rights.

436
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,640
He didn't ask for my permission.

437
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,090
Look at my dark circles.

438
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,560
I haven't slept well for days.

439
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,480
They're huge!

440
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
My skin looks bad.

441
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,680
My clothes are dirty.

442
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,720
My hair is greasy.

443
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,480
What would people think if they saw me like this?

444
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,160
This face is my meal ticket, got it?

445
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,200
So you hit him.

446
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,440
What if he sues you?

447
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
I'd rather be sued

448
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,960
than have that photo leaked out.

449
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,220
I don't understand what you girls think.

450
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
You know nothing.

451
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,320
Gu Yanzhen.

452
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,360
I have something to tell you.

453
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
So do I.

454
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,640
I’ll go first.

455
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,600
I was

456
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,960
angry earlier today,

457
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,760
but now I'm fine.

458
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
It's over.

459
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,140
I'm not angry anymore.

460
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,290
But you must stay away from him.

461
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,560
I won't forgive you so easily next time.

462
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
What...what are you talking about?

463
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
I'm done. Your turn.

464
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,400
After you left today,

465
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,880
I lost something.

466
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,280
I want to ask you about it.

467
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,540
What are you implying?

468
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,860
Are you calling me a thief?

469
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,840
No.

470
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,560
I just want to ask if you saw it.

471
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,880
It's a yellow bag.

472
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,080
Shen Junshan and I

473
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
took it from the Japanese.

474
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,840
It's important.

475
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,700
I didn't see it.

476
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,520
Why are you still here?

477
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,650
I'm waiting for you.

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,760
I knew Xie Liangchen

479
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,880
would kick you out.

480
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,420
You two argued?

481
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,720
Given your look,

482
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
I can tell that

483
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
You're the only one in love.

484
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,320
Unrequited love.

485
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
You're lovesick.

486
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,480
Are you done?

487
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,160
Not yet.

488
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,080
How about I give you a tip?

489
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,440
You want it?

490
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,120
Shoot.

491
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,240
Look at you,

492
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
you've always been clinging onto her.

493
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
When she went back to Peking,

494
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,220
you followed her back.

495
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,340
When she was in danger,

496
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,840
you left your engagement and came back

497
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,880
to protect her.

498
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,760
So tedious!

499
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
If it were me,

500
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,640
I wouldn't like you, either.

501
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,050
Not challenging at all.

502
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,040
You do have a point.

503
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,880
Am I right?

504
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,840
Then what should I do?

505
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,410
Should I ignore her?

506
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,600
You're wrong.

507
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,460
Competition promotes progress.

508
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,000
You should find a girlfriend

509
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,960
and do PDA in front of her every day

510
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
to make her jealous.

511
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
Then she'll get anxious.

512
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,860
Easier said than done.

513
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,210
If you can't find a girlfriend,

514
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,520
I can help you.

515
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,120
You?

516
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,160
Forget it.

517
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,640
What?

518
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,690
Gu Yanzhen, I...

519
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
I'm serious.

520
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,720
Just think about it.

521
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,240
I'm a superstar.

522
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,400
No thanks.

523
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,920
When Jin Xianrong comes to visit Shen Junshan next time,

524
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
keep an eye on her.

525
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,360
Only you guys have come here.

526
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,680
Others are all clean.

527
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,010
She's the only one left.

528
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,720
Besides,

529
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,720
my gut tells me

530
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,980
that woman is bad news.

531
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,930
Are you sure you don't need my help?

532
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,440
No, thanks. Go back.

533
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,880
So ungrateful.

534
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,680
Mom.

535
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,440
Sorry for troubling you tonight.

536
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,640
I shall take my leave.

537
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,600
I failed to discipline her.

538
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
I apologize for causing you trouble.

539
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,680
When you return,

540
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,160
do apologize to Vice Minister Gu for me.

541
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,480
You're too kind.

542
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,240
OK.

543
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,880
I'll visit him myself later.

544
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,980
You troublemaker!

545
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,960
You still remember to come back.

546
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,800
Have you eaten?

547
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,480
I have.

548
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,440
Who is that man?

549
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,560
You dare ask!

550
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,440
You brought shame to our whole family.

551
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,480
It's not all Manting's fault.

552
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,340
It's not hers, then is it my fault?

553
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,600
A young lady

554
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,480
stole another girl's fiance during their engagement.

555
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,440
It's shameful, don't you know?

556
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,720
I'm not a lady anyway.

557
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,360
Dad, you're right.

558
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,720
I'm just a showgirl.

559
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,440
You...

560
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,660
You dare talk back!

561
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,360
Forget it.

562
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,040
Don't upset yourself.

563
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,360
Come on.

564
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,620
Apologize to your dad.

565
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,560
I don't like what Mr. Zhu said.

566
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,920
He made it look like

567
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,200
that Gu Yanzhen

568
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,600
had nothing to do with it.

569
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,320
Don't you know your own daughter?

570
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,160
She's spoiled,

571
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,600
but I don't believe she'd steal

572
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,970
other people's fiance on purpose.

573
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,680
What have I done to have such a daughter?

574
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't want a dictator to be my dad, either.

575
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,530
What did you say?

576
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,840
Where are you going now?

577
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,360
Shen Junshan.

578
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,200
Hi there.

579
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Hi, Xianrong.

580
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,180
I just arrived.

581
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
How are you doing?

582
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,010
Much better.

583
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,060
I may be able to get discharged tomorrow.

584
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,360
What's with the rush?

585
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,140
You should stay and rest more.

586
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,650
It's just a scratch.

587
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,730
No need to stay here any longer.

588
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,280
I envy you.

589
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,410
I want to leave, too,

590
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,260
but the doctor doesn't let me.

591
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,960
Your leg is wounded.

592
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,530
Bed rest is good for you.

593
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,010
Moving around may slow down your healing.

594
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,120
I'm in a wheelchair.

595
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,920
It's fine.

596
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm almost bored to death.

597
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,160
Let me.

598
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,760
Your hand is injured.

599
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,800
I can do it.

600
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,720
It's OK.

601
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,920
Let me.

602
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
I can do it myself.

603
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,400
Junshan,

604
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,670
you want a banana?

605
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,560
No thanks.

606
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,480
And you, Liangchen?

607
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,880
Sure.

608
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,280
Thank you.

609
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,120
Why do you have callus on your palm?

610
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,780
You practiced kung fu?

611
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,639
I know nothing about kung fu.

612
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,219
I got it from doing chores.

613
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,080
Really?

614
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,840
I thought

615
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,290
only sabers could leave that mark.

616
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,440
You're wrong.

617
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,760
Probably.

618
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,320
People use guns now.

619
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,659
Few people use sabers.

620
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,600
At our Academy,

621
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
we only have one saber skill course.

622
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,100
I heard you just came to China.

623
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,880
May I ask

624
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,340
Where're you from?

625
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,000
Britain.

626
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,080
Which city?

627
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,960
Liverpool.

628
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
A city or arts.

629
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,410
No wonder you look so artsy.

630
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,000
Thank you.

631
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,920
Do you have relatives here?

632
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,280
I do.

633
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,760
Really?

634
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,720
We've known each other for a while.

635
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,580
I still don't know where you live.

636
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,400
Perhaps

637
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,000
we can go visit you sometime.

638
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Junshan hasn't been to my place yet.

639
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,120
He never even asked about it.

640
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,610
You've asked me so many questions.

641
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,320
May I assume that

642
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,680
you have a crush on me?

643
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
You must be joking.

644
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,240
Actually, I am.

645
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,280
But I have to warn you

646
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,280
not to fall in love with me,

647
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,360
because I'm already in love with someone else.

648
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,920
You guys talk.

649
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,850
I need to go back.

650
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,120
Do you need help?

651
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,000
No need.

652
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,860
I have Xiaojun.

653
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,960
Take care.

654
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,440
Why do I sense

655
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,330
hostility between you two?

656
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,160
Really?

657
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,090
I feel Liangchen and I are getting along well.

658
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,360
How did it go?

659
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,700
Did you ask her?

660
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
What should I say?

661
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,520
If she didn't take it,

662
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,080
she'd feel offended.

663
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,520
If she did take it,

664
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,780
she wouldn't admit it.

665
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,960
So our hands are tied.

666
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,840
I still think she's odd.

667
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,320
Why?

668
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Just a hunch.

669
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
It can be wrong.

670
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,680
Take your time.

671
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,610
I need to go home.

672
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
You don't need to come this afternoon.

673
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll ask the nurse to bring me lunch.

674
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,920
You've been absent from school for days.

675
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,280
I don't have any class.

676
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,480
Students are all busy with speeches.

677
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
When Gu Yanzhen comes,

678
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,740
tell him to be careful.

679
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,380
His dad is the negotiator.

680
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,160
Students all know his name.

681
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,780
If the negotiation fails,

682
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,290
he'll be in trouble.

683
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,440
I will.

684
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,400
See you.

685
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,800
Bye.

686
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Hi, Xianrong.

687
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,520
Xie Liangchen.

688
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,200
Liangchen,

689
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,770
what are you doing here?

690
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,840
I need some fresh air.

691
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,160
Are you alone?

692
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,520
My friend went home.

693
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,290
Are you leaving?

694
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,760
Xianrong,

695
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,480
could you do me a favor?

696
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
The water is cold.

697
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,090
Can you bring me some hot water?

698
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,040
Sure.

699
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
You're skilled, Xianrong.

700
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
I have no skills.

701
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,420
I'm just flexible.

702
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,880
Why do you have callus on your palm?

703
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,260
You practiced kung fu?

704
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,400
I know nothing about kung fu.

705
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,160
I got it from doing chores.

706
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,840
I thought

707
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,970
only sabers could leave that mark.

708
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,000
You're wrong.

709
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,400
Ms. Huo.

710
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,780
Well, it's not her.

711
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,410
Gu Yanzhen and Shen Junshan wouldn't take it.

712
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,120
That leaves Jin Xianrong.

713
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,800
Hold it tight.

714
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,570
Don't drop it again.

715
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,120
Thank you.

716
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
I'm leaving then.

717
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,160
Bye.

718
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,210
Why didn't you tell me about the shooting?

719
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,880
What have you been doing?

720
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,890
When the shooting began, you were in Nanjing.

721
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,680
I couldn't reach you.

722
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,640
It's been a while since I came back.

723
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,900
You should've told me.

724
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,360
Manting,

725
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,680
it's not just this movie.

726
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,560
All your work has been

727
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,580
canceled except for your show in Paramo.

728
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,480
What did you say?

729
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,800
Mr. Duan has terminated your contract.

730
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,380
Your dad signed it for you.

731
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,400
Manting,

732
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,380
you know my situation.

733
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,960
My whole family is counting on me.

734
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,280
Mr. Duan

735
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,090
has reassigned me to Pingting.

736
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,800
Yang's with her now.

737
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,640
I know

738
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
leaving you right now

739
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,920
isn't right,

740
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
plus, you've always been good to me.

741
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,730
But my mom's in poor health.

742
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,530
I have no choice.

743
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,640
I'm sorry.
