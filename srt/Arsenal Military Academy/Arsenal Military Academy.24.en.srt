00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,580
Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 24

4
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,960
What?

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,400
The Rong Mansion invited me for their birthday celebration?

6
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,600
Ridiculous!

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not an opera performer.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Why do they want me there?

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,979
They're humiliating you.

10
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,039
They assume that you have no work to do

11
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,240
and your price is low.

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,240
Honestly, when they came to me,

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,160
I was pissed.

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,360
How about

15
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,890
I turn them down?

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,280
The Rong Mansion

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,050
is a house of royal members.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,020
Attending their event isn't embarrassing.

19
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,830
Go to tell them

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,880
I'll be there.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,860
Ask them to send a car to pick me up.

22
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,280
Can I get any lower?

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,320
Xiang,

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
stop, stop.

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,570
Xiaojun.

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,930
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,200
Gu Yanzhen is hungry

28
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,860
so he asked me to buy some food.

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Aren't you sweet and thoughtful?

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,920
Knock it off. He's sick.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,770
Go back quickly. It's late.

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,920
Tomorrow

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,100
is your day off.

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,280
Come to my place.

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,090
My mom's been asking about you.

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,760
I'm sorry I can't.

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I have things to do.

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,600
What is it?

39
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,520
You're nosy.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,440
I'll tell you if you need to know.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,240
Go back now.

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,700
Go back.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,440
Go.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
Like I want to know.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,490
Let's go.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,080
OK.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,800
See you.

48
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,720
Be careful.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,280
What a quack!

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,760
Let me see.

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,800
You...you look much better.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,860
You looked as red as

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,079
a lobster yesterday.

54
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,280
Today, it's a tomato.

55
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,210
Where are you going?

56
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,920
Business.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,340
About what?

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,920
Why ask?

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
You want to go with me?

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,000
How can I go out like this?

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,600
That's it.

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,170
Just stay here and rest.

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,140
Come back quickly.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
Bring back some food.

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,810
Can't you go eat in the canteen?

66
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,280
Gosh,

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,200
it's just nearby.

68
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,080
We're all classmates.

69
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
No need to be embarrassed.

70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,160
I won't go out.

71
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,899
So spoiled!

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,320
You heard me?

73
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,200
I did.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,420
Liangchen.

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,280
What's wrong?

76
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,840
Ji Jin,

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,480
may I borrow your bike?

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,200
Sure.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
It's downstairs.

80
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,840
Thank you.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Is Shen Junshan not here?

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,970
Junshan?

83
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,340
He left last night.

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,770
Alright.

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,720
-I'm off. -OK.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,659
Isn't this Shen Junshan's house?

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,659
You look sharp.

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,760
Young ladies in the Rong Mansion

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
may eat you alive.

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,880
If so,

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,500
I'll eat them alive first.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,420
All gifts have been

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,810
placed in the trunk.

94
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,600
See you.

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,360
Manting.

96
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,960
Didn't you say a car would pick me up?

97
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,920
Where was it?

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,120
I didn't see it.

99
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,520
There are too many guests.

100
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,780
They're shorthanded.

101
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,000
I heard that the head of Yuanqing Troupe

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
also came himself.

103
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,640
So they hired opera performers?

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,650
Oh, well,

105
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,820
guess I'm no different from them.

106
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,040
Thank you for picking me up.

107
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,160
I'm new here.

108
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm not familiar with the route.

109
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
You're welcome. Please.

110
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,320
Didn't you say all guests came themselves?

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know what's going on.

112
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,080
I want to kill you!

113
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,600
Miss,

114
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
your invitation, please.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,760
I don't have it.

116
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,690
I'm a performer.

117
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,760
A performer?

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,159
Go to the backyard.

119
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,880
This way.

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Where are you going?

121
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,770
Do your makeup here.

122
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,800
When it's your turn,

123
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
you'll be called.

124
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Don't run around.

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
If anything is missing,

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,040
you can't afford the consequence.

127
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,920
Excuse me?

128
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm here...

129
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,280
A performer,

130
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,520
has such a bad temper.

131
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,080
Sorry.

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,960
What did you just say?

133
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,490
Manting,

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
don't be mad at the servant.

135
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,400
It's not worth it.

136
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,760
I'm not mad at him.

137
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm mad at you.

138
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,720
You asked me to take the rickshaw.

139
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,320
Come back.

140
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Don't move.

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,720
Come back.

142
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,680
You're dead!

143
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,840
Manting,

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,600
where are you going?

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm about to explode.

146
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,800
If I see Yuan Pingting here, I may destroy her.

147
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,440
Then...

148
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,120
Then...

149
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,290
Then come back quickly.

150
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Mr. Shen, the road ahead is blocked.

151
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,160
Go to have a look.

152
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,800
OK.

153
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,450
Junshan.

154
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,970
What are you doing here?

155
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,880
Get in.

156
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,640
Looking From Afar There They Are

157
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,050
The Eight Immortals are here to pay respects.

158
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,130
-Look how great it is. -My lady,

159
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,660
your servant Pei Shun,

160
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,200
together with my family,

161
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
my wife and kids

162
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,200
come to pay our respects.

163
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,000
-Rise. -Rise.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
-Come on. -Get up.

165
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,760
Rise.

166
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,440
You've become a commander.

167
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't call yourself a servant.

168
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,520
Others may laugh at you.

169
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,120
Am I right?

170
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,240
My lady,

171
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,880
I've only got this far

172
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,480
because of Lord Rong, my lady,

173
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,180
and Lord Chengrui's help.

174
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,920
I'll never forget that.

175
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,540
Pei Shun,

176
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,840
over the past few years,

177
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,280
you've been doing great.

178
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,440
You didn't embarrass our family.

179
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
What's more,

180
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,480
you're grateful to your old master.

181
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,520
That alone

182
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,240
is a rare virtue.

183
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,560
I grew up in the Rong Mansion.

184
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,280
Loyalty and righteousness

185
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,200
are in my blood.

186
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,120
I've kept telling myself

187
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,960
that I came from the Rong Mansion.

188
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,480
I should

189
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,920
always be responsible and considerate

190
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,760
so that I wouldn't shame my lord.

191
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,560
Good.

192
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,720
Well said.

193
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,280
In Feng'an,

194
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,090
everyone respects my lord.

195
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,600
No one dares to pick on me.

196
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,800
I've only

197
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,370
become who I am today

198
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
because of my lord.

199
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,840
That I'll never forget.

200
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,760
Good.

201
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,760
Aren't you going to reward him?

202
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,360
Sure.

203
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,250
Reward him handsomely.

204
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,540
Thank you, my lady.

205
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,620
Thank you, my lord.

206
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,120
How long have you been with Qu Manting?

207
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,720
Two years.

208
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,650
That man surnamed Shen,

209
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,840
what's his relationship with Qu Manting?

210
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,170
He's Manting's friend.

211
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,680
Friend?

212
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
More like her boy toy.

213
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,400
He isn't.

214
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,200
Mr. Shen's been in love with Manting for years.

215
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
Manting, Manting.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Who pays your salary?

217
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,760
I...I won't say it again.

218
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,420
Don't be like this.

219
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,140
Others would think I bullied you.

220
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
No, no.

221
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,320
Look at you,

222
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,050
only people like Qu Manting

223
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,290
would hire losers like you.

224
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,240
Tell me,

225
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,890
which one of us is prettier?

226
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,160
You're prettier of course.

227
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm not your match.

228
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,480
Not you.

229
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,890
I mean between Qu Manting and me, who's prettier?

230
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,760
Of...of course

231
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
you're prettier.

232
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,920
You stuttered.

233
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,320
You must be lying.

234
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,260
Don't move.

235
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,120
So

236
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,760
you think I'm not prettier than Qu Manting?

237
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,480
I...

238
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,240
I'll go out

239
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,040
to see what's going on there.

240
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,600
It's great.

241
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,880
Chengrui prepared it.

242
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,920
Thank you, son.

243
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,320
Such a good boy.

244
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
Go see who let off the fireworks.

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,560
OK.

246
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,080
This part is my favorite.

247
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,960
What's going on now?

248
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,930
Who the hell are you?

249
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,700
How dare you make a scene here?

250
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,800
This is...

251
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,460
What are you doing?

252
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,210
Long time no see,

253
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,360
my lady.

254
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,680
I come to pay my respects.

255
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,720
What on earth is going on?

256
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,280
What's wrong?

257
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,680
Yeah, what's happening?

258
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,740
You're not welcomed here.

259
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,840
Get out.

260
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,349
You haven't changed a bit, my lady.

261
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,890
You still love kicking others out.

262
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,760
What a shame!

263
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,000
The time has changed.

264
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,960
Director of Huning Railway Bureau, Song Xiwen,

265
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,089
do you remember him?

266
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,569
Who is he?

267
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,339
Never heard of him.

268
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,640
It doesn't matter if you don't know him.

269
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,120
You should know

270
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,180
his daughter then.

271
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,880
She's He Ruyang's wife.

272
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
Mr. Song's daughter has quite a bad temper.

273
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,280
She used to whip a maid to death

274
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,080
who tried to seduce her husband.

275
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
You don't know

276
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,780
such juicy gossip?

277
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,720
Why should I?

278
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
Let me make this clearer.

279
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,440
Yuan Pingting,

280
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,600
according to seniority,

281
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm superior to you.

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm not afraid that you pick on me.

283
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,760
But before you do anything stupid,

284
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,920
think carefully if

285
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,600
you can handle the consequence

286
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,080
after you piss me off.

287
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,600
This is

288
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,320
custom-made in Liuzhou,

289
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
a cloud-patterned coffin engraved with the words "happiness" and "longevity".

290
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,200
It's made of fine wood

291
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,960
and painted 35 times.

292
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,160
Abbot of the Tianlong Temple

293
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,680
carved sutras and charms on the outside,

294
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,600
inside, which contains 9 layers.

295
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,000
It's as luxurious as the empress's coffin.

296
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,820
I believe such an honor

297
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,720
surely matches your status

298
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,680
as the former princess of Qing Dynasty.

299
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,320
Shut up!

300
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,980
Drive them all out!

301
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,080
Please.

302
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,040
I dare you!

303
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,680
Do you want to die?

304
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,680
I came to pay my respects.

305
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,240
Do you have to pick a fight?

306
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,400
If someone gets hurt,

307
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,920
and blood gushes out,

308
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,770
won't it spoil the mood?

309
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,240
Am I right?

310
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,240
Son,

311
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,400
don't waste time on her. Kick her out!

312
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,080
Get out.

313
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,360
You're so cruel.

314
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
Back then, you kicked me out.

315
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,130
I held no grudge and came to celebrate your birthday.

316
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,600
Not only wasn't I served

317
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,760
with tea or snacks,

318
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,200
but you also tried to

319
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,640
drive me out with swords

320
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,720
and threatened me.

321
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,640
I thought you'd grown.

322
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,240
Shut up.

323
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,930
Leave with your people.

324
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,120
It seems that even if I've prepared

325
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,600
a luxurious coffin

326
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,320
blessed by monks,

327
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,080
after you die,

328
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,700
you'll still be in hell

329
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,600
and be tortured with fire.

330
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,600
-You... Xianrong. -My lady. My lady.

331
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,330
-Don't stop me. -Don't push me.

332
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,290
Given what you've done,

333
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,220
if I wanted to kill you,

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,840
you'd die long ago.

335
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,920
You...

336
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,610
You'd better take care.

337
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,940
They…they…

338
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,290
they're killed.

339
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,920
Hurry!

340
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,680
I came today

341
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,800
to offer birthday congratulations

342
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,930
to Her Ladyship.

343
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
I'm sorry I interrupted you.

344
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,640
My apologies.

345
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,210
Regardless of the crimes she's committed

346
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,890
and her despicable nature,

347
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,480
it's still her birthday.

348
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,280
I'm obliged to

349
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,760
wish her

350
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
happy birthday.

351
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Here's a friendly reminder.

352
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Cherish the days you still have.

353
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,440
You may not be able to celebrate

354
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,360
another birthday.

355
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,520
You...

356
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:05,880
Don't.

357
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Sorry, everyone.

358
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,480
Take care.

359
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,000
Have you obtained the objects?

360
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,600
I have.

361
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,660
Xianrong has left.

362
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,370
Let's go.

363
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,040
Go.

364
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,450
Have you heard what he said?

365
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
I was almost scared to death.

366
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,650
I didn't hear anything.

367
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Xianrong.

368
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,120
I'm fine.

369
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,640
It's just a scratch.

370
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,040
The wound needs to be dressed.

371
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,700
What if you have an infection?

372
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,660
Liangchen,

373
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
thank you so much.

374
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,240
If it hadn't been for you,

375
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,100
Junshan would've been in danger.

376
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Don't mention it.

377
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,920
Junshan and I are classmates

378
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,650
and friends.

379
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,640
Friends should help each other.

380
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,280
By the way,

381
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
why were you there?

382
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,920
I...

383
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,780
Don't get me wrong.

384
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,160
I have no other intentions.

385
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,290
I'm simply curious.

386
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,540
If you don't want to answer it,

387
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,640
it's OK.

388
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,080
There's nothing to hide.

389
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,040
I was investigating something

390
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,840
so I followed that Japanese man.

391
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,240
I had no idea

392
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,260
that he was going to hurt Junshan.

393
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,290
How did you know he's Japanese?

394
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,280
I saw that

395
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,840
he had free access to the Japan COC

396
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,240
and the way he moved and spoke

397
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,640
resembled the Japanese.

398
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,060
What were you investigating?

399
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,040
I only have a theory.

400
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,560
There's no proof yet.

401
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,280
Whatever you're working on,

402
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,210
it's dangerous.

403
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,260
You must be extra careful.

404
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,340
I know.

405
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,120
You know why I beat you?

406
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,720
I know.

407
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,200
I failed in my duty.

408
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,600
You acted on your own

409
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,600
and disobeyed my orders.

410
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,240
Boss...

411
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,410
Don't pretend that you don't understand.

412
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,280
Fujiwara,

413
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,440
you know what I'm talking about.

414
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,680
I dare not.

415
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,880
Really?

416
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,240
You're bold as brass.

417
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,280
I told you to stall him,

418
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,130
yet you took the liberty

419
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,600
and tried to kill him.

420
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,720
Not only did he

421
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,280
kill our soldiers,

422
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,740
but he also sabotaged our plans repeatedly.

423
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
I found you in the wild

424
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,650
and brought you back to be my slave.

425
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,810
Your only mission is to obey my orders.

426
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,320
Understand?

427
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,400
Yes.

428
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,600
I should've killed you

429
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
but I need you to do something for me.

430
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,460
If it goes wrong again,

431
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,400
don't bother to come back alive.

432
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,520
Yes.

433
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,640
Boss,

434
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,040
I fear that man

435
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,050
will weaken your morale

436
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,240
and make you forget your faith

437
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,200
and hatred.

438
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,580
It's none of your concern.

439
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,520
Father.

440
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,680
Is your mother asleep?

441
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,810
She just went to bed.

442
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,520
OK.

443
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,680
Why are you still up?

444
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,560
I can't sleep.

445
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,520
Are you still worried about what happened in the morning?

446
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,370
Don't worry.

447
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
I'll get back what we lost.

448
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,000
Even if you can get the lost things back,

449
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,080
those people we lost...

450
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,200
Father…

451
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,800
You've met Xianrong before?

452
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,920
I met her once on the train back to Peking.

453
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
Is she still working for

454
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,200
Hideyuki Oda?

455
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,060
Father, Xianrong…

456
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,400
Although Xianrong isn't my biological daughter,

457
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,640
I adopted her.

458
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,210
I didn't expect that she'd do such things.

459
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,180
Father, what happened before

460
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
isn't your fault.

461
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,260
She's stubborn.

462
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,310
Your mother refused to accept her and her mother.

463
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,060
Sadly,

464
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,380
after she left,

465
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,590
her mother passed away accidentally.

466
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,340
Now, she's blaming

467
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,780
your mother for it.

468
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,500
Hurry, hurry up.

469
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,220
Xiaojun, hurry.

470
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,820
Coming.

471
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,340
I'm coming.

472
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,060
Hurry up.

473
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,180
You know what,

474
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,420
I went to attend a birthday celebration,

475
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,060
yet I almost lost my life.

476
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,260
Yuan Pingting is a fool!

477
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,420
She can do nothing rather than barking.

478
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,900
Thankfully, I'm lucky and smart.

479
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,580
Otherwise, we'd both die there.

480
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,180
And?

481
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,300
And what?

482
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,380
And I came back.

483
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,460
Lord Chengrui said

484
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,060
they'd take care of the rest.

485
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,040
So we came back.

486
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,900
I guess

487
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,420
now he's in water.

488
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,700
During the celebration,

489
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,940
their foster daughter

490
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,660
came back.

491
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,300
And

492
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,460
she brought a huge coffin with her.

493
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,990
Her Ladyship was furious and almost fainted.

494
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,780
That girl's name is familiar.

495
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,380
What...

496
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,820
What's her name again?

497
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,460
Wait,

498
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,100
why did she bring back a coffin?

499
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,780
She just did.

500
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,860
There are all kinds of people

501
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,120
in those big families.

502
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,180
Wives fight against each other.

503
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,820
Besides, she's adopted.

504
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,820
Children are involved in the fight, too.

505
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,380
It's common.

506
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,260
You're ignorant.

507
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,540
It must be exciting.

508
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,020
How could you say that?

509
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:48,780
Xiaojun.

510
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,340
You know,

511
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,630
I literally thought I'd die there.

512
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,910
There was only one thing in my mind.

513
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Guess what it was.

514
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,460
I guess

515
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,340
you wanted to leave all your property to me.

516
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,260
Of course not.

517
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,380
In your dreams!

518
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,060
I was thinking

519
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,660
I hadn't heard Gu Yanzhen saying he loves me.

520
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,540
I couldn't die.

521
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,620
You're helpless!

522
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm serious.

523
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,620
As they say,

524
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,580
fortune awaits those who survived the disaster.

525
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,900
It's absolutely true.

526
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,060
I believe that one day, Gu Yanzhen

527
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,100
will fall head over heels in love with me.

528
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,820
And then

529
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,860
I'll wear a white wedding gown

530
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,980
and walk down the aisle with him.

531
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,380
He will say he loves me

532
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,540
in front of everyone

533
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,540
and promise

534
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,140
he'll look after me forever.

535
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,180
You must come to my wedding.

536
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,420
Of course, yes.

537
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,780
Lunatic.

538
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,540
Go do your work.

539
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,340
Why are you staring at me?

540
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,600
I don't know anything.

541
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,060
Off you go.

542
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,460
I'll sit here for a while.

543
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,990
Go ahead.

544
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,420
Hurry up.

545
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,280
Gu Yanzhen and I are getting married.

546
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,940
Your turn.

547
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,620
Excuse me?

548
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,140
What's wrong?

549
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,180
What brings you here

550
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,470
in the middle of the night, my lord?

551
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,380
You refused to see me

552
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,420
so I had to come in person.

553
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,420
Sorry for my abrupt visit.

554
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,840
Let's cut to the chase.

555
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,460
You should know why I'm here.

556
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,220
I'm sorry I can't help you.

557
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,080
You can't do it?

558
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,420
I can do it

559
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,580
but instead of

560
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,860
stealing things

561
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,980
to help your emperor restore his regime,

562
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,980
I'd rather leave it to the Japanese.

563
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,380
Aren't you Chinese?

564
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,340
I am Chinese

565
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,100
but I'm not your people's slave.

566
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,420
What a shame!

567
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,900
I thought you and me

568
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,380
would always be close friends.

569
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
If you have other business for me,

570
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm willing to cooperate.

571
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,820
I shall take my leave.

572
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,870
Take care. Goodbye.

573
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,020
Boss.

574
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,100
Tell Xiaodao and Zhameng

575
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,160
to keep an eye on the Japan COC.

576
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,590
I think the one in charge

577
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,020
and the woman who brought the coffin

578
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,150
are the same person.

579
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,180
Boss,

580
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,500
are we going to…

581
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,460
Both sides are bad.

582
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,380
That object

583
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,860
should be in our own hands.

584
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,420
I see.

585
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Where are you going, Miss?

586
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,540
The Qu Residence in Taoyuan Lane.

587
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,020
Got it.

588
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,020
Sir.

589
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,540
Come in.

590
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,740
Director.

591
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,620
What is it?

592
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,340
A woman outside

593
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
has a document issued by the police,

594
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,860
saying she needs to borrow

595
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,190
a student for business.

596
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,300
Go outside and

597
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,220
tell her

598
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,620
the exam is coming.

599
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,820
All students are busy.

600
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,680
Make her leave.

601
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,620
Yes.

602
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,140
Haven't I told you...

603
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:14,860
Are you?

604
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,140
Director Guo, right?

605
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,500
Hello.

606
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm surnamed Qu,

607
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,300
Qu Manting.

608
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,280
What a lovely name!

609
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,220
Hey corporal,

610
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,080
bring a glass of water.

611
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,100
No need.

612
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,630
I'm not thirsty.

613
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,280
Make yourself at home.

614
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,220
Have a seat.

615
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,180
Ms. Qu,

616
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,700
what can I do for you?

617
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,220
Here's the thing.

618
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,620
Lately, I feel

619
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,700
someone's been stalking me.

620
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,480
I stayed at home for a few days,

621
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,380
but I can't always stay indoors.

622
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,270
So I talked to Director Wang

623
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,700
and he told me to talk to you.

624
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,460
He said

625
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,660
With students' protection,

626
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,580
I'd be safe.

627
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,390
Don't worry.

628
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,940
I won't ask them to work for free.

629
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,740
I'll pay.

630
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,120
You name the price.

631
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,780
It's up to you.

632
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,240
Someone's been stalking you?

633
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,980
Yes.

634
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,460
I think.

635
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,060
Do you know

636
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,350
who your stalker is?

637
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,060
I have no idea.

638
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,840
How about this?

639
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,300
I'll ask

640
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,980
some of our best students

641
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,140
to protect you 24/7.

642
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,380
No need.

643
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,780
One is enough.

644
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,790
I've picked one myself.

645
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,700
Take a look.

646
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,190
You know each other?

647
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,900
Are you sure

648
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,190
him alone is enough?

649
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,830
We aren't close,

650
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,020
but I know his kung fu is good.

651
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,260
He's smart

652
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,040
and righteous.

653
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,340
I trust him.

654
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,900
Also, I'll try to stay at home

655
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,030
as long as possible.

656
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,660
OK.

657
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,660
Here.

658
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,270
Have some water.

659
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,900
Thanks.

660
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,740
Ms. Qu,

661
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,940
do you mind if I ask

662
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,580
how old you are?

663
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,660
I'm 21.

664
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,860
21 is good.

665
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,740
That's right.

666
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,420
Right?

667
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,140
What's right?

668
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,260
Nothing.

669
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,790
Nothing.

670
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,740
How many people are there in your family?

671
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,340
My father, mother,

672
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,140
and a sister.

673
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,180
Your father is Qu...

674
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,020
Qu Huaishu.

675
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,980
He's my father.

676
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,660
Are you

677
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,780
a student now?

678
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,180
No.

679
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm an actress.

680
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,000
I occasionally sing, too.

681
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,710
That's nice.

682
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,840
Where do you usually perform?

683
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,380
I performed in Shanghai.

684
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,840
Now, I'm back in Shunyuan,

685
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,700
I sometimes perform in Paramo.

686
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,580
You're welcomed to watch it.

687
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,340
Anytime.

688
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,020
I will.

689
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,230
I will go to watch it.

690
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,420
Is your hand OK?

691
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,220
It's just a scratch.

692
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,020
Not a big deal.

693
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,860
The old wound hasn't healed,

694
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,980
and now there's another one.

695
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,380
You'd better be careful.

696
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,660
We're done.

697
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,520
We're leaving.

698
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,780
Hey,

699
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,180
last time, you said

700
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,660
you were investigating something.

701
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,260
How did it go?

702
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,060
Any progress?

703
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,510
It's still a theory.

704
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,500
Junshan,

705
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
there's something you should know.

706
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,340
The Royal Seal we took

707
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,060
is missing.

708
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,550
Missing?

709
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,860
When?

710
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,740
Back in the hospital.

711
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,940
I've been looking for it these days.

712
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,780
You mean

713
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,310
it has something

714
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,420
to do with the Japanese who attacked me?

715
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,300
Junshan,

716
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,620
do you believe me?

717
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,470
I suspect that it has

718
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,470
something to do with Xianrong.

719
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,300
Xianrong?

720
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,740
That day when the seal went missing,

721
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,420
only Xiaojun, Gu Yanzhen,

722
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,740
you, Ms. Huo

723
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,620
and Xianrong came to my room.

724
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,500
Others are all clean.

725
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
She's the only one left.

726
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,900
So...

727
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,340
So you suspect that Xianrong stole the seal?

728
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,340
I have my reasons.

729
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,220
Jin Xianrong and I don't get along well,

730
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,100
but that day, she came to visit me

731
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,020
and offered to pour water for me.

732
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,590
But during the process,

733
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,100
she spilled the water.

734
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,180
She could've stolen the seal

735
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,440
when I wasn't looking.

736
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,100
Besides,

737
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,420
I followed her afterwards

738
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,020
and found that she had access to the Japan COC.

739
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,940
The reason I followed

740
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,980
that Japanese man who attacked you

741
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,860
was that I saw

742
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,520
she had contact with that man.

743
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,620
Accusing Xianrong of stealing the seal

744
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,950
is somewhat arbitrary.

745
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,580
Xianrong's family is doing business.

746
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,980
Contacting the Japanese

747
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,300
and accessing the Japan COC

748
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,460
is nothing special.

749
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,670
Besides,

750
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,100
how did you

751
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,030
rule out others?

752
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,120
There were Gu Yanzhen,

753
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,110
Tan Xiaojun,

754
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,480
Huang Song,

755
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,820
Huo Xiaoyu,

756
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,060
doctors and nurses,

757
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,100
and how could you be sure

758
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,960
that they didn't enter your room?

759
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,580
Plus,

760
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,540
even if what you said was true

761
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,420
that Xianrong did steal the seal

762
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,420
and she colluded with the Japanese,

763
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,060
tell me,

764
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,980
given the relationship between Xianrong and me,

765
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,110
would she have sent killers to kill me?

766
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,380
That does seem a bit unreasonable.

767
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
Not a bit,

768
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,180
it's totally unreasonable.

769
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,140
I may not have sharp eyes,

770
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,500
but at least,

771
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,900
I can tell others' attitude towards me.

772
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,580
Xianrong wouldn't do anything bad to me.

773
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,910
She would never hurt me.

774
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,280
Gu Yanzhen.

775
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,560
Gu Yanzhen.

776
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,460
You're breaking the chopsticks.

777
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,950
Alright.

778
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,860
Stop looking at them.

779
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,300
Dig in.

780
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,140
I won't.

781
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Shame on them!

782
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,910
Alright.

783
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,500
Eat your food.

784
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,720
It's getting cold.

785
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,420
Dig in.

786
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,180
Eat up.

787
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,760
Xie Liangchen,

788
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,860
Mr. Guo asked you to go to his office.

789
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,340
Now?

790
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:22,900
Yes.

791
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,800
I need to go.

792
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,180
You eat first.

793
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,710
What do you want?

794
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,180
You want to cause more unnecessary trouble?

795
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,380
I won't be easy on you.

796
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,420
Come on.

797
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm not scared.

798
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:02,900
Shen Junshan,

799
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,280
do you like Xie Liangchen?

800
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,600
What are you trying to say?

801
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,220
I want you to

802
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,540
stay away from Xie Liangchen.

803
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,260
Because when we first entered the Academy,

804
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,460
we were really close.

805
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,700
Think about it.
