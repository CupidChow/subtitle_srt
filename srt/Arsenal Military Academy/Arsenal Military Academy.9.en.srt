Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 09

4
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,759
Liangchen.

5
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,240
It's said that

6
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,940
Sergeant Song was dismissed.

7
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,720
He privately gave orders to release the Japanese.

8
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,920
Sergeant Lv got angry when he came back.

9
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,240
When did it happen?

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,920
Yesterday.

11
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,400
Many people saw it.

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,009
He was taken away by the police.

13
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,600
Really?

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,420
I don't know it.

15
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,600
You seem weird.

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Didn't you hear it when I called you

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,810
during morning exercises?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,720
Nope.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,130
You don't look well.

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,560
Are you sick?

21
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,440
I'm fine.

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,680
Sergeant Song is a good man.

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,740
He is just a scapegoat.

24
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,130
What do you mean?

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,640
Conspiracy Theorist.

26
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,760
At ease.

27
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,920
Attention.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Today

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,820
we'll take a periodic assessment

30
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,490
to exam your training during this period.

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,240
Your results

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,280
will be directly reported to the headquarters and the Commander's Mansion.

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,079
I hope you do your best.

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,520
Show me your progress.

35
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,290
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,960
Come on.

37
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,900
Liangchen.

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
Take my hand.

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,200
Forget about me. Go.

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,160
Hold me. Come on

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,620
Be careful.

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,960
Shen Junshan.

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Yes.

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,400
Excellent.

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Work harder.

46
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,500
Thank you, sir.

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
Ji Jin.

48
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,960
Yes.

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,680
Good.

50
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,010
Excellent, too.

51
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,380
Thank you, sir.

52
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,760
Zhu Yanlin.

53
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,600
Yes.

54
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,620
Qualified.

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,780
Thank you, sir.

56
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Huang Song

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Yes.

58
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,900
Excellent.

59
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,040
Good boy.

60
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
If only you did better in academic courses.

61
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,320
Thank you, sir.

62
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
I will try it.

63
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,480
Get back.

64
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,960
Yes.

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,720
Xie Liangchen.

66
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Yes.

67
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
All failed in

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
weight running, steeplechase, and physical confrontation.

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Except shooting.

70
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
What happened to you?

71
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
I'm ashamed to take your bad results

72
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,120
to see the officers.

73
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,880
They have spent so much money

74
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
on training you as an elite officer.

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,680
Permission to speak, Sir.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,200
I am not feeling well today.

77
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,080
No excuses.

78
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
When you go to the battlefield

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,610
and you don't feel well,

80
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,100
can you tell your enemy to fight another day?

81
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
Prepare for the reexamination.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,960
If you still get this at reexamination,

83
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,420
switch to civilian staff.

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,560
Yes.

85
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,640
Sergeant.

86
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,170
It's not so serious.

87
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,560
Our school trains officers,

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,400
not soldiers.

89
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,560
Gu Yanzhen.

90
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,940
Don't dare to interrupt without my permission.

91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
Look at your results.

92
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,080
Unqualified weight running.

93
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,720
The worst result in the squad.

94
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,680
You are a big man

95
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,240
but even Xie Liangchen runs faster than you.

96
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,040
What's wrong?

97
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,840
Were you sick as well?

98
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,000
Sergeant, I didn't sleep well last night.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,360
I got up late

100
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,680
and didn't eat anything.

101
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,280
Shut up.

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,090
Reexamine with him.

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
If you fail again,

104
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,000
wait for my punishment.

105
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,570
Take it away.

106
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Li Wenzhong.

107
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,880
Yes.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,720
You crying?

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,840
Really?

110
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,400
I didn't get upset though I was the worst.

111
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,860
What do you feel bad about?

112
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,140
I'm not crying.

113
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,200
In fact, I got the worst result deliberately.

114
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,880
I did it in consideration of you.

115
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,280
Because I was afraid you would feel bad

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,480
if you were the worst.

117
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,770
Are you touched?

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Repay me by doing my laundry.

119
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,720
No way.

120
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,920
You did it for the others.

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
Why can't you do it for me?

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,860
Xie Liangchen.

123
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,280
Aren't you feeling well?

124
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,200
No.

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,880
You don't look very well.

126
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,680
Are you sick?

127
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm fine.

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,210
Go to your business.

129
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,970
A lot of clothes, right?

130
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,400
You know it.

131
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,800
Please wash your dirty clothes

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,000
when you change them.

133
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,340
I'm not your nanny.

134
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,300
What are you doing?

135
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
The water is too cold.

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,280
You have so many clothes.

137
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,610
The water is not enough.

138
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,900
Don't waste it.

139
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
I'll get more water if it's not enough.

140
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,450
Where to get?

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
Only one hour each day

142
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
for hot water supply.

143
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
Don't do that.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Then don't wash them.

145
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,400
My clothes are all wet.

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,860
Will you wash the clothes?

147
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,480
I will.

148
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
I will wash them.

149
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
Let me wash.

150
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,360
Get up.

151
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,440
Go out.

152
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,960
Out.

153
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,170
What are you doing with the box?

154
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,800
Where are you going?

155
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,360
Home.

156
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
For what?

157
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,760
The laundry.

158
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,400
It's a toilet?

159
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,960
Buddy.

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,320
Shen Junshan.

161
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,800
Who are you?

162
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,980
Allow me to introduce myself.

163
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
My name is Gu Qiqi.

164
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,480
G-U, Gu.

165
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,880
Q-I-Q-I, Qiqi.

166
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,840
It also means I'm looking forward to meeting you.

167
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,760
I am fifteen years old,

168
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,890
studying in Xinhua Girls' School.

169
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,200
Oh, my gosh.

170
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,600
I meet you here.

171
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,120
And I'm talking to you.

172
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,640
I'm so excited.

173
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,800
Stay with me.

174
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,400
I know you.

175
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,080
You are Shen Junshan.

176
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,440
Your brother is Chairman Shen of Shunyuan COC.

177
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,320
You studied abroad and just returned,

178
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,040
the student of the Arsenal Military Academy.

179
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,800
The most important is that

180
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,880
I admire you very much.

181
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
You got the wrong person.

182
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
I saw everything

183
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,520
outside the city,

184
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,050
on the road to Wang village.

185
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Don't worry.

186
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,000
I won't say anything about it.

187
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,720
I swear it.

188
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,880
I don't know what you said.

189
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,640
It wasn't me.

190
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,760
My hero.

191
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
Believe me.

192
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,210
I'm not a bad guy.

193
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
Shen Junshan.

194
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,480
Stop.

195
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm here for my brother.

196
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,330
What did you say?

197
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,360
I said I was here for...

198
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
What did you say to Shen Junshan?

199
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,640
I...

200
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,720
You said outside the city,

201
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,440
on the way to Wang village.

202
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,240
What did you see?

203
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,640
I...

204
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,080
I didn't see anything.

205
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,640
I was kidding with him.

206
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,120
What did you see on earth?

207
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Tell me.

208
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,580
Did Junshan kill the Japanese in the car?

209
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,680
Are you crazy?

210
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,800
I told you I didn't see anything.

211
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,440
If my dad and my brother knew it,

212
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,360
you would die.

213
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Really?

214
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,320
Your dad? Your brother?

215
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,580
You won't tell me, huh?

216
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
- No. - What are you doing?

217
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,480
Go.

218
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
- I'll throw you down. - How dare you?

219
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,480
Let me go.

220
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,020
Believe me I will do it.

221
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,560
Say it.

222
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,280
Say it.

223
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,200
Let me go. Let me go.

224
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,080
I will say it.

225
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,000
I will tell you.

226
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,000
I will tell you.

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,330
Don't play tricks on me.

228
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
Pang took me to practice cycling

229
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,800
outside the city.

230
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,640
Say the point.

231
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,440
I...I'm getting there.

232
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,920
I'm getting to the point.

233
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,580
I'll talk about Shen Junshan.

234
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,200
When I was riding,

235
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
a car suddenly drove by.

236
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,730
And mud splattered all over me.

237
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,640
You would be angry if it was you, right?

238
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,800
I was pissed off.

239
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,100
And I rode my bicycle and ran after it.

240
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,360
Guess what I found?

241
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,680
Yanzhen.

242
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,360
You want to die?

243
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,840
Say it.

244
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,720
No?

245
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,880
Say it.

246
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,730
Are you alright?

247
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,400
He...

248
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,000
Is he dead?

249
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,569
None of your business. Go.

250
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,589
What should we do?

251
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,420
None of your business. Go now.

252
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:26,640
Wait.

253
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,960
Remember it.

254
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,600
You know nothing about

255
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,040
what Shen Junshan did that day.

256
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,970
You saw nothing.

257
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,080
Don't come to him again.

258
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,140
Don't tell anyone.

259
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,960
Get it?

260
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,640
Yes. Get it.

261
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,260
Gu Yanzhen.

262
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Open the door.

263
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,640
Gu Yanzhen.

264
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,200
Gu Yanzhen.

265
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,560
Open the door.

266
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,420
Xie Liangchen.

267
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,080
Open the door.

268
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,460
Xie Liangchen.

269
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,760
What's up?

270
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,360
Shen Junshan.

271
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,960
I think I killed someone.

272
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,600
Sit.

273
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,200
Don't be afraid. Tell me.

274
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,220
What happened?

275
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,280
Li Wenzhong.

276
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,640
I think I killed Li Wenzhong.

277
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,240
Calm down.

278
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,700
What the hell is it?

279
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,200
What happened to him?

280
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,800
I overheard your conversation with the girl.

281
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,540
So did Li Wenzhong.

282
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,520
He chased the girl away.

283
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
I was afraid he hurt you.

284
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,170
So I followed up.

285
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,880
I saw him asking the little girl

286
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,800
about you.

287
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,420
She refused to say.

288
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,640
Li Wenzhong threatened to drown her.

289
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Then

290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
in panic,

291
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,280
I hit him with a stone.

292
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,920
Then he...

293
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Shen Junshan.

294
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Did I murder him?

295
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,120
Will he die?

296
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,560
Don't be afraid.

297
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
We don't know yet.

298
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,560
You tried to save people.

299
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,760
Not only did you save her,

300
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
you also saved me.

301
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,240
Now recall it.

302
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,120
Did anyone else see it?

303
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,640
Besides the little girl,

304
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
is there anyone else?

305
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,880
I...I don't know.

306
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm not sure.

307
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,640
Clear the blood.

308
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,500
And have a rest.

309
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,010
Leave the rest to me.

310
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,640
But...

311
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,410
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

312
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,400
Really?

313
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Do you believe me?

314
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,160
Yes, I do.

315
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,720
Go.

316
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,320
Junshan.

317
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
- Go back now. - OK.

318
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,080
Let's go.

319
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,760
Junshan.

320
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,360
I was looking for you.

321
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,280
What happened?

322
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
Wenzhong was hit by someone.

323
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,080
He was hit?

324
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,760
Yes.

325
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,640
It's serious.

326
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,160
He's in a coma.

327
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,120
Ji Jin drove him

328
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,520
to the hospital just now.

329
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,330
Is his life endangered?

330
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
It's hard to tell.

331
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,560
He was hit on the head.

332
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,520
Do you know who did it?

333
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,160
Not yet.

334
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,120
But it should

335
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,720
be done by someone outside school.

336
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
We found

337
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
an unknown ladder outside the wall.

338
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,970
Don't be afraid.

339
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
I'll be back soon.

340
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,880
Shen...Shen Junshan.

341
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,400
You are so curious.

342
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,480
If you want to know,

343
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,130
why don't you come to me?

344
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,460
Why did you threaten the little girl?

345
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
So it was true?

346
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,720
The people in the car,

347
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,530
you killed them all?

348
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,040
Don't you think

349
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,640
they deserve to die?

350
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,360
Now you know it.

351
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,730
What do you want?

352
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,220
Snitch on me to the police?

353
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,760
Or...

354
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,280
To the Japanese?

355
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,680
Or go to the press

356
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,480
and claim bonuses for the clue?

357
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,000
I...

358
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Li Wenzhong.

359
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,800
Our families have known

360
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,260
each other for many years.

361
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,370
You know me and my family very well.

362
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,400
You should know

363
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
I did this in secret

364
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,700
because I don't want any trouble.

365
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,760
But it doesn't mean

366
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm afraid of trouble.

367
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,360
And It doesn't mean

368
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,690
I can't solve

369
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,800
the trouble if any.

370
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,380
You all thought I just returned home.

371
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,290
Actually, I didn't.

372
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,280
I have been back long ago.

373
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
I studied medicine in British

374
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,840
and served as a medic back here.

375
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,970
I took part in many battles.

376
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,420
Not large ones,

377
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,680
but they were all bitter.

378
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,730
At Pianma in Yunnan,

379
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
I killed many people.

380
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,840
I don't even know

381
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
the exact number.

382
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,220
Don't get me wrong.

383
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,280
I'm not to scare you.

384
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
I want you to know

385
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,840
who you're dealing with.

386
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,220
Lest you don't know the situation

387
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,680
and do something rash,

388
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,780
resulting in unpleasant consequences.

389
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,000
Of course.

390
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,880
If you don't care about this,

391
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,440
I won't mind

392
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,160
solving another trouble.

393
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,800
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,160
Patients should have more rest.

395
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,040
Goodbye.

396
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,880
By the way.

397
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,970
I forgot to tell you.

398
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,360
This hospital

399
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,520
is my family property.

400
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,840
Let the doctor know if you have any need.

401
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,240
If you have no inclination to this world,

402
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,680
they'd be happy to help you.

403
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,660
Good night.

404
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,120
Why is Liangchen here?

405
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,380
What is he doing in bed?

406
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,690
You ask too much.

407
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,320
You sleep in his room tonight.

408
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,880
Me?

409
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,680
Why?

410
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,320
No reason.

411
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,800
Don't talk nonsense. Go.

412
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,040
What?

413
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,160
I have my own room.

414
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,260
Thank god you're here.

415
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,060
What are you doing?

416
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,720
Which is Xie Liangchen's bed?

417
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,850
This one. What's up?

418
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,880
I sleep here tonight.

419
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,040
Who asks you to sleep here?

420
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,080
Where is Xie Liangchen?

421
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,960
He is in my room.

422
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,200
In your room?

423
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Why is he in your room?

424
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,480
I don't know.

425
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Anyway, he is in my room.

426
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
I sleep in his room today.

427
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,280
Who said that?

428
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,720
Shen Junshan.

429
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
When did he get to make the call?

430
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,800
Let's go.

431
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,640
What?

432
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,330
Catch up.

433
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,800
Am I so unpopular?

434
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,560
Gu Yanzhen.

435
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,720
Why do you sleep here?

436
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,980
You have your own room.

437
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,530
Get back with me.

438
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,850
Hurry up.

439
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,300
Xie Liangchen.

440
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,680
What?

441
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,860
Xie Liangchen.

442
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,320
I have a word with you.

443
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,560
What?

444
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,500
Why does it have to be private?

445
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,080
Gu Yanzhen.

446
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,010
Don't be afraid.

447
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,730
Li Wenzhong is not dead.

448
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,280
Well...

449
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,010
Don't worry.

450
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,460
He won't say anything.

451
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,360
Thank you.

452
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,000
Are you done? Go back if you're done.

453
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,680
What's the silly smile?

454
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,340
Good night.

455
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,580
Tell that to me.

456
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
Good night.

457
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,680
Junshan.

458
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,100
Something wrong with you?

459
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,400
Which is?

460
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,880
I don't know.

461
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
It's just a feeling.

462
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,920
Forget it.

463
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,940
Go to sleep.

464
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,560
I think I killed someone.

465
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,920
Don't be afraid.

466
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,050
It's uncertain yet.

467
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,840
You tried to save people.

468
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,960
Not only did you save her,

469
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
you also saved me.

470
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,480
Clear the blood.

471
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,340
And have a rest.

472
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,850
Leave the rest to me.

473
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,330
Don't be afraid.

474
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,850
Li Wenzhong is not dead.

475
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,720
Don't worry.

476
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,340
He won't say anything.

477
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,320
Go.

478
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
Xie Liangchen.

479
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,800
Yes.

480
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,320
Not fast enough.

481
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,400
Poor endurance.

482
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,560
Deficient explosive power.

483
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Poor capability to counter-fight.

484
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,200
It's a disaster.

485
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,260
Excuse me, Sir.

486
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,560
Did he pass it?

487
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,440
Anyway,

488
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,490
you made some progress.

489
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,740
Barely qualified.

490
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,640
Great.

491
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,840
Great. Liangchen.

492
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,500
You made it.

493
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,400
Don't be too excited.

494
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,410
He's barely qualified.

495
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,920
If you get the same poor result like this next time,

496
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,250
you will be eliminated.

497
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,160
Yes.

498
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,300
Thank you, sir.

499
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,040
Tomorrow is the school anniversary holiday.

500
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,900
Three days off.

501
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,490
Pack up and get ready

502
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,880
to go home.

503
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,680
Hooray!

504
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,840
Look at you. You stick to me here

505
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,880
like a mud all day long.

506
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,540
Don't you have anything to do?

507
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,880
No. I have nothing to do

508
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,960
so I stick to you here.

509
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,800
Do you have any business?

510
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,080
Of course I do.

511
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,610
I review every day to prepare for the exam.

512
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,610
Don't you act in the movie?

513
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,960
What about Paramo's performances?

514
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,760
Canceled.

515
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,679
What about Shanghai?

516
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,520
The company puts me on vacation.

517
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,719
It has not filmed in the past two months.

518
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,190
You are miserable then.

519
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,150
So can I come here for a free drink?

520
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,230
Alright. Alright.

521
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,200
So you've been living in the hotel.

522
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Didn't your parents come to see you?

523
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,040
Manshu?

524
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,080
Mr. Shen?

525
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,240
Manshu came once.

526
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,580
But she will study in Beijing.

527
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,080
She'll leave next month.

528
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,260
Shen Tingbai comes here each day.

529
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,140
It's understandable.

530
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,620
So many Japanese died.

531
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,180
He was supervised by them.

532
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,520
Very carefree.

533
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,120
He has nowhere to go but here.

534
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,200
Look at you.

535
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,240
You made such a big trouble.

536
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,320
What do you mean I made?

537
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Who did I do it for

538
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,420
to be chased by them like a rabbit?

539
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,800
How could it be

540
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,560
a hero to save a beauty in your minds?

541
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,490
You have a point.

542
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,120
That's my wine.

543
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
It's just a drink.

544
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
I saved your life, OK?

545
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,520
You save my life?

546
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,720
Oh, god.

547
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,960
I carried you and ran

548
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,420
across the mountains, OK?

549
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,720
If it wasn't me,

550
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,320
you would have been engulfed by wolves.

551
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Don't fool me.

552
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,280
Whisky.

553
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,080
OK.

554
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,720
My lady.

555
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,180
I was there to save people.

556
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,080
You knocked me out.

557
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,100
If I was eaten by wolfs,

558
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,820
you would be the murderer.

559
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,080
I didn't know it was you.

560
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,680
You were also an accomplice.

561
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,560
Your wine.

562
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,280
Thank you.

563
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,760
The Japanese

564
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,720
were killed by Shen Tingbai?

565
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,570
I do not know.

566
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,200
How come you don't know it?

567
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,330
I'm not interested.

568
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,760
Not interested?

569
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,600
I am just not interested in it.

570
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Why do I have to be interested in him?

571
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,120
It doesn't make sense.

572
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,040
Why would he always take the credits

573
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,440
for killing the enemy?

574
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,720
Right.

575
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
These things shouldn't be

576
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,680
ascribed to Shen House.

577
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,140
I don't like them, either.

578
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,480
They wear their poker face each day.

579
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,240
I wonder why.

580
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,440
I can't get rid of them

581
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,320
whatever I do.

582
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,100
I think it was Shen Tingbai who did it.

583
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,700
No one else in Shunyuan

584
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,720
can do

585
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,840
such a pleasant thing.

586
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,920
Since you admire him so much,

587
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,080
why don't you pursue him?

588
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,400
Don't trouble me.

589
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
I can't do that shamelessly.

590
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,440
He is the husband of my friend.

591
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,160
Yes, you can.

592
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,960
It's not shameless at all.

593
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,880
Go and get him.

594
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,880
Read your book then.

595
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,960
Come. Let's drink.

596
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,020
Let's have a drink.

597
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,380
I didn't do it well yesterday.

598
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,900
You were already awesome.

599
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,200
I will work as hard

600
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,080
as you do.

601
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,200
So crowded.

602
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,040
Your wine.

603
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Call me if you need something.

604
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,720
OK.

605
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,370
Xiaojun is here.

606
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
When did you come?

607
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,840
Just now.

608
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,240
Are you happy?

609
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Very happy.

610
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,160
Superstar.

611
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,860
- Yanzhen. - Hi.

612
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,720
You are all here.

613
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,920
No training at night?

614
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,080
No, we rest.

615
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,740
Come on, let's eat something.

616
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,400
Goodies.

617
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,760
You didn't offer us just now.

618
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,700
Help yourself.

619
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,600
Xiaojun,

620
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,040
I brought you something.

621
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,240
What?

622
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,610
Take a guess.

623
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,480
Chocolate.

624
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,640
No.

625
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,440
Cake.

626
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,480
No.

627
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,960
I can't make it.

628
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,690
Tell me then.

629
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,240
Cookies.

630
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,480
My dad brought it to me specially.

631
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,720
He asked his friend to buy it from Hong Kong.

632
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,400
Smell good?

633
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,920
So good.

634
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,240
I just want to have a look.

635
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
I didn't eat any of them.

636
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,170
I keep it for you.

637
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,200
So nice of you.

638
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,040
You take a bite.

639
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,920
I don't eat it.

640
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,580
Take a bite.

641
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,050
I don't like sweet food.

642
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,450
Just take a bite.

643
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,120
Come on.

644
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,960
Is it good?

645
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,840
Yes.

646
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,920
I think so.

647
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,640
What's up?

648
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,720
Right.

649
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,520
What?

650
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,160
Are you

651
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,720
lovers?

652
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,120
No.

653
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,560
Don't talk nonsense.

654
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,420
We are friends.

655
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Friend?

656
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,210
Even a fool can tell you are not.

657
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,040
Do they look like lovers?

658
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,680
Yes.

659
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,480
- Definitely. - Gu Yanzhen.

660
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
What do you think?

661
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,840
I don't know. I can't see it.

662
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,960
It's obvious.

663
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,360
You are definitely lovers.

664
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,120
Tan Xiaojun.

665
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,200
You hide something from me.

666
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,120
Tell me now.

667
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,240
When did you two get started?

668
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,880
How?

669
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,600
How long?

670
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Who introduced you two?

671
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,000
I...

672
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,960
I wondered why you came here to work.

673
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,090
You are here for him?

674
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,120
What?

675
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,920
She wasn't enrolled in school before I came here.

676
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,360
You knew each other recently?

677
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,220
We know each other for a long time.

678
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,240
You have a sister, right?

679
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,720
She is your friend.

680
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
So your sister introduced

681
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,960
you to her, right?

682
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,720
So you were seduced, right?

683
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,360
What seduced?

684
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,760
Be careful of your words.

685
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,560
We are just friends.

686
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Tan Xiaojun. You are... You are...

687
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,960
You!

688
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,060
Where are you from?

689
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
Who are your parents?

690
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,360
Enough.

691
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,440
What are you doing?

692
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,520
I am helping you.

693
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,080
How do you know what the man is thinking?

694
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,920
It sounds as if you were experienced.

695
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,450
Of course I am experienced.

696
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,660
I know exactly what you're thinking.

697
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,330
What's that?

698
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,490
What do you mean?

699
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Don't stare at me.

700
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,620
Liangchen.

701
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,440
Where will you go on the holiday?

702
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,080
She'll go to my family.

703
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,210
My mom has gotten the bed ready for him.

704
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,520
You said it's nothing, right?

705
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,720
He is living in your home,

706
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,920
and the bed is prepared.

707
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,720
You have met the parents, right?

708
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,520
No.

709
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,080
It's not like that.

710
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,420
You misunderstood it.

711
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,680
Xiaojun and I,

712
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,370
her parents and my parents,

713
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,080
have known each other for a long time.

714
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,160
My sister and I came here for study.

715
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,560
They take care of us a lot.

716
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,480
I visit them on holidays.

717
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,600
Can your house accommodate for them?

718
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,720
Yes, it's roomy.

719
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,700
Liangchen.

720
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
Why don't you go to my house?

721
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,640
My sister lives nearby.

722
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,130
It's close to the sea in the suburb.

723
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,840
You say you haven't seen the sea.

724
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,240
My sister has a boat.

725
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,440
We can go to the sea by boat.

726
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,780
We can catch crabs.

727
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,840
Go to your sister's home?

728
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,200
Liangchen.

729
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,720
You are a man.

730
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,640
It is inappropriate to live with Xiaojun.

731
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,240
There will be gossip

732
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,240
if you do that.

733
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,440
Maybe it's OK for you.

734
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,400
But Xiaojun is a girl.

735
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,200
It will be inconvenient.

736
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,200
You're right, bro.

737
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,600
You see, boy.

738
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,650
Even fools know better than you do.

739
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,240
No.

740
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Who is the fool?

741
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,580
I didn't mean you, my dear.

742
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,000
I think it's exactly what you mean.

743
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,000
It's inconvenient as well

744
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
to live in your home, isn't it?

745
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,720
Of course it's convenient.

746
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,520
Liangchen

747
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,240
is my buddy.

748
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,000
Let go.

749
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,240
Don't touch him.

750
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,440
What?

751
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,080
Oh, my god.

752
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,440
Are you jealous?

753
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,520
It's just a touch.

754
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Are you finished?

755
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,640
Alright. Alright.

756
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,570
I'll go with you.

757
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,680
Great.

758
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,440
No, you can't.
