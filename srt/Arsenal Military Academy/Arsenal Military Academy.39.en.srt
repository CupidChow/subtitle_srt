[English subtitles are available]

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,020
Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,500
Episode 39

4
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,440
Oda Xianrong has made her identity clear

5
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,680
by attending

6
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,900
important meetings as Japanese.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,330
Don't have any contacts with her anymore.

8
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,440
I see.

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,960
Mr. Shen,

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,820
I just got news.

11
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,400
Jinhua Hotel?

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,520
Yes.

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,890
Should we tell Junshan?

14
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,120
Not now.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,200
He always attaches great importance to relationships.

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,260
He would cause trouble if he knows it.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,290
Keep an eye on him tomorrow.

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,480
Yes.

19
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,370
Where have you been?

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,020
What have you done these days?

21
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Let go of me!

22
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,180
You have to listen to me today.

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,680
The Commander has just sent a message

24
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,079
to the Peking government

25
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,720
to negotiate with

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,690
the Japanese about the treaty.

27
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,400
And,

28
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,320
several generals, such as Feng Jikun and Duan Changxing,

29
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,000
who are too hostile to Japan,

30
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,520
have been dismissed.

31
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,280
The main force of the Japanese army is now in Jinxian,

32
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,540
less than a day's journey from Shun Yuan.

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
Now the situation outside is very grim.

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Anyone should be careful no matter

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,079
what his position is.

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,320
If you act rashly and blindly now,

37
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,960
you will get yourself involved.

38
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,920
You will even die for this!

39
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Xiaoyu,

40
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,490
listen to me.

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,690
Don't be so wayward.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,730
Be rational,

43
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,280
OK?

44
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Are you finished?

45
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,380
Then you can leave now.

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,160
Are you insane?

47
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,840
The three of them

48
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,800
were picked up by me from the street.

49
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,880
They have accompanied me for so many years.

50
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
I grew up in the theatre

51
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,940
with no parents and no relatives.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600
They are my family.

53
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,640
Now my families were killed,

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,560
can't I even avenge them?

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,200
Besides,

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,520
who are you to me?

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,370
You are in no position to tell me these.

58
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
After this,

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
whether we would live or die,

60
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,920
I won't see you again.

61
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,960
Shuting,

62
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,150
I've been pestering you for so many years,

63
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,620
finally you are going to get rid of me.

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Are you happy now?

65
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,550
Don't drink that much anymore.

66
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,370
Shunyuan is too cold in winter.

67
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
If you're drunk again,

68
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
nobody will look for you

69
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,200
street by street.

70
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,600
Marry me.

71
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,040
I don't want to watch you die.

72
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Xiaoyu,

73
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,860
let me take you away from here.

74
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,159
Your home town is Suzhou, right?

75
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,540
Let's go there,

76
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,560
OK?

77
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,040
Have you read the book I told you last time?

78
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,960
Not yet. I will read tonight.

79
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,680
That is interesting.

80
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,159
Really?

81
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,680
Xie Xiang,

82
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,360
waiting for someone?

83
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,520
Aren't you here to pick me up?

84
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,840
Get on.

85
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,030
Ms. Huo.

86
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,419
Is she here?

87
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,320
Yes.

88
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,700
Let's get started.

89
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,240
Please give us a definite answer

90
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,840
as soon as possible on the situation of Western Liaoning.

91
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,440
Miss,

92
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
there is someone from Rong Mansion.

93
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,280
Lord wants to see you.

94
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,210
He is waiting for you at Lide Hotel.

95
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,760
Tell him I'm not going.

96
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,640
He said there was something very important

97
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
that you had to go.

98
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
Excuse me.

99
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,640
Sorry.

100
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,120
This way.

101
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,920
That's all.

102
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,200
Thank you.

103
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,360
Please.

104
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,940
Where is your Lord?

105
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,920
I've got a thing

106
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
to tell you today, actually.

107
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,960
So do I.

108
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,400
You first.

109
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,480
Junshan.

110
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,240
Ms. Huo.

111
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,320
Done?

112
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,360
Yes.

113
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,920
Let's go.

114
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,660
Why did it explode suddenly?

115
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,920
It's not peaceful now.

116
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,520
I just saw people from the Japanese COC

117
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,400
went in there,

118
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,080
and the female president had gone in there, too.

119
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,760
Really?

120
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,480
Yes.

121
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,000
What they said seemed to be Oda Xianrong.

122
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,220
Do you need to check it out?

123
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,440
Young master.

124
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,930
Why are you here?

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Oda Xianrong is not in there.

126
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,220
Let me send you back first.

127
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,680
Dad,

128
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,210
why did you save her?

129
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,760
She killed my mom.

130
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
Don't do this again.

131
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,890
No matter what others would do,

132
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,730
you shouldn't be involved.

133
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,420
But that was my mom!

134
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,160
Liu,

135
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,760
you can rest in peace now.

136
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,680
Ms. Huo has taken us together to avenge you.

137
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,720
Xiaoyu!

138
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,280
Xiaoyu!

139
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,480
Sergeant Guo.

140
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,680
You must know where Xiaoyu is,

141
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,200
right?

142
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,700
Ms. Huo asked me to give you

143
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,010
the key of the tavern when she left.

144
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,040
Here is the rent for these years.

145
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,540
When our people

146
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,220
rushed to Mountsouth Tavern,

147
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,800
it was already empty.

148
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,170
Mr. Miyazawa has

149
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,320
sent people to block all the main roads.

150
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,560
But there's

151
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,400
no news of them yet.

152
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,900
Call Mr. Miyazawa and tell him

153
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,280
that we will cooperate with him

154
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,840
in the matter of Western Liaoning.

155
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,480
OK.

156
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,380
Although Huo Xiaoyu has escaped,

157
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,480
there must be something about her has left.

158
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Go find out the staffs who used to work in her tavern,

159
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
and the familiar customers,

160
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,180
bring everyone who has any

161
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,740
relationship with her back to me.

162
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,320
I don't believe

163
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,890
she won't come out then.

164
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,760
Yes.

165
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,600
And,

166
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,770
keep an eye on Rong Mansion.

167
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,880
Are you blind?

168
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,800
It was you who hit me!

169
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,880
So what?

170
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,360
So what?

171
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,440
So what?

172
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,300
Are you insane?

173
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,120
What a fool!

174
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Are you crazy?

175
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Idiot!

176
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Her name is An Wen,

177
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,480
something bad happened to her

178
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,610
when she was a child.

179
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,040
So she got an illness since then

180
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,240
that she always forgets things,

181
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,440
especially the people who is bad to her.

182
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Welcome, sir.

183
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,859
Want some flowers?

184
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm just browsing around.

185
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,280
OK.

186
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Don't you know me?

187
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,800
Please wait a second.

188
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,240
Sir,

189
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,800
should I know you?

190
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,480
No.

191
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,400
We don't know each other.

192
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,160
You can go back to your work.

193
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,800
Go back to your work.

194
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,240
I'm just

195
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,040
having a look.

196
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,140
You can go now.

197
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,680
OK,

198
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,480
just enjoy yourself.

199
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,960
An Wen!

200
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,040
Still working?

201
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm waiting for someone.

202
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,440
Then I'm leaving.

203
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,920
OK.

204
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,320
Stop! Stop!

205
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,280
Cover me!

206
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,810
Cover me!

207
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,280
What are you doing here?

208
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
I'm waiting for someone.

209
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,040
What?

210
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,200
For whom?

211
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
It's written on my note book

212
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,840
that I should wait outside for someone today.

213
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
I can't go back until the one is here.

214
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,720
Then don't get caught in the rain.

215
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,650
I'm leaving now.

216
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,900
Be careful.

217
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,040
Here.

218
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:07,920
Take it.

219
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,520
Thank you.

220
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,620
You are still here.

221
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
I have to wait for him.

222
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,720
Who?

223
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,920
It's written on my note book

224
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,760
that I should wait outside for him.

225
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,920
I can't leave before he is here.

226
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,680
You don't even know who you are waiting for

227
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,320
and you're still waiting, are you insane?

228
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,520
I have to see him.

229
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,460
Go in there.

230
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,170
I won't be polite if you come out again.

231
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,080
Stop looking!

232
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,920
Be careful next time.

233
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,520
Are you done?

234
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,040
Yes.

235
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,570
Manting,

236
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,160
thank you for the guest appearance.

237
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
It's not a big deal.

238
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,800
Nothing.

239
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,770
Besides,

240
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
the movie we made last time

241
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,280
is about to be released.

242
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,480
I've got some tickets for you.

243
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,320
You can go watch it with your friends.

244
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,160
That movie?

245
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,720
Yes, right.

246
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,880
OK, sure.

247
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,880
Thank you.

248
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,160
Then I'll see you in the cinema.

249
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,640
OK.

250
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,680
What do you, a super star, want to do?

251
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,080
The movie we made last time

252
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,400
will be released tonight.

253
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,260
After all, you've helped me once.

254
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,800
Here are some tickets.

255
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,490
You can go watch it with your friends tonight.

256
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,320
So fast!

257
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,100
Sure!

258
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm the leading star, OK?

259
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,800
It should be fast.

260
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,320
OK.

261
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,320
I will go.

262
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,240
I will.

263
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,560
Meet you there.

264
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,160
Alright.

265
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,100
Everybody, quiet!

266
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,040
Stop eating.

267
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,320
Li Wenzhong!

268
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,920
Stop that.

269
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,210
I'm telling you something.

270
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,600
Say it!

271
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,040
What's it?

272
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,600
Now…

273
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,100
Go on.

274
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,560
I want to announce a thing.

275
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,560
The new movie

276
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,920
"The Spirit of Xiangjiang"

277
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,160
will be shown at Guotai Cinema at 6:00 this afternoon.

278
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,420
The leading male actor

279
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,240
is Gu Yanzhen!

280
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,320
Our young master, Gu Yanzhen

281
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,800
will treat us to watch the movie.

282
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,560
Everybody please show your support.

283
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,160
- Sure! - OK!

284
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,240
- OK! - Thank you.

285
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,340
Thanks.

286
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,400
Thank you.

287
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,460
Gu Yanzhen,

288
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
seriously?

289
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,850
You acted in a movie?

290
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,600
Just a help for my friend.

291
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,520
I can't refuse.

292
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,100
Who is the feminine lead?

293
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,960
Qu Manting.

294
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,100
She is my favorite star!

295
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,340
Then that's too late.

296
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,880
Qu Manting loves Gu Yanzhen a lot.

297
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,000
This is known over Shunyuan.

298
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,360
Really?

299
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,930
Don't you know that?

300
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,200
Go!

301
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,260
Liangchen,

302
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,740
let's go watch the movie!

303
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,840
No, thank you.

304
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,160
Come on!

305
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,840
I haven't been to cinema

306
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
and seen a movie

307
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,170
since I was born.

308
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,000
Let's go!

309
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,240
You can go with them,

310
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,100
I don't want to.

311
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,140
Liangchen,

312
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,040
please come with us.

313
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,560
They all will go watch the movie.

314
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,120
It will be

315
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,610
so weird if you don't go.

316
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
Come on!

317
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,330
It may be very interesting!

318
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,360
Fine.

319
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,680
Yeah!

320
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,100
Ms. Qu,

321
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,280
do you have anything

322
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,610
to say about this movie?

323
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,200
Ms. Qu,

324
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,800
do you have any expectations for the box office?

325
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,440
No.

326
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,280
- Ms. Qu! - Ms. Qu!

327
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,560
Have a seat.

328
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,860
Gu Yanzhen,

329
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,800
why haven't you appeared yet?

330
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,400
Aren't you

331
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,130
the leading male actor?

332
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,620
Soon, soon.

333
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,100
On the way.

334
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Still not show up?

335
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm almost asleep!

336
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,860
Gu Yanzhen,

337
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,940
are you really the leading actor?

338
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,210
How come I didn't see any of your shots?

339
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,240
Yanlin,

340
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,480
maybe you fell asleep just now.

341
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,210
Fell asleep?

342
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,200
How can that be possible?

343
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,000
Ji Jin,

344
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,660
did you see him?

345
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,000
Not even his shadow.

346
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,880
I saw him.

347
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,680
You did?

348
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Yes.

349
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,920
The last scene.

350
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,160
Those figures viewed from behind

351
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,290
are from Gu Yanzhen.

352
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,200
Right.

353
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,640
How did you know that?

354
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,160
The leading actor is taller than Gu Yanzhen,

355
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,290
sure I can know that.

356
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,120
Which eye of yours sees that he is taller than me?

357
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,360
Both of them!

358
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,360
Your eyes are useless.

359
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,980
They should be dug out.

360
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,000
Welcome…

361
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
Xie Liangchen.

362
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,960
I passed here

363
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
on the way back to school.

364
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
Has anyone bothered you lately?

365
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,480
No.

366
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,050
That's fine.

367
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,960
These lilies are fresh.

368
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,920
Take them back with you.

369
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,720
No, thank you.

370
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,900
They will smell good in your room.

371
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,640
Don't bother.

372
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,180
This is my gift for you.

373
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,800
Fine.

374
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,760
Thank you.

375
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,450
Xiaojun.

376
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,920
Why…

377
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,000
Why are you here?

378
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
Are you here for Liangchen?

379
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,400
Yes.

380
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,040
Is he here?

381
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,640
He is out.

382
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,280
Not here.

383
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,560
Then did he tell you when he will be back?

384
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,600
No.

385
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,560
Do you have anything to tell him?

386
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,640
I can tell him for you.

387
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,200
No,

388
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,800
thank you.

389
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,100
I'll come again later.

390
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,840
Alright.

391
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,800
I'm leaving now.

392
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,280
Bye.

393
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,000
Bye.

394
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,320
Sorry! Sir!

395
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,460
- I'm so sorry! - Not again!

396
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,600
This is the second time that you spilled on me!

397
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,530
The second time!

398
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,860
I don't remember that.

399
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,840
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

400
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,700
Let me help you.

401
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,220
Forget it. Never mind.

402
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,620
What a poetic justice.

403
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,690
I'm so sorry.

404
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,600
Go,

405
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,320
note it down that this is

406
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,180
the second time you spilled on me.

407
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,040
How do you know

408
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,500
that I have a note book?

409
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,520
None of your business.

410
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,580
Just do what I said.

411
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,240
Sir,

412
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,320
sir!

413
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,850
Where is your note book?

414
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Write it down now!

415
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,200
Note book!

416
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,370
Just write that,

417
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,690
I'm Li Wenzhong,

418
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,780
the Baihua Company

419
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,890
on the street belongs to my family.

420
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,760
Baihua Company,

421
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,360
Mr. Li Wenzhong,

422
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,220
has been spilled by me,

423
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,560
twice.

424
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,120
Forget the spilling.

425
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,360
Finished?

426
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,040
The others all have their photos!

427
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,440
I should have one, too.

428
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,080
Wait a second.

429
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,520
How about this view?

430
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,760
Do I look good?

431
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,960
Look here.

432
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,000
OK.

433
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,690
Alright.

434
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,440
Remember

435
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,400
to post the photos on it when you get it.

436
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,920
OK.

437
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,440
Be careful next time.

438
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,640
Mr. Li!

439
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,730
Please wait.

440
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,960
Mr. Li.

441
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,260
This is for you.

442
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,240
What's this?

443
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,720
Lucky bamboo. It's easy to take care of.

444
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,800
Just give it some water and it can live well.

445
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I don't need this.

446
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,160
I'm really sorry for spilling you twice.

447
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,280
Take a bow!

448
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,000
Apologize needs to be sincere,

449
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,530
you know?

450
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,880
See you,

451
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
Mr. Li.

452
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,040
Xiaojun!

453
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm here. I'll go over there.

454
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:35,930
Xiaojun!

455
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,780
Let me borrow this.

456
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,480
Have a taste!

457
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,190
Xiang!

458
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,230
Xiang!

459
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,080
Save me!

460
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,840
Xiang!

461
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,880
Xiang!

462
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,480
Run!

463
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,640
Watch out!

464
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,360
Run!

465
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,700
Move!

466
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,200
What?

467
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,920
Are you crazy?

468
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,240
What are you doing?

469
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
Make way! Coming!

470
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,920
Run!

471
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,080
Stop for check.

472
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,360
Hurry up!

473
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,280
Get off!

474
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,360
Get off!

475
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,000
Get off!

476
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,600
I really don't know anything.

477
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,040
I've told you all I know.

478
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,330
Please let me go.

479
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,840
Bastard!

480
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,020
Let go of me!

481
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,880
Say it!

482
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,480
Take him away.

483
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,120
Go!

484
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,000
That's done.

485
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,680
Please wait a second.

486
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,940
I'll get the medicine.

487
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,600
OK.

488
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,240
Thank you.

489
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,130
Where is she?

490
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,000
The girl who was kidnapped by you.

491
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,730
Where is she?

492
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,120
Don't make a pretense with me,

493
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,380
I know you understand.

494
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,980
Will you say it?

495
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,880
No?

496
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,040
No?

497
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,400
She…

498
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,400
She is

499
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,050
in the basement.

500
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,840
Yumi!
