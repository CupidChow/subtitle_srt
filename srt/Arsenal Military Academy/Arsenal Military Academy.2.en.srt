Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 02

4
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,880
Guards!

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,520
Hang him up on the training ground!

6
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,440
I don't care about your background.

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,520
In this place,

8
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,800
you have only one status.

9
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,920
You're all reservists.

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,840
From now on,

11
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,520
who else dares to

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,850
bring up their families

13
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,009
will be severely punished.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
What are you waiting for?

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,840
You don't want to have dinner?

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,970
Carry your luggage.

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
Run!

18
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,440
Run!

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,030
Liangchen,

20
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,100
I can't carry all of it.

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,920
What were you thinking?

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,200
I'll sue you for abuse!

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm angry now!

25
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm sorry. Put me down.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,120
I know I was wrong.

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,840
I apologize.

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,700
What are you doing?

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,090
Don't touch my wine.

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,560
Please, put me down.

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,760
Take this wine

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,100
and let me down, OK?

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,560
I have more in my car.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,440
It's all yours.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,040
Good wine!

37
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,240
I like it!

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,040
Here are two silver dollars.

39
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,280
Here, take them

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,880
as the money for the wine.

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,920
Take them.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,780
Are you kidding me?

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,200
Did anyone lose two dollars?

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,050
Whose money is this?

45
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,800
I'll take it if no one claims it.

46
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,760
Keep running!

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,840
Speed up!

48
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,540
Tomorrow is the registration day. Are you nervous?

49
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,970
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,840
Your stamina is good

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,050
and you have kung fu skills.

52
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,720
Remember, you're a boy at school.

53
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,240
Don't be too competitive.

54
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,840
Be sure to control yourself.

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
Or others may discover your real identity.

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Relax.

57
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,120
I know what to do.

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,700
I will make my rank stays in the middle

59
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
and keep a low profile.

60
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,960
Run faster!

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Hurry up!

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
Turtles can outrun you!

63
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,260
They just arrived.

64
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,100
Isn't this too harsh for them?

65
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,640
Not even close.

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
For these rich brats,

67
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,360
if I were easy on them, they'd turn the world upside down.

68
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,680
Are you planning

69
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,880
to train them as ordinary new recruits?

70
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,880
It'll be 10 times harsher.

71
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,840
We've recruited them

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,080
to make a difference.

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
Right now, all eyes

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,040
are on us.

75
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,600
They can't wait for us to make mistakes.

76
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
We must be extra careful.

77
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,159
Then what about Mr. Guo?

78
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,820
Ignore him.

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
We can't count on him.

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,530
Just pretend he doesn't exist.

81
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,920
OK.

82
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm dying! Help!

83
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
They're abusing me!

84
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
They're monsters!

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
Alright. You can rest.

86
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,180
What are you doing?

87
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,890
You still have two laps.

88
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,690
Haven't I finished?

89
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,930
Don't try to fool me.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,520
Hurry.

91
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,720
Sir,

92
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,960
please cut me some slack.

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,240
Five laps.

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,120
Ten laps.

95
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,780
Stop, stop!

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,159
I'll continue.

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,280
Hurry!

98
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,520
Speed up!

99
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,860
Liangchen,

100
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,240
come on.

101
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,040
Hang in there!

102
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,040
Last two laps.

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,640
I'm beat.

104
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,640
My lung is on fire.

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,000
Stick your tongue

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,040
to the palate.

107
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,120
Close your mouth and breathe with your nose.

108
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,040
Try it.

109
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,080
I can't.

110
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,200
I really can't.

111
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,120
Almost there.

112
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,440
I can't.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
I can't move anymore.

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,080
You keep on.

115
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,140
What about you?

116
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,020
I'm exhausted.

117
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,850
I can't leave you alone.

118
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,840
If you won't go,

119
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,170
then neither will I.

120
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,880
Let's both skip dinner

121
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,680
and sleep on the training ground.

122
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,880
Who says you're honest?

123
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,120
I...

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,760
I am honest.

125
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,640
You can skip dinner

126
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,680
but I need to eat.

127
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Let's go.

128
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
A single room!

129
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,220
What are you doing?

130
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,770
Why are you here?

131
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,180
What's wrong with you?

132
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,400
Why am I here?

133
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,640
It's my room.

134
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,960
You thought you'd live alone?

135
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,650
Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,080
Why do you have such things?

137
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
You're a pervert!

138
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
Why does it have to be you?

139
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,760
I don't want to live with you.

140
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
You think you're an ideal roommate?

141
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,050
I'm going to ask them for a different room.

142
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,170
Need I open the door for you?

143
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
Everyone,

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
assemble now.

145
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,730
We've met this morning,

146
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,730
so I'll skip the formality.

147
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,760
From now on,

148
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,800
at this Academy,

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,280
your study, training,

150
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,090
tests and examinations

151
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,900
will be under my watch.

152
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm easygoing.

153
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,640
But you must know

154
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,800
I hate troubles.

155
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,740
If you don't cause me any trouble,

156
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
then I'm sure we'll get along very well.

157
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,720
But if someone gets on my nerve,

158
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,560
then don't blame me

159
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
for being harsh on you.

160
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,660
Now, back to business.

161
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,720
Here are a few requirements.

162
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,640
If you follow all of them,

163
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
then I'm sure

164
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
your two years

165
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,130
of study here will be pleasant.

166
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,960
First,

167
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,330
follow all dormitory rules and regulations.

168
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,080
Get up at 6 a.m.

169
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,680
Finish tidying your room before 6:10.

170
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,360
Dress yourself neatly before 6:20.

171
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,960
Breakfast begins at 6:30.

172
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,320
No breakfast after 6:35.

173
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,920
Run 20 laps if you're 10 minutes late.

174
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,080
If you're 15 minutes late,

175
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
a "bath" will be waiting for you.

176
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
Sir.

177
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,440
Yes.

178
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
What's a "bath"?

179
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
Try sleep late tomorrow.

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,210
When you're 15 minutes late, you'll find out.

181
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,920
Second,

182
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,620
The light will be off and the door will be locked after 9 p.m.

183
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Whoever comes back late will be beaten 30 times.

184
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,320
Those who stay out the whole night

185
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
will be expelled.

186
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,600
In the dorm,

187
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,680
no smoking, no drinking,

188
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,200
and no gambling.

189
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,440
If I catch you smoking opium,

190
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,290
you'll be executed.

191
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,160
No one is able to save you.

192
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't think this is a bluff.

193
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,080
Besides,

194
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,920
fighting isn't prohibited.

195
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,560
But if you break something in the dorm,

196
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,760
watch your ass.

197
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,800
Also,

198
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,700
except for vacations,

199
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,690
nobody is allowed to go out.

200
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,300
File a report if you need to leave,

201
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,440
but it may not be approved.

202
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,440
I can't think of anything else for now.

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,920
Once someone breaks the rules,

204
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,040
I'll let you know.

205
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,560
Here's a warning.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,800
Remember every word I just said.

207
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,360
Don't think I was joking.

208
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,840
Arsenal Military Academy

209
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,900
isn't a place you can goof around.

210
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,960
Now,

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,200
I'll search your personal belongings.

212
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,080
I hope you didn't bring any contraband.

213
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
This is our first day.

214
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,100
I'm trying to leave a good impression on you.

215
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560
Search.

216
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,560
This also counts, got it?

217
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,960
Such an old model.

218
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Can it still work?

219
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,620
Can it kill anyone?

220
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,050
It can't even hit a chicken.

221
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,420
Put it away.

222
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,170
Don't embarrass yourself.

223
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,280
Even the chefs here

224
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,640
are using Mausers now.

225
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
Pick up that sock.

226
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,720
Pick it up.

227
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Open it.

228
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,640
Pour them out.

229
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
The candies are good.

230
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,740
Won't they get smelly in the sock?

231
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,220
The...the sock is clean, sir.

232
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
Is this yours?

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,970
I'm asking you if this is yours.

234
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,480
What is it?

235
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,320
I...

236
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,920
I...

237
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,760
Sir.

238
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
The suitcase is misplaced.

239
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,800
It's mine.

240
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,760
What are you looking at?

241
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,220
Can't people have a hobby?

242
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,200
Your hobby is unique.

243
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,490
My girlfriend gave it to me.

244
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,050
She said once I was here,

245
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,260
we could no longer see each other.

246
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,170
So she gave it to me as a memento.

247
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,080
Sir,

248
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,290
having a girlfriend isn't against the rules, right?

249
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
Those who failed the search,

250
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,480
step forward.

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
Beat those three five times.

252
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,500
Run 30 laps.

253
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,280
Why are you only punishing us?

254
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,120
Ten times!

255
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,920
Sir,

256
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,160
I didn't do anything!

257
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
I didn't even say a word!

258
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,040
Twenty times!

259
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,260
What about Gu Yanzhen?

260
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,700
Take them away.

261
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,840
So strict.

262
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
Thank you for that.

263
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,240
What did you say?

264
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,349
I didn't hear you.

265
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,120
I said

266
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,440
thank you.

267
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,690
You're welcome.

268
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,720
We're roommates.

269
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,050
We're supposed to help each other.

270
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,660
Help me wash my clothes

271
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,280
and bring me some tea.

272
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,560
Polish my shoes, too.

273
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,080
Also...

274
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,680
Excuse me?

275
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,080
We're roommates.

276
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,930
We're supposed to help each other.

277
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,410
Don't worry.

278
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,000
I won't judge your sick hobby.

279
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,480
So comfortable!

280
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,040
Huang Song, Huang Song!

281
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,000
Junshan, Junshan!

282
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,360
Junshan!

283
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,600
Help us open the door.

284
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,600
Junshan.

285
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,640
This isn't fun, Junshan.

286
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,560
Shen Junshan, what are you doing?

287
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,120
Junshan!

288
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,160
Thanks.

289
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,800
Enjoy yourself.

290
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Wine, please.

291
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,860
Coming.

292
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,560
Here's your wine.

293
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,720
Let's call it a day for now.

294
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,280
We can continue next time.

295
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,960
Enjoy.

296
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,490
Fine, that's all for today.

297
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
See you next time.

298
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,320
OK.

299
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,360
Is it for Mr. Guo?

300
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,760
Yes.

301
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,200
Thanks.

302
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,130
You're welcome.

303
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,760
Mr. Guo, your drink.

304
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,120
Where's your boss?

305
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,520
Oh, she's out

306
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,320
for business.

307
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,320
It's late at night.

308
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,920
What business does she have?

309
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,480
If the business is bad,

310
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,880
how can we pay your rent?

311
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,560
Please enjoy.

312
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
Who asked you to pay?

313
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,440
Ms. Huo, you're back.

314
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,640
Xiaoyu, care to join me?

315
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,320
Xiaoyu, good evening.

316
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,560
Ms. Huo.

317
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,480
Xiaoyu, you look amazing.

318
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,600
Ms. Huo.

319
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,080
Mr. Guo is

320
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
at his usual spot.

321
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,600
When did he come?

322
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,570
A moment ago.

323
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,000
And already drunk like this?

324
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Liu,

325
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
pour me another.

326
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,520
Liu!

327
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,760
You need water.

328
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,080
You're back.

329
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,720
How come I smell

330
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,360
blood on you?

331
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,960
You can smell blood on everyone.

332
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,440
How long have you been back?

333
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,500
How's your family?

334
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,160
Now the Germans and the Japanese are at war.

335
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,920
What do you think?

336
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,960
Glad you're back. Come.

337
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,040
Refill my glass.

338
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,740
I won't sell you more wine.

339
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,160
You own a bar.

340
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,020
What can you sell other than wine?

341
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
I can sell myself.

342
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,360
Do you want it?

343
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,040
I can't afford it.

344
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,560
I heard

345
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,000
Arsenal Military Academy's reopened.

346
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So what?

347
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,840
None of my business.

348
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,640
You're the Deputy Director

349
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,040
and the Instructor of Tactics.

350
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,840
How come it's not your business?

351
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Ms. Huo.

352
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,280
Let him take a nap.

353
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,460
Take him upstairs after he sobers up.

354
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,720
Ask the chef to cook some porridge and side dishes.

355
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,920
He'll eat them later.

356
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,320
OK.

357
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,840
Liangchen, are you up?

358
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,850
Coming, coming.

359
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,940
Liangchen.

360
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,040
Coming. Stop rushing me.

361
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,540
Liangchen,

362
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,290
this place is magnificent.

363
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,040
Is this a palace?

364
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Boor!

365
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,120
- Hey, what did you say? - What are you doing?

366
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,920
You can't cut in line!

367
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,320
Let it go.

368
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,080
Never mind, Liangchen.

369
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,760
It's OK.

370
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,920
So what?

371
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,120
Liangchen, have an egg.

372
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,320
Thanks.

373
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,120
Good morning.

374
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,240
Good morning.

375
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,760
Morning.

376
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,080
Hello.

377
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,520
I'm Huang Song.

378
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
I know you.

379
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,240
The Giant.

380
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,280
I'm Ji Jin.

381
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,720
He's Shen Junshan.

382
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,840
Hello.

383
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,720
I'm...

384
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,620
Huang Song.

385
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,320
Ignore him.

386
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,580
He's always like that.

387
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,600
Shorty,

388
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
what's your name?

389
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,780
You called me what?

390
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,240
So feisty.

391
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,760
I was joking.

392
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
What's your name?

393
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,300
I'm Xie Liangchen.

394
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,720
Xie Liangchen?

395
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,600
Quite a nice name.

396
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,680
Well, where are you from?

397
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,740
I'm from Shandong.

398
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,730
I'm from Peking.

399
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,000
Peking?

400
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,720
Then why did you come here?

401
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,640
I'm a local.

402
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,480
Since we've known each other,

403
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
give me a shout if you need me.

404
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,920
Have you read the newspaper?

405
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,530
Germany and Japan are at war

406
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,280
in Shandong

407
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,640
as we speak.

408
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,600
There are biting remarks

409
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,880
all over the paper.

410
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
But towards whom?

411
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,320
The Germans?

412
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,360
The Japanese?

413
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,200
None of them!

414
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,850
They're criticizing our army,

415
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,520
our soldiers,

416
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,080
including me,

417
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,210
as well as all of you.

418
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,040
Today is Shandong.

419
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,890
Tomorrow, it might be Feng'an.

420
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,400
When the sky of Shunyuan

421
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,260
is filled with enemies' bombers,

422
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,200
and all streets are packed with

423
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,530
their cannon and tanks,

424
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,620
who do you think will help you?

425
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,770
The Peking government,

426
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,120
or the Revolutionary Army in the south?

427
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,680
When all your parents

428
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,120
and relatives

429
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,600
suffer from the war,

430
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,920
when your wives and sisters

431
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,580
are abused by the enemies,

432
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,570
who will help you save them?

433
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,050
No one else can help you.

434
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,410
You can only count on yourself.

435
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,040
All the condemns

436
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,490
and protests

437
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
won't do a damn thing.

438
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,480
In the end,

439
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,840
it's you and your gun

440
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,970
that can save lives.

441
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,400
You're the 7th batch of recruits

442
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,060
of Arsenal Military Academy.

443
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,140
Frankly speaking,

444
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,640
you're the worst soldiers

445
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
I've ever seen.

446
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
But you're also the bravest.

447
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,440
Most of your families are well off.

448
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,800
You're educated.

449
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,660
Some even studied abroad.

450
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,020
At a time like this,

451
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,240
many people have fled to the south

452
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,760
or even

453
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,090
gone abroad to seek refuge,

454
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,720
yet you've chosen to enlist in the army.

455
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,940
That proves you're all brave.

456
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,200
So

457
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,240
as a reward for your bravery,

458
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,720
I assure you that the toughest training

459
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,920
is waiting for you.

460
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,580
You'll all become the best of the best

461
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,080
on the battlefield

462
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,220
to protect our nation,

463
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,900
to protect our people.

464
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,840
Can you do it?

465
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,680
Yes!

466
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,880
Louder!

467
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,760
Yes!

468
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,060
What's wrong with you?

469
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,400
Sorry, sir.

470
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,600
I ate too many eggs.

471
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,480
I apologize.

472
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,760
Stop laughing.

473
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,960
Cut the crap. Hurry.

474
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,680
Director Lv.

475
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,240
Don't push me.

476
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,970
He's been sleeping in the room.

477
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,890
Didn't you hear what I said last night?

478
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,680
Sir,

479
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,440
you said so many things.

480
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,100
How could I remember all of it?

481
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,400
You have a bad memory, don't you?

482
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Sir,

483
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,720
I didn't mean to sleep late.

484
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,080
I...I didn't hear

485
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,410
the alarm this morning.

486
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,600
Also,

487
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,240
well,

488
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,090
yeah,

489
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,600
it's his fault.

490
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,760
Yesterday,

491
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,200
I told him to wake me up,

492
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,880
but he didn't.

493
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,760
So I was late.

494
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,460
He should take the blame, too.

495
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,040
Well, how about you let me go this time?

496
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,640
Next time,

497
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,340
I won't do it again.

498
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,160
You!

499
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,040
If he can't get up on time tomorrow,

500
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,640
both of you will be punished.

501
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,920
Objections?

502
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,840
No.

503
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,639
Louder!

504
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,120
No!

505
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,290
At this Academy,

506
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,420
there's no compromise

507
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,920
and no favors.

508
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,080
I want you

509
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,610
to engrave this in your mind

510
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,520
that all you need to do is

511
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,699
following orders.

512
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,400
Am I clear?

513
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,320
Yes.

514
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,320
Yes, sir.

515
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,790
Stop.

516
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,810
Take the "bath"!

517
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,880
That way.

518
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,750
Sir...

519
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,860
Take him there!

520
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,120
Go.

521
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,960
Sir, what about him?

522
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,750
Where are you taking me to?

523
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,360
Will it be comfortable?

524
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,159
Attention!

525
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,790
Yes.

526
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,639
Turn right.

527
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,840
You've...you've also tried it?

528
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,120
March!

530
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,780
We all have.

531
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
So great!

532
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,080
Of course.

533
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,660
Liangchen.

534
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,600
Liangchen.

535
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,720
Are you OK?

536
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm fine. Let's go.

537
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,690
Let's go.

538
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,520
Hurry up.

539
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Quickly. Hurry.

540
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,320
Faster!

541
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Speed up!

542
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
You're soldiers,

543
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,090
not a bunch of girls.

544
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,960
Faster, shorty.

545
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
Liangchen, hang in there!

546
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,200
Liangchen, you can do it!

547
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,640
Speed up. Shut up.

548
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,100
Hang in there, Liangchen!

549
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,970
He's about to collapse.

550
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,880
A rich brat like him

551
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,940
can't do anything.

552
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,600
He'll drop out tomorrow.

553
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,840
Bah!

554
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,920
Loser!

555
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,000
Liangchen,

556
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,400
are you still good?

557
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,440
Let me carry it.

558
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,440
I'm fine.

559
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
I can do it.

560
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,360
Come on.

561
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,280
Hang in there!

562
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,040
Almost there.

563
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,240
Hang in there!

564
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,080
Loser!

565
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
A good-for-nothing!

566
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,560
If you always have to rely on others,

567
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,840
you'd better pack your stuff and go home now!

568
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,240
Otherwise, you'll get others killed

569
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,480
on the battlefield someday.

570
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,720
Sergeant Song, he...

571
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,240
Shut up!

572
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,760
Did I ask you to speak?

573
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,220
Did I give you permission?

574
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,320
If you help him now,

575
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
when he's sent to the battlefield,

576
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,980
he'll die for sure.

577
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
You're soldiers.

578
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
Soldiers never quit.

579
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,520
Keep going.

580
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,880
Hurry!

581
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,960
Liangchen, come on.

582
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,920
Liangchen, you can do it!

583
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,040
Hang in there!

584
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,280
Go on.

585
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,880
Keep going.

586
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,080
Beauty,

587
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,400
where do you think you can go?

588
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,480
Brother.

589
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,640
Hit him! Do it!

590
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,280
Let go!

591
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,160
Go away.

592
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,800
Let me go.

593
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,320
Xiang, run!

594
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,320
Don't hit my brother!

595
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,240
Brother!

596
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,040
-Xiang. -Brother.

597
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,640
Run!

598
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,920
Go!

599
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,440
Xiang, run!

600
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,520
Don't stop!

601
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,520
Faster!

602
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,600
Your speech is inspirational.

603
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,440
I'm greatly encouraged.

604
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,480
Really?

605
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,720
What a pity!

606
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,800
Looks like I'm old.

607
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,320
I can no longer feel that.

608
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,120
You enlightened them,

609
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,060
but you didn't feel anything?

610
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,380
Young people are always passionate.

611
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
With passion,

612
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,080
they still have hope.

613
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,000
I guess that kid is about to faint.

614
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,320
That brat can't hold any longer.

615
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,160
He's suffered a lot this time.

616
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
He sure has.

617
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,960
Stop!

618
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,360
Come!

619
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,140
Come here! Come on!

620
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,720
Come!

621
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,560
I'll kill you!

622
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,660
Don't let him get away.

623
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,060
Hurry up, you guys.

624
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,920
Catch him!

625
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,680
Stop!

626
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,960
Stop there!

627
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,400
Don't move!

628
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,120
I'll stop.

629
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,240
Stop there!

630
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,480
Let's make deal!

631
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,160
I mean it.

632
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,140
I'll go back to the water dungeon.

633
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,250
Beat him!

634
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,440
Little punk. Now you have a lesson.

635
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,600
I said I'd stop.

636
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,330
Don't you have any principles?

637
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,490
How come you're back alone?

638
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,490
Where is Liangchen?

639
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,360
Liangchen and I fell behind.

640
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,960
He didn't want me to be punished

641
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,360
so he asked me to come back first.

642
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,560
He forced me to leave.

643
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,160
So stubborn.

644
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,400
Right.

645
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,520
He's a grown man.

646
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,360
A wuss wouldn't

647
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,160
join the army.

648
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,920
Assemble!

649
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,680
That's all for today's training.

650
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,120
Have your meal in canteen now.

651
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,880
Dismiss!

652
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,320
Sir!

653
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,120
Sergeant Song!

654
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Follow the order!

655
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,960
Dismiss!
