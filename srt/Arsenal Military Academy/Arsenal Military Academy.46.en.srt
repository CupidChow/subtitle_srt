00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,020
Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,260
Episode 46

4
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,000
Xiang,

5
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,600
come here.

6
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,120
Sergeant Guo brought it for you.

7
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,720
What is it?

8
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,720
Take some.

9
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
Is she so bad at cooking?

10
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,560
Very bad.

11
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,620
Don't you think so?

12
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,840
I don't think so.

13
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,620
Maybe it's because you're a soldier.

14
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,160
Eat it.

15
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,920
I'll watch.

16
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,840
Sergeant,

17
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,840
is it still a time of tension?

18
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,880
Yeah.

19
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,040
All the main roads

20
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,840
are blocked.

21
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,490
It's extremely hard

22
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,760
to get out of the city.

23
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,020
We have to wait.

24
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,420
Deputy Commander Song

25
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
is such a despicable person.

26
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,530
Now everything is playing to his plan.

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,560
And you threaten him now.

28
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,020
Do you think he will buy it?

29
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,860
This is the Catholic Hospital's report.

30
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
It proves that

31
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,240
the Commander died of taking medicine wrong

32
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,080
which led to heart failure.

33
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,250
It has nothing to do with Xie Xiang.

34
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,440
Why should I believe you?

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,760
You may doubt it.

36
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
But it's OK.

37
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,480
The Commander's body is the evidence.

38
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,279
I can contact his family anytime

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,899
for another examination.

40
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,190
What do you want?

41
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Xie Xiang's life.

42
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,540
That Song Xicheng.

43
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,640
Now

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,040
he's the order itself

45
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,880
in Shunyuan.

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,120
If we go to him directly,

47
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,770
we won't stand a chance.

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,960
So you two stay here.

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,480
When the situation eases down,

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,010
I'll get you out of the city.

51
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,640
Besides,

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
your pals in the Academy

53
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,170
planned to appeal to

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
the Commander's mansion

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
for you.

56
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,409
I convinced them not to.

57
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
I can only stay here for a while.

58
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,010
I have to go back.

59
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,000
Otherwise,

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm afraid that

61
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
I feel guilty about

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,480
keeping it back from them.

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
We have no choice.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,040
The more people know,

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,570
the more dangerous for you.

66
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,680
But I think Shen Junshan doesn't buy it.

67
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,520
He followed me today.

68
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,400
I think Shen Junshan is a decent man.

69
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,360
Shall we

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
tell him about it?

71
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,290
No. Absolutely not.

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,360
But if...

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
We'd better keep it from all of them.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,560
Or...

75
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,080
The less people know about it,

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,320
the safer we are,

77
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,360
right?

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,490
Oh, yeah.

79
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,320
Where's Li Wenzhong?

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,250
Did you find him?

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah.

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,120
He's dead.

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,440
What?

84
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,440
How?

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,320
I don't know

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,200
why he didn't leave Shunyuan

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
with his parents.

88
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,640
He encountered the Japanese

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,460
on his way back to the Academy.

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,140
He was outnumbered

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
and killed.

92
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,220
Li Wenzhong is a true man.

93
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
He didn't humiliate the Academy

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
till the last minute.

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,200
Yeah.

96
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,390
He is a true soldier.

97
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,160
An Wen,

98
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,130
are you going to your parents' tomb again?

99
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
What's wrong with me?

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
Do we know each other?

101
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,760
His father is Gu Zongtang,

103
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
an important minister

104
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,440
in the Peking government.

105
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Gu Yanzhen has good ratings in the Academy.

106
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,280
He shares

107
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
a dorm with Xie Liangchen.

108
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,240
They're very close.

109
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,300
I have sent men to block the main roads

110
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,360
and have arranged search in the city.

111
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,020
For now we don't have any lead.

112
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Your opinion?

113
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,000
We have searched the hospital thoroughly.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,640
Gu Yanzhen couldn't have

115
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,610
stolen the body by himself.

116
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,190
I guess he's got companies.

117
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
You mean

118
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,800
it has something

119
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,280
to do with the Arsenal Military Academy.

120
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,410
We can't rule it out.

121
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Both Lv Zhongxin and Guo Shuting

122
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,240
used to be the late Commander's right hand men.

123
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
They are loyal to him.

124
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Loyal to him?

125
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,400
Mr. Shen.

126
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,330
Is it difficult?

127
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,480
In the meeting today,

128
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,860
the military authority requested to

129
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,620
increase military expense to wipe out bandits.

130
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,520
The government finance never makes ends meet.

131
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,180
Mayor Bai doesn't have money.

132
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
So he increased taxes

133
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,370
on business associations and companies.

134
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,400
According to reliable sources,

135
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,290
Song Xicheng is likely to skip the government

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,930
and to allocate military expenses

137
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,840
to each entity.

138
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
He doesn't have the assignment yet.

139
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,060
So he's not the commander.

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
He will be one day.

141
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,920
Maybe Shunyuan will be put

142
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,440
under military control.

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
When it becomes true,

144
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,850
he will be the emperor of Shunyuan.

145
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
It's killing the hen to get eggs.

146
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Will Mayor Bai agree?

147
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,000
Several government leaders who disagreed

148
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,660
died miraculously one by one.

149
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,810
Mayor Bai is probably freaked out.

150
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,640
President Liu of the bank is secretly

151
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,500
transferring their properties.

152
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,700
Everyone is preparing for both situations.

153
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,770
The others can run away,

154
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,280
but we cannot.

155
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,600
I'll die

156
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,560
protecting the 3 parcels of land

157
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,080
from the Japanese.

158
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,640
Tingbai.

159
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,840
I'm tired.

160
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,490
I'll go upstairs and take a nap.

161
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,960
Don't wait for me for dinner.

162
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,960
Mr. Shen.

163
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,400
How is it going?

164
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,480
We found the criminal's body

165
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,080
at the suburb west of the city.

166
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
It's a man's body.

167
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,080
When can I get the lands?

168
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,170
You'll have to wait.

169
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm collecting the military expenses.

170
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,200
Shen Tingbai,

171
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,920
as the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

172
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,280
is useful to me.

173
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,960
So you can't hurt him for now.

174
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
It's your business

175
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,940
how to deal with Shen Tingbai.

176
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,980
But I need the lands immediately.

177
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,280
Miss Oda...

178
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,960
Remember.

179
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,420
I can help you get the position

180
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,520
and I can get anyone else.

181
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,080
Besides,

182
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,240
you're not the commander yet.

183
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,900
Deputy Commander,

184
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,240
I like working with you.

185
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,520
I hope our further cooperation goes well.

186
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,680
It's late.

187
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
Deputy Commander,

188
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,300
you must have a lot of things to do.

189
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,520
I shall take no more of your time.

190
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,120
When we meet again,

191
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,930
I hope I can hear good news from you.

192
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,500
Can we finish her for good?

193
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,120
Not easy.

194
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,520
According to my investigation,

195
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,850
this woman is cautious.

196
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,500
There are lots of guards protecting her.

197
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,760
Unless using force,

198
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,290
we can hardly take her down.

199
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,700
Now we can't use force.

200
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,040
I want to take Shunyuan under control.

201
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
Now is not the right time.

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,240
We can't turn against the Japanese now.

203
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,520
Think about something else.

204
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,610
She seems to care much about the lands.

205
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,640
Can we...

206
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,600
No.

207
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,840
I want the land, too.

208
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,520
I don't believe we can't manage her.

209
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,360
Besides,

210
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,000
how is it going with the Academy?

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
It's quiet recently.

212
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
Lv Zhongxin is quite cooperative.

213
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Nothing unusual.

214
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,480
Is he?

215
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,440
Dad, I'm back.

216
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,370
I don't know you will come back.

217
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,560
You never take here as your home.

218
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,040
Dad, can you please

219
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,000
don't fight with me

220
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
each time I come back home?

221
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
I'm really tired.

222
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,860
I haven't slept well for days.

223
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
I'll go up to my room.

224
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,280
Don't wait for me for dinner.

225
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,880
Stop.

226
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,170
I haven't finished yet.

227
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,880
Can we talk about it

228
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,320
when I get up later?

229
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,080
I have work to do at night.

230
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,280
I'd say you should quit

231
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,340
that indecent job.

232
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,589
A lady shouldn't go out

233
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,760
with men every night

234
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,960
living on her smiles.

235
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,770
Our family's reputation is ruined by you.

236
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,589
I live on my songs and my performances.

237
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,400
Each penny I made is clean.

238
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,109
I didn't humiliate anyone.

239
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,040
Don't talk back.

240
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,920
Dad,

241
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,720
can you please understand me?

242
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,920
I'm so tired.

243
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,760
OK.

244
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,520
If you're tired,

245
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,840
OK then.

246
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,280
But listen to me.

247
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,080
You don't have to go out anymore.

248
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,040
Quit that job.

249
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,680
Don't make our family a laughing stock.

250
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,280
Besides,

251
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
I have made you another engagement.

252
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,100
You just stay at home

253
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,630
and wait for being married.

254
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
Dad, how many times have I told you?

255
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,720
Shen Tingbai and I

256
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,880
are impossible to get married.

257
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,640
It's not him.

258
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,080
Not him?

259
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,080
The Shen Family is a big fish now.

260
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,940
I won't force you to marry him.

261
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
It's a troubled time now.

262
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,020
So is it to do business.

263
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,360
On the outside,

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
Shen Tingbai seems rich and powerful.

265
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
But who knows the hardship beneath?

266
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,240
This time, the man I want you to marry

267
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,440
is from a scholarly family.

268
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,570
His surname is Zhao.

269
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,960
When you're married,

270
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,760
no matter how the situation will go,

271
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,280
your life won't be affected.

272
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,410
Dad, don't you think it's ridiculous?

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,480
You want me to marry a man

274
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,520
I don't even know.

275
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
I can support myself.

276
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,480
You have to marry him.

277
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,630
I've accepted their gifts,

278
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,040
and given out invitations.

279
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,400
It's you who accepted the gifts

280
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
and gave out invitations.

281
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,200
If someone has to marry,

282
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,100
it should be you.

283
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,840
I will not.

284
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,040
I make my own calls.

285
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,270
Insolent child!

286
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,240
All right. All right.

287
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,560
She seldom comes back.

288
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
Don't fight with her.

289
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Manting can't accept it for now.

290
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,020
But it doesn't matter.

291
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
Give her more time

292
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,480
to think about it.

293
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,900
She's our daughter after all.

294
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,360
Whose daughter is she?

295
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,100
Has she ever taken herself as your daughter?

296
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
I've been a decent man for my whole life.

297
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
I could never give birth to a girl like her.

298
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,280
It's all because of

299
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,560
your lascivious sister.

300
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,520
Enough. Stop it.

301
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,680
What did you say?

302
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,460
No more questions.

303
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,240
I...

304
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,600
I'm not your daughter?

305
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,800
My aunt is my mom, right?

306
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,160
Manting!

307
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,320
Manting!

308
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,250
It's late. Where are you going?

309
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,250
Dinner time.

310
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,360
Shuting.

311
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
It's dinner time.

312
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,040
Is it a special day?

313
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,020
So many dishes.

314
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,760
Sit down.

315
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,960
Time for dinner.

316
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,360
Xiaoyu cooked all these.

317
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,920
Yeah.

318
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,320
I have been working on it for the afternoon.

319
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
Xiaoyu, you look

320
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,220
a bit different today.

321
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,920
How so?

322
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,090
You look beautiful.

323
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,680
Sweet tongue!

324
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,720
You two...what

325
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,240
is going on?

326
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,840
Nothing.

327
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,370
Eat your dinner.

328
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
Don't ask questions.

329
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,600
No. Tell me.

330
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Or, I don't know if I can eat or not.

331
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,360
Today,

332
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,330
Shuting and I are getting married.

333
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,280
I...I'm not prepared.

334
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Prepared for what? It's my wedding.

335
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,120
We have to book a big hotel

336
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
and make it a big event.

337
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,600
I'm OK with this.

338
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,640
Besides,

339
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,160
at such a situation,

340
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,220
it's not suitable.

341
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,720
Maybe later.

342
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,920
Or maybe

343
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,320
we can go to another city.

344
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,930
I can't wait any longer.

345
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,040
I don't want to wait any more.

346
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,760
You brat.

347
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,820
Xiaoyu cooked all these for tonight.

348
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,450
Why don't you shut up

349
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,400
and have dinner?

350
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,800
OK.

351
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,480
OK, yeah.

352
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
When you and Xie Xiang

353
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,680
get married,

354
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,320
you have to throw

355
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,440
a big party.

356
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,720
OK.

357
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,880
I never said I would marry him.

358
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,600
See that?

359
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,280
You have to try harder.

360
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,200
Yes.

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,340
I'll try harder.

362
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,000
OK?

363
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,320
Stop it.

364
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,660
It's late. Who is this?

365
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,480
Better be careful.

366
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,320
You stay here.

367
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,380
I'll go have a look.

368
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,120
OK.

369
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,210
What are you doing here?

370
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,200
What's up?

371
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,060
Did someone bully you?

372
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,820
What's wrong with her?

373
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I want to talk.

374
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,880
OK.

375
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,260
Let's talk inside.

376
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,240
We can talk right here.

377
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,170
We can't make it clear here.

378
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,470
I want to get inside.

379
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,640
Who can imagine

380
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,930
that you're a woman?

381
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm sorry

382
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,050
for lying to you for so long.

383
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,740
I've got a boyfriend, too.

384
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,680
Looks like

385
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,560
I was right

386
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,600
to make so many dishes.

387
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,520
We have guests.

388
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,520
Shuting.

389
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,000
All right.

390
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,700
Let's have a drink.

391
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,720
It's cold

392
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,740
outside there.

393
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,630
A little drink warms you up.

394
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,840
What a day!

395
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,220
I'll go have a look.

396
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,200
Sergeant Guo.

397
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Come on in.

398
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,200
All right.

399
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
Don't just sit there.

400
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Help yourselves.

401
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,840
I wanted to save you.

402
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,520
But I didn't know that...

403
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,120
Thank you.

404
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,170
Junshan might not be some help.

405
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,520
But on the day when you were arrested,

406
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,840
he didn't sleep.

407
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,700
He used all his connections.

408
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,160
All right.

409
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,980
No more explanations.

410
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,760
Xie Xiang

411
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,700
escaped successfully

412
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,920
from death sentence.

413
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,640
We can gather here today.

414
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,080
As your sergeant,

415
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,880
I'm happy to have you as

416
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,720
my students.

417
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,080
One more thing.

418
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,280
An important thing is

419
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,570
that today is

420
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,200
my wedding with Xiaoyu.

421
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,680
I suggest that we raise our glasses.

422
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,240
Here.

423
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,200
Drink to us.

424
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,720
Here.

425
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,340
Have a drink.

426
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,840
OK.

427
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,920
Come on.

428
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,880
Auntie Yu.

429
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,900
We're leaving.

430
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
Leaving?

431
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,960
I've waited for him for decades.

432
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,270
He's always busy

433
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,140
and has no time to rest.

434
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,800
Now,

435
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,040
we want to live a different life,

436
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
to travel around.

437
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
It would be nice.

438
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,410
You're leaving?

439
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,440
Take care.

440
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,760
Take care.

441
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,050
You're leaving?

442
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,600
You...

443
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,520
You married her?

444
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,400
Yeah.

445
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,580
Do you love her?

446
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
What do you think?

447
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,600
Xiaoyu is beautiful and elegant.

448
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,400
Besides, she's a capable woman.

449
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,520
She waits for you for so many years.

450
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,680
You should love her.

451
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,360
Yeah.

452
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,680
Travel around

453
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,410
when you can.

454
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,860
Live a different life.

455
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,560
When you stepped in,

456
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,800
you said

457
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,560
you wanted to talk.

458
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,640
You can talk now.

459
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,360
What is it?

460
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm leaving.

461
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,480
For where?

462
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Back to Shanghai.

463
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,220
Don't you want to say something to me?

464
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,360
What can I say?

465
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,240
You...

466
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,160
You should say something at least.

467
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,280
You'll come back one day.

468
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,200
We can still meet, right?

469
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,760
Are you OK?

470
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,000
What's wrong?

471
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,800
Nothing.

472
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,480
Really.

473
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,280
When do you

474
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,000
plan to leave?

475
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,600
I'll see you off.

476
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,280
It's OK.

477
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,120
I think

478
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,480
Shen Tingbai

479
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,370
is a nice man.

480
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,960
Since you said that.

481
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,400
OK.

482
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,040
I'll give him a chance.

483
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
See if we have a thing.

484
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,520
Guo,

485
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,120
don't drink too much.

486
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,920
It's bad for your health.

487
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,980
Now you're married to Xiaoyu.

488
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,340
You should cherish the time with her.

489
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,600
I know.

490
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,940
You're not young anymore.

491
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,840
So be good to yourself.

492
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,600
What is that?

493
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,320
It sounds bitter and harsh.

494
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
All right.

495
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,060
Go back now.

496
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,520
Shen Tingbai

497
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
has been standing there for a while.

498
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,090
He might be worried.

499
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,920
Go.

500
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,800
A hug with me, Guo?

501
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,720
Be good.

502
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,920
What's wrong?

503
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,080
Is everything all right?

504
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,920
Yeah.

505
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,610
See you, Guo.

506
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,300
Did you ask him?

507
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,280
No.

508
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,480
Why not?

509
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,320
It must be a sad story.

510
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,200
So why bother asking?

511
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,400
Sometimes,

512
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,680
things are buried

513
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,240
for a reason.

514
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,880
If you dig them up,

515
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
no one would be happy.

516
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,880
How about you?

517
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,010
Aren't you curious?

518
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,400
Yes, I am.

519
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,600
But what's the point?

520
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,120
Forget it.

521
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,179
No more inquiring.

522
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,230
Winter is coming.

523
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,960
Shunyuan is too damn cold.

524
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,520
I want to go back to Shanghai.

525
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,720
Um...

526
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,860
what about Gu Yanzhen?

527
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,120
Maybe in the next life.

528
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,960
What's so funny?

529
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,600
Does that mean

530
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,000
in this life

531
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
I still have a chance?

532
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,480
Was that Guo in the car?

533
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,760
It was him.

534
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,960
He looks brilliant

535
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,020
when he shaves his moustache.

536
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,380
There must be a reason.

537
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,480
Is he in love?

538
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,600
Sergeant!

539
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,440
Sergeant Guo.

540
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,400
Guo.

541
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,080
What's up?

542
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,800
You...

543
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,680
What happened to you?

544
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,400
What?

545
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,920
Quit looking at me like that.

546
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,800
What is it?

547
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,460
What's happening?

548
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,160
Didn't I say it clear?

549
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm an old man

550
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,120
with bad physical conditions.

551
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,360
Don't give me this nonsense.

552
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,690
I want to know the truth.

553
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm married.

554
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,240
To Huo Xiaoyu?

555
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,840
Yeah.

556
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,180
Congratulations!

557
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,000
Even if you're married,

558
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,460
there is no need to resign.

559
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
You know well

560
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,440
who she is.

561
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
Besides,

562
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,860
we can't stay in

563
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,580
Shunyuan City any longer.

564
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,060
Can't you wait for a while?

565
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
The students are about to graduate.

566
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,300
We have the final test today.

567
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,600
I know.

568
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,760
It's just for formality.

569
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,290
I've taught them all I know.

570
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,580
I think you can't leave today.

571
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,040
Why is that?

572
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,970
Combat meeting.

573
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,220
We're closed off.

574
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,040
Since when?

575
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,920
Since now.

576
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,600
It's likely to be a mission for graduation.

577
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,660
After the mission,

578
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,160
we can get our commission

579
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,400
and be assigned to the army.

580
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,260
I asked around.

581
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,840
It is just for formality.

582
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,360
It's whether combating bandits

583
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,760
or delivering supplies.

584
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,640
Anyway, we're just a sidekick for combat units.

585
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,280
It's all the same.

586
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Don't be nervous.

587
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,480
I'm not.

588
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,080
I just think

589
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,650
the rings are whammies,

590
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,840
making it a funeral or something

591
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,360
Hey,

592
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,280
it's a pity that Gu Yanzhen can't come.

593
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,600
After two years of training,

594
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,000
he can't come for the graduation ceremony.

595
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,740
If Liangchen were here...

596
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,650
What are you talking about?

597
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,960
I think

598
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,490
I heard the bell ringing from the Academy.

599
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
My brother always wanted to get in the Academy.

600
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,040
I came here

601
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,560
to realize his dream.

602
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,880
But now...

603
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,080
It's not your brother's dream

604
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,610
that you get in the Academy.

605
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,200
If you want to fulfill his dream,

606
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,010
you'll have plenty of opportunities.

607
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,560
You're right.

608
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,250
In fact, I just think

609
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,520
it's a pity to have to

610
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
leave like that.

611
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,130
When that thing fades away,

612
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,260
if you still want to come back,

613
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,580
I'll be there with you.

614
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,640
All prepared.

615
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,420
We leave tomorrow.

616
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,160
Tomorrow.

617
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,260
The Double-wolf Stronghold has 4 exits.

618
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,840
This time we plan to

619
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,090
take this exit down.

620
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,800
Our mission is

621
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,320
to hold them there and upset their plan.

622
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,480
When the main force takes action,

623
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,680
we make our move, too.

624
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,420
This action will be under my command.

625
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
The rest stay behind.

626
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,480
Just you?

627
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,680
What about Director Guo?

628
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,440
That old bachelor has got his love now.

629
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,920
He's not with us from now on.

630
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,250
He handed in his notice.

631
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,400
Really?

632
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,220
You resigned?

633
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,440
Congratulations! Shuting.

634
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,700
Well done, man.

635
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,040
Hos before bros.

636
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,320
Any questions?

637
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,240
No.

638
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,480
Then you're dismissed.

639
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,960
We set off in 10 minutes.

640
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,760
OK.

641
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,730
This is Lv Zhongxin.

642
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,600
Now?

643
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,000
OK.

644
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,400
OK, I get it.

645
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,920
I'm coming.

646
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,220
Morning, Sergeant Lv.

647
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,600
Zhongxin,

648
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,400
don't you have a mission?

649
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,480
Where are you going?

650
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,160
The Commander's mansion called.

651
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,000
If you're leaving,

652
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,080
what about those students?

653
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,120
They've got you.

654
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,040
Me?

655
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,100
It's your call now.

656
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,160
Shuting,

657
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,980
be careful.

658
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,680
What is there to look?

659
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,890
Don't recognize me?

660
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,680
I'll be the commander

661
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,210
and take you to the mission.

662
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,600
You have to work harder.

663
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,680
I just received the Commander's order.

664
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,960
He ordered us to cooperate with the 3rd Battalion

665
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,360
and take the Double-wolf Stronghold down.

666
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Take this mission

667
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,000
as your graduation test.

668
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,520
Look sharp.

669
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:47,880
Understood?

670
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,440
Yes, Sir.

671
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,930
Director Lv,

672
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
this way, please.

673
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,600
OK.

674
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,320
This way.

675
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,570
Director Lv,

676
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,280
please turn in your sidearm.

677
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,410
I'll take it for you.

678
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,120
Since Commander Zhang was killed,

679
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,920
Commander Song orders to tighten control on arms.

680
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,210
Commander Song?

681
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,620
Commander Song Xicheng.

682
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,210
Director Lv.

683
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
Please hand in your sidearm.

684
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,520
Please.

685
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,880
Hold on.

686
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,560
Can I go to the bathroom first?

687
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,080
OK.

688
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,000
This way.
