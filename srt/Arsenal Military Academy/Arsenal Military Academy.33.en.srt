Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,500
Episode 33

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,000
The blue one.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,840
Blue.

6
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,039
Blue?

7
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,920
The large one at the back.

8
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
Awesome.

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,530
Can you do it?

10
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,960
No, sir.

11
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,080
There must be a problem with your stall.

12
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,920
My lady.

13
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,920
So many people are watching.

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,759
And many people

15
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,800
played it.

16
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,000
There is no problem.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,759
Right.

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,600
Sir.

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
Give us the presents.

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,920
OK.

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,900
So many dolls. Who wants them?

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,160
Here. Take it.

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,220
I want it! I want it!

24
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,079
Take it.

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
- Give me. - Yours.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,520
Take it.

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,620
Thank you, sir.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,520
Let's go.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
Let's go.

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,520
Sir.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,579
I'll take the rest.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
I buy them.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,079
This is not the way I do business.

34
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,610
I don't care. I'll buy them.

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,800
Why don't you let us in?

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,440
We will pay for it.

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,680
Excuse me.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Right.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,720
I have been here before.

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,800
Exactly.

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,200
This store used to

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
operate to the public.

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,000
But several days ago

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,000
the childe bought this place.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,060
So it's a private racecourse now.

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

48
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,880
sorry for that.

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,620
You can't get in.

50
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,800
Is it a private racecourse?

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
We traveled so far to be here.

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320
Please let us get in.

53
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm sorry

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,280
but I can't.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Xiaojun.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,560
If you want to ride horses,

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
I'll take you to ride next time.

58
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,600
Poor bumpkin.

59
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,520
Have you ever

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,800
seen a horse?

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,130
What did you say?

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
You are deaf at a young age.

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,480
So poor.

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,400
Say it again!

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,450
I can repeat it a hundred times.

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Poor wretch!

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
Bumpkin!

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,240
Bumpkin?

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,160
You are no better than a whore.

70
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,130
Who do you mean is the whore?

71
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,200
Who answered me is whom I meant.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,400
You...

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,760
Do you want to fight?

74
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,840
You hit her!

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,860
She started it.

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,490
Are you alright?

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Mr. Song.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,200
Who are they standing at the door?

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,260
A gang of bumpkins.

80
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,000
Why don't you keep the order?

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,680
Miss Du.

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm really sorry.

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,160
Mrs. Lu called me and said that

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,480
you would come to the racecourse.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,010
So we are here to pick you up.

86
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,960
Well.

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
Your red horse

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,280
gets so strong.

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,240
I have arranged to bathe it.

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,920
You can ride it

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,950
in a moment.

92
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,829
Really?

93
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,880
Take me to see it later.

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
Mr. Song.

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
It is a

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,380
private racecourse of my cousin.

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,480
The guests here are dignitaries.

98
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,760
Not anyone can come in.

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,380
Look outside the door.

100
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
So many people are standing there.

101
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,420
It's like a market.

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
People would sneer at us

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,360
for our family has no rules.

104
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,600
Don't worry, Miss Du.

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,420
I'll handle it right away.

106
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

107
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm really sorry.

108
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,260
It is indeed a private racecourse.

109
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,990
We don't receive any customer.

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,760
So,

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,530
please dismiss and go back.

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,240
Xiaojun.

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,159
Let's go.

114
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,040
Tan Xiaojun.

115
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,480
Mr. Shen.

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,120
What brings you here?

117
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,520
I come here to ride horses with classmates.

118
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,440
When we arrived,

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
they said it was a private racecourse.

120
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,720
We are not allowed to get in.

121
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,640
I see.

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
This is my racecourse.

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,340
You won't be rejected.

124
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Tell me in advance

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,960
next time before you come.

126
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,200
I'll help you arrange it.

127
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,659
Really?

128
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,560
But this lady said

129
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
this was their private racecourse.

130
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,640
All those who come here are dignitaries.

131
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,120
It will disgrace you

132
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,040
if we go there.

133
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,360
Cousin.

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,470
I am the daughter of Du Yucheng.

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
You visited my home when you were young.

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,040
Do you remember we are engaged?

137
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,040
Director Du of the Judicial Bureau?

138
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,600
No. No.

139
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,800
Xiaojun.

140
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,760
Who is this?

141
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,720
She is my...

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
my classmate.

143
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,560
So lovely.

144
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,820
Hello!

145
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,570
My name is Shen Junshan,

146
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,780
Xiaojun's friend.

147
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,000
Hello.

148
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
I introduced myself.

149
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,680
It's your turn.

150
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,920
I... I...

151
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,480
My name is...

152
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
Her name is Xie Xiang.

153
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,320
She is Xie Liangchen's sister.

154
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
You should have the impression.

155
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,120
Liangchen's sister?

156
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,000
Alright.

157
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,240
Mr. Song.

158
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,440
Sir.

159
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
Lead them in.

160
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,560
Pay attention to safety.

161
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,680
In addition,

162
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,920
bring out my best two horses

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
to Miss Tan and Miss Xie.

164
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,840
Get it, sir.

165
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,440
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

166
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,240
Xie Zhipei has two children.

167
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
The son is Xie Liangchen.

168
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
The daughter is Xie Xiang.

169
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,480
The brother is two years elder.

170
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,000
Two years ago, Xie Liangchen was enrolled at the Arsenal Military Academy.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,680
On the first day of school, he encountered a thief at Shunyuan Railway Station.

172
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,010
The thief was cornered,

173
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,360
and robbed a car.

174
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,920
Xie Liangchen was killed by the car on the spot.

175
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,680
His sister Xie Xiang was depressed

176
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,140
and dropped out of school.

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
There has been no news about her since then.

178
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
This is Xie Xiang.

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Riding is so fun.

180
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,410
I didn't expect you to ride so well.

181
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
You shouldn't say that.

182
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,860
I was nearly exposed.

183
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,160
Someone also said that

184
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,640
you were Xie Liangchen's sister before.

185
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
No one doubted it.

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,290
He won't see it through.

187
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,640
Xiaojun.

188
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,200
We should leave.

189
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
Can I ride another lap?

190
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Just one lap.

191
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm going.

192
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,340
Alright. Alright.

193
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
Xiang.

194
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,720
Be careful!

195
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,560
Why don't you ride two more laps?

196
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
You ride so well.

197
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,050
Did your brother teach you?

198
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,520
Do I look scary?

199
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,210
Why don't you look at me?

200
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,800
No.

201
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,920
Unless...

202
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,880
you have ulterior motives.

203
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,060
This is not the first time we have met, right?

204
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,520
Do you know it?

205
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,290
Do you think you can fool me?

206
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,800
I didn't mean it.

207
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,120
I have reasons.

208
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,880
Right.

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,120
It is the second time we have met.

210
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,880
But you shouldn't pretend to ignore me.

211
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,440
Last time when you performed on stage

212
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
at Shengping Theater,

213
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,860
I was sitting in the first row.

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,330
After the performance,

215
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,010
I went to backstage for you.

216
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,680
But I didn't see you.

217
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,880
Did you hide away?

218
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,120
I thought Xie Liangchen disguised as a man.

219
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,280
I didn't know

220
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,600
he has a twin sister

221
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,320
until Huang Song told me.

222
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Really?

223
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
I don't think

224
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,520
you look like him.

225
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,250
You are much prettier than him.

226
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,770
We can go out together if you have time.

227
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,080
Alright.

228
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,960
In a few days,

229
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,600
Xie Liangchen will come to our house for dinner.

230
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,800
You can come with him.

231
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,520
It's not allowed to ask for leave in school.

232
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,600
Xinhua Girls' School.

233
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,520
The headmaster is Li Yuankui, right?

234
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,780
I'll help you to ask for leave.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No need.

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
I can ask for leave on my own.

237
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,880
Can you make it approved?

238
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,040
Yes.

239
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,640
Good!

240
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm looking forward to seeing you and your brother.

241
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,000
Mr. Shen.

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank you to see us off.

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
Thank you for your hospitality.

244
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,370
You're welcome.

245
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,960
We're leaving.

246
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,440
Goodbye.

247
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,720
Goodbye.

248
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,240
Did you get exposed?

249
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,920
Why are you so sad?

250
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,600
He invited me to his house for dinner.

251
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Isn't it good?

252
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,170
He also invited my brother,

253
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
Xie Liangchen from the AMA.

254
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,760
What should you do?

255
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,760
I don't know.

256
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,000
It's your fault.

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,760
You shouldn't take me to the racecourse.

258
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,240
I didn't know it.

259
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Now your identity has been exposed.

260
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,960
Now there is a letter.

261
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,540
But the same letter will appear next time.

262
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,000
Now that you have a chance to give up,

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
I think it's better

264
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
for you to leave.

265
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,520
In a few days,

266
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,000
Xie Liangchen will come to our house for dinner.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
You can come with him.

268
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,320
Wenzhong.

269
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,200
You are back.

270
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Nothing happened in school these two days?

271
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,960
Nothing.

272
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,300
What about Xie Liangchen?

273
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,280
Nothing happened to Xie Liangchen either.

274
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,880
What's up?

275
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,080
Nothing.

276
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,120
Bye.

277
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,180
OK. See you around.

278
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,660
Sergeant Lv saw the letter

279
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,520
and did not dispel Xie Liangchen.

280
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,530
It seems that he knows about it.

281
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,880
Right.

282
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
If she knows no one

283
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,520
in the school authority,

284
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,920
it's impossible for Xie Liangchen, a woman, to pass the checkup.

285
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
I don't know if Sergeant Guo knows about it.

286
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,120
Sergeant Guo.

287
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,300
Why are you standing here?

288
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,380
I want to report something to you.

289
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,440
Say it.

290
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,880
Could we go in and talk about it?

291
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,080
What I will tell you is serious.

292
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,680
It's fine. Say it.

293
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,640
I found a shocking secret.

294
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,440
Xie Liangchen is a woman.

295
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,760
I saw her go to the ladies' room in the hospital.

296
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
And she suffers from abdominal pain

297
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,540
occasionally,

298
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
which is weird for a man.

299
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,640
So I alleged that she was a woman.

300
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,200
Alright.

301
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,820
Anything else?

302
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,000
Nope.

303
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,940
OK then. Go for your business.

304
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,840
It seems that Sergeant Lv and Guo

305
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,700
were bought off by Xie Liangchen.

306
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,640
I have to figure out another way.

307
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,420
Did you lose money?

308
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,820
All the money given by my family was lost.

309
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,140
Did you lose money?

310
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,040
I heard that many people have lost things recently.

311
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah.

312
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,640
Two days ago,

313
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Li Wenzhong also lost his new watch.

314
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,760
He deserved it.

315
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,920
Who did it?

316
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,400
He was so bold to steal.

317
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,800
No matter who he is,

318
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,760
if I capture him.

319
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,720
I would beat him to death.

320
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,320
How much money have you lost?

321
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,440
All of it.

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,640
Song.

323
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,540
Did you lose anything?

324
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,080
No.

325
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,920
Don't eat it. It was dirty.

326
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
We have so much.

327
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,130
What's up? You seem absent.

328
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,160
- So strange. - Who could it be?

329
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,090
I just got my salary and it was gone.

330
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,820
What have you lost?

331
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,960
I don't know.

332
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,360
It was definitely stolen.

333
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,440
I won't afford the expenses this month.

334
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,720
We have to find it out.

335
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,760
Right. I lost money three times a week.

336
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
It is definitely not a coincidence.

337
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,730
There must be a thief

338
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,820
in this apartment.

339
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,680
I lost twenty yuan last night.

340
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,840
I have no money for daily expenses this month.

341
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
It must be the same thief.

342
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,520
The thief is so odious.

343
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,069
He stole things so many times,

344
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,520
and left nothing for us.

345
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,960
So hateful.

346
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,349
The thief must be captured.

347
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,950
Let's report to Sergeant Lv.

348
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,200
When the Sergeant arrives,

349
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,060
the thief would already run away.

350
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,550
Do you have any ideas?

351
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,520
Any idea?

352
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:21,960
Well.

353
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,520
We can search it.

354
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,680
Search?

355
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,109
Yeah.

356
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,589
What we lost,

357
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,880
the money and watch,

358
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,760
are easy to be transferred away.

359
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
We can't search anything out

360
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
since so many days passed.

361
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,840
Why did you say it?

362
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
Let me finish my words.

363
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,440
He must have waited

364
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,800
until the lights were off last night.

365
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
And he shouldn't have acted until we fell asleep.

366
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
At that time, the dormitory door was locked.

367
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
It was impossible for him to transfer the stolen stuffs.

368
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,240
Right?

369
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,440
Right.

370
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,570
We found it stolen early this morning.

371
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,640
It was impossible for him to run out

372
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,200
because it would provoke our suspicion.

373
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,480
So I alleged that

374
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
the stolen stuffs are still in the apartment.

375
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,920
We can definitely find them.

376
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,200
It makes sense.

377
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,380
Is it right?

378
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,880
We all lost money.

379
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,840
Did you lose any other stuff?

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
We all lost money.

381
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
But we all have money with us.

382
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,200
So we can't tell

383
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,700
whether it is the stolen money or not.

384
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,320
Yeah.

385
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,440
Yeah.

386
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,640
I also lost my wallet.

387
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,280
If we find out where the wallet is,

388
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,480
we can tell who the thief is.

389
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,740
Yes. I agree to search.

390
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,060
- I agree, too. - Agree.

391
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,280
Alright.

392
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,520
Let's search it separately.

393
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,640
Search each room.

394
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,040
So I'll take the lead.

395
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Search my room first.

396
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,840
Go.

397
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,900
Search carefully.

398
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,340
Alright.

399
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,960
Who will search my room?

400
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,840
We will go.

401
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,100
- All right. - Let's go.

402
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,230
Where are you going?

403
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,560
None of your business.

404
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,760
It's not my business.

405
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,200
But I have to suggest you.

406
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,400
Don't leave out of sight.

407
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,500
Otherwise you will be suspected of booty transfer.

408
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,200
What do you mean?

409
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
I mean nothing.

410
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,340
I'm going.

411
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,520
Don't be afraid

412
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,180
if you didn't steal anything.

413
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Unless

414
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,600
you have

415
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,660
something afraid to be searched out.

416
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,040
Gu Yanzhen is sleeping inside.

417
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,160
Go and search it

418
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,080
if you dare to.

419
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,810
I don't care.

420
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
I find something!

421
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,720
Song.

422
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
How do you explain

423
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,160
the money?

424
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Yeah.

425
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,240
Where is my watch?

426
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,400
Where's my twenty yuan?

427
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,280
- What about my money? - Where is mine?

428
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,080
Where is mine?

429
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,280
It is

430
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,560
all of my money.

431
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,520
Your money?

432
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,330
Where did you get the money?

433
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
What do you mean?

434
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,240
I mean what I said.

435
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,300
We all know his family is poor.

436
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,940
It's about one hundred yuan.

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,040
How did he get so much money?

438
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,720
Song couldn't steal the money.

439
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,200
OK.

440
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,680
I know he couldn't steal the money.

441
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,520
But where did the money come from?

442
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,380
Xie Liangchen.

443
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
We know you are good with Huang Song.

444
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,040
But he has to explain

445
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,480
where he got so much money.

446
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,240
Why does he have to explain it to you?

447
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,400
If your family is rich,

448
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,100
do you have to explain where the money comes from?

449
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,920
It's different.

450
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,040
I don't think it's different.

451
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Xie Liangchen.

452
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,200
Don't talk nonsense.

453
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,940
You said you lost your wallet.

454
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,370
Where is the wallet?

455
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,100
Didn't you say we can confirm the thief

456
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,520
by the wallet?

457
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,140
Maybe he threw it away.

458
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,220
Where did he throw?

459
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
If he thought of throwing the wallet away,

460
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,680
how could he have put the money

461
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,520
in such an obvious place so that you can find it?

462
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,560
He is silly.

463
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
You are much sillier than him.

464
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,160
You...

465
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Alright.

466
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,340
Stop your quarrel.

467
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,140
Liangchen.

468
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,360
I don't believe Song

469
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,760
is a thief.

470
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,560
But Song,

471
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
if you can't explain

472
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
where you got the money,

473
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,610
they will suspect you definitely.

474
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,040
Do you know what I mean?

475
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,100
Right. Huang Song.

476
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,400
All the money

477
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,520
was earned by me.

478
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,380
Did you earn it?

479
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,700
How did you earn it?

480
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,020
Why should he tell you?

481
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
In my view,

482
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
you must steal it.

483
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,720
Say it again!

484
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,340
So what?

485
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
Do you want to fight?

486
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,800
Come on.

487
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,640
Let's fight. Come on.

488
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,800
Stop now.

489
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,090
What are you arguing about?

490
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,280
You disturbed my sleep.

491
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,040
Gu Yanzhen.

492
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,170
Do you want to fight?

493
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,200
Someone lost money again last night.

494
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,100
And we searched out

495
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,480
so much money from Huang Song.

496
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,340
We asked him how he got it,

497
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,560
but he refused to explain it.

498
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,200
Money?

499
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,800
Isn't this my money?

500
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,200
Your money?

501
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,340
Yes. The money I gave him.

502
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,980
The money you gave him?

503
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,700
Why did you give him money?

504
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,960
Do you defend him

505
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,800
as Xie Liangchen did?

506
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,920
Yeah.

507
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Didn't you tell them?

508
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,560
Xie Liangchen fought with me two days ago.

509
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,240
She was angry with me,

510
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,200
and wanted to change the dormitory.

511
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,340
Huang Song agreed but I didn't agree.

512
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,500
So I stealthily gave him the money

513
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,680
and told him not to change the dormitory with Xie Liangchen.

514
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,760
It's so simple.

515
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
You are lying.

516
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,040
I have no reason to lie. Right?

517
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,340
We just asked him where the money was from.

518
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,540
Why didn't he tell us?

519
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,440
Yeah.

520
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,240
Why?

521
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,640
Why didn't you tell them?

522
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,800
You are afraid that Xie Liangchen

523
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,360
would be angry at it. Right?

524
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,120
Don't worry.

525
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
I have reconciled with her.

526
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,560
She won't change her dormitory.

527
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,120
Right?

528
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
What on earth are you hiding from me?

529
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,040
What Gu Yanzhen said

530
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,530
was fake. Right?

531
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,600
Does the money

532
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,640
have anything to do

533
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,770
with your injuries?

534
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,040
I know.

535
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,640
Why didn't you tell us about it?

536
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,200
Since you have the reasons for it,

537
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,100
forget it.

538
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,600
Be careful these days.

539
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,360
This matter was possibly

540
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,520
plotted by Li Wenzhong.

541
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,060
Huang Song.

542
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,040
Gu Yanzhen.

543
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,960
Come. Let's talk.

544
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,480
The dormitory doors are all closed.

545
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,920
Why don't you go back?

546
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,860
Don't you know the way to go in?

547
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,760
How do you know it?

548
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,820
Of course I know it.

549
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
You can't fool me by your tricks.

550
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,520
Gu Yanzhen.

551
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,770
Thank you for helping me today.

552
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,300
I will pay the money back to you someday.

553
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,080
No need.

554
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,680
It's not concerned with you.

555
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,040
Anyway,

556
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,680
you helped me today.

557
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,880
Since you know I helped you,

558
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,080
I have some words to you.

559
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,920
I don't care to pay more money to compensate their losses.

560
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,760
Compared with friendship,

561
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,290
money is nothing at all.

562
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,400
I have no interest in

563
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,280
what you did

564
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,200
and how you got the money.

565
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,560
But I know,

566
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
you would rather be wronged of theft

567
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,600
than tell the truth.

568
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,770
It shows that you got the money illegally.

569
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,100
Once it is revealed,

570
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,010
the consequences could be much more serious than steal.

571
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,520
Am I right?

572
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,100
Huang Song.

573
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,180
Everything has the limit.

574
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,960
Now you are being targeted.

575
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,400
You should stop it

576
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,100
before it's out of control.

577
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,880
You know.

578
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,840
Money is

579
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,240
nothing for me.

580
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,520
I can even deal with officials

581
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,600
in the name of my father.

582
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,320
Tell me.

583
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,040
Who did you offend?

584
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,920
Or did you make any troubles?

585
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,800
I can handle it

586
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,440
on my own.

587
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Alright.

588
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,000
Look at you.

589
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,480
Because of you,

590
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,600
Xie Liangchen gets distressed.

591
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,800
You should know.

592
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,520
I won't be happy if she is not.

593
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,800
So you'd better settle it.

594
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,080
Gu Yanzhen.

595
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,800
Liangchen and you...

596
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,600
Don't interfere in our affairs.

597
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,480
Let's go.

598
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,680
Qu.

599
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Our two families have known each other for many years.

600
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,200
You and I have been friends for a long time.

601
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,100
I respect you for your character and knowledge.

602
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,560
I also admire your good family disciplines.

603
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,640
I witnessed the growth of Manting.

604
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
My wife and I

605
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,960
are fond of her so much.

606
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,760
But now it's not the old times.

607
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,680
A blind match

608
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,140
based on the horoscope

609
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,320
and the family background

610
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,460
doesn't work anymore.

611
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Anyway,

612
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,000
it depends on the thoughts of children.

613
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,840
Their interests, hobbies and temperament

614
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,900
should be suitable to each other.

615
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Since they are not willing to marry,

616
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,160
we can't make the decision for them

617
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,880
and ruin their happiness of life

618
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,720
even though we hope it.

619
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,360
What do you think of it?

620
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,400
Uncle. Aunt.

621
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,640
It's all my fault.

622
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,760
I was reckless before.

623
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,080
I came to your family and proposed to her

624
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,480
before thinking it over,

625
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,160
and caused the embarrassing situation like this.

626
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,600
I get you awkward.

627
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,480
As my apology,

628
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,370
what we agreed on before

629
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,120
will still be valid

630
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,450
except for the wedding.

631
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,560
I am young and bold.

632
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,480
I should be as meticulous

633
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,610
as the seniors like you on business

634
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
from now on.

635
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,800
Though our Qu family is not as wealthy as before,

636
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,120
we are not beggars.

637
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,180
We don't need donations from others.

638
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,160
Now that you have put it in this way,

639
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,160
do it as you said.

640
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,400
Mrs. He.

641
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,500
See the guests off.

642
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes.

643
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
Sir, please.

644
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,760
Qu. Sister.

645
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,240
Farewell.

646
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,280
Uncle.

647
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,840
Aunt.

648
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,480
Farewell.

649
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,320
I'll see you off.

650
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,000
Stop.

651
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,680
You are so shameless.

652
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,320
Uncle.

653
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,280
It is my fault.

654
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,760
Please don't blame Manting.

655
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,880
Tingbai.

656
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,080
Dad. Mom.

657
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,800
I...

658
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,200
You disgraced

659
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,970
our Qu family today.

660
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,040
He came to our house and broke off the marriage.

661
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,800
I have no face to see others anymore.

662
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,320
Why do you have no face to see others?

663
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,380
It's not a big deal.

664
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,400
Do you think you are reasonable?

665
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If you were cautious with your deeds

666
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,160
and didn't get entangled with Gu,

667
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,480
how could he come here

668
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,940
to break off the marriage?

669
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
Do you know the honor of our Qu family?

670
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,560
In the era of Tongzhi and Guangxu,

671
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,120
your grandfather and great grandfather

672
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,560
had been the Cabinet Bachelor,

673
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,420
serving in the Imperial Academy.

674
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,160
Our ancestors had been glorious officials for several generations.

675
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,690
But you, as the descendant, are so shameless!

676
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,080
Our ancestors in the heaven

677
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,780
would be disgraced by you.

678
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Did I get the ancestors disgraced

679
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,240
for I asked him to break off the marriage?

680
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,040
If our ancestors know that

681
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
you dissipated the family property by selling houses

682
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,840
and even your own daughter,

683
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,240
they might be pissed off in the tomb.

684
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,120
Manting.

685
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,600
Stop talking.

686
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,200
Don't get your father raged.

687
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,620
She is not my daughter.

688
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,040
I am not her father either!

689
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,680
Stop.

690
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,260
Stop your quarrel.

691
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,960
Manting.

692
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,450
Go back to your room.

693
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
From now on,

694
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
don't go out without my permission.

695
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,140
Introspect yourself at home.

696
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,840
Hello. Who is it?

697
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,880
Hi. It's me

698
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,760
Where are you?

699
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
It's so noisy.

700
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,240
Paramo.

701
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,880
I thought you would have been depressed

702
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,240
when you broke off the marriage with me.

703
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,900
I didn't expect you to go to entertain yourself.

704
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,480
How is it?

705
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,330
Did you get scolded?

706
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,080
More than scolding.

707
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,360
Did he beat you?

708
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,450
Are you hurt?

709
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,440
Don't worry.

710
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,700
I'm so thick-skinned.

711
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,720
I know.

712
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,060
If he beats you violently,

713
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,480
you would fight back.

714
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,680
Bro.

715
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,920
Don't make fun of me.

716
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,320
I'm not so bad as that.

717
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,920
Alright?

718
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,320
How is it?

719
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,960
Did Shen lecture you?

720
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,340
No. He said I did a good job.

721
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,160
Really?

722
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,660
Does he dislike me so much?

723
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,720
He likes the fat ones,

724
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,620
and those who can bear babies.

725
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,600
He did the fortune-telling with your horoscope.

726
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,520
He said

727
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,320
your physiognomy was against your husband's fortune.

728
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
What?

729
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,360
Who said that?

730
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
Which charlatan?

731
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,880
My physiognomy is pretty good to my husband's fortune.

732
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,190
My mother also did the fortune-telling for me.

733
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,850
I'm destined to be an empress.

734
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,880
Yeah.

735
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Destined to be an empress.

736
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,420
The emperor has abdicated

737
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,600
but you haven't married yet.

738
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,230
Shen Tingbai.

739
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,440
What are you talking about?

740
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,100
You want to piss me off. Right?

741
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,400
Well.

742
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,159
I won't talk with you.

743
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,000
Sleep now.

744
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,159
Enjoy yourself.

745
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,120
Bye.

746
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,120
Junshan.

747
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
You're back.

748
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,440
What?

749
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,080
Move.

750
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,760
Go.

751
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,640
Don't push me.

752
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,680
Are you mad?

753
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,120
It's said that

754
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,580
this test would be proctored by Sergeant Lv.

755
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,120
Seriously?

756
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,080
The news is reliable.

757
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,720
Liangchen.

758
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,120
Lend me your notes.

759
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,600
Nope.

760
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,050
My notes will be given to Shen Junshan.

761
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,680
Why?

762
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
He didn't come to classes for sickness.

763
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,200
What about you?

764
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,480
You skipped classes

765
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,320
for unknown reasons.

766
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,450
I won't indulge you.

767
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,880
Since you hide so much from me recently,

768
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
you should draw a lesson from it.

769
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,000
Don't be so cruel to me.

770
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,400
You can borrow it from him if you need it.

771
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,900
What are you doing?

772
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,920
Can I sit here?

773
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,320
As your wish.

774
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,720
What did you chat about?

775
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
I wanna borrow notes from Liangchen.

776
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
He refused to lend me.

777
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
He said he kept it for you.

778
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,720
Really?

779
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,440
You didn't come to classes recently.

780
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,720
Neither did I.

781
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,960
Did anyone force you to skip classes?

782
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,290
Did you get injured too?

783
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,400
How are your injuries?

784
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,060
Almost recovered.

785
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,530
That's good.

786
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,220
Xie Liangchen, you...

787
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,630
How is your foot?

788
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,720
Liangchen.

789
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,880
You tripped him.

790
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,370
Did he just leave like that?

791
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
He is afraid of me.

792
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Why don't you eat?

793
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,650
I'm full when watching you eat.

794
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,210
Gu Yanzhen. What are you doing?

795
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,920
Do you like it?

796
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,120
Pretty.

797
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,280
That's good.

798
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,640
I'll fly you more.

799
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
I get it.

800
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,480
My notes!

801
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,240
Gu Yanzhen, you are dead!

802
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,680
Good!

803
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,080
Don't let me capture you!

804
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,850
Alright, I have stopped it.

805
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,040
Be happy now.

806
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,920
I stopped.

807
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,200
Let me take it.

808
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,400
Let me take it.

809
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,000
Come.

810
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,340
Xie Liangchen.

811
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,600
You...

812
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,560
Stop!

813
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,240
You can't hit me!

814
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,400
I hate you!

815
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,760
Come in.

816
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,600
Gu Yanzhen folded my notes

817
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,840
into paper planes.

818
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
It took a long time

819
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,400
to find some.

820
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,540
But there are still a lot missing.

821
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,600
I really take a long time to find them.

822
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,000
That's all I found.

823
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,410
You didn't keep your words.

824
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,960
I'll look for them tomorrow.

825
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,740
I'll put them on the table.

826
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,760
Well.

827
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,000
Forget the notes.

828
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,520
Help me to apply the medicine

829
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,720
as the compensation.

830
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,080
Close the door.

831
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,520
Didn't your injuries

832
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
get recovered?

833
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,930
To remove the scars.

834
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,770
Are you afraid of scars?

835
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,610
I don't care about them.

836
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,220
But I am afraid that the future wife

837
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,440
would dislike them.

838
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,480
You are foresighted.

839
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,490
Apply the medicine.

840
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,440
I saw your sister

841
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,370
at the racecourse days ago.

842
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,400
She is so lovely.

843
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,400
Clever and pretty.

844
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,200
But she is kind of shy.

845
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,740
She doesn't talk much.

846
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,000
Really?

847
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,960
Yeah.

848
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,000
It seems that

849
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
she doesn't contact with boys much.

850
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,260
Liangchen.

851
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,140
Does she have a boyfriend?

852
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,880
I don't think so.

853
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,960
That's good.

854
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,040
I intend to

855
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,840
court her.
