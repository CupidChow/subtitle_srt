00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 07

4
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Miss,

5
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,759
what's your name?

6
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,520
Are you a friend of Mr. Gu?

7
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not his friend.

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,200
Hands off!

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Do you want to die?

10
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
She is my girl.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He's annoying.

12
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,360
What did you call him?

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,340
Liangchen.

14
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,630
Xiaojun, last time at the Wintersweet...

15
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,080
That is his sister!

16
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
You have a sister?

17
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
Yeah, I have a sister.

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,490
Her sister is Xie Xiang,

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,200
studying in Xinhua Girl's School.

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,240
Xie Xiang?

21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,360
Isn't your pet name Xie Xiang?

22
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,120
He is lucky that he didn't show up today.

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,520
Next time I see him,

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,320
he will be done.

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
Chief is right.

26
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,240
Bro,

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,890
listen to me.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,210
What are you looking at?

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Am I handsome?

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,140
What's wrong with you?

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,330
A woman with a bad tongue is the least lovable.

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,730
Who is the woman?

33
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,120
So is the man.

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,770
Didn't you walk Ms. Qu home?

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm not interested in

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,890
walking that crazy woman home.

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,360
You said she is pretty that you wanted

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,060
to take her away last time.

39
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,360
I changed.

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,940
I changed my taste.

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,860
I'm not interested in her now.

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
What a play boy.

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,820
It's getting cold.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,680
I don't need it.

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,210
Put it on.

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,640
Move.

47
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,760
Sir!

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,280
Come in.

49
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
What's wrong?

50
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,500
Mr. Song asked me to help you sort out the documents.

51
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,700
Anything wrong again?

52
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
He disobeyed

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,360
the command and

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,900
left without permission.

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,560
Just put the documents on the ground

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,360
on the shelf in chronological order.

57
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,490
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:43,680
And,

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,240
be quiet.

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm resting.

61
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,120
At ease!

62
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,620
Attention!

63
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Dress right!

64
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,240
Dress front!

65
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,320
You are all

66
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,400
combat officers carefully trained by the school.

67
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,800
To be an excellent officer,

68
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
we should not only have a smart mind,

69
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,680
rich combat experience,

70
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,360
a keen military sense,

71
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,220
but also a strong ability to survive.

72
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,440
So,

73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
before you learn how to

74
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,120
be a good commander,

75
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,440
you have to learn

76
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,280
how to be a good fighter first.

77
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,440
You have to adapt to all kinds of complex combat environments,

78
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,240
keep a clear mind

79
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,090
and accomplish tasks quickly.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
And to ensure

81
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,159
your own safety at the same time.

82
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,370
Today's mission

83
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,930
will ask you to know the map well

84
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,620
within 30 seconds.

85
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
And find the plate with your own number

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,920
according to the signs on the map.

87
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
There will be a guardian.

88
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,160
If you are beaten by the guardian,

89
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
your mission will fail.

90
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,640
The terrain there is very complicated.

91
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,880
There are faults

92
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,760
and blind alleys.

93
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,200
Blind intrusion will only waste your time.

94
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,060
There are a lot of fire points.

95
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
The longer you stay inside,

96
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,570
the heavier the fog will be.

97
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,370
Ant it will be more difficult to find the targets.

98
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,650
Whoever is defeated by the guardians,

99
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,890
fails to find his own target plate,

100
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,280
or is the last one to come out,

101
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,300
will be regarded as a mission failure

102
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
and will be punished.

103
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,120
Sir,

104
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,250
what is the punishment?

105
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,250
Clean the toilet for one month.

106
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,970
Toilet cleaning again!

107
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,520
Or you could

108
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
run 20 laps naked on the playground.

109
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,300
Stop laughing!

110
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
Is that clear?

111
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,520
Yes, sir!

112
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,020
Remember the location of your plate.

113
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
You have only 30 seconds.

114
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,040
Time's up!

115
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,800
Move!

116
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,400
Let me go!

117
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,810
Why do you have this?

118
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,960
Gu Yanzhen!

119
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,840
Why are you wearing this?

120
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,920
Where is Xie Liangchen?

121
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,760
I don't know.

122
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,540
Xie Liangchen.

123
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,560
Xie Liangchen.

124
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,260
Xie Liangchen.

125
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,220
Xie Liangchen.

126
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,940
Why are you still here?

127
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,680
I haven't found my plate yet.

128
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,280
Forget it.

129
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,000
Get out of here!

130
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,600
No.

131
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,530
I have to find it.

132
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,560
Get out!

133
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,800
No way!

134
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,360
What are you doing?

135
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,020
Put me down!

136
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,120
Shen Junshan!

137
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,480
Put me down!

138
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,600
Shen Junshan!

139
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,560
Where is Xie Liangchen?

140
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I didn't find him.

141
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,520
That's none of my business.

142
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,840
No! No!

143
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,380
He was just taken out by Shen Junshan.

144
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,220
Shen Junshan! Put me down!

145
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,940
Don't move.

146
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,240
I have to go back.

147
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,640
My plate is still there.

148
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
Shen Junshan!

149
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm tired.

150
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,480
I need to take a rest here.

151
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,050
Did I ask you to stand up?

152
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,040
Sit down!

153
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,080
Why?

154
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,200
Sit!

155
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,210
What punishment

156
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,880
I said that the one

157
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
who fails would take?

158
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,090
Run naked

159
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,400
for 20 laps.

160
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,060
So there seem to be quite a few naked runners.

161
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,330
Except for them,

162
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,640
anyone who didn't

163
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
find the plate with your own number,

164
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
stand over there.

165
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,160
Anyone else?

166
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,300
Where is yours?

167
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,040
I'm asking you!

168
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,730
Where is your plate?

169
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
I picked it at the door.

170
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,280
Is this yours?

171
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,620
Xie Liangchen!

172
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,840
Come and run with me!

173
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,320
Come on!

174
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
How will you thank me?

175
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,600
For what?

176
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,160
I know it was you

177
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,820
who took away my number plate.

178
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,180
You're so mean.

179
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,760
Junshan.

180
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,170
What are you talking about?

181
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,040
Nothing.

182
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,010
I'm asking him about the plate.

183
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,920
Why does he have your plate?

184
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,280
Who knows?

185
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,680
Maybe he was bored

186
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,610
then he did that.

187
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,400
If you didn't take me out,

188
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,720
I could have sought it in vain.

189
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
I took you out without

190
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
your permission.

191
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,820
Sorry for that.

192
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,100
Or I would have run naked, too.

193
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,520
Thank you.

194
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,720
Yes.

195
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,080
Yes.

196
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,040
I got it.

197
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,620
Mr. President,

198
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,420
Mrs. Sachiko and Miss have been on board.

199
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,120
And the cremains of Mr. Sanada

200
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,920
will be taken to Japan together.

201
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,780
Where is Shen Tingbai?

202
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,880
He

203
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,100
has gone back home.

204
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,680
He didn't admit that he killed Mr. Sanada.

205
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,810
The police said they would continue the investigation.

206
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,080
Besides,

207
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,560
the Academy protested to the Military Department,

208
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,840
saying that we broke into the Military Zone without authorization

209
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,500
and attacked their students.

210
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,160
They didn't get hurt, did they?

211
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,960
But five people

212
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,720
of us were dead.

213
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,720
They said

214
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,360
one of them

215
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,280
got his ankle injured.

216
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,320
And another one

217
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,280
injured his head in the fight.

218
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,800
Nonsense!

219
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,800
I heard that

220
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
Shen's cotton factory has opened. Right?

221
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,360
Yes.

222
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,720
I see.

223
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,920
This is my ball!

224
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,480
Give me!

225
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,040
Yours?

226
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,090
Here you are.

227
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,080
Xiaotao.

228
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Don't be naughty!

229
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,200
Sir,

230
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm so sorry.

231
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,200
Did you get hurt?

232
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,640
I'll take her out now.

233
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,000
Let's go.

234
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,460
Be careful.

235
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
Mr. Shen.

236
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,720
Look at this.

237
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,120
These are

238
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,480
the machines we just bought.

239
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,810
They are all the newest.

240
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,960
Very accurate.

241
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Our employees

242
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,090
are also very hard-working

243
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
and experienced.

244
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,140
Junshan, you're here.

245
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,440
I'm fine.

246
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Just go ahead.

247
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,880
The mechanics from Shanghai will leave tomorrow.

248
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Please re-adjust

249
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,090
the machines before you leave.

250
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,760
Okay.

251
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,100
We should order the cotton for next year now.

252
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,480
There is a war in Shandong

253
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,640
and a disaster in Hebei.

254
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,300
The cotton is in short supply.

255
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,040
I got it.

256
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,640
Mr. Shen,

257
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,200
let me take a photo for you.

258
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,800
Alright.

259
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,360
Where?

260
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,520
The light is well here.

261
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,320
You stand here.

262
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm here.

263
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,290
Alright.

264
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,560
Call others.

265
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,200
Call them all here.

266
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,840
Come on.

267
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,960
Wait a moment.

268
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,280
Come here.

269
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,080
Let's take a group photo.

270
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,760
Qiang, come here.

271
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,320
Hurry up.

272
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,080
Come here.

273
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,280
You, come on.

274
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,960
Hurry up!

275
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,520
Let's take a group photo.

276
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,720
Come here. Come here.

277
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,720
Where is the little girl just now?

278
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,560
Take her here.

279
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,560
Okay.

280
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,880
Go.

281
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,120
Here.

282
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,080
Watch the camera.

283
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,880
One, two, three.

284
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,360
You must keep the key points

285
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,760
of this lesson in mind.

286
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Where do you want to go this vacation?

287
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,210
I don't know where to go.

288
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,080
Just go home.

289
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,100
Liangchen,

290
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,520
the vacation will begin tomorrow.

291
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,720
Where do you want to go?

292
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Where can I go?

293
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,860
My home is not here.

294
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,520
Isn't your sister here?

295
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,050
Aren't you going to see her?

296
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,850
She lives in the school,

297
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,240
she can't get out easily.

298
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,970
Then, if you have nowhere to go,

299
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,380
you can go to my sister's home with me.

300
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,480
Isn't your sister's home in Huixian?

301
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,880
It's dozens of miles from here.

302
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,360
She moved here long ago.

303
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
It's not far.

304
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,600
My brother will go there as well.

305
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,330
You haven't met him yet, right?

306
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,600
I haven't met him too.

307
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,760
I want to go too.

308
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,080
You too?

309
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,170
Alright.

310
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,610
You are everywhere.

311
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,200
Guys!

312
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,410
Have you heard that?

313
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,800
Japanese warriors set fire to a dormitory building and a warehouse

314
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,720
in Huaxi Cotton Machinery Factory.

315
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,800
Seven workers and a child

316
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,000
died in the fire.

317
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,320
The Japanese COC shelters the murderer publicly.

318
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,080
The workers and businessmen

319
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
set strikes everywhere outside now.

320
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,880
Students marched on the street,

321
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,240
demanding the government to punish the murderers severely

322
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,880
and give the deceased a fair result.

323
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
No way!

324
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Why not?

325
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,440
The Japanese have always

326
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,040
been so arrogant and domineering.

327
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,120
Commander Zhang

328
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,890
won't let Japanese go wild.

329
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Commander Zhang?

330
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,360
It's been over

331
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,960
12 hours from that happened.

332
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,690
If Commander Zhang is as tough as you said,

333
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,440
why did he not respond at all?

334
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,100
Every school is on strike.

335
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
Should we do something?

336
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,960
Our school is military academy.

337
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,320
We are different from them.

338
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Do you think Sergeant Lv

339
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,720
would allow us to parade?

340
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,240
Who cares if he agrees

341
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,360
or not at this time?

342
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,360
Junshan,

343
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,020
does this factory belong to your family?

344
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,640
Ask for a leave for me.

345
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,560
I need to go back home.

346
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
Okay, take care.

347
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,240
Handover!

348
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,010
Take it away.

349
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,760
Go!

350
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,970
Hurry up!

351
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,320
Go!

352
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,040
Let's go!

353
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Come out and look!

354
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,160
The marching students attacked the Japanese COC

355
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,560
and caught the murderer.

356
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,600
The police dispersed the students.

357
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,000
They caught four leaders

358
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,520
and kept them in Chengnan Prison.

359
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,160
And they sent the three murderers

360
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,090
to our school and asked Sergeant Lv

361
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,480
to watch them for the reason that

362
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,160
What are you fooling around for?

363
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,440
they couldn't keep Japanese

364
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,240
and radical students together.

365
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,200
You said the police caught students?

366
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
They dare not to do anything to them.

367
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,640
They will be released in a few days.

368
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,960
What about the Japanese?

369
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,600
I don't know.

370
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,920
They may wait for trial.

371
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
What trial?

372
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,680
There are many people who saw them set the fire.

373
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,040
They should be killed directly.

374
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Killed directly?

375
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,120
That's too easy for them.

376
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,410
They killed eight Chinese.

377
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,640
They should suffer more.

378
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,720
If the government really dares to kill them,

379
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,530
why did they send them to us?

380
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,330
They just transferred the pressure to the military.

381
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,800
And it's obvious that

382
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,570
Mayor Bai doesn't want to deal with this trouble.

383
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,840
What a weasel!

384
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,600
Maybe they just wanted to keep them for a few days,

385
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,840
and when the news is over,

386
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,040
they will send them back respectfully.

387
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,880
Shall we just watch them

388
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,040
killed eight of us

389
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,520
and walk out safe and sound?

390
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,120
Impossible!

391
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Yanlin,

392
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,560
you should ask Commander Zhang

393
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,450
or Mayor Bai this question.

394
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,900
Then what should we do?

395
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,360
Shall we watch them

396
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,640
be kept for just a few days

397
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,700
and released then?

398
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,520
Listen,

399
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,240
don't step in when they're going

400
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,820
to do something later.

401
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,400
Why?

402
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,320
What can those idiots do?

403
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,250
Every man has a duty to his country.

404
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
Moreover, we are reserve soldiers.

405
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,280
Is that clear?

406
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,440
What?

407
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,880
Are you looking for trouble here

408
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,360
in such a small figure?

409
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,780
Who did you say?

410
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,760
We can discuss about

411
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,960
this question later.

412
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,200
Discuss what?

413
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,200
They have been sent to us.

414
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,360
Their destiny

415
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,920
is up to us.

416
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,960
We can still

417
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,520
do it secretly.

418
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,160
Yes.

419
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,320
We can kill

420
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,600
them tonight secretly.

421
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,920
Yes! We can kill them!

422
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,160
Are you crazy?

423
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,600
You are a soldier now.

424
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,440
Do you want to be sentenced to death

425
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,600
if you don't obey orders

426
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,200
and act without permission?

427
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,960
Tell them to keep an eye on Li Wenzhong

428
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,560
in case that he gives us away.

429
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,160
You're smart.

430
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,600
Sure.

431
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,320
In this world,

432
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
besides burning, drowning,

433
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
bombing and stabbing,

434
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
there is another way of death

435
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,720
called sudden death of disease.

436
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,160
Our prison is wet, cold,

437
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
dirty and smelly.

438
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,400
It's normal for those

439
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
Japanese people

440
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,560
to get sick.

441
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,920
It's so easy for them.

442
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,600
Let's cheer up

443
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,560
and serve these guys well.

444
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,120
Yes,

445
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,520
treat them "well".

446
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,560
Enough.

447
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,520
It's no use saying that now.

448
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,440
We don't know what the leadership's idea is yet.

449
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,770
What if Commander Zhang

450
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,540
wants to judge them in public?

451
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,240
Am I right?

452
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,280
Impossible.

453
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,320
Jiaozhou Bay in Shandong is withdrawing troops now.

454
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,840
The government in Peking is negotiating with Japan.

455
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,440
Do you think Commander Zhang

456
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,960
dares to judge them in public

457
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
at this crucial time?

458
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,880
It's better to

459
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,200
count on Shen Junshan's brother

460
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,960
to blow up the Japanese COC at night

461
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,800
than on them.

462
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
That's feasible.

463
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,120
Stop talking, Sergeant Song is coming.

464
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,360
What are you gathering here for?

465
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,800
Do you have nothing to do?

466
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,440
Dismiss!

467
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,520
Gu Yanzhen!

468
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,840
Someone wants to see you!

469
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,740
Xie Liangchen.

470
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,200
Do you remember what I told you?

471
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,760
Yes.

472
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,620
I'll go out now.

473
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,000
Fatty.

474
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,680
What's wrong?

475
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,000
Yanzhen,

476
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,920
there is a bad thing.

477
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,360
Was it you

478
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,460
who said our poems were terrible?

479
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,120
I said it,

480
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,640
but you did this.

481
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,080
Stop talking.

482
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,600
Now all the people are here.

483
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,330
Let's start.

484
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,880
When will the autumn at lakeside make the moon full

485
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,400
Sleeping beside the Chu River makes the old dream again

486
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,840
The cranes and the white clouds are becoming dimly

487
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,300
The song and the water recalled the past time

488
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,810
That's my notebook!

489
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,980
You stole my poems!

490
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,800
Is it yours because you said it?

491
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,840
Shame on you!

492
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,360
Beat them!

493
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,480
Gu Qiqi.

494
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,400
What's going on?

495
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,960
Yanzhen?

496
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,480
Why are you here?

497
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,640
You get reinforcements?

498
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,280
What?

499
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,320
What are you doing?

500
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,560
We are well-educated.

501
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Don't fight if we can talk.

502
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't preach me here.

503
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,880
I'm not afraid of you.

504
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,080
Bastard.

505
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,880
Say it again.

506
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,120
Bastard!

507
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,920
Charge!

508
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,600
Move away!

509
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,760
Let me do this!

510
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,200
How dare you

511
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,680
to fight now?

512
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
This can't be tolerated.

513
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,090
I'm fighting for honor.

514
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,440
You can talk books away now?

515
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,840
Yanzhen,

516
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,640
I learned these from you.

517
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,540
Why didn't you learn from my virtues?

518
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,760
Virtues?

519
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,970
Do you have this kind of things?

520
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,560
Yanzhen,

521
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,760
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

522
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,400
Yanzhen,

523
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,320
You are handsome,

524
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,520
graceful, mature and steady.

525
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,650
You are just a model for our younger generation to learn.

526
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,160
To be honest,

527
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,440
when will you go back home?

528
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,520
I don't get out of school usually.

529
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,280
School?

530
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
It has been so long from school started.

531
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,600
Why haven't you been expelled?

532
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,860
What a strange school.

533
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,760
Gu Qiqi,

534
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,760
I think you're really looking for death today.

535
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:19,880
No,

536
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,240
I'm caring about you.

537
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,840
Come on.

538
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,960
Look at yourself.

539
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,000
Can you survive if you go back

540
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,720
home like this?

541
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,760
Don't bother.

542
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,940
Dad went Peking for a meeting.

543
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
Mom accompanied aunt to Nanyuan again.

544
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,160
They won't come back

545
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,480
in the next ten days.

546
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,160
No wonder

547
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,280
you are so bold.

548
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,520
This is call well-prepared.

549
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,840
Always make a plan.

550
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,570
I don't understand.

551
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,680
You don't want to be limited by our parents.

552
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,000
But why did you insist

553
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
on coming to Shunyuan with me?

554
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,440
You will be free in Peking alone.

555
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,640
That's different.

556
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,680
Look,

557
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,320
you all came to Shunyuan.

558
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,360
I don't wanna be alone in Peking.

559
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,400
Sir.

560
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Yanzhen,

561
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,600
my driver is here.

562
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,000
I need to go back now.

563
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,000
Just go, bye.

564
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,480
How about this?

565
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,880
I can take Qiqi back home.

566
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,920
It's still far,

567
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,480
right?

568
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,440
You just go.

569
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,880
Let's go.

570
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,710
Get on the car.

571
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,600
Be frank.

572
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,760
I see.

573
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,840
One.

574
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,230
One.

575
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,230
Two.

576
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,760
Two.

577
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,150
One.

578
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,670
One.

579
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,710
Two.

580
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
Two.

581
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,840
You didn't want to sleep. Right?

582
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,200
Since you are so energetic,

583
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,680
I can help you.

584
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,680
One.

585
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,760
One.

586
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,840
Two.

587
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,320
Two.

588
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,760
One.

589
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,080
Gu Yanzhen.

590
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,720
Do you want to join us?

591
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,600
No, no.

592
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,760
What are you

593
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,520
looking at?

594
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,960
Move on!

595
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,680
One.

596
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,920
Two.

597
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,760
One.

598
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,720
Two.

599
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,680
One.

600
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,240
Two.

601
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,060
Why are they punished?

602
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,080
Didn't you guess it all?

603
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,720
Because of the Japanese

604
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,120
who are kept here. Right?

605
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,600
Why didn't you join them?

606
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,450
You said I shouldn't go.

607
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,660
You are so obedient this time.

608
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,240
I'm not obedient.

609
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,040
I have my own judgement.

610
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,810
And Shen Junshan didn't join them either.

611
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,000
What does it matter

612
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,660
to you whether he joins or not?

613
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,920
If he didn't, then there should be something strange.

614
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,680
I don't understand.

615
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,080
Why do you trust him so much?

616
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,200
And

617
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,560
I said they are unreliable too.

618
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,820
Why don't you trust me?

619
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,610
You are more unreliable than them.

620
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,920
Shen Junshan is the only one who is reliable.

621
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,440
Yes.

622
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,120
He is far smarted than you and them.

623
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
What made you think he is smarter than me?

624
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,240
Go away.

625
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,400
Wait,

626
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,760
can you wear something in the dormitory?

627
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,440
Do you know the

628
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
basic difference between human and animal?

629
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,840
It's that human wear clothes.

630
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,640
Walking around here

631
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,760
with upper body naked all day.

632
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,490
Is there any difference between you and animals?

633
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,160
I'm a man. What's wrong with it?

634
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,360
Besides,

635
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,200
naked?

636
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,980
Aren't these clothes?

637
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,600
Come on.

638
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,200
Let me show you what naked means.

639
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,920
Bastard.

640
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,720
What are you going to do?

641
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,450
Wash my face!

642
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,640
Haven't you washed once?

643
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,770
I want to wash again!

644
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,530
He must have been fascinated by my figure.

645
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,200
Good morning!

646
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,860
Did you sleep well last night?

647
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,920
It's late.

648
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,400
If you come one minute later,

649
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
you don't need to take this class.

650
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,330
You can go to take shower directly.

651
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,330
Have you heard that?

652
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,010
Zhu Yanlin sneaked into

653
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,600
the detention room where the Japanese were

654
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,130
and was discovered by Sergeant Lv last night.

655
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,650
I heard them cry and howl for all night.

656
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,540
It was not difficult to know that.

657
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,530
He seemed to be caught when he was stealing

658
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,330
from the warehouse.

659
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,200
I'm wondering what he wanted to steal.

660
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,800
Maybe he wanted some poisons

661
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,130
to poison those Japanese to death.

662
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,340
That's why we called them idiots.

663
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,930
The Japanese were already in the detention room.

664
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,200
Even a nail clipper

665
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,170
can kill them if you want to.

666
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,200
They still

667
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,040
went to steal poison.

668
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
If it's that easy,

669
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,920
why don't you do this?

670
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,380
I really got a plan.

671
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,040
Do you want to join me?

672
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,840
What plan?

673
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,720
Tell me.

674
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,440
Liangchen,

675
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,260
have you delivered Sergeant Guo's meal?

676
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,580
Where is my egg?

677
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,360
Not me.

678
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,440
You're sitting on my seat.

679
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,920
You ate my egg and

680
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,850
didn't admit it.

681
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,840
Did you see me eat you egg?

682
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,640
Yes, I saw you!

683
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
I should gouge your eyes out.

684
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,140
Why don't you eat this too?

685
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,400
Have you finished it?

686
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,240
Shen Junshan,

687
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,360
are you interested

688
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
in my plan?

689
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,480
It seems that he isn't.

690
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,480
He always put on a bad face

691
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,520
like a pervert.

692
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
What did you say?

693
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,180
None of your business.

694
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,360
Gu Yanzhen.

695
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,440
What?

696
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,160
What's your plan?

697
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm quite interested in it.

698
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I want to join you.

699
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,860
But I'm not interested in you.

700
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,160
Gu Yanzhen,

701
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,680
take me with you.

702
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,480
If it was not because that Zhu Yanlin

703
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
didn't call on me,

704
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,820
I would have done it with them last night.

705
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,960
Yes,

706
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,200
it's a pity

707
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,970
that you weren't

708
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,680
punished together with them last night.

709
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,440
Idiot.

710
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,480
What plan?

711
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,960
The plan to trick the Japanese.

712
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,930
You should keep it a secret.

713
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,050
Why don't you say it louder?

714
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,860
Huang Song.

715
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,320
Huang Song, how about it?

716
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,200
Go on.

717
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,400
Keep going on.

718
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,450
What's this?

719
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,880
That's itchy!

720
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
So itchy!

721
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,840
That's itchy!

722
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Watch out!

723
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,720
Sorry.

724
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,480
I'm sorry.

725
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,600
Get up!

726
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,610
It's time to eat.

727
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,720
Meals! Hurry up!

728
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,840
It's time to eat.

729
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
Drink it, quickly.

730
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,160
Let me have a drink.

731
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,480
Me first! I can't bear it.

732
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,680
I'm the first!

733
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,000
That hurts! I can't bear it too.

734
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,290
You naughty boy!

735
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,760
I can't bear it too.
