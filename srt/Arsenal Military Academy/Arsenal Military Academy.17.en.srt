Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 17

4
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,479
When do we go to court?

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
That's not up to us.

6
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,039
In three to five days at least.

7
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,759
In three to five months if you're lucky.

8
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,620
It could be one or two years later.

9
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,880
Calm down.

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,479
You...you flunky!

11
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
Flunky, traitor!

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,420
Let us out! Shut up!

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
I don't care that you arrested them.

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,640
But can you please tell me

15
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,440
why we are also detained?

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,640
Don't you know why?

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,560
I have nothing to do with it.

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,170
And I don't know any of them.

19
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,630
I was in my home

20
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,030
when they broke in and made a mess.

21
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,160
None of my business.

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,320
You sure

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,680
you have nothing to do with it?

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,410
Pretty sure.

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
And you're not involved?

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,360
No.

27
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,240
You know

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,200
none of them?

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,040
None.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Do you know him?

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,400
No at all.

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,040
Chief.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,360
Chief.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,760
What's wrong?

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,620
I got the truth.

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
This guy

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,060
is probably their leader.

38
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,200
They all protect him.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,680
What did you say?

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,600
They claimed that they didn't know him.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,480
and urged us to let him go.

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,450
They gave the game away so fast.

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
Such a bunch of rookies!

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,680
Separate him

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,160
with the others.

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,440
And interrogate him in private.

47
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes, Sir.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,300
You two, come here.

49
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,020
Take him away.

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,320
Let him go!

51
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,940
We said we didn't know him.

52
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,640
Don't worry.

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,000
Trust me.

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,520
Cut the craps! Get out.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,200
Go.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,440
Song Maogong, right? Go.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Gu Yanzhen.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Gu Yanzhen.

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,320
Miss Oda.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Song Maogong.

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,760
How are you doing?

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,720
It's late.

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,520
Can I help you?

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,010
I think you know well

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
why I come here.

66
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,390
You ruined my plan today.

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,280
Are you saying that

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,680
you want someone in here?

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
The authority

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
knew that a bunch of students were coming back.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,160
So, they let me keep a close eye on them.

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,400
I want them dead.

73
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,600
Miss Oda,

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,840
they are just a bunch of

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,920
ignorant students.

76
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,120
If you think it's inappropriate,

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
I can lock them up,

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,520
until the treaty is signed.

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,940
Dealing opium, selling intelligence, trafficking in human.

80
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,000
How many people have died

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,680
because of you these years?

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,180
If not 1000, then 800 at least.

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,480
What's wrong?

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,500
After all the bloody things you've done,

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,180
now you decide to show your mercy?

86
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,360
Within 24 hours,

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,560
I want them all dead.

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,240
You want to spare anyone's life?

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Trade it with one of your families'.

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,360
Help!

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
My stomach aches.

92
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
Somebody help me.

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
Shut up!

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
So annoying!

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
My stomach aches.

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,120
I want to...

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,200
I want to...

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,040
go to bathroom.

99
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,720
Go to bathroom?

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Do it in your cell.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,260
What are you thinking?

102
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,840
What now?

103
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,800
Come on.

104
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,120
Take this.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,460
Let me go to the bathroom, please.

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,320
Clever boy!

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,000
Be quick.

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,880
Thank you.

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,960
Sorry.

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,880
We dragged you into this.

111
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,570
It's none of your business.

112
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,560
But why are you hunted?

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,660
We heard about the Twenty-one Treaty

114
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,240
when in Japan.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,260
Everyone was furious.

116
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
We thought

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,600
we should stand out at such a critical juncture

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
to show our stance

119
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,480
against the treaty.

120
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,840
So we came back

121
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,120
to organize demonstrations

122
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,720
to appeal to the government.

123
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,290
You were locked up here once you came back.

124
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,940
It seems that someone wants you to be silent.

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,330
We knew there would be troubles

126
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,360
before we came back.

127
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,930
There were over 100 of us

128
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,280
back in Japan.

129
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,120
But our tracks were exposed,

130
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,850
many classmates failed to get on the ship.

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Plus the setback in Guangzhou,

132
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,610
there are just us to be left now.

133
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,740
And now we're here.

134
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,570
But compared with those being killed,

135
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,560
we're lucky enough.

136
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
It's a tough time.

137
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,010
Our country is weak.

138
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,800
The foreign powers want to colonize us.

139
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,480
To wake up the people,

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,900
there will be sacrifices.

141
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,980
Before we started out,

142
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
we all signed blood letters to show our stance.

143
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
We reach our goal or die.

144
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,280
Now I hope

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,049
that they didn't sacrifice

146
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,000
for nothing.

147
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,970
What is this?

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,360
Something far more important than my life.

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,600
It's me.

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,660
How did you get out?

151
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,000
I got the keys.

152
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,240
Try them out.

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,130
No. Not this one.

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,780
Someone's coming.

155
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,360
Gu Yanzhen, you go first.

156
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,360
Wait.

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,840
Go. Get out of here.

158
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,010
You get out first. Then you can save us.

159
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,880
Hurry.

160
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,840
Leave now.

161
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,770
What did you say?

162
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,840
The ancestral house is destroyed.

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,570
And they took the young master.

164
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,880
Song Maogong! How dare you

165
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,640
touch my son!

166
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,770
He might not know young master was one of them.

167
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,000
Master,

168
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,240
Song Maogong has no mercy.

169
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,010
And he colludes with the Japanese.

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm worried that he will kill them

171
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,730
under the command of the Japanese.

172
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,840
Now,

173
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
get Yanzhen back for me.

174
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,480
Yes, master.

175
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,160
Wait.

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
I'll go by myself.

177
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,000
My clothes. Be quick.

178
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Welcome.

179
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,000
Vice Minister Gu,

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
please let me explain.

181
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,600
Please.

182
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
Vice Minister, about this...

183
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Chief, let us out. Chief.

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,700
Let me explain.

185
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,820
Vice Minister,

186
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,880
Gu Zongtang.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,640
Open it.

188
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,320
Yanzhen.

189
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,240
Yanzhen.

190
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,560
Vice Minister, look.

191
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,880
Your son is not here.

192
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,880
Master,

193
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,880
he's not here.

194
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,840
Chief Song.

195
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,080
Yes, Sir.

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,160
He's my only son,

197
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,500
the treasure of the whole family.

198
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,000
Sure he is. I understand.

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,640
So,

200
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
if anything

201
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,800
happens to him...

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,520
Your son is blessed.

203
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm sure he'll lead a long and happy life.

204
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Make sure of that.

205
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,360
Master,

206
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,880
young master is back.

207
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,280
Go.

208
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,800
Dad, you're back.

209
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,250
Help me get my...

210
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,520
Insolent boy!

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,330
What are you going to do?

212
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,610
Are you looking for more troubles?

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,160
I don't understand.

214
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,400
Do you know

215
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,600
who these people are?

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,770
You'll get yourself killed

217
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,490
by fraternizing with them.

218
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,720
They are patriotic students

219
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,760
who want to save the country.

220
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,520
Patriotic students?

221
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,640
To me,

222
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,440
they are idiots who made things more complicated.

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,360
The government will take care of the fate of our nation.

224
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Who give you innocent students

225
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,480
the right to get involved

226
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,810
into national affairs?

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,320
Nonsense.

228
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,560
Utterly nonsense.

229
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,500
Damned congress and government.

230
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,780
They can't even tolerate a few outspoken students.

231
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
A government without a spine

232
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
should be toppled.

233
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,400
Mr. Gu,

234
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,900
don't say that.

235
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,010
You won't save them.

236
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,840
I will.

237
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,850
How dare you!

238
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,720
Stop.

239
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Master, please stop.

240
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,640
Get out of the way.

241
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,700
Hold your impulse.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,280
Master, don't do that.

243
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
Be careful.

244
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,760
Mr. Zhu,

245
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,960
now,

246
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,040
buy the latest ticket to Nanjing

247
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,770
and take Yanzhen back with you.

248
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,920
Master,

249
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,980
in such a hurry?

250
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,300
Under the current situation,

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,260
I may not survive this.

252
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,200
Nevertheless,

253
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,740
I have to get my son out of this.

254
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,760
Zhu.

255
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,960
Master.

256
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,580
Take care of him for me.

257
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,580
I will, Master.

258
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,640
Master,

259
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
you wake up.

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,200
Where are we?

261
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,640
You father asked me to take you back to Nanjing.

262
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,600
Master,

263
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
where are you going?

264
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,410
I'm going back to save them.

265
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,160
Master,

266
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,760
why can't you be reasonable?

267
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Do you know what kind of

268
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,460
trouble are you in?

269
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,720
Your father went to the prison

270
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,050
in person to get you out.

271
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,640
Someone may

272
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,280
use it to undermine him.

273
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,740
Who dares to voice against

274
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,780
the Twenty-one Treaty

275
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,600
at such a critical juncture?

276
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,080
Now that you got involved with

277
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,680
those students' scheme.

278
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,080
You put your father in dilemma.

279
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,400
He sent you away

280
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,040
to protect you.

281
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,960
Don't you understand?

282
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,140
As for those students,

283
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,890
don't worry about them.

284
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,090
Now all the eyes are fixed on

285
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,040
the significance of the incident.

286
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,240
Nobody pays attention to the students.

287
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,520
I guess

288
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,540
they'll be released in a few days.

289
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,680
The Japanese openly

290
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,880
broke into private property

291
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,410
and killed those students.

292
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,480
Who knows

293
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,820
what will happen to the students held in prison?

294
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,840
Master,

295
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,580
no matter what you say,

296
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,589
I won't let you out.

297
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,890
Don't let Mr. Gu get out.

298
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,520
Yes.

299
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,480
Let go!

300
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,030
Let go! I said we didn't know him. Let go!

301
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,880
Don't worry.

302
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,040
Believe me.

303
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,440
Gu Yanzhen, you go first.

304
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,400
Not this one.

305
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,320
Go. Get out of here.

306
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,810
You have to go to save us.

307
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,520
Chief.

308
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
everything is ready.

309
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Get the students out into the truck.

310
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes.

311
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,640
I want them all dead.

312
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,340
You want to spare someone's life?

313
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Trade it with one of your families'.

314
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,640
Hurry.

315
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,760
Chief,

316
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,040
they're here.

317
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,160
Hurry.

318
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,120
Move it.

319
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,800
Hurry.

320
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
Don't dawdle over it.

321
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Go.

322
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Chief,

323
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
should we

324
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,400
get them to the old spot?

325
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,490
Is this what you should ask?

326
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
Be alert.

327
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,200
Don't get anything wrong.

328
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,730
Yes, Sir.

329
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,720
Where are they taking us?

330
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,960
We've probably been out of the city.

331
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,440
Are they going to kill us?

332
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,040
Hard to say.

333
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,860
They might just

334
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,560
want to keep us detained

335
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,000
in a secret location

336
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,530
until the treaty is signed.

337
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,970
They might follow someone's order

338
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,880
and want to kill us

339
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,490
without startling anyone.

340
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Follow order?

341
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,960
Who wants to kill us?

342
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
A lot of people do.

343
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,540
The capitulators,

344
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,650
or the Japanese.

345
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,600
What should we do?

346
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,960
Be quiet.

347
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Why do we stop?

348
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,300
Get off and check out.

349
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,370
Don't try to escape.

350
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,300
Is this the place where we'll be killed?

351
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,160
Xianwei,

352
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
what should we do?

353
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,200
I don't regret to sacrifice for my country.

354
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,100
Let the wind take my soul home.

355
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,320
We've been

356
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,220
preparing for today long ago.

357
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,560
I...

358
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,100
But...

359
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,960
But I don't want to die.

360
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,400
Chief,

361
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,360
the fallen rocks block the road.

362
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,320
Once we clear them,

363
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,580
we can pass right away.

364
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,560
Then do it.

365
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,440
Yes.

366
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,280
Guys,

367
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,610
let's go clear the road.

368
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,200
Now.

369
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,160
Some of you stay to watch them.

370
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,960
The others follow me.

371
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,600
Hurry up.

372
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,160
You guys

373
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,620
stay put and don't mess up with me.

374
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,320
Don't get yourselves into trouble.

375
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,650
Where are you taking us?

376
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,440
It's not what you should ask.

377
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,320
Don't ask.

378
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,600
You'll know

379
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,080
when we get there.

380
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,370
Are...are you going to kill us?

381
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,100
If I am going to,

382
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,680
what will you do?

383
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,960
I...

384
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,780
My father is Chen Ruchang,

385
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,100
the headmaster of Longbei Primary School.

386
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,960
If you kill me,

387
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,260
my families won't let you get away with this.

388
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Well, look at you.

389
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,360
You all scare me with your fathers.

390
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,400
Now a headmaster

391
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,650
won't let me get away with this.

392
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
I really want to see

393
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,960
what he's going to do with me.

394
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,680
Chief Song.

395
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,080
As the handler of Peking,

396
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,810
you must be busy with

397
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,100
things concerning to

398
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,720
the fate of our country.

399
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
So forget about what he said.

400
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
He didn't mean it.

401
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,100
I apologize to you for him.

402
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,800
We're just students.

403
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,610
We'll follow your command.

404
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,920
You can take us

405
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,020
wherever you want.

406
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,440
It seems you're smart.

407
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,840
So,

408
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,290
I'm taking you to grave.

409
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,640
Will you follow it and die?

410
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,560
You're the Sheriff of Peking

411
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,440
who's in charge of Peking's security

412
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,840
and protects the people.

413
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,960
To us, you're like a parent.

414
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,660
We're nothing but poor students.

415
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,180
And we never do bad things.

416
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,960
Though what we did this time is ill-considered,

417
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,840
I believe

418
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,720
that you won't hurt us.

419
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,680
Chief,

420
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
the rocks have been cleared.

421
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,440
We can go now.

422
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,720
Run!

423
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,690
Lin Xianwei.

424
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,920
Xianwei.

425
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,850
Keep the blood letter safe.

426
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,760
Mr. Chen.

427
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,360
Chen Rong.

428
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,160
Go to hell.

429
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,400
Mr. Chen.

430
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,320
Chen Rong.

431
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,970
Chen Rong. Mr. Chen.

432
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,130
Lin Xianwei.

433
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,830
Lin Xianwei.

434
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,610
Are you alright?

435
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,000
I laugh

436
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,360
in front of

437
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,920
the blade.

438
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,360
However,

439
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,560
the patriotism

440
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,000
never dies.

441
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,290
Lin Xianwei.

442
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,080
Lin Xianwei.

443
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
Lin Xianwei.

444
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,940
You've done your best.

445
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,760
Yanzhen.

446
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
How could you

447
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
disobey your father for this woman?

448
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,440
If Song Maogong died,

449
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,320
the police station won't let it go.

450
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,800
They'll look into it.

451
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,760
With her by your side,

452
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
do you know what's the consequence?

453
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,800
If you don't care about me,

454
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,760
then think about her.

455
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Do you know that

456
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
you'll get her whole family killed?

457
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,040
You punk!

458
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,760
What should I do?

459
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,640
Give her to me.

460
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,560
I'll send someone to

461
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,280
escort her home safe and sound.

462
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,000
As for you,

463
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,120
you must leave with Mr. Zhu

464
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,920
for Nanjing.

465
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,900
And from now on,

466
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,760
stay out of this.

467
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,020
The police station...

468
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,620
I'll take care of them.

469
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,280
OK.

470
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I'll do as you said

471
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,520
Xiang.

472
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,460
Xiang, you wake up.

473
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,880
Xiang.

474
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,360
Where did you go?

475
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,040
Who were those people

476
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
who sent you back?

477
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,290
Why is there blood on your clothes?

478
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,080
What happened?

479
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,920
Tell me.

480
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,080
Xiang.

481
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,120
talk to me.

482
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,760
Tell me.

483
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,760
Xiang.

484
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,200
talk to me.

485
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,680
Keep the blood letter safe.

486
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,810
Chen Rong. Mr. Chen.

487
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,800
Mr. Chen.

488
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,200
Lin Xianwei.

489
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Lin Xianwei.

490
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
No Twenty-one Treaty!

491
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,900
No Twenty-one Treaty!

492
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,200
No unfair treaties!

493
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,760
Japanese troops out of Qingdao!

494
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,640
No Twenty-one Treaty!

495
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,120
No unfair treaties!

496
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,190
Japanese troops out of Qingdao!

497
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,760
No Twenty-one Treaty!

498
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,400
No unfair treaties!

499
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,600
No unfair treaties!

500
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,230
No Twenty-one Treaty!

501
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,080
No unfair treaties!

502
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,600
Japanese troops out of Qingdao!

503
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,840
No Twenty-one Treaty!

504
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,760
No unfair treaties!

505
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,200
Japanese troops out of Qingdao!

506
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,560
No Twenty-one Treaty!

507
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,200
Beat them.

508
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,440
Do it!

509
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,370
- No Twenty-one Treaty! - Hit them.

510
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,820
What are you doing?

511
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,180
No Twenty-one Treaty!

512
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,800
Open it.

513
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,760
Which one?

514
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,080
Well, that one.

515
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,120
The one in skirt.

516
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,680
Get out.

517
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,600
Xie Xiang.

518
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,120
Get out.

519
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,760
Are you hurt?

520
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,720
Let's go.

521
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,320
Let's go home.

522
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,560
Are you crazy?

523
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,160
How dare you demonstrate

524
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,440
with those students?

525
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,920
What did you learn

526
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,600
while you were in Fang'an?

527
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,290
You're not going anywhere.

528
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,080
Just stay in Peking.

529
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,800
No.

530
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,040
I'm going back.

531
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:58,920
You...

532
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,280
Xiang. Xiang.

533
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,280
You have to think for me.

534
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,920
Your brother has gone.

535
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,160
Don't make me heart-broken again.

536
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,240
From tomorrow on,

537
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,520
she's not allowed to go out.

538
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,120
She must stay at home.

539
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,420
All right. It'll be OK.

540
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,440
Xiang,

541
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,220
one day, you'll understand.

542
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,480
Someone has to do these things.

543
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,580
Though we may not succeed,

544
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,100
or it might does no good to the situation,

545
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
it has to be done.

546
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,280
Wire can cut a wood in half.

547
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,800
Dripping water can wear through a stone.

548
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,480
Every great success

549
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,280
is achieved step by step.

550
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,220
As long as we don't give up,

551
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
one day,

552
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,200
we'll make it.

553
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,240
Xiang,

554
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,680
why does your brother look gloomy today?

555
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Who knows?

556
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,480
Maybe Dad scolded him.

557
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,100
Where is the old Mr. Gu?

558
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,040
And Zongtang?

559
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,490
Master is in Peking.

560
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,840
He might not come back for the Spring Festival.

561
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
What is it?

562
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,640
The Japanese envoy proposed the Twenty-one Treaty,

563
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,840
aiming at taking over all German privileges in Shandong.

564
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,450
Recently, Peking is

565
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,440
in chaos.

566
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,600
Students all go on street to demonstrate.

567
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,680
Master is part of the negotiation delegation.

568
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,940
He can't avoid the duty

569
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
in a short time.

570
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,960
It's just a proposal.

571
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,720
We haven't signed it.

572
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,100
There's never a treaty

573
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,980
of such national betrayal and humiliation.

574
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,880
If there are no voice against it,

575
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,250
I think our nation will really perish.

576
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,560
Let's call it a day.

577
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,480
Mr. Gu is right.

578
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,760
What's Zongtang's opinion?

579
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,840
Of course he opposes to it.

580
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,940
But in current situation,

581
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,080
he can't reverse it

582
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,920
on his own.

583
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,400
The government wants to convince foreign powers,

584
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,530
such as Britain and America, to give Japanese pressure.

585
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,720
But since Japan has proposed such terms,

586
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,090
they're prepared for objections.

587
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,320
People are talking.

588
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,960
The nation is ignited.

589
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,040
Students, merchants and civilians

590
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,240
are joining the demonstration.

591
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,440
They protest in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs each day.

592
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,120
Anyway,

593
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,320
it's a mess now.

594
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,560
Now the situation is not clear.

595
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,540
Keep it under control,

596
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,520
especially the school.

597
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,040
Don't let the young students

598
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,360
do anything irrational.

599
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,840
Keep them safe.

600
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,880
Yes.

601
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,760
How is it going with the students coming back from Japan

602
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,850
that Yanzhen talked about?

603
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,840
Sir,

604
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,760
I've sent someone.

605
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,760
Those students were held by the police

606
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,690
in a secret facility in the suburb.

607
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,640
Mr. Gu already talked to Chief Song.

608
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,760
He can let them out.

609
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,280
But they have to go back to Japan immediately.

610
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,610
They can't stay at home.

611
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,800
As for

612
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,120
those who've died,

613
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
we can do nothing.

614
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,800
In current situation,

615
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,660
these things can't be put on the negotiation table.

616
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,520
Otherwise,

617
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,720
it will trigger greater uproar.

618
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,890
Bury them decently.

619
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,080
They are all patriotic lads.

620
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,600
If these things happen again,

621
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,780
even without those invaders,

622
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,920
we'll lose

623
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,400
the people's support

624
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,880
by ourselves.

625
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,640
Yes.

626
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
And Song Maogong?

627
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,680
He's dead.

628
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,380
Anyone who was involved into this

629
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,160
won't get away with it.

630
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,730
The country is faced with a crisis.

631
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,960
People are suffering.

632
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,480
Who are presenting in

633
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,200
this negotiation?

634
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,240
Quite a lot.

635
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,840
But few of them can make a difference.

636
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,600
Lu Zhengxiang, the Foreign Minister.

637
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,160
and Cao Rulin, the Vice Minister.

638
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,090
are all present.

639
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,600
The treaty is so humiliating for the nation.

640
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,840
Whoever signs it

641
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,800
will be a traitor to the country.
