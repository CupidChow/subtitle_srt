00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:28,460
Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,460
Episode 34

4
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,300
Liangchen.

5
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,180
Does she have a boyfriend?

6
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,920
I don,t think so.

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,000
That,s good.

8
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,880
I intend to court her.

9
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,160
What? What did you say?

10
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,920
I said

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
I intended to court her.

12
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,320
You only met her once.

13
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
How can you have the thought?

14
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,480
Once?

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, that,s right.

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,880
But I don,t know why

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,100
I feel very familiar with her.

18
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,680
It seems I have known her for a long time.

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
Maybe it,s fate.

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,260
Liangchen.

21
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,400
You tell me.

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
If I court her,

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
would she say yes?

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,900
How could I know it?

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,620
Liangchen.

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,280
Go on.

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,050
He already has a target,

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,810
and will not rush to you.

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Ji Jin.

30
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,860
What are you doing?

31
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,810
Yanzhen.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,770
Sorry for your sufferings.

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,760
But,

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,100
There are other fishes in the sea.

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,720
Though you have peculiar hobbies,

36
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,880
one day

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,750
you will find your predestined lover.

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,040
Don,t take it to heart.

39
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,840
Don,t be sad.

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,800
This way.

41
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,720
What the hell?

42
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
Why does Song come here?

43
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,520
We will know it when we get in.

44
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Hello, sir. Lay a bet?

45
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
This game is almost over.

46
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,530
It,s not fun.

47
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,400
Are there any games tonight?

48
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,880
Yes.

49
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Yellow Cricket against Iron Tower.

50
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,050
Yellow Cricket?

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
I guess you haven,t been here

52
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,180
for a long time.

53
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
He is new here.

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,580
Just one month.

55
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
Seven wins and three losses.

56
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,000
The odds are in his favor.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,530
People think highly of him.

58
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,720
Good! Beat him! Beat him!

59
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,360
Yes! Yes! Beat him!

60
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:56,960
Yes!

61
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,659
I bet on his win.

62
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,060
Take it.

63
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,480
OK.

64
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,760
Is Yellow Cricket Song?

65
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,090
Watch it and we,ll know.

66
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,080
Beat him!

67
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,120
One! Two! Three! Four!

68
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,640
Five! Six! Seven!

69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,880
Eight! Nine! Ten!

70
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,450
The winner is Iron Bull!

71
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,420
My friends!

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,480
The highlight tonight

73
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
is about to start!

74
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,600
The next match is

75
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,820
Yellow Cricket against Iron Tower!

76
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you wanna see it?

77
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,120
Yes!

78
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
Wanna see it?

79
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,720
Welcome

80
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,120
Yellow Cricket and Iron Tower to the stage!

81
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,040
Yellow Cricket!

82
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,680
Song!

83
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
Wait until he finishes it.

84
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,600
Yellow Cricket!

85
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,400
Iron Tower!

86
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:58,280
Yellow Cricket!

87
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,090
The first round!

88
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,840
Go!

89
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,520
Beat him! Beat him!

90
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
Beat him! Beat him!

91
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,960
Beat him!

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,730
We should go now.

93
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,240
Beat him! Beat him!

94
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,000
The winner is Yellow Cricket!

95
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Yellow Cricket!

96
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
We need to talk.

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,530
Please enjoy it.

98
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,360
Thank you.

99
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Why didn,t you tell us

100
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,040
about it?

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,660
It is useless to blame him now.

102
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,850
How is your brother?

103
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,960
He is out now.

104
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,680
But he is very weak.

105
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,060
I sent someone to rent a house and to take care of him.

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,130
He suffered so much.

107
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
He should recuperate for a period.

108
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,920
Recuperate?

109
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,800
My...

110
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,200
My sister told me

111
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,400
she saw him posting leaflets on the street days ago,

112
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
along with his classmates.

113
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,720
You are so silly.

114
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,280
You could die for saving him.

115
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,920
Now you still care about him.

116
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,420
You should care about yourself more.

117
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,100
Gambling is expressly forbidden by AMA.

118
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,570
You gambled on boxing in the black market!

119
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,720
With such great fanfare,

120
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,600
do you know the consequences?

121
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,720
You would be dismissed!

122
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,680
I have no way to go.

123
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,040
In order to get him out,

124
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,440
I borrowed money from Mr. Mu, the boss of boxing club.

125
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,900
Xiaohe was ill after that.

126
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,600
I borrowed him much money again.

127
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,530
All about Money.

128
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,240
Why didn't you tell us if you need money?

129
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,040
Why do you make money by this way?

130
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,640
You are ruining your future.

131
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
Do you know how many people die

132
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,540
from illegal boxing each year?

133
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,400
It,s suicide!

134
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,540
I didn,t think so much.

135
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
How much do you owe your boss?

136
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
I have returned him some.

137
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,500
I owe him one hundred yuan now.

138
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,800
It,s not much.

139
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
One hundred yuan?

140
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,660
Why didn,t you ask me for the money

141
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,260
but borrowed it from others?

142
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,920
I,ll give you the money. Pay it back.

143
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,850
And leave there.

144
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,960
No.

145
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,620
I signed the contract.

146
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,640
I have to fight for two years.

147
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,130
They have investigated me.

148
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,040
If I left in advance,

149
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,220
they would go to school to find me.

150
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,240
Two years?

151
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,660
You would be killed within two years!

152
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,280
There,ll be a way out.

153
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,250
We can,t wait for two years.

154
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,420
I will handle this.

155
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,520
Do you have any ideas?

156
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,560
Of course.

157
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,850
I am your Gu Yanzhen, right?

158
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,840
Well. It,s alright now.

159
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,450
Let,s go back to school.

160
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,160
If Lv knew it tomorrow,

161
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,780
we wouldn,t need to worry about Song.

162
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,720
We will have to pack up and leave the school.

163
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,280
Let,s go.

164
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,960
Let me finish my wonton.

165
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,650
Who is the person in charge?

166
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,180
Captain He.

167
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,020
Captain He.

168
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,240
What brings you here?

169
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,280
What can I do for you?

170
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,480
We received a tip-off

171
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,160
that Douwei Club ran illegal businesses.

172
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,720
Well.

173
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,760
You are ordered to stop business

174
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,890
for investigation.

175
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,040
No business is allowed until you receive the official notice.

176
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,600
But...

177
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,820
Captain He.

178
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,540
Douwei Club has been operated

179
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,070
for more than twenty years.

180
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,880
You know it.

181
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,210
Even the Lord Rong is our guest.

182
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,800
How could it be illegal?

183
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,660
Do you threaten me with Lord Rong?

184
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,000
Twenty years ago, the Qing emperor ruled the country,

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,930
and it was out of our jurisdiction.

186
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,040
But now the Police Station thinks your business is illegal.

187
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,170
The emperor is unable to intervene it.

188
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,520
Soldiers.

189
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Put the seals

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,200
and get the work done.

191
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,380
Captain He.

192
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
Could you give me a hint

193
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,080
whom we have offended?

194
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,240
Please tell me

195
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,480
and we,d plea for leniency.

196
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,980
Give you a hint?

197
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
It,s the business of high-ranked officials.

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,480
You and I can do nothing for it.

199
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,130
Notice your boss Mr. Mu now.

200
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,680
It would be a great loss of money

201
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,140
each day when it is closed.

202
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,050
Alright.

203
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,120
Thank you, Captain He.

204
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,320
Can I paste the seals?

205
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,840
Do it.

206
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,000
OK.

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,640
Soldiers.

208
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,120
Do it.

209
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,760
The Battle Drums Roar

210
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,520
As The Sun Sets Behind The Mount

211
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,000
Good! Good!

212
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,480
Battle Drums Roar

213
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,000
Mr. Mu.

214
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,090
You are here.

215
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,570
Has he arrived here?

216
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,320
Yes.

217
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,930
At the private box No.2.

218
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,960
Mr. Mu.

219
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,160
It,s an honor to meet you.

220
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
Sit.

221
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,400
Mr. Gu.

222
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,000
Forgive my rudeness.

223
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,920
But I can,t understand.

224
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
Did I offend you before?

225
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,760
Mr. Mu, it’s not serious.

226
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,940
I mean nothing to do it.

227
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,880
In fact, I need your help.

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,520
The way was kind of reckless.

229
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,720
I apologize for that.

230
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,240
My help?

231
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,080
I am curious now.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
You have beaten around the rush.

233
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,810
And you said you needed my help.

234
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,400
What is the matter then?

235
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,800
Mr. Mu.

236
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,700
Huang Song?

237
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,240
How come you are here?

238
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,280
You two...

239
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,610
Huang Song is my friend.

240
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,440
His family had a mishap days ago.

241
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,780
He sought your help

242
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,960
and you were so generous

243
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,760
to help him.

244
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,890
I really appreciate it.

245
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,400
He is from the AMA

246
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,520
but he fought in your club.

247
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
If it were learned by the AMA,

248
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,720
there would be a great trouble.

249
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,520
Mr. Mu.

250
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,280
I hope you can do me a favor

251
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,579
to release him.

252
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,329
As for the money he owes you,

253
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,990
I,ll double it to pay you.

254
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,880
Oh, I see.

255
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,200
Mr. Gu.

256
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,619
Can I say some words to him?

257
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,960
Huang.

258
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,440
When you came to me,

259
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,440
you said you needed money to save your brother.

260
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,800
I thought you were a man of great kindness.

261
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,520
So I lent you the money

262
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,800
without the mortgage of real estate

263
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,960
or the bondsman.

264
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,240
You were grateful for my help

265
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,340
so you voluntarily required to fight in the club

266
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,200
to pay off debt.

267
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
I,m not lying, am I?

268
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,560
No.

269
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,840
What Mr. Mu said is the truth.

270
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,560
The boxing club has its own rules.

271
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,640
And I have let you know the rules

272
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,200
before you were contracted.

273
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
You tell me now.

274
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
Did you sign the contract voluntarily?

275
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,680
Did anyone force you?

276
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,160
No.

277
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,280
Alright then.

278
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,140
There are rules in each industry.

279
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Since you were contracted voluntarily,

280
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
you are the man of my boxing club.

281
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,600
If you want to cancel the contract,

282
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,200
it,s fine.

283
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,250
You need to follow the rules

284
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,920
to fight for the life-and-death boxing.

285
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,050
Then I,ll let you go.

286
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,040
You know all of the rules.

287
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,680
But you didn,t even tell me

288
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,520
before you asked Mr. Gu to embarrass me.

289
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,460
Does it make any sense?

290
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
Life-and-death boxing?

291
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,120
Yes.

292
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,000
Sign the death contract before boxing.

293
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,960
Life or death,

294
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,580
it depends on the fate.

295
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,480
No.

296
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,560
I disagree.

297
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,400
Mr. Gu.

298
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,340
Douwei Club has operated more than

299
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,800
twenty years in Shunyuan.

300
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,680
You are neither the first one

301
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,880
nor the last one

302
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,240
to harry me.

303
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,320
Many boxing clubs have closed

304
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,600
one after another.

305
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,720
But my club survives

306
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,040
due to my rules.

307
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,520
The rules are the essence of the Mu Family.

308
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,160
If no one had obeyed the rules,

309
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,040
like Huang,

310
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
who regretted and intended to leave,

311
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
my club couldn,t have been operated.

312
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,400
Even if you hadn,t sealed my club,

313
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,890
it could have been closed on my own.

314
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,140
Gu Yanzhen.

315
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,300
Gu Yanzhen.

316
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,160
Mr. Mu.

317
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,480
It,s my fault.

318
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,250
I am willing to fight for the life-and-death boxing.

319
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,870
You saved my brother and me.

320
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,300
I won,t bring you any trouble.

321
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,360
I just hope if I were alive

322
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
by a fluke after the fight,

323
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,300
you could release me.

324
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,880
Of course.

325
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,880
Life-and-death boxing?

326
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,050
To sign the death contract?

327
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,260
Gu Yanzhen.

328
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,880
Are you mad?

329
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,610
Is it signed?

330
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,160
I disagree.

331
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,580
But he promised it.

332
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,820
I said so much to persuade him.

333
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,640
But he…

334
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,430
He refused and promised

335
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,740
to fight for the life-and-death boxing.

336
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,400
Song!

337
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,490
You are so silly.

338
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,640
Mr. Mu is not a good person

339
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,170
whose business is so dirty.

340
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,920
An evil person fears someone even more evil.

341
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,340
You should hand it over to Gu Yanzhen to deal with.

342
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,740
Why did you interfere it?

343
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,330
What do you mean?

344
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,370
I am the evil person?

345
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Is the date fixed?

346
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,370
The sixth day of next month.

347
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,740
Huang Song.

348
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Are you sure about it?

349
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,490
If you hand it over to me,

350
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,840
Mr. Mu dares not

351
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,970
to hurt you for fear of offending the Shen Family.

352
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,100
Do you mean our family has no honor?

353
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,200
Does your family have any honors?

354
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,880
Song.

355
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,870
You should do as we told you.

356
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Fighters of the life-and-death boxing are all outlaws.

357
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,540
You have your friends, family

358
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,020
and a bright future ahead.

359
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,340
Why do you take the risk?

360
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

361
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,140
Liangchen.

362
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,840
I know you are kind to me.

363
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,080
But I made the trouble.

364
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,000
When He was in the jail,

365
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,400
I begged Mr. Mu for help

366
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
and he lent me money without hesitance.

367
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,100
No matter what his intention was,

368
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,400
I owed him a favor.

369
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
So,

370
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,400
I don,t allow you to threaten him.

371
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,800
I will end it

372
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,660
through my own efforts

373
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,800
to requite his kindness.

374
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,600
Don,t worry.

375
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,880
The life-and-death boxing

376
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
is just a bluff.

377
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,160
In fact, it,s not a big deal.

378
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,640
You just said that

379
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,640
most fighters of the life-and-death boxing are outlaws.

380
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Senior boxers won,t fight for this.

381
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,840
I have been in club for a long time

382
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,560
and have watched some life-and-death boxings.

383
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,200
The levels of fighters

384
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,000
are not good.

385
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,000
Even in regular matches, my victories are much more than defeats.

386
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,040
Not to mention these amateurs.

387
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,370
Don,t worry.

388
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,160
You can rest assured.

389
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,290
I will surely win it.

390
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,800
Liangchen. Don,t worry.

391
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,200
You decided it?

392
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,960
Now that you decided it,

393
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,420
you need to prepare for it.

394
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,320
In the remaining twenty days,

395
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,560
I won,t fight.

396
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,980
I will take a good rest.

397
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,320
To rest is not enough.

398
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
I,ll find you a boxer

399
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,530
and train yourself.

400
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,480
Right.

401
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
As matters stand,

402
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,560
you should recover your state to the best.

403
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,120
Well.

404
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,120
I,ll draw up a training plan for you.

405
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,520
Train yourself

406
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,040
according to my plan.

407
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,280
I,m sure all your rivals would be defeated.

408
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Right.

409
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,600
You should be defensive besides endurance

410
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,260
and skills.

411
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,000
I know several martial masters.

412
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,320
I,ll invite them to hit you every day

413
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,000
to build up your defensibility.

414
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So that you won,t even fight

415
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,240
and just exhaust them

416
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,200
by bearing their blows.

417
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,840
Believe it?

418
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,400
Yeah.

419
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,040
We will train you as Sergeant Lv did.

420
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,080
I believe five coaches of us

421
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,010
will surely help you win the match.

422
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,370
How about it?

423
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,240
Yanzhen.

424
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,640
I regret it now.

425
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,320
Can I quit the fight?

426
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,440
Of course not.

427
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,810
Aren,t you Yellow Cricket?

428
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
Let me see your strength.

429
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,690
Yellow Cricket.

430
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,050
You will go to fight in two days.

431
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
Shen Junshan said we won,t train you these two days.

432
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,060
You can take a rest.

433
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,520
Should I say thanks to you?

434
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,440
Whether you say it or not,

435
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,040
I,d say you,re welcome.

436
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,330
You,re welcome.

437
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,180
Liangchen.

438
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,200
Shen Junshan.

439
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,040
What,s up?

440
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,680
I need to go out now.

441
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,460
Help me to request a leave.

442
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,130
Alright.

443
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,010
Where are you going?

444
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
To find Xie Xiang.

445
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,440
Who?

446
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,360
Xie Xiang.

447
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,720
It,s rare to be free today.

448
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,780
I want to visit her.

449
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,040
She...

450
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
She may not be free.

451
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Have you met her?

452
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,320
No. No.

453
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,960
No.

454
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,100
How do you know she is not free?

455
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,240
You know she is always busy.

456
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,480
I guess it.

457
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,560
She bustles around,

458
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,760
dancing and the like.

459
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,100
Do your business.

460
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,830
I,m leaving.

461
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,100
What should I do?

462
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,200
Hurry up.

463
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,840
Hurry up.

464
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,560
Thank you.

465
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Not at all.

466
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,840
Xie Xiang.

467
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,080
Mr. Shen.

468
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,020
What are you doing?

469
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,770
I,m waiting for the car.

470
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,340
Where are you heading?

471
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,340
The bookstore.

472
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,170
I wanna go to the bookstore.

473
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,400
Get in the car.

474
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,260
I,ll drive you.

475
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,720
No. Thank you.

476
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,840
It doesn,t matter.

477
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,440
Get on.

478
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,640
Alright.

479
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,940
Do you wanna buy books?

480
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,890
I wanna look around.

481
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,330
You can go later.

482
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,570
There is a performance at Shengping Theater.

483
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,400
Tulip Dance Troupe from Russia.

484
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,810
They can dance Giselle.

485
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,000
Do you wanna watch it?

486
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,520
Really?

487
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,210
I know you would like it.

488
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Why no audience here?

489
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,370
Do we come too early?

490
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,560
Please.

491
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,440
How about it?

492
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,100
Was it good?

493
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,260
Brilliant.

494
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,730
That,s good.

495
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,730
But how come the audiences were only two of us?

496
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Maybe few people

497
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,440
in Shunyuan like ballet.

498
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,020
Are you hungry?

499
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,520
Let,s have some food.

500
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,380
I,m not hungry.

501
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,280
Get in the car.

502
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,840
Goodbye.

503
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,240
Rickshaw.

504
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Please be seated.

505
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,680
Leave now.

506
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,080
You come back so late.

507
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,680
Come here.

508
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:21,840
What,s up?

509
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,640
Come here now.

510
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,800
What?

511
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,040
Li Wenzhong is behind us.

512
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,600
Hush.

513
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,450
Listen to me.

514
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,770
You are so silly.

515
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,540
If the stuff you hid

516
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
and your identity were exposed,

517
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,920
you would definitely die.

518
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,960
How can you hide them in the dormitory?

519
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,640
It doesn,t matter.

520
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,480
It has been safe

521
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,610
for such a long time.

522
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,240
But it doesn,t mean it will be safe for good.

523
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,200
If you were exposed,

524
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,920
no one could save you.

525
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,040
I know it.

526
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,850
I,ll send those away tomorrow.

527
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,940
You,d better do it.

528
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,480
Is it alright?

529
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,080
OK. OK.

530
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,160
Go.

531
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,040
Hurry up.

532
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,680
Don,t push me.

533
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,340
Be careful.

534
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,040
I have repeated it so many times.

535
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
I will get angry if you push me again!

536
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,670
It,s late. No one can see it.

537
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,230
Come.

538
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,560
You…

539
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,800
You…

540
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,880
What are you doing?

541
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,740
Take pictures.

542
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,380
Record your heroic poses.

543
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,570
We also helped you find your watch.

544
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,130
Not only your watch,

545
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,320
but also the money,

546
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,120
the silver dollars lost lately.

547
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,440
All were stuffed in your quilt.

548
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,440
So many things were in the quilt.

549
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,500
Can you sleep well?

550
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,240
You set me up?!

551
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,120
Yeah.

552
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,090
How about it?

553
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,810
Li Wenzhong.

554
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,000
I never intended to provoke you.

555
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,220
But you provoked me in the first place for so many times.

556
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,000
Now we both

557
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,640
have weak points of each other.

558
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,160
If you dare to get me in troubles,

559
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,760
you wouldn,t be good either.

560
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,280
Take it as hush money.

561
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,730
Are you leaving?

562
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,960
Li Wenzhong.

563
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,760
What are you doing?

564
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,090
Why did you kick my door?

565
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,480
What are you doing?

566
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,540
What are you doing?

567
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,880
Don,t you sleep in the night?

568
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,940
Yeah. Li Wenzhong.

569
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,360
Why don,t you sleep and kick my door?

570
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,290
What do you want?

571
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,880
I...

572
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,480
Li Wenzhong.

573
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,440
Are you sick?

574
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,720
Go back to sleep.

575
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,560
What are you looking at?

576
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Why don,t you eat?

577
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,040
I heard that the thief

578
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,300
had returned all the stolen things back.

579
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,330
Shouldn,t you return my money?

580
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,920
Yes, I will.

581
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,920
Li Wenzhong didn,t sleep

582
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
and smash your door last night.

583
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,520
Was he mad?

584
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,690
He always gives me the evil eye.

585
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,400
I heard that he was punished by Guo

586
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,520
for three days in solitary confinement.

587
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,450
It was pathetic.

588
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:02,920
Song!

589
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,690
Why do you look dispirited?

590
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,490
I didn,t sleep well.

591
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
You should have a good rest.

592
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,290
It is significant to you tomorrow.

593
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,200
Listen to me.

594
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,920
It,s not too late

595
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,450
to regret if you are afraid.

596
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,220
No.

597
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,160
I will go.

598
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,950
As your wish.

599
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,370
Don,t worry.

600
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,460
We will go with you tomorrow evening.

601
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,680
I will go, too.

602
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,640
No need.

603
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,480
It would be a disaster if the Sergeants knew it.

604
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,740
But you can,t go alone.

605
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,840
Come.

606
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,980
It doesn,t matter.

607
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,480
I can solve it on my own.

608
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,000
Take it.

609
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,140
The yolk has been removed.

610
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,200
Thank you.

611
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,700
Did you sleep well last night?

612
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,020
It was good.

613
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,640
The door was almost smashed.

614
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,370
Are you sure?

615
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,680
It has nothing to do with you.

616
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,040
Get your hands away.

617
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,640
Nope.

618
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,480
Have the meal.

619
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,120
Nope.

620
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,040
Alright.

621
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,640
So be it.

622
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,160
Xiaoyu.

623
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
It,s almost done.

624
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Did anyone follow you on the road?

625
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,480
No.

626
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
We made a fraud.

627
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,360
The police surnamed He

628
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,220
still stayed

629
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,020
at Warehouse No.17 with his men.

630
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,720
Get prepared.

631
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,220
Mr. Zhou will pick up the goods tomorrow.

632
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,880
It,s fine. Xiaoyu.

633
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,440
I know it.

634
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,440
Xiaoyu.

635
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,730
All are light machine guns.

636
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,250
All are made in Britain.

637
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,650
No wonder

638
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,960
the police are so crazy for them.

639
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
It is worthy for us

640
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,520
to take such great risks.

641
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,440
Stay here tonight.

642
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,120
Keep vigilant.

643
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,560
Don,t make any mistake.

644
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,420
Get it. Xiaoyu.

645
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:11,880
Leave.

646
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,520
Go.

647
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,850
We,re leaving, Xiaoyu.

648
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,890
What do you want?

649
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,170
Pretend to be a hero?

650
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,220
Face your enemy alone?

651
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,920
You want to have fun alone.

652
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,980
Don,t you see us as your brothers?

653
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:19,880
Huang Song.

654
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,700
I warn you.

655
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,920
I,ve bet you all my money for meals this month.

656
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,980
If you dare to lose,

657
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,880
you wash my underwear for a month.

658
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,810
Don,t you only have one underwear?

659
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,220
Do you think I have only one as you do?

660
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,150
Have you seen it?

661
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,200
Song.

662
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,660
We will go with you.

663
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,240
Thank you.

664
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,220
Thank you.

665
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,630
Don,t be afraid.

666
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,700
If the rival is powerful,

667
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,630
we will help you.

668
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,250
Don,t worry.

669
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,400
Song.

670
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,720
Song.

671
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,840
Mr. Mu said it.

672
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,220
Go to see him at the lounge.

673
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,920
Did he say what the matter is?

674
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,480
Nope.

675
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,940
Go to visit him now.

676
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,160
I,ll go to visit him.

677
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,220
Let,s go together.

678
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,740
Where is your boss?

679
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,960
Song.

680
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,220
Where is the boss?

681
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,560
He was here just now.

682
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,160
But

683
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,740
two Russians came here

684
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
and took him away.

685
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,440
Russians?

686
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,020
Do you know whom I will fight with?

687
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,640
Peng Jiu.

688
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,600
Who is Peng Jiu?

689
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,560
Is he powerful?

690
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,400
Didn,t Peng Jiu hurt his leg?

691
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,680
Can he fight?

692
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
He is lame.

693
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,080
He can,t fight in normal matches.

694
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,280
So he gambles it on the life-and-death boxing.

695
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,080
Hey, Song.

696
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You know it,s him.

697
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,800
You should be reassured now.

698
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,170
In the match,

699
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,880
you don,t need to fight him at all.

700
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,280
Just run around the stage

701
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,960
and exhaust him to death.

702
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,080
How could it be like this?

703
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,880
Let me fight a lame chain smoker?

704
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,880
I can,t do that.

705
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,840
Song.

706
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,700
This is

707
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,700
your final match.

708
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,700
The boss neither wants to break the rules,

709
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,960
nor to embarrass you.

710
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,700
It is said that even Mr. Gu in Gu Mansion intervened.

711
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,640
So the boss must show some respect.

712
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:50,880
Song.

713
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,160
You know such an eminent person.

714
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,480
If you become famous someday,

715
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,400
don,t forget to promote me.

716
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,810
Where are you going?

717
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,040
I will bet all my savings on Song.

718
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,360
This is a rare opportunity

719
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,560
to make a big fortune.

720
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,480
Ji Jin.

721
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,640
That,s right!

722
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,600
Wait for me!
