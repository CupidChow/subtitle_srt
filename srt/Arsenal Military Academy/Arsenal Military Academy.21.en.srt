Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 21

4
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,920
What am I thinking?

5
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,880
Why am I thinking of him?

6
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,320
Wake up.

7
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Xie Xiang,

8
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,520
wake up.

9
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,880
Dad.

10
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Morning.

11
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,160
What's wrong? What's with that look?

12
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,920
The Eight-Nation Alliance's waged war again?

13
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,240
Look what you've done!

14
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
The agency is moving fast.

15
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
How can you still laugh?

16
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,520
Dad.

17
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
This is unnecessary.

18
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
Grandpa arranged this marriage.

19
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,760
You also dislike Dong Huiseng, right?

20
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,480
Nonsense.

21
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Invitations have already been sent out.

22
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,760
All the guests have arrived in Nanjing.

23
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,560
Your engagement is coming soon.

24
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,079
But you...

25
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,320
How could you do this?

26
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
You're embarrassing me

27
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,720
as well as our whole family!

28
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
It's not that serious.

29
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,000
You...you dare to talk back?

30
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,640
Dad.

31
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Have the Dongs sent an envoy

32
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,240
to break off the engagement?

33
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,240
Not really.

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,960
But Dong Huiseng

35
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
did call me early in the morning

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,960
and asked me to discipline you.

37
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,720
He even gave me a lecture,

38
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,510
yet I couldn't say anything.

39
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,950
It's all your fault!

40
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
They aren't going to cancel it?

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
They have no shame!

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,720
Their family is well-known in Nanjing.

43
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,320
After such humiliation,

44
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,240
they still won't cancel it.

45
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,760
They are so thick-skinned.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,720
Yanzhen.

47
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,280
Don't think I don't know

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,680
about your little tricks.

49
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
Don't even think about it.

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,600
You are doomed to get married!

51
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,120
Mr. Zhu,

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
keep an eye on him.

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
Don't let him go out today.

54
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

55
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,960
Young master.

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,120
Hey, bro,

57
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,480
how far is this place from the town?

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,720
Four hours on foot.

59
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,960
But look,

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
after the rain,

61
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,760
the muddy road may take more time.

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
I need to spend the night in town

63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,840
so I've brought Lingdang with me.

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,920
Can she walk that far?

65
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
She's used to it.

66
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Once we speed up,

67
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,920
she may be faster than both of you.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,720
It's OK, sweetie.

69
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,480
Calm down.

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,480
I'll get it back.

71
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,480
It's OK.

72
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,680
Liangchen,

73
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,240
can you look after Lingdang for me?

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,320
I'll go get the dog back.

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,240
Can you get it back?

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
I will.

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
It's OK.

78
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,080
Let me go with you.

79
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,840
No need, no need.

80
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,960
I'll be back in a moment.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,320
Lingdang, don't be afraid.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,880
Your dad will get your dog back.

83
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,720
He'll be back soon.

84
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,480
Why hasn't he come back?

85
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,120
I'll go check.

86
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,880
I'll go with you.

87
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,400
Stay here

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
and wait for me.

89
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,240
Lingdang needs you.

90
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Lingdang, don't be afraid.

91
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
It's OK.

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,040
Don't worry.

93
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
Don't be scared.

94
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,560
Lingdang.

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,400
Wait here for me.

96
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,120
Don't go anywhere.

97
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Got it?

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,640
Wait right here.

99
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,880
It came from that way.

100
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
Mr. Wei.

101
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,200
Mr. Wei.

102
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,160
When I arrived,

103
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,200
he had already died.

104
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
Lingdang,

105
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,920
your dad died.

106
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
Lingdang,

107
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,640
your dad is gone!

108
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,400
Liangchen,

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,280
she doesn't understand you.

110
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Don't scare her.

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
It's our fault.

112
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,680
We killed him.

113
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,600
Over there.

114
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,120
Lingdang.

115
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,120
Junshan.

116
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,640
Leave now!

117
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,360
I'll cover you!

118
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,040
Run!

119
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,640
Go.

120
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,880
Split up.

121
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,240
This way.

122
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,120
Lingdang, wait here for me.

123
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,720
Don't go anywhere.

124
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Got it?

125
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,040
Don't go anywhere.

126
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Freeze.

127
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,840
Xie Liangchen. Xie Liangchen.

128
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,520
Congratulations, Vice Minister Gu.

129
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,240
May I interview you later?

130
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,880
Sure.

131
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,640
Vice Minister Gu.

132
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,480
Welcome. Welcome.

133
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,600
-Congratulations! -Congrats!

134
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,200
Congratulations!

135
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,720
This way, please.

136
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,400
OK.

137
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,400
Congratulations!

138
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,760
Are you happy with your daughter-in-law?

139
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,120
I am. She's amazing.

140
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,520
With all due respect, your son doesn't seem

141
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,360
too happy.

142
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,000
Congratulations!

143
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,200
He's just nervous.

144
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,600
I think it's understandable.

145
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,080
Am I right? Right?

146
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,600
-Yes, yes. -Excuse me.

147
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,960
-Thanks. Thank you. -Go ahead.

148
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,440
Vice Director Gu.

149
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,400
-Thanks for coming. -Congratulations!

150
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,540
-Welcome. -Congratulations!

151
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
Yanzhen,

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,240
What's with the long face?

153
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
It's your engagement

154
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,360
not a funeral.

155
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,880
Give me a smile.

156
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,600
Vice Minister Gu.

157
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,720
Congratulations!

158
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,660
-This way, please. -Congratulations!

159
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,480
Please.

160
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,840
Director He.

161
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,280
Vice Minister Gu.

162
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,320
Congratulations!

163
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,320
Thanks for coming to my son's engagement.

164
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,680
It's my pleasure.

165
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,000
Your son is getting engaged.

166
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,520
How could I miss it?

167
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,800
You're a handsome young man!

168
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Your fiancee must be pretty, too.

169
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Thanks for your compliment.

170
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,840
I'm indeed handsome.

171
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,640
As for my fiancee,

172
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,400
I'm not sure

173
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,240
if she's pretty or not.

174
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,520
He likes to joke around.

175
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,240
Director He, please.

176
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,280
-Sure. -This way, please.

177
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,440
See you.

178
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,800
OK.

179
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,120
-I can go in myself. -Sorry for the inconvenience.

180
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,480
Sure.

181
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,240
What nonsense?

182
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,440
I was telling the truth.

183
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,120
How come

184
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,280
she still wants to get engaged with me?

185
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,760
Do you really

186
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
want me to marry that shameless woman?

187
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't say that again.

188
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
You can go inside if you like.

189
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,160
Vice Minister Gu, congratulations!

190
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Please.

191
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,840
Hey, what's wrong?

192
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,280
You're already drunk before the ceremony begins?

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,800
I

194
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,000
am

195
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,880
Yu Shaotian.

196
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,680
Gu Yanzhen.

197
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,760
Listen,

198
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm Yu Shaotian.

199
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,480
And?

200
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm the heir of Sixi Restaurant

201
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,360
and Dong Xiaowan's ex-fiance.

202
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,360
Yu Shaotian.

203
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm Yu Shaotian

204
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,560
Dong Xiaowan's ex-fiance?

205
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,760
Mr. Yu.

206
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,200
Hello.

207
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Nice to meet you.

208
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,200
Are you here

209
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,800
to...

210
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,560
to teach me a lesson

211
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,640
or...

212
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,080
or to take Dong Xiaowan away?

213
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,760
Tell me now.

214
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
I can help you. Hurry up.

215
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,200
I won't hurt you.

216
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,560
I just came to have a look.

217
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
No, man.

218
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,120
How about you hit me?

219
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,240
You...

220
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,480
Come on. Hit me.

221
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
I just come to see

222
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,640
what kind of man

223
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,120
Xiaowan loves.

224
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,760
Hey man, don't cry.

225
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,440
He's crying!

226
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,960
Hit me now.

227
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,880
Take photos.

228
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,520
Hit me, then you may feel better.

229
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,280
Trust me.

230
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,440
What are you doing?

231
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Young master, don't worry.

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,320
We'll take care of him.

233
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,840
Xiaowan!

234
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,520
Come here.

235
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,480
Xiaowan!

236
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,920
Wish you all the best.

237
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,280
Xiaowan!

238
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,040
You must be happy, Xiaowan!

239
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
Yanzhen.

240
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,880
What's wrong with him?

241
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,440
I don't know.

242
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
The ceremony is about to begin.

243
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,960
Come with me.

244
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,440
Dad, my stomach hurts.

245
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,480
I need to...

246
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,560
I...

247
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
You can't go anywhere.

248
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's go.

249
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
Distinguished guests,

250
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
ladies and gentlemen,

251
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,280
welcome.

252
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,280
Today is

253
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,240
Mr. Gu Yanzhen

254
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
and Miss Dong Xiaowan's engagement ceremony.

255
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm honored to be here upon Vice Minister Gu,

256
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Gu Zongtang's invitation.

257
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,040
On behalf of the Gus and the Dongs,

258
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,640
I sincerely welcome

259
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,400
all of you...

260
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,080
Pull yourself together.

261
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
…to join us today.

262
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,560
Thank you all for coming.

263
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,240
Don't say anything stupid.

264
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,640
Thanks.

265
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Don't worry, dad.

266
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm in your hands now.

267
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
I won't go anywhere.

268
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,320
Now,

269
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,640
Let's welcome the stars of the day

270
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,120
Mr. Gu Yanzhen

271
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
and Miss Dong Xiaowan

272
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,040
to the stage.

273
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,360
How about

274
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,280
Mr. Gu and Miss Dong

275
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,800
perform the opening dance

276
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,480
for us?

277
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,400
Great!

278
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,480
What are you doing?

279
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,109
Stop.

280
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:22,960
What's wrong?

281
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Shouldn't you invite me to dance?

282
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,040
No matter how reluctant you are,

283
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,760
under such situation,

284
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,640
you have no choice.

285
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,240
Damn it.

286
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
What's wrong?

287
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,720
Who is that?

288
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,520
Gu Yanzhen.

289
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Will you keep your promise?

290
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,400
What promise?

291
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
That you'll escort me back to Shunyuan.

292
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,000
Of course.

293
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,640
Let's go.

294
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,880
Yanzhen.

295
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,720
What are you doing?

296
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,440
Dad, I must go.

297
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,240
Stop there.

298
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,920
Miss Dong,

299
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,040
wait a moment

300
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,120
if you

301
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,440
want to.

302
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,280
Qu Manting,

303
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,120
You're so cool!

304
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,880
What did you say?

305
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,920
I said you're cool!

306
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,280
Just so-so.

307
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,200
Xie Liangchen.

308
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
Lingdang, where's Xie Liangchen?

309
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,880
Answer me. Where's Xie Liangchen?

310
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,000
Be good. Don't go anywhere.

311
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Liangchen.

312
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,560
Hello.

313
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,100
Please call 9537 for me.

314
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,100
Mr. Gu,

315
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,480
the line's been busy lately.

316
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,640
It may take a while for your call to be put through.

317
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,160
You can enjoy your meal first.

318
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,640
I'll call you when it's through.

319
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,800
You have to dress up for a meal?

320
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,760
I'm a star.

321
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,880
It's my job to look spotless.

322
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,600
There's a train going back tonight,

323
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
but the time is a bit tight.

324
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
If you're tired,

325
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,320
we can take the train tomorrow.

326
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,760
OK.

327
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,440
We will have time to hang out tomorrow.

328
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,720
I need to use the bathroom.

329
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,080
Miss,

330
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,920
Where's the man sitting here?

331
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,360
What's wrong?

332
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,880
He has a call.

333
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,200
I can answer it.

334
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,640
Hello.

335
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,160
Is this

336
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,040
Gu Yanzhen's fiancee?

337
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm not.

338
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm his friend.

339
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,120
Who is this?

340
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,920
What's wrong?

341
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm his friend.

342
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,800
He called me just now.

343
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
He's in the bathroom.

344
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Do you know

345
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,320
when he'll come back to Shunyuan?

346
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,640
In a few days.

347
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,880
OK.

348
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,720
When you see Gu Yanzhen,

349
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,560
please tell him

350
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,520
to come back immediately.

351
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,600
There's an emergency in school.

352
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,600
Emergency?

353
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,520
What happened?

354
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,800
Shen Junshan, Xie Liangchen,

355
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,880
Huang Song, and Ji Jin

356
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,120
escorted a batch of medicine

357
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
to Dandong Hospital.

358
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
On their way back,

359
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,000
they were hunted by some killers.

360
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
Now Shen Junshan and Xie Liangchen

361
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,000
are missing.

362
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,880
Huang Song and Ji Jin have come back.

363
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,120
Hello?

364
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,160
Hello?

365
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,680
I'm listening.

366
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,720
When Gu Yanzhen is back,

367
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,360
please tell him about it

368
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,200
or ask him to call me back.

369
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,920
OK.

370
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,120
Are you done?

371
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm done.

372
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,000
What's wrong?

373
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,320
Nothing.

374
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,200
Let's go.

375
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Thank you.

376
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,160
For what?

377
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,680
For helping me out.

378
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
Don't you blame me for sabotaging your engagement?

379
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,520
That engagement is

380
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,840
more like a disaster.

381
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Hey look,

382
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,000
I've done you a huge favor.

383
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,320
A thank you isn't enough.

384
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,560
Tell me,

385
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,360
what do you want?

386
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I'll give you anything

387
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,160
ex…except my body.

388
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
The least valuable thing you have

389
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,880
is your body.

390
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,880
That might be

391
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
the case before but not now.

392
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,160
I've changed.

393
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
I don't want

394
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,480
anything else.

395
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,640
Let me be clear,

396
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,760
We're friends

397
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,640
with no affection.

398
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,200
I know I'm charming...

399
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
Sir, no chili, please.

400
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,160
I want one, too.

401
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,280
What is it? Smells good.

402
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,920
Duck blood and vermicelli soup.

403
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,800
I want it.

404
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,360
Haven't you eaten already?

405
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,080
Are you a pig?

406
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,000
I have but I'm still hungry.

407
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,480
I want more. What's wrong?

408
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,280
I am a pig.

409
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,200
Go sit over there.

410
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,920
I'll go get it.

411
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,960
Add extra chili.

412
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,320
No shallot and cilantro.

413
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,280
Hello, excuse me.

414
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,960
I...

415
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,120
Lost your wallet?

416
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,040
Thanks. Thank you.

417
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll tell your boss

418
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,160
to give you a bonus.

419
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,560
You have a good sense of humor.

420
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,360
Rest assured, sir.

421
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,320
In our restaurant,

422
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
all items we found

423
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,480
will be given back to the customers.

424
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,520
Check your wallet,

425
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,680
see if anything is missing.

426
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,960
No need.

427
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,120
I trust you.

428
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,920
Sir,

429
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,120
your call got through just now.

430
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,360
It did?

431
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,520
You were in the bathroom

432
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,360
so your friend answered it for you.

433
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,240
May I borrow your phone again?

434
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,440
Of course. Please.

435
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,080
What took you so long?

436
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,760
It's been so long.

437
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,200
There was a long line.

438
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,960
Smells so good.

439
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,360
So delicious. Don't you want some?

440
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,400
Qu Manting,

441
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,640
did you answer my call just now?

442
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,720
Yeah.

443
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,400
Why didn't you tell me about it?

444
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,560
What's the point of telling you?

445
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,160
We're going back soon anyway.

446
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,480
You're right.

447
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,240
Go on eating.

448
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,160
Gu Yanzhen,

449
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,800
what do you mean?

450
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,720
I like you.

451
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,720
I told you that long ago.

452
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,720
Don't say you don't know that.

453
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,400
How long will

454
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,160
your affection last?

455
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,720
Don't judge me.

456
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,280
You're no better.

457
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,640
Since you know what kind of person I am,

458
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,520
why do you still like me?

459
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,080
Qu Manting,

460
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,520
I'm in love with someone else.

461
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,240
Look,

462
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
I'm grateful

463
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,760
for what you did today.

464
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,760
In the future,

465
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,720
if you need my help

466
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
or anything else,

467
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,400
I'll

468
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,840
help you as much as I can.

469
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,240
Tell me,

470
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,400
why doesn't he like me?

471
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,520
He's blind.

472
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,800
He's an idiot.

473
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,640
Yeah,

474
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,240
he's an idiot.

475
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,040
But why am I still obsessed

476
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
with that blind idiot?

477
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,920
Go back and rest.

478
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,320
OK.

479
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,480
Get some rest.

480
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,520
Good night.

481
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,600
Thank you.

482
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,040
Why didn't anyone tell me

483
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,280
about Junshan's missing?

484
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,640
We didn't hear a word about it.

485
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,560
I just called back and asked them

486
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,640
to find him immediately.

487
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Book tomorrow morning's ticket.

488
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,480
Yes.

489
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,040
Hello.

490
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,960
Hi, hello.

491
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,760
Is this Director Guo, Guo Shuting?

492
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,520
I am.

493
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,560
I'm calling from Dandong City Hospital.

494
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,360
We've received two patients today.

495
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,880
We believe they're your students.

496
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,120
I'd like to confirm it with you.

497
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,520
You must be punished

498
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,080
for your mistakes.

499
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,040
Boss,

500
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,880
on the train,

501
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,800
I saw Chairman Shen,

502
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,240
Shen Tingbai's brother.

503
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,560
Shen Junshan.

504
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,560
Was he involved in it, too?

505
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
He was just an accomplice.

506
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,720
Have him treated.

507
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,480
Be careful.

508
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,560
Come.

509
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,680
Luckily, the wound is on your leg.

510
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,240
If it were on your stomach or chest,

511
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
your identity would be exposed.

512
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,040
Then I wouldn't go to the hospital.

513
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,880
Great.

514
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,120
Just stay at home

515
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,280
and wait for death.

516
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
Your cover will blow soon.

517
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,880
You won't be lucky every time.

518
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,960
Things will work out in the end.

519
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,760
I heard Shen Junshan saved you again.

520
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,440
You two have gone through so much.

521
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,200
Tell me,

522
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,280
are you in love with him?

523
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,640
Shut up.

524
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,920
Are you shy?

525
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,400
What's wrong?

526
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,240
You don't feel well?

527
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,800
I'm fine.

528
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,760
I've asked for a three-day leave

529
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,160
to take care of you.

530
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,520
No need.

531
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,040
Huang Song will come later.

532
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,280
Xie Xiang,

533
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,000
just use your brain for once!

534
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,440
You're injured

535
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,560
and can't move freely.

536
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,120
Can he go to the bathroom with you?

537
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,760
I'm going home to get your lunch.

538
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,280
My mom heard you were sick,

539
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,800
so she cooked a lot of food for you.

540
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,800
And,

541
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,560
remember that little girl you brought back last time?

542
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,800
Ever since she came to our house,

543
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,960
she hasn't said a word.

544
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,120
She's always been like that.

545
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
Please take good care of her.

546
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,200
When I get better,

547
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,360
I'll find a place for her.

548
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,240
OK.

549
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,360
Take care of yourself first.

550
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,440
Don't worry about other things.

551
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,120
Be careful.

552
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,560
By the way,

553
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,240
Ms. Huo asked about you this morning.

554
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,440
She said she'd come to visit.

555
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,480
See you.

556
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,480
Bye.

557
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,720
Excuse me,

558
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,240
which is Xie Liangchen's room?

559
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,760
Over there.

560
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,760
Thanks.

561
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,520
You're welcome.
