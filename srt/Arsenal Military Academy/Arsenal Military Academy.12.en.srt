Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 12

4
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,120
Good!

5
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,320
Does anyone

6
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
want to come forward and have a try?

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,440
I won't.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,479
Huang Song.

9
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,250
Do you want to have a try?

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,479
Sergeant. Me?

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,759
Sergeant.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
What if I hit you with the sword?

13
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,440
Just try your best.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I won't blame you even if you kill me.

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Everyone will witness it.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
What if

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,800
you hit me?

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,460
You can blame on your bad luck.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
I won't then.

20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Sergeant, I dare not to.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,920
Cut the crap.

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Come on.

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,320
Go. Go.

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,280
Go. Go.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
Raise the sword before go forward

26
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
when you chop down next time.

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,240
If you raise the sword as rush forward,

28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,170
it will be easy to

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,320
hit your middle body indefensible.

30
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,200
Get it?

31
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
I got it.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,280
Get back.

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,079
Are you OK?

34
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,440
Anyone else would like to try it?

35
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,120
Xie Liangchen.

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
Me?

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,850
Is there anyone else named Xie Liangchen?

38
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
Be careful, Liangchen.

39
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,209
Your weakness is not at skills.

40
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,920
You don't have the desire to win.

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
You are hesitant and timid.

42
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,640
If you proceed like this,

43
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,170
it's impossible

44
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,720
for you to graduate from here.

45
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,580
Go back and think about it.

46
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,040
Get back.

47
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
Anyone else?

48
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,440
Zhu Yanlin.

49
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Come forward.

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
Sergeant.

51
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,520
I have a stomachache.

52
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,920
I...

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
-Why did you raise up? -I...

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Come forward.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Come on.

56
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,240
Go ahead.

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Be careful.

58
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,080
Were you punished again today?

59
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,320
Lv Zhongxin

60
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,650
said you were too weak to graduate, right?

61
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,320
You knew it?

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,520
I am too stupid.

63
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,920
I have an idea.

64
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,240
You come here to me every night.

65
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll train you.

66
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,960
Train me?

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,080
Lv Zhongxin said you were weak.

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,800
But I can make you graduate as an elite student.

69
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Me?

70
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Elite student?

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,840
No. No.

72
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,800
I just hope I'm not the last.

73
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,320
Come on.

74
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,360
Watch me.

75
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Good.

76
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,960
Come on.

77
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Sergeant, are you all right?

78
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm fine.

79
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,400
You

80
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,880
did a good job.

81
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,640
Thank you, Sergeant.

82
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,320
Let's go on.

83
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,520
No.

84
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,560
Practice it by yourself.

85
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,880
See you, Sergeant.

86
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
Alright. That's enough.

87
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,920
Get back now.

88
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Zhu Yanlin. Come forward.

89
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,640
Sergeant. Me again?

90
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,240
Who do you want if not you?

91
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,000
I...

92
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,720
OK.

93
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,260
You fight against Xie Liangchen.

94
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,090
Always pick the weak rival.

95
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,560
Who do you mean the weak rival?

96
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,400
You.

97
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,120
That's fine.

98
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
Don't worry, Liangchen.

99
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,560
I won't use my full strength.

100
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,580
Liangchen, how could you pretend to be weak?

101
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,650
Are you alright?

102
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,920
Enough.

103
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,240
Don't lay on the ground.

104
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,000
Get up.

105
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,440
Xie Liangchen.

106
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,160
Good. You got progress.

107
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
Thank you, Sergeant.

108
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Awesome.

109
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,760
This is your tactics.

110
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,440
Gu Yanzhen, get up.

111
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,640
What?

112
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
This is the midnight!

113
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,690
Are they insane?

114
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Be serious.

115
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,440
Something must get wrong.

116
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,200
Get dressed.

117
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
Attention!

118
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,760
Set out!

119
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you know what happened?

120
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,720
I don't know.

121
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,680
It gets farther away.

122
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,010
Sit away from me.

123
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,920
Apparently

124
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,890
it is a warehouse over here.

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
But in fact

126
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
it is a stronghold for illegal detention

127
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,060
and trafficking of laborers.

128
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,280
The intelligence we received indicated that

129
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,240
this place concerned with

130
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,570
several large-scale illegal detentions

131
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,400
and torture of Chinese laborers

132
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,200
in the past two years in Feng'an.

133
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,440
The police

134
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
have been monitoring this place for a while.

135
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
But we heard the whisper that

136
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,540
there was a mole in the police.

137
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,160
The criminals have received the intelligence.

138
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,280
They would transfer to another place tonight possibly.

139
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,810
So the commander ordered us

140
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,210
to assist the police

141
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,960
to arrest the criminals.

142
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,040
They should

143
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,770
be employed by foreign forces.

144
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,360
They have sufficient weapons and ammunition,

145
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,240
probably heavy weapons.

146
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
So you must be careful when you act.

147
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,640
In addition,

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,920
this place

149
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,800
is guarded 24 hours a day,

150
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,420
and equipped with professional hounds.

151
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,000
Attention.

152
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,400
This is not a drill.

153
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
It's a real battle.

154
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,410
No criminal will show mercy to you.

155
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,330
No one will spare you the death.

156
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,240
You may pay

157
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
your lives for any mistakes.

158
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,120
Though you haven't graduated yet,

159
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
you have to be prepared as I told you

160
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,800
on the first day of school.

161
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
The country is in desperate.

162
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,880
We must be prepared

163
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,820
to get into the war at any time.

164
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,480
Soldiers should be baptized

165
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,010
with blood to be qualified.

166
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,100
I hope you can prove it to me with your actions

167
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,920
that the training in these months

168
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
are not in vain.

169
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,120
Alright.

170
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,000
I will assign the missions.

171
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,120
Shen Junshan.

172
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,440
Take a squad

173
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,000
and sneak in through Gate I.

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Destroy the Observation Post I.

175
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,120
Get close to Target I

176
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,920
and wait for the order to attack.

177
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,400
Gu Yanzhen.

178
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,300
Take a squad and

179
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,740
sneak in from the west.

180
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,520
Destroy the Observation Post II.

181
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,720
Get close to Target II

182
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,880
and wait for the order to attack.

183
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,480
Ten minutes later,

184
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,560
I will fire red flares.

185
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,000
All shall attack simultaneously.

186
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,160
Remember.

187
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,000
No one is allowed to act

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
before getting your orders.

189
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,800
Return by the same route

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,130
after the missions.

191
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,640
Don't underestimate the enemy.

192
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,700
Don't be merciful.

193
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,980
Protect the Laborers.

194
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,880
Also, you must be careful

195
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,800
to protect yourselves.

196
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,280
Get it?

197
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,640
Yes, sir.

198
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,640
Set out.

199
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,720
Yes, sir.

200
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,800
Hurry.

201
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,520
You go. I need to empty my bowels.

202
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,200
Alright.

203
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,240
Light up here.

204
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,560
Hurry up.

205
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,200
You're wasting time.

206
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,680
Forget it.

207
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,160
What?

208
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,120
Go.

209
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Go over there and have a look.

210
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,160
Hush.

211
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,840
Two men and a dog.

212
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,120
I have an idea.

213
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,240
The dog is a trouble!

214
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,960
Leave it alone.

215
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,020
Go and check it out.

216
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,160
Stupid police!

217
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,440
What now?

218
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,600
Those bastards!

219
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,800
Prepare to withdraw!

220
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,920
Many enemies in the south tower.

221
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,370
The north building is a warehouse.

222
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,530
Go roundabout and leave from the back.

223
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,460
Be careful!

224
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,040
Go!

225
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Be vigilant.

226
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,440
There are hostages ahead!

227
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,800
Shen Junshan, I go check it.

228
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,440
OK.

229
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Go to the hell!

230
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
Did we learn how to dismantle bombs?

231
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,920
Nope.

232
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
But I have read these books.

233
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,080
This is a simple explosive device.

234
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
It usually explodes after deployed five minutes.

235
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,600
It contains explosives,

236
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,920
probably with toxic chemicals

237
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,250
and biological toxins.

238
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
The timing device is equivalent to a switch.

239
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,720
Now the switch is off.

240
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,400
When the time is due and

241
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,120
the leads are connected,

242
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,580
the blast can raise all of us to 3 meters high.

243
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,050
You said so much.

244
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,760
Which wire should we cut?

245
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,320
And the timing device...

246
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,440
The switch is on the left.

247
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,600
The detonator is on the right.

248
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I think the yellow wire or the green wire should be cut.

249
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,440
Yellow one or green one?

250
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
Yellow.

251
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,320
Huang Song.

252
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Scissors.

253
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,530
It could also be the green wire.

254
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
Bro, are you kidding me?

255
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,040
Yellow line.

256
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,880
Are you sure?

257
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm not sure.

258
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,080
I only saw it in books.

259
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,120
Then I'll cut the red wire.

260
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,960
Don't cut the red.

261
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,840
It will definitely explode!

262
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,240
I can't trust you.

263
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,440
Is it OK? Hurry up.

264
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,840
Stop opting it.

265
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,300
Why don't you cut them all?

266
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,080
Shen Junshan!

267
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,290
Is it the yellow one?

268
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,840
Maybe, but...

269
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,690
It's the yellow one!

270
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,380
Ji Jin. Zhu Yanlin.

271
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,340
Take them away.

272
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,640
Coming.

273
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
Follow me. Come on.

274
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,360
Clear.

275
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,800
Let's go!

276
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,490
I'm running out of bullets.

277
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,580
I'll cover you. Leave now.

278
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,280
Huang Song, go!

279
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,400
Any idea?

280
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,920
Go to the roof.

281
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,800
Leave now!

282
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,960
Watch out!

283
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,720
Don't move. Don't move.

284
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,180
Squat! Squat! Don't move!

285
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,000
Squat!

286
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
Take them all back.

287
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Come on. Move.

288
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,080
Come on. Move.

289
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,200
Listen!

290
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,800
Your men are in our hands,

291
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,930
and you are surrounded.

292
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,640
Surrender now.

293
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,480
Otherwise I will

294
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,280
kill all of them.

295
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm not much patient.

296
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,840
Put down all your weapons!

297
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,520
Who said to go to the roof?

298
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,400
I don't know.

299
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,120
Go!

300
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,320
Shen Junshan.

301
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,720
Go.

302
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,800
Move.

303
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,160
Go.

304
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,680
Arsenal Military Academy?

305
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,600
So capable.

306
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,930
A gang of student soldiers can beat you like this.

307
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,360
How could you lose it?

308
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,700
So useless you are.

309
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,640
Who is

310
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,660
in charge here?

311
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,640
Me.

312
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,840
You?

313
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,840
What do you want?

314
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,840
What do I want?

315
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
What do I want?

316
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,440
You came to my house,

317
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,640
shooting and killing.

318
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,520
And interrupt my sleep.

319
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
How do you explain it?

320
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,380
We have different faiths.

321
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,020
Different faiths?

322
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,400
Different faiths?

323
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,960
Nonsense!

324
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,560
Bro.

325
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,840
I just want to make some money.

326
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,040
You have cut off

327
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,040
my way to make money.

328
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,480
Why did you do that?

329
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,720
Did I offend you?

330
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,880
They...

331
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,240
Did they offend you?

332
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
Why did you kill them?

333
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,200
You sell your own compatriots for foreigners.

334
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,880
How dirty your money is!

335
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Did I ask you to speak?

336
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,280
- Did I? - Liangchen!

337
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Shen Junshan.

338
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,640
Don't move.

339
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,920
- Junshan. - Junshan.

340
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,280
This matter has stirred the top authority.

341
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,720
Now the Daoyin Office, the police station,

342
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,440
the army,

343
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,520
are all after you.

344
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,520
It's in vain to kill us.

345
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,360
Why don't both of us step back?

346
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,220
We can pay you money for our lives.

347
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,440
Pay money for your lives?

348
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,800
How much money do you have?

349
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,320
As much as you wish.

350
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,120
It sounds great.

351
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
But it's a pity

352
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,520
that I don't want it.

353
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,800
Farewell,

354
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,680
gentlemen.

355
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,560
Kill them all!

356
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,360
I have your men!

357
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Drop off your weapons!

358
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,640
Hurry up!

359
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,640
Or I'll shoot him!

360
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
Hurry up!

361
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,520
Don't move! Don't move!

362
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,560
Drop your gun.

363
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't move. Squat!

364
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,280
Don't move.

365
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,640
Drop your gun.

366
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,800
Don't move.

367
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,480
Drop it.

368
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,640
Don't move.

369
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,280
Miss Oda.

370
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,120
Go ahead.

371
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
The timber factory was demolished.

372
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,820
Wu Bin was arrested

373
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,090
by people from the Arsenal Military Academy.

374
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,770
Arsenal Military Academy?

375
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,000
Sergeant Lv.

376
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,520
Good morning.

377
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,760
It's late.

378
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,800
I have been waiting for you for an hour.

379
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,120
I slept late last night.

380
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,490
I missed something with me.

381
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,560
Soldiers!

382
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,400
Sergeant!

383
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,600
I can't take the "bath" in this weather.

384
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,760
It will kill me.

385
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Attention!

386
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,280
Salute!

387
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,240
The school recognized

388
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,020
your heroic performance last night.

389
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,320
It will be reported

390
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,580
to the army department

391
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,050
and you will be awarded.

392
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,760
Very good.

393
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,800
You are the heroes from Arsenal Military Academy.

394
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm proud of you.

395
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,770
Thank you, Sergeant Lv.

396
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,960
Thank you, Sergeant.

397
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,920
You're good, Yanzhen.

398
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,640
Yanzhen. Awesome!

399
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,480
It's awesome!

400
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,760
Amazing, Yanzhen!

401
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,880
Wonderful, Yanzhen.

402
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,280
Yeah.

403
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,560
Gu Yanzhen.

404
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,960
You were so handsome

405
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,520
yesterday.

406
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,920
It was not a big deal.

407
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,670
Everyone is congratulating me,

408
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,040
why are you so silent?

409
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,080
You didn't wake me up this morning.

410
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,139
Congratulations.

411
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,320
Why are you

412
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,880
absent-minded?

413
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,040
No sincerity.

414
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,230
Ji Jin. Breakfast.

415
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,560
Ji Jin.

416
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,090
Have you seen Shen Junshan?

417
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,389
I am about to tell you.

418
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,850
Junshan is in hospital.

419
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,920
Hospital?

420
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,280
Since I came back yesterday,

421
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,560
he has been coughing

422
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,710
even with blood in sputum.

423
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,230
I took him to the hospital

424
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,800
and just came back.

425
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,360
You sell your own compatriots for foreigners.

426
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,960
How dirty your money is!

427
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,080
Did I ask you to speak?

428
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,560
Liangchen.

429
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Did I?

430
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,800
Shen Junshan.

431
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,560
Don't move.

432
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,520
Which hospital?

433
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,580
The City Hospital.

434
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,320
It is not holiday today!

435
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,920
We should take some time to visit him.

436
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,450
Let's have the meal.

437
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,320
Can you contact the doctor Liu for me?

438
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,120
I have contacted him many times.

439
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,480
Sorry.

440
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,440
I'm sorry.

441
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,800
Be sure to take your medicine on time.

442
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,280
OK.

443
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,520
I will.

444
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,520
Nurse.

445
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,300
Which ward is Shen Junshan in?

446
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,600
The first room this row.

447
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,320
Thank you.

448
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,200
Drink some.

449
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,530
It's good for your lung.

450
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,520
Xie, you're here

451
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
I'm here to visit Junshan.

452
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,160
Junshan just woke up. Come in.

453
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,280
Xie Liangchen.

454
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,480
Sit.

455
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,640
Why did you come?

456
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,560
Don't you have class today?

457
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,320
Yes.

458
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,680
But I heard from Ji Jin that you were injured.

459
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,000
So I'm here to visit you.

460
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,640
How do you feel now?

461
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,240
I'm fine.

462
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,040
Just a minor injury.

463
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,370
It's not a minor injury.

464
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,700
The doctor said

465
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,240
you should have more rest.

466
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,660
Be prepared

467
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
to rest here for a long time.

468
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,800
Not so serious.

469
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,600
Listen to instructions from the doctor.

470
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,680
You have no right to argue.

471
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
I am a medico, right?

472
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,200
You studied medicine to cure others,

473
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,480
not to cure yourself.

474
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,720
I know.

475
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,320
Don't make a fuss.

476
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,520
And you shouldn't be careless about it.

477
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,520
Xie, do you want some water?

478
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,760
No, thanks.

479
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,840
You attended the same military school.

480
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,480
But Xie looks much quieter

481
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,000
than you.

482
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Where are you from, Xie?

483
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,800
Peking.

484
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,560
There are many schools in Peking,

485
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,940
and military schools.

486
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,880
Why did you come to Shunyuan for study?

487
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,320
I like Shunyuan.

488
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
Really?

489
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,920
The situation is so chaotic.

490
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,600
Many people here are bringing their families

491
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,640
to the south.

492
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,360
Shunyuan is the gateway to our country.

493
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,400
Who will protect the home

494
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,160
if they are gone?

495
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,560
Don't preach here.

496
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,120
Xie doesn't talk much.

497
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,920
Shen Junshan.

498
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,330
I want to ask you something.

499
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,760
What's it?

500
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,050
Do you know dismantling bombs?

501
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,920
No, I don't.

502
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,440
Then why did you listen to me?

503
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,050
Anyway, we need to gamble on it.

504
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,120
And

505
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,280
I trust you.

506
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,160
I didn't even trust myself.

507
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,040
Yeah.

508
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,960
So I trust you.

509
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,820
Xie Liangchen.

510
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,200
Don't underestimate yourself.

511
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,840
In fact

512
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,480
you are excellent.

513
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Thank you.

514
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,000
You seem to have a good relationship with Junshan.

515
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,800
Shen Junshan helps me

516
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,720
a lot at school.

517
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,090
I am grateful to him.

518
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,290
Have a good rest.

519
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,440
I'm going back.

520
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Stay longer if you can.

521
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,880
No.

522
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
There are classes in the afternoon.

523
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,130
Goodbye.

524
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,400
Goodbye.

525
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,760
Xianrong.

526
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,610
What are you looking at?

527
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,330
You are not always a busybody, aren't you?

528
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,860
We are classmates.

529
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,060
We need to take care of each other.

530
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,440
Ms. Qu, I'll tell the usher.

531
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,120
Please wait here.

532
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,920
Don't bother.

533
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,640
Stop.

534
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,440
Excuse me?

535
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,160
This is the Arsenal Military Academy.

536
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,240
Only staff can get in.

537
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Can't I get in?

538
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,440
I don't know you.

539
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Don't you know me?

540
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,000
I don't.

541
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,280
I am a girlfriend of soldier.

542
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,120
Someday,

543
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,120
I'll be his wife.

544
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,720
Don't be rude to me.

545
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,600
You know life is difficult as a wife of soldier.

546
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,060
They may die when they go to the battlefield.

547
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,080
I have to take care of the parents,

548
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,440
and the children on my own.

549
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,920
I'm always afraid

550
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
that I would be a widow someday.

551
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,720
It is not easy for you soldiers to marry a wife.

552
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,850
Don't you know that?

553
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,120
If we are broken up

554
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,760
because of you,

555
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,520
you will feel guilty.

556
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,200
Anyway...

557
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,320
As the saying goes,

558
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,760
a marriage is more important

559
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,090
than thousands of gold.

560
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,810
To break the marriage is equivalent to crime.

561
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,400
Can soldiers be criminals?

562
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,640
You can't.

563
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,840
At least you have to register it.

564
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,840
OK.

565
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,440
I will register it.

566
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,440
What's up?

567
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Nothing.

568
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,160
Can't I visit you?

569
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Yes, there is a thing.

570
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,840
I haven't finished yet.

571
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,440
You don't look like you have something to tell.

572
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,840
I really have something.

573
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,480
There's a banquet at Juhaige, Baima Road the day after tomorrow.

574
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,720
You go with me.

575
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,050
Why should I go with you?

576
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,320
I have no relationship with you.

577
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,560
We are lovers.

578
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
Pretended.

579
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,440
Gu Yanzhen.

580
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,000
What are you doing?

581
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,680
Don't bother me.

582
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,280
I tell you.

583
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,160
That's right.

584
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,480
I am handsome,

585
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,040
and outstanding.

586
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,920
But you can't fall in love with me.

587
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,440
I won't be in love with you.

588
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,360
I didn't fall in love with you.

589
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,090
I want you to serve as a stopgap.

590
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,920
Why don't you find someone else for it?

591
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,040
I don't know anyone else.

592
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,600
I just know you in Shunyuan.

593
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,360
The main reason is that you are handsome.

594
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,690
It's good to go with you.

595
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,290
Thank you for compliments.

596
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
Do you affirm it?

597
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,360
No.

598
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,210
Gu Yanzhen. Stop bothering me.

599
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,560
What?

600
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
I told you

601
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
there is no good for you to be with me.

602
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm afraid that

603
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,000
you will be obsessed.

604
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,560
Back now?

605
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
Didn't you hear me?

606
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,520
If I didn't intercede with Sergeant for you,

607
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
you would have...

608
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,810
Where are you going?

609
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,680
What?

610
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,600
Don't force me to it.

611
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,360
Will you go or not?

612
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,200
I won't!
