00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,539
Episode 10

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh, my god.

5
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,479
Jealous, isn't it?

6
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,740
I can't even touch you.

7
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
Are you finished?

8
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,680
Alright. Alright.

9
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,610
I'll go with you.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,720
Great.

11
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,479
No way.

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,280
Why?

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,759
Are there enough rooms?

14
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,280
Yeah.

15
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,250
My sister's house is large.

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,240
It can accommodate ten people.

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,040
Then... I will go as well.

18
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,640
Will you?

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,080
You say the house is large.

20
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,880
Ten people can be accommodated.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
Don't you welcome me?

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,910
Alright. Welcome.

23
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
I wanna go as well.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
I wanna go.

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
I haven't seen the sea either.

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,160
I have never seen the sea.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,640
You can go for a river.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,280
River is different from the sea.

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
You know nothing.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,520
You don't know sea at all.

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,280
You shouldn't go.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Of course I know the sea.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,340
And people know me.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,280
Well.

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,250
You're Song, right?

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,079
Do you know me?

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
Yes. Yes.

38
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,340
The superstar.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,880
See? He knows me.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,460
It's settled then.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,130
We will go together tomorrow morning.

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,079
We need to get up early

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
to take the train.

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,079
No. I can drive.

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,340
You're so excited.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,980
You drive then.

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
Great.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,960
I have something to do.

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,560
Gu Yanzhen.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,460
What a beautiful car you have.

51
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,400
It's good,

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,040
right?

53
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,010
Sit in the front.

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
I wanna sit in the front.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,820
Go away.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,160
OK.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,130
You sit in the front.

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,650
I'll sit in the back.

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,720
Come on.

60
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm coming.

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,920
Xiaojun.

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,040
Thank you.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,079
Be quick.

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,940
You have two big cases.

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,440
Give me.

66
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
That's a trouble.

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,600
Fine.

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,200
Hi, babies.

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,440
Superstar.

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,600
Thank you.

71
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,600
Song.

72
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,640
I have a car of luggage there.

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,680
Help me put it on.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,000
OK.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,120
Yanzhen.

76
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,760
So much luggage.

77
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,740
How to put them?

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,920
Get some ways.

79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,730
Alright.

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,280
My hat.

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,920
Superstar.

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,560
What are in your cases?

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,720
So many stuff.

84
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Not so many.

85
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
Food, clothes and toys,

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,160
some necessaries I need.

87
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,020
I don't expect to borrow from you.

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,360
You are really troublesome.

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,840
Liangchen.

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,090
Do you agree with me?

91
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,410
Not all women are troublesome.

92
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,080
Liangchen.

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,140
Don't you think so?

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,240
Be seated.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,020
Gu Yanzhen.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
So thrilling.

97
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
Yeah.

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Be faster then.

99
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,240
Hold on.

100
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,960
Slow down, slow down.

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Get the fastest.

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
This way, please.

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,080
I'm sorry

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,810
but I'm late.

105
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,800
Fine.

106
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
I came early.

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,520
Tell me.

108
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
Where do you want to play?

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
The city has been visited all over these days.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,080
I want to go somewhere far away.

111
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,320
Far away?

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,800
Where?

113
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,640
I don't know.

114
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,400
Some places with a scenic view.

115
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
Scenic view?

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,820
South Lake,

117
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,280
Qipan Mount, Palace Museum are good.

118
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,650
I have been to all these places.

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,720
I want to go

120
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,370
somewhere with mountains and seas

121
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,080
Mountains and seas?

122
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,850
Panshan County?

123
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
There is a village

124
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
by the sea.

125
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,250
The scenery is good.

126
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,410
You can eat crabs at the moment.

127
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,090
It's just a little far away.

128
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,800
Really?

129
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
So are you busy today?

130
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,520
Not really.

131
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,040
The place is far away.

132
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,480
If we go, we will spend the nights there.

133
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,000
Good.

134
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,720
We can enjoy the sea breeze and crabs,

135
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,360
and watch the sunset.

136
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,720
OK.

137
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's go to Pan Mount.

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,680
My home is near to it.

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
You are back, Song.

140
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm back.

141
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
I'm exhausted.

142
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,400
Come on.

143
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,560
It's close.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,680
You are back, Song.

145
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,280
I'm back.

146
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,620
It's fragrant.

147
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,460
Smells so good.

148
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,880
Sister.

149
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,600
It's irritative.

150
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Sister.

151
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Sister

152
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,880
Song.

153
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,970
Why do you come back?

154
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,080
School holidays.

155
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
I come back to see you.

156
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,159
This is...

157
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,159
These are my schoolmates.

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,880
Wang.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Come out.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,880
We have guests.

161
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,760
Brother-in-law.

162
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,240
Song.

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Come.

164
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,280
You're back.

165
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Your sister talks about you every day.

166
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,460
Where's your brother?

167
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,840
He is busy with his homework.

168
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,400
He didn't come back with me.

169
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,960
It's school holiday.

170
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,220
So I brought them home.

171
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,320
Good.

172
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,080
The house is large.

173
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,240
You can all stay here.

174
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,680
At the evening,

175
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,400
my brother-in-law will buy some food back,

176
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,880
and prepare the dinner for you.

177
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Thank you.

178
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
We like delicious food.

179
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,440
Don't bother, sister.

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
It's very disturbing that we came here.

181
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
You are welcome.

182
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,400
You can stay here at ease.

183
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
The tide will ebb tomorrow.

184
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,040
Let Song take you to the seaside.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
Make the introduction to me.

186
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,880
Allow me to introduce to you.

187
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,760
This is Xie Liangchen,

188
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,490
my good friend in the military.

189
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,400
Hello. Hello.

190
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,300
Your academy allows girls to attend?

191
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,760
Sister.

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
What girl?

193
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
He is a man.

194
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,490
Ridiculous.

195
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,280
Embarrassing.

196
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,140
Sorry for that.

197
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,960
You look so pretty.

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,960
I thought you were a girl.

199
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,549
Pretty.

200
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,440
Good-looking.

201
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,480
Hello, sir.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
This is Gu Yanzhen.

203
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,280
Mr. Gu.

204
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,080
My good friend in the military academy.

205
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,880
Hello, hello.

206
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,200
Hello, hello.

207
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,760
Hello.

208
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,090
This is Tan Xiaojun.

209
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,970
She is the friend of Liangchen,

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
my friend as well.

211
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,010
Nice to meet you.

212
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,400
Hello, hello.

213
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Hello, hello.

214
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,000
This is...

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,760
Well,

216
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,200
let me ceremoniously

217
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
introduce to you,

218
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,880
the superstar from Shanghai,

219
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Ms. Qu, Qu Manting.

220
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,000
Superstar.

221
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,290
You are actress?

222
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,720
Sister.

223
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm a singer,

224
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,640
sometimes acting in movies.

225
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,200
You know, the artists.

226
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,800
We have many activities in Shanghai

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,400
related to...

228
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,160
Sister,

229
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Let's go inside.

230
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,080
The wind was so strong on the way.

231
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,840
And his stupid car didn't have a roof.

232
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
The wind pained my eyes.

233
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,680
It has nothing to do with my car.

234
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
It's the problem of your eyes.

235
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,650
Let's go inside.

236
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
Wang. Lead them in.

237
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
OK. OK.

238
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,680
Alright. Alright. Come.

239
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,760
Come. Let's go inside.

240
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,480
Take luggages.

241
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,960
Stop.

242
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,360
I haven't finished yet.

243
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,160
What do you mean the stupid car?

244
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,640
Shut up.

245
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Why should I shut up? You shut up.

246
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,050
I'll throw you into the sea.

247
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,480
Believe it? I'll throw you into the sea.

248
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,040
I believe. You scared me to death.

249
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,600
Come on.

250
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Go inside.

251
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,280
Come, this way.

252
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Hurry up

253
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
Come, come.

254
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,160
Come on. Hurry up.

255
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,420
We can't pick the room.

256
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,120
Oh, my god.

257
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,240
Xiaojun.

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,460
They eat inside the house.

259
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,420
None of your business.

260
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,960
I tell you.

261
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
The houses at seaside are good indeed.

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,760
But it is windy.

263
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,690
And it is smelly.

264
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,800
Yes, indeed.

265
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,930
And you talk so much.

266
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,280
No, I'm not.

267
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
Where is the toilet?

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,560
No toilet here.

269
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,840
Came here.

270
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,920
I tell you.

271
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,080
You asked for it to come here,

272
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
not forced by others.

273
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
Don't complain so much.

274
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,240
It's impolite.

275
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,880
Did I complain?

276
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Did I complain?

277
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,440
I just wanna go to toilet.

278
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,240
I...

279
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
You are troublesome.

280
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,880
Our home is beautiful, isn't it?

281
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,410
The sea is in front of house.

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,720
Do you like it?

283
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,650
It's beautiful.

284
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
This room has a good view.

285
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I like it.

286
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,160
No one lives here, right?

287
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,040
I will live here.

288
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,900
Don't dream it.

289
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,560
You see my ass is sitting here.

290
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,290
You sleep wherever your ass is?

291
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,020
Be polite. Listen to our host.

292
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,960
Song.

293
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,440
You decide it.

294
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,100
Who should sleep in this room?

295
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,600
I don't care.

296
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,000
You decide on your own.

297
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,920
I'll sleep with Liangchen.

298
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,520
Why do you sleep with Liangchen?

299
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
Why can't I sleep with Liangchen?

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,570
Because it is...

301
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,760
I should...

302
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,400
I should sleep with Manting.

303
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,360
Does Gu Yanzhen sleep with Liangchen?

304
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,880
Yes.

305
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,240
But...

306
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,040
But I want to sleep with Liangchen.

307
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,560
You always want to sleep with Liangchen.

308
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,640
What do you plot?

309
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,360
I plot nothing.

310
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,560
I tell you.

311
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I just want to sleep with Liangchen.

312
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,960
You know. Gu Yanzhen sleeps with Liangchen at school.

313
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,880
Gu Yanzhen will sleep with Liangchen here.

314
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,340
Qu Manting will be with me.

315
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,280
Right, right.

316
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,080
You're right.

317
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Is this room occupied?

318
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Of course we will.

319
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,520
I do not know.

320
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,250
You ask Song.

321
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,880
Song.

322
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I am a girl.

323
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,280
Can I sleep here?

324
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Let me see.

325
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,800
Let the girls stay here.

326
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,280
Hooray!

327
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,560
Crap.

328
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,040
You have

329
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,280
no affection.

330
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,040
Go.

331
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,880
Come on.

332
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,700
Look at the sea.

333
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,360
I'll take you to catch crabs.

334
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,760
You shouldn't talk with Song in that way.

335
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,220
He is a little weird to you.

336
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,000
Does she know that you are a girl?

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,720
No, it's impossible.

338
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
Song is kind of silly.

339
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,730
He won't know it.

340
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
You think she is silly.

341
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,040
I think you are the silliest.

342
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,920
You should be careful.

343
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,160
Someone has slept with you.

344
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't let another person sleep with you.

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,160
What do you mean?

346
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,520
Be careful to your words.

347
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,280
But that's exactly what happened.

348
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,160
Remember it.

349
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,960
Liangchen, Xiaojun.

350
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,720
Hurry up.

351
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,680
Do you hear me?

352
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,810
I have told it to you.

353
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,640
I won't talk.

354
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,640
Keep in mind what I said to you.

355
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Come here.

356
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,740
Qu Manting.

357
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,940
What are you doing?

358
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,480
Qu Manting.

359
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,800
Practice.

360
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,880
What practice?

361
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,880
A master taught me

362
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,360
to remain my youth forever.

363
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,460
You practice it and under a broken umbrella.

364
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,320
You are just afraid of sunburn.

365
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
You know nothing.

366
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,200
Really?

367
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,160
Don't you think

368
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,570
you should come to help?

369
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,480
First,

370
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,060
it's the time for my practice.

371
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,400
Second,

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,760
a fairy never needs to work.

373
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,690
Ugly ones deserve the work to cook.

374
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,090
Alright.

375
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,570
She is such a person.

376
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,440
That's it.

377
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,520
You will find it over time.

378
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,440
It's fine

379
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,360
if so.

380
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,400
You two are annoying.

381
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,980
Stay away before speaking ill of others.

382
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,090
I thought you couldn't hear me.

383
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm not deaf.

384
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,720
Really?

385
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,720
What's up?

386
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,960
What pleasant happened?

387
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,240
You look so happy.

388
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,520
I'm not.

389
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,400
Aren't you happy.

390
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,120
You have been laughing all the way.

391
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
What happened?

392
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,800
Nothing at all.

393
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,660
Tell the truth.

394
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,880
What's the secret?

395
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,320
No one.

396
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,640
Are you in love?

397
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,720
Are you crazy?

398
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,480
They all thought I was a man.

399
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,520
They thought?

400
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,360
They don't know it.

401
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,220
But you know it.

402
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,440
You can date others.

403
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,810
Don't bother me.

404
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,920
Is it Gu Yanzhen?

405
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,360
Are you crazy?

406
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,920
I... I get it wrong.

407
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
You get it wrong or you get mad?

408
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,440
You stuttered.

409
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,560
I think he is good.

410
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,880
Think about his family.

411
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,940
And he is handsome,

412
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,120
funny and humorous.

413
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,960
You get along together all the time.

414
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,090
Is there no any love spark between you?

415
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,520
There is no love spark,

416
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,840
but a lot of hatred.

417
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,840
Boring.

418
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,400
You know me well.

419
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,240
I don't like any trouble.

420
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
Things about love

421
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,320
are not subject to the will.

422
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,360
You don't want trouble,

423
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,320
But trouble comes to you.

424
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
What you say is right,

425
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,730
though you are illiterate.

426
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,560
Am I illiterate?

427
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,880
Yes, you are.

428
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,800
You used to fail the literature exams.

429
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,589
Well.

430
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,400
You are mocking me, aren't you?

431
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,920
Yes.

432
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,880
I will punish you.

433
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,069
I will punish you.

434
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,440
You dare to mock me.

435
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,040
Come here.

436
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,240
I will punish you.

437
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,800
You two lovers who are playing around,

438
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,640
can you think about my feelings?

439
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,829
You are practicing.

440
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,349
Can you think about my feelings?

441
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,240
Look.

442
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,349
You admitted it, right?

443
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,109
What did I admit?

444
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,349
You two are in love.

445
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,160
You are lovers.

446
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,619
I don't want to talk to you.

447
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,720
You are angry and embarrassed.

448
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Am I right?

449
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,640
What are you doing?

450
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,970
You scared my fish away.

451
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,360
You can't catch them.

452
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Of course I can.

453
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,720
You dislike me. I'm leaving.

454
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Where are you heading?

455
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,520
That fool is spearing fish.

456
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,240
Be careful.

457
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,280
Moss is everywhere here.

458
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
It's slippery.

459
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
Don't worry about me.

460
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,560
You are so stupid.

461
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,560
Who?

462
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,520
I said you.

463
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,640
Let go of me.

464
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,400
Do you mean it?

465
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,720
Let me go.

466
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,440
Gu Yanzhen.

467
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,040
Gu Yanzhen.

468
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,090
Don't climb so high.

469
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,320
I can't save you if you fall into the sea.

470
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,720
Qu manting.

471
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,040
Qu manting.

472
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,280
Qu manting.

473
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,560
Qu manting.

474
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
scared?

475
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,620
Are you kidding me?

476
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Gu Yanzhen, I...

477
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,180
Gu Yanzhen. Don't... I...

478
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,280
Gu Yanzhen.

479
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
It's a joke.

480
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,300
Don't take it serious.

481
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Gu Yanzhen. Come back.

482
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
I will be drowned by the tide

483
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,160
If you leave me here.

484
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,800
Gu Yanzhen. I...

485
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,400
Oh, my god.

486
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
Tan Xiaojun.

487
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,360
So heavy you are.

488
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,160
Am I heavy?

489
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Be gentle. It pains me.

490
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Gu Yanzhen.

491
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,560
Don't touch my feet.

492
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,090
You two are in love, aren't you?

493
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,440
Oh, my God.

494
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
Be gentle.

495
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,640
What happened to her?

496
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,840
Her feet got injured.

497
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,800
Tan Xiaojun.

498
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,600
Can't you say some decent words?

499
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,520
My gosh. It's wet.

500
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,440
Disgusting.

501
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,760
I just...

502
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,040
Do you want to figure it out?

503
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,280
Do you want to figure it out?

504
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,240
I care about you.

505
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,760
Why do you yell at me?

506
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,020
I don't need your care.

507
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,320
Oh, my god.

508
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,840
Be gentle.

509
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,160
I'm back.

510
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,200
I'm back.

511
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,580
Liangchen.

512
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,680
What is it?

513
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,520
So much.

514
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,480
Crabs, shrimps and scallop.

515
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,360
Everything.

516
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,960
Are they eatable? Seriously?

517
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,680
You doubt it?

518
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,400
Then you don't eat them later.

519
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,440
You have so many questions.

520
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,040
Girl. Are you against me?

521
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,380
Are you against me?

522
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
Gentlemen shouldn't be rude.

523
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,000
Let go of me!

524
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
I tell you that I'm a fairy,

525
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,320
not a gentleman. Let me go.

526
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,040
Let me go!

527
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,960
I hit you.

528
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,440
You dare to hit me.

529
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,970
There's sand. I'll wash it.

530
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,080
Let me help you.

531
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,610
Let me go!

532
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,060
Are you against me?

533
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,220
Are you against me?

534
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,760
The hand is broken.

535
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,000
Hand is broken.

536
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,960
How is she?

537
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,640
She

538
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,440
is very happy.

539
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,440
Why didn't you have your sister here?

540
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,640
She

541
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,440
is busy.

542
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,720
You can come here with her next time.

543
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I want to meet her.

544
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,960
OK.

545
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,640
It needs a cold compress.

546
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,170
Otherwise it will swell up.

547
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,140
No. It doesn't matter.

548
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,640
Wash it.

549
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,770
It's bad-tempered.

550
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
I'll collect some firewood.

551
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,680
Huang Song.

552
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,600
Pull her away.

553
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,460
Liangchen.

554
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,320
Where are you going?

555
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,880
Let me go!

556
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,360
Gu Yanzhen.

557
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
What happened to Liangchen?

558
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,360
I don't know.

559
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,640
Gu.

560
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,500
Did you bully my Liangchen again?

561
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,040
Well, well.

562
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,440
Your Liangchen?

563
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,600
You just admit it.

564
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,320
This is my home.

565
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,040
This is my home.

566
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
This is my home.

567
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,000
You said this beach was yours.

568
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
The sea was yours.

569
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,960
If so,

570
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,720
Is Shunyuan your city?

571
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,120
It seems you are good at talking.

572
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,960
I'll tell you again.

573
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,840
This beach is mine.

574
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,200
If you want to eat and play,

575
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,960
you have to pay.

576
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,160
If you don't pay,

577
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,420
get out of here.

578
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,650
What's going on?

579
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,000
We make the barbecue.

580
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,080
Then they came

581
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,320
and said the sea and the beach

582
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,960
belonged to them.

583
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,760
We need to pay.

584
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,520
My family lives here.

585
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,120
I don't know this beach belongs to you.

586
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,000
My... my family is here.

587
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,640
Do you live in the sea or on the mountain?

588
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,360
Have you seen him?

589
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,200
No. No.

590
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Have you seen him?

591
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,520
No.

592
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,720
How about your hands?

593
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,960
Be serious.

594
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,840
You're too young to play tricks with me.

595
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,440
Pay for it.

596
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,200
Bro.

597
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,760
You should be reasonable.

598
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,120
Why do we need to pay the money?

599
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,640
Yeah.

600
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,300
Don't talk with them further.

601
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,640
Damn you.

602
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,120
Is there something wrong with you?

603
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,840
What?

604
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,330
Do you want to fight?

605
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,400
This chick is pretty.

606
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,210
She looks familiar.

607
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,120
Damn you.

608
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,720
Beat them.

609
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,240
Beat.

610
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,930
Do you want to fight?

611
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Take this.

612
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
You wanna fight, right?

613
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,480
Fight again

614
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
and I'll kill you.

615
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,940
Bastard. Beat you.

616
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,340
You dare to bully me. Get away.

617
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,200
Song. Beat him.

618
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,080
Manting. Don't be impulsive.

619
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,520
Fight! Fight! Stop! Kick him!

620
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,050
Kick him!

621
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,300
Liangchen.

622
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,330
Are you alright?

623
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,680
You dare to bully me.

624
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,020
Don't you know who I am?

625
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,400
You are a gang of hooligans.

626
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,530
You dare to bully me?

627
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,600
It's him.

628
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,480
Kick him to death.

629
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Kick him to death. Give him a lesson.

630
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,240
Do you know me now?

631
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,360
Do I live here?

632
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,040
Come on. There.

633
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,080
Come on. Be quick.

634
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,280
Come on. Quick.

635
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,200
Fight!

636
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,200
Fight!.

637
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,320
Boss. Our men are here.

638
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,120
Wait for me!

639
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,800
Don't go away!

640
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,600
Hurry up.

641
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,480
Who are they?

642
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,560
Should we proceed to fight?

643
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,720
You came at the right time.

644
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
They did it to us.

645
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,240
Yeah.

646
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,960
They didn't pay the protection racket but beat us.

647
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,560
Beat them.

648
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,160
Wait a second.

649
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,840
Stop.

650
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,280
Do you know who I am?

651
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,800
I'm Qu Manting.

652
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,800
I am a superstar.

653
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,040
Do you know me?

654
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,520
I'll tell you.

655
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,840
Fighting is illegal.

656
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,040
The ones with the pole and the rake.

657
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,160
Do you want to die?

658
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,040
You have more people.

659
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,280
Apologize to me now

660
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,340
and I'll let you go.

661
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,680
It works!

662
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,720
Run!

663
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,920
Run! Run!

664
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
You are great, Qu.

665
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
They all left.

666
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
You are so famous.

667
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,480
Ms. Qu.

668
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,410
Are you alright?

669
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
Who is this?

670
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,480
A fan of Ms. Qu.

671
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
They wait for her

672
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
every night outside the pub. I...

673
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,570
What do you want?

674
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,520
I...

675
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,900
Is it coincidence?

676
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,160
They came with so many people.

677
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,240
Another coincidence?

678
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,680
In this godforsaken village.

679
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,600
Godforsaken village?

680
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,160
It's Xibazi Village.

681
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,820
Another coincidence, right?

682
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,000
Ms. Qu.

683
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Mr. Shen worries about your safety.

684
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,080
It's dangerous for you

685
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,440
to go out alone.

686
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm not alone.

687
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,960
So many people are with me.

688
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,020
Aren't they human?

689
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
What did say, Qu Manting?

690
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,900
I didn't talk with you.

691
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,660
None of your business.

692
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,780
She scolded me.

693
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,900
You must leave now.

694
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,020
Stop following me.

695
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,880
She scolded me.

696
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,440
Qu.

697
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,920
Wait a second.

698
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,940
Why don't you stay for dinner?

699
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,080
There is no restaurant here.

700
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,800
No need.

701
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,890
Please take good care of Ms. Qu.

702
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,440
We will.

703
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,120
Go.

704
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,690
It's fun, right?

705
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,360
I told you.

706
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,040
My lady.

707
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,760
We have offended them.

708
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,760
If they dare to come here for trouble again,

709
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
you get my brother-in-law go to the county and call me.

710
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,880
Don't worry.

711
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,680
They won't.

712
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,640
We are villagers in the same village.

713
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,360
It's fine.

714
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,410
Don't be afraid.

715
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,840
Come to me if any trouble.

716
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Don't come to him.

717
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,120
You can call me.

718
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,300
Thank you, sister.

719
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,000
Alright. Eat the meal.

720
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,130
I'll add some water.

721
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,420
Aren't you angry, superstar?

722
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,160
Liangchen.

723
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,890
Did you get injured?

724
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,520
Let me see.

725
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,450
I'm not injured.

726
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,400
Really?

727
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
What are you doing?

728
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,320
Why don't you care about me?

729
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,520
I am your good friend.

730
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,880
You didn't fight.

731
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
I fought, indeed.

732
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,360
I fought with the shoes.

733
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,880
Really? Let me see.

734
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,440
I injured, really.

735
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,960
Where?

736
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,720
Look.

737
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,660
No injury here.

738
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,920
Are you blind?

739
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,400
Here.

740
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
Here, here.

741
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,960
It hurts.

742
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
Are you all right, Liangchen?

743
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,840
I'm fine.

744
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,640
Song.

745
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,900
Here is really beautiful.

746
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,640
Yeah, not bad.

747
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,080
This house is too old.

748
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,680
Water leaks when it rains.

749
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,840
When I make a fortune,

750
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
I will change the roof of my sister's house.

751
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,300
Don't need to wait.

752
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,420
I'll buy it for you.

753
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,560
Nope.

754
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,620
I earn it by myself.

755
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,320
Stubborn.

756
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,420
Ignore him.

757
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,480
I support you.

758
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,060
Alright, stop pretending it.

759
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
I have a question.

760
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,320
Shen Tingbai is so kind to you.

761
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,970
Aren't you moved by him?

762
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
He is good to me.

763
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,420
But I don't like him at all.

764
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,520
You know.

765
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,000
It's like that you want a bowl of noodles,

766
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,880
but he offers you the meat.

767
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,080
It's annoying.

768
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,690
No, it's not.

769
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,080
I like meat very much.

770
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
I think meat is better than noodles.

771
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,860
I can't communicate with you.

772
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,040
You don't appreciate the blessings that you have.

773
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,170
I can't afford this kind of blessings.

774
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,440
What exactly do you like?

775
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,920
None of your business.

776
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,240
Lie down and sleep. Don't bother yourself.

777
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,480
So heavy you are.

778
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,200
Am I heavy?

779
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,520
Be gentle. It pains me.

780
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,640
I don't know.

781
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,080
Lights on, the night is deep

782
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,680
Breeze blows through windows and doors

783
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,840
Ask from the bottom of the heart

784
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,640
Is the love true

785
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,320
The look in your eyes

786
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,160
Is engraved on my heart

787
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,600
Crystal clear like the moon

788
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,120
Yearnings deepen

789
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,160
So grateful in this life

790
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,480
You're here with me

791
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,920
It's late now.

792
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,330
Why don't you sleep?

793
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,210
I can't fall asleep.

794
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,600
Alright.

795
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,160
I can't sleep either.

796
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,330
I will accompany you

797
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,000
In dream shall we meet

798
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,560
Hope in this life

799
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,880
We'll love and cherish each other

800
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,320
Till death do us part

801
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,680
Don't idle away your youth

802
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,920
Dreams never stop

803
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,000
Hope in this life

804
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,040
We'll love and cherish each other

805
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,840
Till death do us part

806
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,440
Don't idle away your youth

807
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,840
Dreams never stop

808
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,530
I'll bring you some salted fish

809
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,680
when we have holidays next time.

810
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,200
OK.

811
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Thank you so much.

812
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,160
It must have been the people in Xibazi village.

813
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,090
I'll visit them.

814
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
You didn't see it.

815
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,680
They wouldn't admit it.

816
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,140
They went so far as to do it.

817
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,440
Gu Yanzhen.

818
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,440
I should be blamed.

819
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,600
You what?

820
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,880
It's none of your business.

821
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,280
Yes, it's not your fault.

822
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
It's my fault.

823
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
I started the fight yesterday.

824
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
It has nothing to do with you.

825
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,480
Let's report it to the police.

826
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,840
But we have no proof.

827
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,050
We don't need proof.

828
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,800
Report it.

829
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,680
I'll give you a contact information.

830
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,000
You tell them this is

831
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
is Gu Zongtang's car.

832
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,680
Let them deal with it.

833
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,440
Sister, don't be afraid.

834
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,800
His father is a high-ranked official.

835
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,860
The officials here are afraid of him.

836
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,880
The key is

837
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,080
how we

838
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,010
get back today?

839
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,989
Shen Junshan.

840
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,290
Why are you here?

841
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,000
We came here for holiday and the car broke down.

842
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,560
Xiaojun.

843
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,100
We can leave by his car.

844
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,190
His car has a canopy.

845
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,040
Go. Go.

846
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
We're leaving, Liangchen.

847
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,860
Come. Yanzhen.

848
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,400
Huang Song.

849
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,080
Come with us.

850
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,440
Junshan.

851
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,840
Then I'll go with Yanzhen and Liangchen.

852
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,960
Goodbye.

853
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,820
Otherwise, we will be late for the roll call.

854
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,250
Don't worry about that.

855
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,480
My car is much

856
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,840
faster than yours.

857
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,560
Gu Yanzhen.

858
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,560
You shouldn't get angry with Shen Junshan.

859
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,920
Look.

860
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,330
We have no way to go back.

861
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,680
Believe what I said.

862
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,210
I'll take you to fly.

863
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,200
Fly! Fly!

864
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Go to fly!

865
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,280
Slow down.

866
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,770
I'm gonna vomit.

867
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,920
You will get

868
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,320
used to it.

869
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,440
Set up the arena

870
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,920
Mu Guiying

871
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,320
Rides the horse

872
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,080
Good!

873
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,240
Good!

874
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,840
Mr. Guo is here

875
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,360
to see Xiaoyu.

876
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,720
Xiaoyu?

877
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,720
This is...

878
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,640
This is Nianqing.

879
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,000
Hello, Xiaoyu.

880
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,170
Nice to meet you.

881
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,480
I am Pei Nianqing.

882
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,520
Hello.

883
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,400
Xiaoyu.

884
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,800
What do you think of this?

885
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,040
It's good.

886
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,850
What about this one?

887
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,080
It's good, too.

888
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,700
How about this?

889
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,200
Good.

890
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,800
Can you be serious?

891
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,240
I'm serious.

892
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,720
Besides,

893
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,560
I don't know about these.

894
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,170
It's inappropriate for me to see them.

895
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,640
Anyway, you are

896
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,880
a famous

897
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,880
opera actress, right?

898
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,760
I thought you could

899
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,640
help me for this.

900
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,360
Come.

901
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,560
I think this is good.

902
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,800
So

903
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,480
you are sent back?

904
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,560
Exactly.

905
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,050
The treaty has been signed.

906
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
The war at Dayukou

907
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,280
has ended.

908
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,810
There is no battle to fight.

909
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,600
Besides,

910
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,040
my mother

911
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,080
threads me by her death

912
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,840
and doesn't allow me to go to the war.

913
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,520
So

914
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
I come back.

915
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,600
You turn from a sergeant

916
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
into a teacher.

917
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,480
It's a great change for you.

918
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,280
Don't say that.

919
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,880
General Zhang is

920
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,520
an officer studied in Japan.

921
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,240
Arsenal Military Academy

922
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,120
aims to cultivate

923
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,720
fundamental army officers.

924
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,680
I'm not

925
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,620
far way from the battlefield.

926
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,760
Nianqing.

927
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,440
Come.

928
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,520
Shuting.

929
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,240
Shuting.

930
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,960
You are so drunk.

931
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,200
Come.

932
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,680
Why did you marry him?

933
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,400
Slow down.

934
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,480
Slow down.

935
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,240
Tell me.

936
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,320
Why did you marry him?

937
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,680
Slow down.

938
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,800
What's up?

939
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,800
Shuting.

940
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,200
Shuting.

941
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,720
What's up?

942
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,640
Nianqing.

943
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,680
Why did you

944
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,440
have his child?

945
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,920
Tell me.

946
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,440
Did you bear his children?

947
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,480
I'm so sad

948
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
about what you did.

949
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,920
Do you know?

950
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,840
Stop drinking.

951
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,600
Go.

952
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,720
Come with me.

953
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,880
No.

954
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,680
You have to come with me.

955
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,960
Nianqing was there alone.

956
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
She is waiting

957
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,640
for you alone.

958
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,880
She bears your child now.

959
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,120
Come with me

960
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,280
if you are a man.

961
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,080
Go.

962
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,480
Leave me alone

963
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,720
You bastard.

964
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,800
The child is not mine.

965
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Nonsense.

966
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,400
Whose child will it be if it is not yours?

967
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,320
Bastard.

968
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,400
She was raped.

969
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,560
The child is not mine.

970
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,530
What are you talking about?

971
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,340
You're talking nonsense.

972
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,320
Tell me.

973
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,840
Who did it?

974
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,400
Who did it?

975
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,880
Say it.

976
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
I don't know.

977
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,360
I don't know.

978
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,880
There should be several people.

979
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,760
This is all my fault.

980
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,880
I shouldn't have let her wait for me.

981
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,160
It's all my fault.

982
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,660
Does Nianqing know it?

983
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,680
She doesn't know.

984
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,680
She was in a coma.

985
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,960
I told her that

986
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,280
I did it.

987
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,920
So it's the reason

988
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,000
you married her, right?
