00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:28,420
Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,500
Episode 27

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,160
What a pity.

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,360
Hope your loss won't be too large

6
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,640
and hope you catch these thieves soon.

7
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,640
I hope so.

8
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,560
Xianrong.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
Something else is waiting for me.

10
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,120
I must go now.

11
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:45,880
Please.

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,520
See you.

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,840
She looks familiar.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
I might see her before.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,480
Junshan,

16
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,720
do you know her?

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,600
No.

18
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,400
What are you looking for?

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
Is there anything that can help us out?

20
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,760
Does it work?

21
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
You'll know later.

22
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
You're so imaginative.

23
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
Sure.

24
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,520
Come.

25
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,520
Gu Yanzhen. I'm telling you that

26
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,720
if I fall...

27
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,280
I know.

28
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
You won't spare me even if you were a ghost.

29
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Don't worry.

30
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,560
I'll be with you.

31
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,600
Come up.

32
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,520
Hurry.

33
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,600
Still need my words to stimulate you.

34
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,720
They are from Rong Mansion?

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,640
Yes.

36
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,280
We met them before.

37
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,280
They are good fighters.

38
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,880
This time, they were trapped by Japanese.

39
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,070
So they didn't succeed?

40
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,880
They were completely annihilated

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
It seems that something did happen

42
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,960
from the reaction of the Japanese.

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,280
There were another group of people in the museum.

44
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,440
Who will that be?

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,400
Hush!

46
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,280
Where did you go?

47
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,960
Where did you go?

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,760
You mean the killers with pigtails

49
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,680
were all killed by you?

50
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,600
Yes.

51
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,480
The power was cut off suddenly at that time.

52
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
We hurt some of our men wrongly.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,400
But we did kill all the people

54
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,560
of Rong Mansion.

55
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
No one got away.

56
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,760
So these things ran away with legs?

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,280
No.

58
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,680
They must be stolen by someone.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
The day before yesterday,

60
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,440
you asked me

61
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
to kill that student of Arsenal Military Academy.

62
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,120
Xie Liangchen.

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,800
I saw him at the museum.

64
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
He was holding the Royal Seal in his hand.

65
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
Was he alone?

66
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,280
No, he was not.

67
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,040
At least, Shen Junshan,

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,080
your partner tonight,

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,440
came with him.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,760
In terms of other people,

71
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
I am investigating.

72
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,440
I have sent someone to follow Shen Junshan.

73
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,760
As long as our men go there,

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
there is no doubt that we can take the things back.

75
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,280
And also, we can kill all of them.

76
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,040
You're hurt.

77
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,040
You don't need to involve in the action tonight.

78
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,960
The value of these things

79
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,280
equals a big house, doesn't it?

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,560
A house?

81
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,040
It equals a half city.

82
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
Are they really valuable?

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,120
Why hasn't Shen Junshan come back?

84
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,760
He is with Xianrong.

85
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,120
He may arrive at here later.

86
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,120
It's none of your business

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
whether Shen Junshan comes back.

88
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
Jin Xianrong is not pure.

89
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm worried that he may have troubles.

90
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,240
Yes.

91
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,280
Jin Xianrong is not good.

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,280
Do you have evidence?

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,280
Of course I have.

94
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,920
She is the evidence.

95
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
I am the evidence.

96
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,400
There are some problems with Jin Xianrong.

97
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,440
But from how

98
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
she looks at Shen Junshan,

99
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,340
she won't hurt him

100
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,540
even if she is a demon.

101
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,080
Rest assured.

102
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,200
Now, he comes back.

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Our Romeo is back!

104
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,640
Someone is tracking me.

105
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
I have thrown off the follower,

106
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,720
but I checked in with my real name.

107
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,159
They will find me out soon.

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
We must leave here immediately.

109
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,960
You are exposed?

110
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,120
No.

111
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,680
I have told you that Jin Xianrong is not good.

112
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,720
Stop talking now.

113
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,400
Let's go.

114
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,120
Watch out!

115
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,680
Shen Junshan.

116
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,160
I'll cover you.

117
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
You take them to leave.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Chop.

119
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,200
Go.

120
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,280
You leave first.

121
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,030
I'll distract them.

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,150
Let's meet at Arsenal Military Academy.

123
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,760
Be careful.

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
Junshan, get on the car.

125
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,480
Junshan.

126
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Hurry.

127
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,160
Get on the car.

128
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,320
Go.

129
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,480
Gu Yanzhen is still inside.

130
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,240
No need to wait him.

131
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,800
Let's meet at the school.

132
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,600
What brings you by?

133
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,080
I come to see you.

134
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,240
Who are they?

135
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,200
You don't know them?

136
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,480
No.

137
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,440
It seems that Jin Xianrong is good.

138
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,600
It was her who saved us.

139
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,600
Are you stupid?

140
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,000
I said the truth.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,640
What brain do you have?

142
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,640
Do you have any plan?

143
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,800
Where are you going?

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,680
Well.

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
Now find a safe hotel

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,840
and stay at there tonight.

147
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Thank you so much.

148
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,120
It's my pleasure.

149
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,360
Junshan.

150
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,200
What on earth did you encounter?

151
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,400
It's convenient to tell me?

152
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,880
Next time.

153
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,240
I send you back now.

154
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,880
Did you

155
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,560
find your family after that?

156
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,120
Yes, I did.

157
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,600
They left first.

158
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
Are they living with you?

159
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,000
If it's convenient,

160
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,000
I want to meet them.

161
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,520
Meet them?

162
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,120
Don't you think it's too late?

163
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,880
What?

164
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,960
Not convenient?

165
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,720
Well.

166
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,360
It is too late now.

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
They are sleeping.

168
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,160
Maybe next time.

169
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,440
Xianrong.

170
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,800
Are

171
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,000
you working for Japanese?

172
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,800
Why do you ask me this?

173
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,600
Do you really come to see me?

174
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,120
We just met.

175
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,960
I...

176
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,520
Xianrong.

177
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,760
Don't lie to me.

178
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,280
I don't lie to you.

179
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,520
I just got some information that

180
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,680
someone wants to harm you.

181
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,680
Stop.

182
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,600
Junshan.

183
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
Stop.

184
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,680
Junshan.

185
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,520
Junshan.

186
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Junshan.

187
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,280
Excuse me,

188
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
could you tell me which room

189
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,600
the two men and a woman live in?

190
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,640
Two men and a woman?

191
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,800
They are likely living in Room 206.

192
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,480
The stairs are here.

193
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,200
Thank you.

194
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,200
Xie Liangchen.

195
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,960
Xie Liangchen.

196
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,640
Huang Song.

197
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,960
Junshan.

198
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,120
Why are you here?

199
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,040
Where are they?

200
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Don't worry. They are fine.

201
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,120
Xiaoyu came.

202
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,920
She told me that here was not safe.

203
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,600
She took us to leave here.

204
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Manting.

205
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,280
Xiaoyu?

206
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,160
Hush.

207
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I'm worried that you may be in danger,

208
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,120
so I come to you.

209
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,800
Luckily, you are fine.

210
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,880
You thought all of us were in trouble?

211
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,080
So, you have known, right?

212
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,120
I mean Jin Xianrong...

213
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,840
Leave it now.

214
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Let's go.

215
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,360
Where did you plan to go?

216
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,280
Did you try to come to Lieutenant Fukushima?

217
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,440
Miss Jin,

218
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,520
you must forget

219
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
why you came back to China.

220
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
You disappoint the master

221
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
since you forget your hatred

222
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,560
and even your belief.

223
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,320
Belief?

224
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,480
Find your belief in hell.

225
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,600
I become unskilled in my archery

226
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,200
without practice for years.

227
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Where is Peiwen?

228
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,080
Peiwen?

229
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,920
Who is Peiwen?

230
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,160
Your first wife?

231
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,360
We haven't talked

232
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,240
like this

233
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,280
for many years.

234
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,280
Why do you mention

235
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,040
such a disappointing person?

236
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,000
Speaking of the past,

237
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,200
it was she betrayed you.

238
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,360
But

239
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,960
she was used by others.

240
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,760
It was me who should be blamed.

241
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,440
Now she is old.

242
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,520
She has been regretful.

243
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,800
If you wanna blow your steam off,

244
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,080
punish me.

245
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,440
Don't hurt her.

246
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,200
If I didn't hear it from you,

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,920
I won't believe

248
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
these words are from your mouth.

249
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,800
You have changed your character

250
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,240
after experiencing a lot

251
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
or making too many sins?

252
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,720
Now the emperor has given up the throne,

253
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,440
so no one is supporting you.

254
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,280
You are getting timid?

255
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,680
Rong.

256
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,520
Don't call me this!

257
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,200
You want to save her, right?

258
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,120
I give you a chance.

259
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
I remember your

260
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,800
archery was wonderful.

261
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,000
Well.

262
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,680
If you can shoot the centre,

263
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,560
you can take her to leave.

264
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,600
You don't trust me?

265
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,120
Can you release her now?

266
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
My Lord,

267
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,560
the world

268
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,800
has been changed.

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,240
You can't control

270
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,120
everything now.

271
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,720
What on earth did you do to her?

272
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
I did nothing to her.

273
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,320
These sins are

274
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
made by you.

275
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,280
Peiwen.

276
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,560
Peiwen.

277
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,640
Peiwen.

278
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,160
Peiwen.

279
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
Peiwen.

280
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
Peiwen.

281
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,480
You did very well

282
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,320
on this.

283
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,360
I will report everything to

284
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,440
the leaders to ask

285
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,840
some awards for you.

286
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,960
Sir,

287
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
why don't we

288
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,600
swap wine with these

289
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,840
which are pretty valuable?

290
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,400
Get out.

291
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,400
Alright. Go.

292
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,520
What are you looking at?

293
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,200
This one…

294
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,440
What?

295
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,840
This.

296
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,400
This one.

297
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,080
Do you like it?

298
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,960
It's yours now.

299
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,400
Can I take it, sir?

300
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Take it as a souvenir.

301
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,400
Thank you, sir.

302
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,120
Shen Junshan.

303
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,340
You are like a Buddha standing there.

304
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,040
Why do you want to say?

305
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,960
Sir.

306
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,600
Most of them are very valuable.

307
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,100
Some of them

308
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,960
are even priceless national treasures.

309
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,160
So no matter

310
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
which party takes them,

311
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,120
they are doomed to be sold

312
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,400
or missing.

313
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,160
Commander Zhang and Mayor Bai are the same.

314
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,800
What do you want to say?

315
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,280
We trust you,

316
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,960
so we gave them to you.

317
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,680
I hope you don't

318
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,280
let us down.

319
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
The turbulence is temporary.

320
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,560
Peace will come one day.

321
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
At that time people have

322
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,640
spare time and strength

323
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,040
to appreciate it.

324
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,320
I just hope

325
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,920
when it comes,

326
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,840
these treasures still belong to our country.

327
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,440
OK.

328
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,960
I promise you.

329
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,640
Thank you for your help.

330
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,200
I'll leave now.

331
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
Why do you take this?

332
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,800
This is the most worthless

333
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,840
of all things in the bag.

334
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,960
I won't sell it.

335
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,280
You won't sell it?

336
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,400
You won't sell it, so

337
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,640
why do you take something fond of by women?

338
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,880
Do you have a lover?

339
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,200
Ignore him.

340
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,400
Song.

341
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,320
Give it to your sister.

342
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,080
She doesn't like this.

343
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,920
Then keep it.

344
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,960
When the one you love appears, give it to her.

345
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,200
Liangchen.

346
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,800
Do all girls

347
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,920
like this?

348
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,080
Of course. It looks beautiful.

349
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,760
Do you like it?

350
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,760
I'll buy you one if you like.

351
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,360
Junshan.

352
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,080
What did you say to the sergeant?

353
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,080
Nothing.

354
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,920
Liangchen.

355
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,840
I have to leave to deal with something now.

356
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,480
What are you going to do?

357
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,560
To take care of some business.

358
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,320
Liangchen.

359
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
I also have something to do.

360
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,480
See you.

361
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,600
Ask me.

362
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,360
Hurry.

363
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,160
Where are you going?

364
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,040
I have been tired for a whole day.

365
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,280
I want to go back for sleep.

366
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,000
Will you sleep with me?

367
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,920
Why do you come again?

368
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,800
I come to see Xie Xiang.

369
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
She is not here.

370
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,000
Where is she?

371
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,360
I don't know.

372
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,480
Well,

373
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,120
may you leave a message to her?

374
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,560
I'll come tomorrow.

375
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,240
Bye.

376
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,280
Wait.

377
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,280
If you have something, you can tell me.

378
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,880
Why are you standing here?

379
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Ji Jin.

380
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
How long have we known each other?

381
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,520
It's been more than ten years.

382
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,200
Why do you ask me this suddenly?

383
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,200
During these years,

384
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,440
have you ever thought

385
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,200
I have a disease?

386
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,320
Disease?

387
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,080
No, you are healthy.

388
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,560
You are all right, aren't you?

389
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,960
What I mean is...

390
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,040
What do you mean?

391
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,600
Forget it.

392
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,560
Never mind.

393
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
Gu Yanzhen.

394
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,360
Shen Junshan.

395
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,200
Xie Liangchen.

396
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,680
Huang Song.

397
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,200
Come down. I'm here.

398
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,520
Shen Junshan.

399
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,480
Huang... Huang Song.

400
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,800
Hey, super star.

401
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,760
What's up?

402
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,400
I'm wondering that

403
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,800
why you come again?

404
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
Your hearing is the best in this building, right?

405
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,600
This is our destiny.

406
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,640
I don't want to have any relation with you.

407
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,160
Ask them out.

408
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,080
I'll treat them dinner.

409
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,000
I want to take them to have dinner.

410
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,960
Have dinner?

411
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,960
Good.

412
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,960
Take me.

413
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,680
Sorry.

414
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,640
It's an internal activity.

415
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Others are not welcomed.

416
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,200
Am I stupid?

417
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,000
Gu Yanzhen.

418
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,960
Xie Liangchen.

419
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,560
Cheers!

420
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,280
Bottom up.

421
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,760
What's your drink?

422
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,960
It's white spirit

423
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,800
or water?

424
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,720
Water.

425
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,720
Why do you drink water?

426
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,160
Have some liquor.

427
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,120
I don't drink that.

428
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,240
Why not?

429
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,280
The things would be delayed if I drink wine.

430
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Do you have anything to do tonight?

431
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,000
It's my habit.

432
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,760
How annoying.

433
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,720
Quite weird.

434
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,880
Xiaoyu.

435
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,760
Bring you some fruits.

436
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,000
Help yourselves.

437
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,440
OK.

438
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,880
Thank you, Xiaoyu.

439
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,000
Mr. Huo.

440
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,880
How did you find them that night?

441
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,400
I am a businessman.

442
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,440
Of course I have my source.

443
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,680
What?

444
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,720
Are you investigating me?

445
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,920
No.

446
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,800
Just out of my curiosity.

447
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,960
Thank you for your liquor.

448
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,840
Curiosity would kill the cat.

449
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,480
Alright.

450
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,360
Enjoy yourselves.

451
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,880
I'll leave now.

452
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,000
Have a good night.

453
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,760
Bye.

454
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,680
Have a seat. Sit.

455
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,600
Relax and drink.

456
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,240
No, thanks. I have a lot of work to do.

457
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,760
Enjoy yourselves.

458
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,320
It's alright.

459
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,120
Xiaoyu.

460
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,200
Let Xiaojun have a seat.

461
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,240
OK.

462
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,600
Play with them.

463
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,000
Come. Have a seat.

464
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,880
After all,

465
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,480
we did a good thing.

466
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,240
Let's celebrate it.

467
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,520
Hurry.

468
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,920
Let's celebrate it.

469
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,480
Let's celebrate it.

470
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,160
Listen to me.

471
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,240
Be careful when you go out.

472
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,960
They have known who did this.

473
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,600
They have a huge loss, so

474
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,920
they certainly will make up for it.

475
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
They don't dare to do

476
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
as we are at school.

477
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,120
You can't be at school all the time.

478
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,080
So why asked us to be careful?

479
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,880
You should be careful, too.

480
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Don't they know who I am?

481
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,040
Don't they know my family?

482
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,760
How dare they hurt me?

483
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,800
Send them to the hell.

484
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,840
What's your family?

485
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,360
You are almost thrown out of your house.

486
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,560
What family do you have?

487
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,080
Yeah.

488
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,480
You borrowed my money this month.

489
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,840
You borrowed money from Huang Song?

490
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,360
Are you humane?

491
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,720
Why do you believe him easily?

492
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,960
Of course I believe him. Borrow from me next time.

493
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,680
Sweetheart. I have money.

494
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,120
Drink more.

495
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,560
No, thanks.

496
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,080
Come. Let's play the dice.

497
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,680
I won't join.

498
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,320
It's boring.

499
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,720
What are you doing?

500
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,800
Every time you are like this.

501
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,280
I got a big one with all my luck.

502
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,960
Put it back.

503
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,760
Come on. One more time.

504
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,520
The atmosphere is hot here while

505
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,240
he is just sitting quietly.

506
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,680
What?

507
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,240
Is he trying to play as a poet?

508
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,640
It's so annoying.

509
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,960
Junshan.

510
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Come and drink.

511
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,160
Don't be isolated.

512
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,680
If I am not welcomed,

513
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,800
I'll leave now.

514
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,560
Besides, I'm not interested in that.

515
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,320
Alright.

516
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,040
Leave him alone.

517
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,840
Don't force him.

518
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,710
Did I force him for asking him to drink?

519
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,880
What else can we do except drinking?

520
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,960
Listen to the music?

521
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,760
If you want to listen to music,

522
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,560
I'll invite a singer to

523
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,630
sing for you face to face.

524
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,880
Are you sure you'll drink with me?

525
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,520
Good man.

526
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,840
I am scared of no one in my life.

527
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,600
Xiaojun.

528
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,440
Take all the liquors.

529
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,150
Give me the strongest.

530
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,080
Go.

531
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,120
Choose the best drinker?

532
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,080
No.

533
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,000
It's better to play the dice.

534
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,640
Stop drinking.

535
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,920
Don't stop

536
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,280
men' s talking.

537
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,240
Have your fruits.

538
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,920
Liangchen.

539
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,840
He said you are not a man.

540
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,320
Drink with him.

541
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
Why doesn't make him drink with you?

542
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,000
I can't.

543
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,160
Give me something to eat.

544
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,720
Here are the liquors.

545
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,760
Come.

546
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,600
Let's play the hardest one.

547
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,160
Come.

548
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,720
Drink this.

549
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,000
You drink with the bottle.

550
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,360
The Shen's has a good custom.

551
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,480
He can still be sober

552
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,560
after drinking with many people.

553
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,680
Is it exaggerated like what you said?

554
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,480
Yes.

555
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,640
His grandma is the best.

556
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,240
It is not a story that she is never drunk.

557
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,700
She drinks liquor as water.

558
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,400
Even their dog

559
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
wants to drink in the morning.

560
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,600
My cat drinks more,

561
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,800
but it is never drunk.

562
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,440
When I first met you, you were like a drunken dog.

563
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,320
Did you say Mr. Shen wasn't a good drinker?

564
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,120
I saw he was drunk.

565
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,520
How much did he drink?

566
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,360
I don't know.

567
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,360
Junshan,

568
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
stop it if you can't drink.

569
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,120
It's late now.

570
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,080
We should go back.

571
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,240
Go.

572
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,840
When he is unconscious.

573
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
When I am unconscious?

574
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
It's easier to kill me.

575
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,800
Come.

576
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,880
Junshan. Are you alright?

577
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,800
So you can't drink.

578
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,680
What happened?

579
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,040
He only drank one glass of liquor.

580
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,440
Is he pretending himself?

581
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,440
You said people of his family

582
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,840
are all good drinkers.

583
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,120
Other people are good drinkers.

584
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,160
But I don't know he is so weak.

585
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,800
Alright.

586
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,600
Stop talking now.

587
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,320
What?

588
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,240
I didn't ask him to drink.

589
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,120
I'm sleepy. I'll go back.

590
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,920
Send me home.

591
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,720
I won't.

592
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,320
Hurry.

593
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,700
No.

594
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,220
Be quick.

595
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,200
Gu Yanzhen, send me home.

596
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,960
You go back alone.

597
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,640
Manting.

598
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
I fell down.

599
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,320
It hurts.

600
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,680
Send her home.

601
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,640
It's too late.

602
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,520
What if she encounters troubles

603
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,000
on the way home?

604
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,960
Dude,

605
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,280
I can tell that she is pretending.

606
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,960
I can tell it, too.

607
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,520
You'd better send her home.

608
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,160
I'm dizzy.

609
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,720
Listen, don't be close to him.

610
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,440
Won't you go?

611
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,280
Yes.

612
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,200
Help me.

613
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,120
Song.

614
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,600
I send her home.

615
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,400
Help me to take care of her.

616
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,480
OK.

617
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,480
Well, see you.

618
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,320
Take care.

619
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,040
Be careful.

620
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,560
Take care of Junshan.

621
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,520
Junshan.

622
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,680
Are you all right?

623
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,800
Junshan?

624
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
Am I crazy?

625
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,160
Coming.

626
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,800
Coming.

627
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,160
Help me.

628
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,800
What happened?

629
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,960
He's drunk.

630
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,080
Did he drink?

631
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,120
Who asked him to drink?

632
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,200
He bragged like he is the god of liquor.

633
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,480
But the fact is that he's drunk with one glass.

634
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,640
He is allergic to alcohol.

635
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,680
He can't drink even a sip,

636
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,520
not to mention a glass.

637
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Do we need to send him to hospital?

638
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,640
It won't be a big deal.

639
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,840
Let him have a rest.

640
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,280
Take care of him.

641
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,200
I'll go back now.

642
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,440
Liangchen. Wait.

643
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,680
My family has something urgent.

644
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,640
I need to go out now.

645
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,600
Could you help me to take care of him?

646
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,120
OK.

647
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,800
Deal with your own business.

648
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,480
I'll wait for you here.

649
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,240
Thank you.

650
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,880
No worries.
