00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,460
Episode 38

4
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
Awesome!

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,410
Haven't you recognized me?

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,180
But I've known who you are.

7
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,600
Xiang!

8
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,360
Xiang!

9
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,160
Miss, see you!

10
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,079
Xiang!

11
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,620
Did you know that long ago?

12
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,620
Is this a collusion between you two?

13
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,240
Shen Junshan said

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,320
he wanted to invite Xie Xiang

15
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,600
and me to the ball.

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,240
I thought you had never been to a Mask Ball,

17
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,640
so here we are!

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
Tan Xiaojun! You'll give me away!

19
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,400
Xiang…

20
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,020
Xie Liangchen!

21
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,160
What are you doing there?

22
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm waiting for you.

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,560
I brought you some food. Come on.

24
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,620
Xie Liangchen!

25
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,480
What are you doing there?

26
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm waiting for you.

27
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
I brought you some food.

28
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,960
Come on.

29
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,620
Still can't recognize me?

30
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,900
But I've known who you are.

31
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,240
Do I look scary?

32
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,770
Why don't you look at me?

33
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,440
No.

34
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,200
Unless,

35
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,370
you have secrets in your heart.

36
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
Has he doubted me since then?

37
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,460
Liangchen,

38
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,220
does she have a boyfriend?

39
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,920
I don't think so.

40
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,970
That's good.

41
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,720
I intend to court her.

42
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,080
What? What did you say?

43
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,160
I said,

44
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,260
I intended to court her.

45
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
You only met her once,

46
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
how can you have the thought?

47
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,490
I don't know why,

48
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,760
but I felt familiar with her.

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,160
I need to go out now.

50
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
Please ask for a leave for me.

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,400
Okay.

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,290
Where are you going?

53
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
To find Xie Xiang.

54
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,600
Who?

55
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,800
Xie Xiang.

56
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
It's rare to be free today.

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,100
I want to visit her.

58
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,980
Have you repaired the pipes in your room?

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,690
If it is broken again, come and find me.

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,060
You have finished?

61
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,240
You came so late that all the meat

62
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
has been eaten up.

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,960
What's wrong?

64
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,920
Nothing.

65
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,460
Xie Liangchen.

66
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,720
Button up your clothes.

67
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,050
Take care of your looks.

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,820
Don't do that.

69
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,300
Liangchen!

70
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,060
What's wrong with you two?

71
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
What?

72
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,020
You and Xie Liangchen.

73
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,720
Something is strange between you two.

74
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,200
Is it?

75
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,650
I don't think so.

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,660
Xie Liangchen.

77
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,290
You're back.

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm going to see your sister.

79
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,980
Do you want to come with me?

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
What for?

81
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,170
That's a secret.

82
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,280
Do you?

83
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,960
No.

84
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,360
I need to do the laundry.

85
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,320
Then I'm leaving now.

86
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Xie Xiang!

87
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,570
Why are you here?

88
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,850
I came to see you.

89
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,340
I want to ask you one thing.

90
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,010
What's that?

91
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
Do you dislike me?

92
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,440
Or…

93
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,909
No.

94
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm too young

95
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,210
to think about this kind of things.

96
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,260
Aren't you twins with Liangchen?

97
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
You two should be at the same age.

98
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,320
I don't want to talk about this now.

99
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,200
I think

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,660
it's better for us to be just friends.

101
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
I have to go to school every day.

102
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,240
And there are a lot of works for me to do.

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,720
Does your brother disagree?

104
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,450
That's fine.

105
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,250
Don't worry.

106
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,460
I'll go ask him.

107
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,360
Shen Junshan!

108
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,800
An Wen,

109
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,970
the rent should be paid this month.

110
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,970
Please wait.

111
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,360
Mr. Landlord.

112
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,240
Ji Jin.

113
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,140
Liangchen.

114
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,880
Where is Junshan?

115
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,940
He was back to room.

116
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
What's so urgent?

117
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,970
I'm here.

118
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,850
Go ahead.

119
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,840
What?

120
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,900
Aren't you looking for me?

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not.

122
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Who told you this?

123
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,210
Is there anything else?

124
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,320
No.

125
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,400
No.

126
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,290
Then I'm going to sleep now.

127
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,170
Welcome,

128
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,080
sir.

129
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,140
Want some flowers?

130
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,920
What kind of flowers do you want?

131
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm not sure.

132
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,480
Is it a gift?

133
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,520
Yes.

134
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,880
To a friend.

135
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Must be a girl.

136
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,940
How about rose?

137
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,520
Girls love roses.

138
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,640
Or lily.

139
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,210
Girls love lilies, too.

140
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,400
Well,

141
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,320
a bunch of each.

142
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,240
OK.

143
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
Wait a moment, sir.

144
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,890
Alright.

145
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,640
Come in.

146
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,180
Liangchen.

147
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm going to see Xie Xiang.

148
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,040
Do you…

149
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,400
What again?

150
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,040
For something.

151
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,210
Come with me?

152
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,640
No.

153
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,000
OK.

154
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
Then I'm going alone.

155
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,940
Liangchen,

156
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,450
does your sister

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,440
like roses

158
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,720
or lilies?

159
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,240
Tell me.

160
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,400
Roses or lilies?

161
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,720
Roses?

162
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,520
Lilies?

163
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,520
No! She doesn't like

164
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
any of these!

165
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,460
Liangchen,

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
what's wrong?

167
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,040
Junshan!

168
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,610
Junshan!

169
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,760
Junshan!

170
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,880
Junshan!

171
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,000
Junshan!

172
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,840
Hey!

173
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,050
Why do you

174
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,160
invite me for coffee today so suddenly?

175
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm done.

176
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,840
What?

177
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,400
Why?

178
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,300
Miss, what do you like?

179
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,440
Americano, please.

180
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,920
OK.

181
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,980
One moment please.

182
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,890
Tell me clearly.

183
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,020
What happened?

184
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,840
Shen Junshan

185
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
seemed to know my secret.

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,880
He has gone to the Girls' School twice for Xie Xiang.

187
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,740
And he said he wanted to court her.

188
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,930
Help me figure out a way!

189
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,760
I should meet him

190
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,000
every day in the Academy.

191
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't even know how to face him now.

192
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,890
Tan Xiaojun!

193
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,280
What are you laughing at?

194
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
I'll break up with you if you keep doing this.

195
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,200
You're not done.

196
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
You're obviously

197
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
falling.

198
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,200
Miss,

199
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,560
- Your coffee. - You're so mean.

200
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,490
Enjoy yourself.

201
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,840
Alright,

202
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,600
seriously,

203
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,760
when did you find out that Shen Junshan knew it?

204
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,320
Besides,

205
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,840
even if it is,

206
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,360
the one he wanted to court

207
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,200
was the Xie Xiang in Xinhua Girls' School.

208
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,530
Not you, Xie Liangchen.

209
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Don't mention it.

210
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,240
Recently,

211
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
when I was alone with him at Academy,

212
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,140
he said something to me

213
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,600
and I didn't take it seriously.

214
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,080
I thought it was just a chat

215
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,210
between classmates and good friends.

216
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,130
Besides,

217
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,600
I've never shown any flaws before.

218
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,440
I don't know why

219
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
he wanted to see me in the Girls' School that day.

220
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
I had to run between the Girls' School and the Academy.

221
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
It occurred to me these days

222
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,840
that he had an insinuation in his words.

223
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
Go ahead.

224
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,680
And,

225
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,920
on the Mask Ball,

226
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,920
he took off my mask and said,

227
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,920
"Haven't you recognized me?"

228
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,520
"But I've known who you are."

229
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Why don't you tell me

230
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,200
such an important thing?

231
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,920
Tell you?

232
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,180
I want to blame you now!

233
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,490
It was you who wanted to go to that ball.

234
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,850
You're to blame.

235
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,040
You stay with him day and night.

236
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,240
Maybe it was you who slipped your tongue accidentally.

237
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,200
He wanted me to invite Xie Xiang,

238
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
not Xie Liangchen.

239
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,440
Fine.

240
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
You're right. OK?

241
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,780
So what should I do now?

242
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,720
Are you sure he did recognize you?

243
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,920
Stands a good chance.

244
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,960
Since

245
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,520
he has recognized you,

246
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,560
he will pay more attention

247
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,280
to you and protect you.

248
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,450
Xie Liangchen.

249
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,310
Button up your clothes.

250
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,640
Take care of your looks.

251
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,200
Therefore,

252
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,069
you have to be careful not to get

253
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,869
too close to the boys around you.

254
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,520
Who do you mean?

255
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,069
Gu Yanzhen!

256
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Hasn't he always been courting you?

257
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,310
Look,

258
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,920
one is the son of a business tycoon,

259
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,720
the other is the childe of a government family.

260
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,320
Perfect.

261
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,560
You can be protected and looked after

262
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,160
at school.

263
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,160
Well.

264
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,200
Which one do you prefer?

265
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,960
Tan Xiaojun,

266
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,330
I'm asking you for help.

267
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,960
Are you

268
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,890
making fun of me?

269
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,440
Seize the moment of happiness

270
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,680
to love and be loved.

271
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,320
What…

272
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,040
From Tolstoy.

273
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,200
Xiang,

274
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,200
I know that

275
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,440
you always have arguments

276
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,970
and fights with Gu Yanzhen.

277
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
But I know you have feelings for him.

278
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,160
Or why are you being

279
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,640
so scared when Shen Junshan

280
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,170
said he wanted to court you?

281
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not what you think.

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,920
Fine.

283
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,140
I know you're confused right now.

284
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,240
But I think what you should do now

285
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,960
is to make a decision by your heart.

286
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,440
Gu Yanzhen

287
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,930
is the first one who has known your secret.

288
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,480
Only you know what he

289
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,520
has done for you and what position

290
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,480
he holds in your heart.

291
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,240
And Shen Junshan,

292
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,520
we all know what kind of man he is.

293
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,880
You've been together for so many days

294
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,120
and experienced so many things.

295
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,530
Your relationship with Gu Yanzhen and Shen Junshan,

296
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,940
is like the coffee in this cup.

297
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,380
You are the only one

298
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,460
who know it is sweet or bitter.

299
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,880
Mr. Landlord.

300
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,440
Why are you here again?

301
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,240
Why do you always come for money?

302
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm here for the rent.

303
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
What's wrong?

304
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,740
Is your house rent charged every day?

305
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,440
I passed here yesterday

306
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
and I saw that you gave him the rent.

307
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,810
Why again today?

308
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,560
I…

309
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,200
An Wen,

310
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,040
don't listen to this boy.

311
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,920
He must have heard about you from somewhere

312
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,580
and came to you deliberately.

313
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,480
Well…

314
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,770
Don't listen to him!

315
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,800
I still got something to do.

316
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,440
I, I…

317
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
I will come tomorrow.

318
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,000
Thank you.

319
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,920
Come in.

320
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,200
OK.

321
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,000
Would you like something to drink?

322
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,960
No, thanks.

323
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
Well, help yourself.

324
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,160
Tell me if you like something,

325
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,560
I can pack them up for you.

326
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,240
OK.

327
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,520
Well,

328
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,000
you really don't remember that

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,930
you've given him money yesterday?

330
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,920
I don't.

331
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,140
How could it be?

332
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,040
I hurt my brain when I was a child.

333
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,080
My memory became poor since then.

334
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,740
I always forget the bad things

335
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,800
and bad people.

336
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,380
Is this an illness?

337
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,860
Can it be cured?

338
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,920
No, it can't.

339
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,860
But it doesn't matter.

340
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,200
I will write down every important

341
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,680
people and thing on this book.

342
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,800
I read it every morning

343
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,330
then I can keep them in mind.

344
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,040
My name is Xie Liangchen.

345
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,800
Xie Liangchen.

346
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,120
Please wait a moment.

347
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,320
Look here.

348
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,480
Later I'll put your photo on this book,

349
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,970
then I can remember you.

350
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
That's not enough,

351
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,160
you should remember who is the bad guy

352
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,820
and who have bullied you, too.

353
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,000
I have bad brain

354
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,880
even can't remember my friends,

355
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
if I use my poor memory to remember those bad people,

356
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,770
it will be too tired.

357
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,680
Fine.

358
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,560
Junshan.

359
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,980
Liangchen.

360
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,740
Teacher Li is looking for you.

361
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,040
OK.

362
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,560
Mr. Li,

363
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,980
are you looking for me?

364
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
Go pack your things up

365
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,690
and move to room 103.

366
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,640
Why?

367
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,280
I heard some rumors

368
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,280
about you and Gu Yanzhen.

369
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,080
Sir,

370
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,770
it's not what you think.

371
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,100
No need to explain.

372
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,780
I know it's not your fault.

373
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I'm doing this for you,

374
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,480
in case of more troubles.

375
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,040
Sir…

376
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,240
What?

377
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,260
You don't want to move?

378
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,200
Do you really…

379
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,400
No.

380
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,160
I got it.

381
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,180
Liangchen.

382
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,010
Did you have fights with Gu Yanzhen again?

383
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,560
No.

384
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,010
Then why do you have to change your dormitory?

385
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,560
I think

386
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
you'd better wait until Gu Yanzhen

387
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,480
is back.

388
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,280
No, it's OK.

389
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,960
Alright.

390
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,320
It's up to you.

391
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's go.

392
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,680
Mr. Gu,

393
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,960
this is your dessert.

394
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,560
Xie Liangchen,

395
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,160
why did you change your room?

396
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,880
Need any help?

397
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,520
No, thanks.

398
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,240
Fine.

399
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,170
Then we are leaving for dinner now.

400
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,060
Liangchen.

401
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,780
They are all packed up.

402
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,040
Let's go to have dinner, too.

403
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,880
I'm not so hungry.

404
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,800
You can go first.

405
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,280
OK.

406
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,440
See you later.

407
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,400
Close the door for me.

408
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,920
OK.

409
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,720
Come in.

410
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,800
Well,

411
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,920
how is your new room?

412
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,560
Was it you who told Mr. Li?

413
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,680
Yes.

414
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,600
Why did you do that?

415
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,720
Now the rumors of you and him

416
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,920
is spreading so fast.

417
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,440
Don't you care about that?

418
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,260
We are classmates,

419
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,070
and friends.

420
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,640
And I have a good relationship with your sister.

421
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,000
It's not a big deal.

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,720
Unless,

423
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,720
you two are really…

424
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,840
Of course not!

425
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,700
Are you satisfied with your new room?

426
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,280
Yes.

427
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,330
That's perfect.

428
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Have you seen Xie Liangchen?

429
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,760
No.

430
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,000
Have you seen Xie Liangchen?

431
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,560
No.

432
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,920
Have you seen Xie Liangchen?

433
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,780
No, we haven't.

434
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,760
Have you seen Xie Liangchen?

435
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,440
No.

436
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,320
Are you crazy?

437
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,880
What?

438
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,450
Where is Xie Liangchen?

439
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,240
How could I know where she is?

440
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,760
What did you do again?

441
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
Her things are taken away.

442
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
Did you give her away?

443
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,400
Hands off me.

444
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm not scared of you.

445
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,040
I'll finish you today!

446
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,160
Wait! Stop!

447
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,760
Li Wenzhong! Li Wenzhong!

448
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,640
Stop it! Stop!

449
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,700
Stop the fighting!

450
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,340
What's wrong with you?

451
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,270
He is being a dog!

452
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,320
You won't say where Xie Liangchen is, will you?

453
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,800
I…

454
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,890
Xie Liangchen's room was changed!

455
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,320
He has moved?

456
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,320
To 103.

457
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,960
I just helped him to move.

458
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,220
Gu Yanzhen?

459
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,580
This is the end?

460
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,860
Why did you stop me?

461
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,500
I should have killed him!

462
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
I was going to wait

463
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,240
for you to come back and tell you about it before moving.

464
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,300
Was it Shen Junshan who made you move?

465
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,160
Was it him?

466
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
No, it was me.

467
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,280
Now there is a lot of gossip about us.

468
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
I don't like that.

469
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,620
Gu Yanzhen!

470
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,620
Gu Yanzhen!

471
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,240
Stop!

472
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,720
I think we need to have a talk.

473
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,660
Gu Yanzhen!

474
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,820
Let go of me!

475
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,940
Gu Yanzhen!

476
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,780
Gu Yanzhen!

477
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,680
Why don't you go to the class?

478
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,920
What's wrong with him?

479
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,250
Who provoked him again?

480
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,280
Let's go.

481
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,450
All the grass has withered.

482
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,200
Pull them all

483
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,360
and throw them away.

484
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,040
We don't need them all.

485
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,100
What are you doing?

486
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,480
The grass here

487
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
is all dry to death.

488
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,560
The Academy want to change them

489
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,490
to the new grass.

490
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Now?

491
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,080
No.

492
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
We'll come again tomorrow.

493
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,740
The tools are not enough here.

494
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,280
Hurry up! Pull them up all!

495
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,940
Throw them.

496
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,200
So,

497
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,640
are you falling in love with him?

498
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,280
I don't know.

499
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,000
Then now you have moved out

500
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
and lived in a room by yourself.

501
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Are you used to it?

502
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,320
I don't know how to say it.

503
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,920
But I always feel that the room is empty.

504
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,440
It seems that

505
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,000
you're attracted to him.

506
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,920
Forget it.

507
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,800
What about you?

508
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
How are you doing?

509
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm still the same.

510
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,460
Don't you know that

511
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,340
the tavern will be closed?

512
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,400
Closed?

513
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,290
But the time is still early.

514
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,280
It's out of business.

515
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Won't open again.

516
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,760
Why?

517
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,640
Let me tell you secretly.

518
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,380
Xiaoyu seems to be going to do something big.

519
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,240
Many people I don't know came here

520
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,370
every day recently.

521
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,160
I guess

522
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,720
she wants to avenge Liu.

523
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,440
Avenge?

524
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,200
Xiaoyu is not an ordinary person.

525
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,730
You should have known that.

526
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,210
Then what about you?

527
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,840
I won't come here for work from tomorrow on.

528
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
I've worked here for so long.

529
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,640
It's such a pity.

530
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,840
Where is my birthday gift?

531
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,170
Your gift is that apple.

532
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,760
Who gives others an apple as a birthday gift?

533
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,720
It's too late.

534
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,360
Where can I buy a gift for you?

535
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,620
What about I give you

536
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,360
the button?

537
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,560
No.

538
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,840
You lost your button?

539
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,460
Where is it?

540
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,720
Seek it.

541
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,120
The look in your eyes

542
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,600
Is engraved on my heart

543
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,280
Crystal clear like the moon

544
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,560
Yearnings deepen

545
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,800
So grateful in this life

546
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,000
You're here with me

547
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,960
I love you.

548
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,400
No one can stop that.

549
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,370
My father can't.

550
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,409
Shen Junshan can't.

551
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,190
You also can't.

552
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,170
Don't try to get rid of me for your life.

553
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:49,150
Hope in this life

554
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,800
We'll love and cherish each other

555
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,320
My bad!

556
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,670
I was kidding you.

557
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Don't get angry.

558
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Burn it!

559
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,880
Dreams never stop

560
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,600
Put me down!

561
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,920
Gu Yanzhen!

562
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,240
You bastard!

563
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,040
What?

564
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,640
Bastard!

565
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,120
Then the bastard is taking you home.

566
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,880
You're here with me

567
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,480
Wind brings back the memory

568
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,900
Xie Liangchen,

569
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,810
happy birthday!

570
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,040
You know what I mean!

571
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,640
We'll love and cherish each other

572
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,840
Till death do us part

573
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,600
Don't idle away your youth

574
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,920
Coming.

575
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,400
Junshan,

576
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,980
what's the matter?

577
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,760
I have an appointment with your sister.

578
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,960
Do you want to join us?

579
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,370
An appointment with my sister?

580
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,760
Why don't I know that?

581
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,180
Does she tell you everything?

582
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Not all of them.

583
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
Well, when?

584
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,730
Sunday noon.

585
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,840
I'll go pick her up at her school.

586
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,100
Can you come together?

587
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,800
No.

588
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,060
I have something to do.

589
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,160
OK.

590
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,380
Then we can be together next time.

591
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,050
I'm leaving now.

592
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,920
Bye.

593
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,200
Welcome, sir.

594
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,720
Do you want some flowers?

595
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,320
Pick one bunch for me.

596
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,400
Is it going to be a gift?

597
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,080
Yes.

598
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,120
Well,

599
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,600
how about the lilies?

600
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,920
They arrived just this morning.

601
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,760
And they can last ten days after taking them home.

602
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,690
They smell good.

603
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,800
That's ok.

604
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,760
Alright.

605
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,400
Would you like some more carnations?

606
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,730
The color is beautiful.

607
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,160
Fine.

608
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,040
OK.

609
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,690
Then let me pack them up for you.

610
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,600
Well,

611
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,580
don't you remember me?

612
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,880
No, I don't.

613
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,960
Fine, pack them up for me.

614
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,800
Okay.

615
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,010
Why are you here?

616
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,040
Me?

617
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,400
Can't I buy flowers?

618
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,360
Do you

619
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,920
know the boss here?

620
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,080
Why do I feel something is wrong with her?

621
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,760
Wrong?

622
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,800
She is kind of…

623
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,160
That…

624
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,520
Can't she recognize you?

625
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,740
You must have bullied her.

626
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
I, I just scared her once that day.

627
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,940
And she can't remember anything.

628
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Her name is An Wen,

629
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,600
something bad happened to her

630
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,730
when she was a child.

631
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,920
So she got an illness since then

632
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,400
that she always forgets things,

633
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,600
especially the people who is bad to her.

634
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,100
She will forget that soon.

635
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,620
Is there this kind of illness?

636
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,800
I don't know.

637
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,600
Why should I tell you this?

638
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,160
You know what,

639
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,560
don't bully her anymore.

640
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,610
Xiaojun.

641
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,880
I decided to tell him everything tomorrow.

642
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,450
I want to tell him my real identity.

643
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,730
Are you sure?

644
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,860
I thought that I could hide

645
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,400
until I graduate.

646
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,200
But now it seems

647
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,120
that I can't hide it from Shen Junshan anymore.

648
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,850
I'm afraid the later I tell him,

649
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,120
the more I hurt him.

650
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,320
Hurt?

651
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,600
For so long,

652
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
he has been taking care of me,

653
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,940
protecting me,

654
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,420
and even saved my life.

655
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,160
He has been treating Xie Liangchen as his classmate

656
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,020
and companion.

657
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,220
But no one expected

658
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
the things to reach

659
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,040
such a crucial point.

660
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
I don't want to deceive him anymore.

661
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,440
Xie Xiang,

662
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,680
what do you want to do?

663
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,420
Do you think the people who know about it are not enough?

664
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:32,880
Xiaojun,

665
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,090
as you've said to me,

666
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,890
Gu Yanzhen or Shen Junshan,

667
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,690
I have to make the decision.

668
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,280
Now I have known my feelings

669
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,040
and what choice I should make.

670
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Although Gu Yanzhen

671
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,660
always has fights and arguments with me,

672
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,120
sometimes he even did something

673
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,290
to make me angry.

674
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,690
But later I found out

675
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,420
that he was a childish person.

676
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,040
At first I didn't understand

677
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,090
what was going on

678
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,900
between me and him either.

679
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,250
But after we have experienced so much,

680
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
even almost died,

681
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
I figured out

682
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,200
that before I knew it,

683
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,560
there has been no one else

684
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,520
to replace him in my heart.

685
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,160
Then what about Shen Junshan?

686
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,490
Shen Junshan treated me

687
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,330
like how my brother would treat me.

688
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,650
He always appeared when I needed help.

689
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,220
And the longer it goes,

690
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,120
the stronger it feels like this.

691
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,000
Maybe I have been apart with my brother for a long time.

692
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,120
But I thought

693
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,800
if I could tell him what I really

694
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
feel one day earlier,

695
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,440
I could end this tangle

696
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,970
and hiding one day earlier.

697
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,340
Did you book seats of Jinhua Hotel tomorrow?

698
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,040
Don't go there then.

699
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,250
Let me book the seats of Lide Hotel for you.

700
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,440
Why?

701
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,220
The Japanese will hold a meeting there

702
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,220
at noon tomorrow.

703
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,440
Hiroshi Miyazawa and Haruka Takeda of the Japanese Military,

704
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,120
and Hai Kikugawa, the representative of the Japanese COC

705
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,520
will attend the meeting.

706
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,880
They will discuss the situation of the west of Liaoning with the Commanders.

707
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
I got the news that

708
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,520
Oda Xianrong will also attend.
