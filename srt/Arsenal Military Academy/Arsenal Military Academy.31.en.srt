Arsenal Military Academy

2
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 31

3
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,120
Xie Liangchen.

4
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Where is Junshan?

5
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,479
He left hospital.

6
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,400
He left?

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,160
When?

8
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,120
Just now.

9
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,560
Mrs. Shen and his brother were here.

10
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
He wanted to wait for you.

11
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,840
But Mrs. Shen was afraid that

12
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,500
someone would harm him again.

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,120
So they left in a rush.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,600
Also,

15
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,900
his brother asked me to thank you.

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,320
He will send his gratitude personally

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,120
after he deals with these works.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,920
Can he leave hospital in his current condition?

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,250
Don’t worry about this.

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,520
We have a family doctor.

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,800
Doctor Liu also followed them back.

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,330
The environment is better than the hospital.

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,090
That’s fine.

24
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,750
Let me send you back to school.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,800
No, thanks.

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,860
I can go back alone.

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
You must be very busy now.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
I can take care of myself.

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,920
OK.

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,960
See you.

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,079
Here.

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,360
Wonderful.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
Come on. Have a rest.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Take some fruits.

35
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,900
You eat first.

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,440
Let me finish this part first.

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
Rome wasn’t built in a day.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
It won't take you much time.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,240
Come on.

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,560
Manting.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Please come here.

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,640
Manting!

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
Mr. Jin will arrive soon!

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,120
I know!

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,200
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,860
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
Remove Gu Zongtang from office.

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,880
Remove Gu Zongtang from office.

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,000
Kick out of the traitors!

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,320
Kick out of the traitors!

51
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Remove Gu Zongtang from office.

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,120
Remove Gu Zongtang from office.

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,360
Kick out of the traitors!

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,760
Kick out of the traitors!

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

56
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,840
Kick out of the traitors!

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
Kick out of the traitors!

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,320
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,880
Kick out of the traitors!

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,280
Kick out of the traitors!

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,760
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,280
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Kick out of the traitors!

66
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,720
Kick out of the traitors!

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,960
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm afraid others will be arranged

69
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,520
to live with you after I leave,

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,520
especially that Li Wenzhong.

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,850
I always suspect that he knows something.

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
If you like Shen Junshan,

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,160
apply to the sergeant to

74
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,010
let him live in our dorm.

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,520
If he is here,

76
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,490
you won't be bullied by others.

77
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,760
Object to Twenty-one Treaty.

79
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,070
Remove Gu Zongtang from office.

80
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,870
Remove Gu Zongtang from office.

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,440
One, two, three, four.

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,200
One, two, three, four.

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,180
Gu Yanzhen!

84
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,480
Gu Yanzhen!

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,560
Where is Gu Yanzhen?

86
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,220
Gu Yanzhen?

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I didn¡¯t see him.

88
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
Do you know where he went?

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,650
I don't know.

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
What's so funny?

91
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,560
Zhu Yanlin.

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,260
Hey guys,

93
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,440
this is the young traitor's bed.

94
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,500
Let's flip it over.

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,220
What are you doing?

96
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,040
IT is none of your business.

97
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,820
Get out. Go.

98
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,350
Who gives you right to touch others¡¯ things?

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,140
Put it down.

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,060
Put it down. That¡¯s mine.

101
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,800
Burn it!

102
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,240
Stop!

103
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,960
Burn it!

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Listen to me!

105
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,680
The two traitors have gone.

106
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,640
But they can't escape anyway.

107
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
We must let them know our anger.

108
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,020
They must know that

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
traitors deserve the worst result.

110
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,000
Now let's  burn all of the things here.

111
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:08,640
Burn it!

112
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,040
Are you all crazy?

113
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,400
Ignore him. Go ahead.

114
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,880
Get out of the way.

115
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
I don't.

116
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Do you think I don't dare to burn you?

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Have a try.

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,730
Then don't blame me.

119
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,600
Burn it! Burn it!

120
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:54,120
Burn it! Burn it!

121
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,400
Mr. Gu.

122
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I's time to leave.

123
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,400
OK.

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,600
Qiqi.

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,240
Ask your brother to come.

126
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,680
Yanzhen.

127
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,000
Dad!

128
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,040
Dad!

129
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,880
Burn it! Burn it!

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,669
Didn't you come to me?

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,909
Come on.

132
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,400
Let's go.

133
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,860
How dare you come back?

134
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,440
Mates. Come on.

135
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Didn't you leave?

136
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,320
If I had left,

137
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,840
you would have been burnt to death by those idiots!

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,480
Xie Liangchen. Xie Xiang!

139
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
What is in your brain?

140
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,440
Water?

141
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,720
You told me

142
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,610
this was the last photo of you and your mom.

143
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
I was going to leave.

144
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,720
I was going to leave you to him.

145
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,200
But now, I go back on my words.

146
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,240
Xie Xiang. This is because of you.

147
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Listen.

148
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,680
I love you.

149
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,680
Nobody can stop me.

150
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,160
Not my father.

151
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,040
Not Shen Junshan.

152
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,080
And neither can you.

153
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't try to get rid of me for your life.

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,560
We'll love and cherish each other

155
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,120
I love you.

156
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,560
Don't idle away your youth

157
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,520
Dreams never stop

158
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,920
You are just better. Put down your book.

159
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,000
Have more rest.

160
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,220
My body is stiff after a long-time lying.

161
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,520
You were hurt severely this time.

162
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
It's better for you to follow the doctor's words,

163
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,080
since you almost lost your life.

164
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,360
Mom is here.

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Don't make her angry.

166
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,380
Is mom alright?

167
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,770
She is fine when she's with you.

168
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,120
I saw her wiping her tears

169
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
outside just now.

170
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,490
She was scared to death due to your injury.

171
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,570
When will father come back?

172
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,160
Next month.

173
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,760
I have arranged staff to protect him.

174
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,160
Everything will be fine.

175
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,580
I'm worried about you.

176
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,770
I heard from Ben that

177
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,540
your surgeon

178
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,000
was found by Oda Xianrong?

179
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,240
Yes.

180
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,280
It seems that the one

181
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,850
who sent people to kill you was not her.

182
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,840
It's no wonder.

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,040
No wonder what?

184
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
At the night when you were attacked,

185
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,640
Oda Hideyuki died.

186
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,560
How did he die?

187
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,780
Officially, he was attacked by a killer.

188
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,620
But I don't believe it.

189
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,600
Oda Hideyuki was cautious.

190
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,840
And a lot of guards were with him.

191
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,920
How could he die like that?

192
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
And the Japanese COC

193
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
dealt with this in a rush.

194
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
His body was burnt in a hurry.

195
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,700
They didn't even organize a funeral for him.

196
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,460
The Japanese garrison was not informed.

197
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,960
After his bone ash was sent back,

198
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,420
they announced this news.

199
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,240
Is it weird?

200
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Only one person has the ability

201
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,040
to kill Oda Hideyuki secretly

202
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,520
and deal with these quietly.

203
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
Of course,

204
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
this is only my guess.

205
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,240
No matter what happened,

206
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,880
you can't take a risk.

207
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
The Twenty-one Treaty has been signed.

208
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,060
The Japanese sent more troops to Feng an.

209
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,460
It seems that the Japanese

210
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,360
wants more than that.

211
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,480
Our family is always holding that idea,

212
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,920
the war will come

213
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,400
sooner or later.

214
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,520
But we never change

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,360
our standpoint.

216
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,160
I know.

217
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
By the way.

218
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
I heard that

219
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,720
Xie Liangchen saved you.

220
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,320
Yes.

221
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
He broke in the Japanese COC,

222
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,700
and almost lost his life at there.

223
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,420
He is a good friend.

224
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,120
Invite him over to have dinner someday.

225
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,660
Mom wants to meet him, too.

226
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,040
We should thank him personally.

227
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,760
OK.

228
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,980
What brings you by?

229
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,760
I just have a walk to kill time.

230
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,690
What are you doing here?

231
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,840
Nothing.

232
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
The air inside is stuffy.

233
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,520
So I went out.

234
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,320
I heard that something happened at school.

235
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,400
You know it?

236
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,970
During these years,

237
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,080
everything can happen.

238
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,800
It is possible that

239
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,200
people like Gu Yanzhen

240
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,320
become beggars one day.

241
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,520
What beggars?

242
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,050
What are you talking about?

243
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm silly.

244
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,930
I'm not good at talking.

245
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,380
Liangchen.

246
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,370
I find that you always speak for him recently.

247
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,850
You two have made peace?

248
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,760
Who spoke for him?

249
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,240
I didn't

250
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,410
It seems that you are in a good mood.

251
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
You have been showing a long face these days.

252
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,200
But you don't tell us what is disturbing you.

253
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,720
What?

254
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,780
Is your thing done?

255
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,960
Almost done.

256
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,770
Almost done.

257
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,120
By the way,

258
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,240
I also borrowed money from Xiaojun.

259
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,300
Junshan was attacked, so I forgot it.

260
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
Do you still need money?

261
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
I'll ask her to borrow me some if you need it.

262
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,600
No, thanks.

263
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
The money is enough.

264
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,540
That's enough.

265
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,680
Look at how triumphant you are.

266
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,080
What?

267
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,840
Did you become wealthy?

268
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Don¡¯t forget me if you are wealthy.

269
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,560
What's wrong?

270
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,320
Are you hurt?

271
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,400
It's fine.

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,680
I don¡¯t believe it.

273
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,280
I just touched you slightly.

274
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,710
Why is your face bruised?

275
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,770
Did you fight with others?

276
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,630
No, I didn¡¯t.

277
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,040
I just bumped against somewhere.

278
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,720
Where did you bump against?

279
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,680
I...

280
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,440
A door.

281
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,130
I bumped against a door.

282
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
What a silly boy!

283
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,069
Cover your bruise with a cold towel

284
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,069
when you are back.

285
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,010
Otherwise, we will see a painted face tomorrow.

286
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,760
What is the matter of that?

287
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
I don¡¯t care my appearance.

288
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,080
Ridiculous.

289
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,600
The moon is so round tonight.

290
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,480
So many bad things happened during this month.

291
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,970
Hope next month can bring us good luck.

292
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,920
Dear Xiang,

293
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,040
good morning.

294
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,560
The hot water is in the kettle.

295
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,680
Don’t use cold water,

296
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,100
otherwise you will have a stomachache.

297
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,200
Love, Yanzhen.

298
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,800
The toothpaste is on your toothbrush.

299
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
I begin to miss you.

300
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,280
Yours, Yanzhen.

301
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,340
Your shoes have been polished.

302
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,360
Did I do a good job?

303
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,360
Can I be an ideal husband?

304
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,000
Your affectionately, Yanzhen.

305
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,050
Song, why do you have a bruise in your eyes?

306
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,600
Do I?

307
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,280
Yes.

308
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,960
It’s fine.

309
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,890
Liangchen. Liangchen.

310
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,120
Here. Here.

311
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Hurry up.

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
Liangchen.

313
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,280
Why do you arrive so late?

314
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,640
I got up late.

315
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
I’ll take the breakfast now.

316
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,760
I have taken it for you. Come.

317
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,520
Gu Yanzhen.

318
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,480
You said you took two portions because of hunger.

319
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,800
Do you think I am you?

320
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Come now.

321
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,100
- I can take breakfast by myself. - Come.

322
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,880
Come to eat.

323
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Come.

324
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,320
Come here.

325
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,040
Come now.

326
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,160
Hurry up.

327
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,860
Come on.

328
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,480
I have washed chopsticks for you.

329
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,940
Come on.

330
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,960
Thank you.

331
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,960
No worries.

332
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,520
How can you do such hard work?

333
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,380
Let me help you.

334
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,960
I can do it myself.

335
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,620
It’s fine. I like shelling it.

336
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,940
Gu Yanzhen.

337
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,500
Help me to shell it.

338
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,880
Yanzhen.

339
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,200
And Liangchen.

340
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,320
I'm afraid I need to

341
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,720
explain one thing to you.

342
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,960
Yanlin and I

343
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
have known what happened to you yesterday.

344
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,050
But we didn't know because we were absent.

345
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,330
If we had been there, we would help you.

346
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,960
Right.

347
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,520
Are you angry with us?

348
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,680
Well.

349
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,040
I help you to shell the egg for Liangchen.

350
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,760
OK.

351
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,290
Why don't you eat the shell?

352
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,000
Stop joking.

353
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,760
I finished.

354
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,660
Come on.

355
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,040
Eat.

356
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,880
I lost my appetite suddenly.

357
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,960
You have to.

358
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,240
Breakfast is the most important meal.

359
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,520
Come on. Eat.

360
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
Open your mouth. Let me feed you.

361
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,680
What's wrong?

362
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,820
Are you choked?

363
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,460
Are you all right, Liangchen?

364
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,640
Give me that. - This...

365
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,240
This was taken by me just now.

366
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,320
The cup is new.

367
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,960
Mate.

368
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,480
Come on.

369
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,960
Have a drink.

370
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,160
Drink some water.

371
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,800
Idiot.

372
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,840
Don't hurry.

373
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,520
You're like a kid.

374
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,080
No.

375
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,900
What¡¯s wrong?

376
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
What's going on?

377
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,760
Nothing. Nothing.

378
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,460
Xie Liangchen.

379
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you crazy?

380
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,480
You.

381
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,800
Get out.

382
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,120
You.

383
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,800
Go with him.

384
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,240
Qu...

385
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Manting.

386
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,600
Do you want to make me mad?

387
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,340
It¡¯s not easy that your business becomes better.

388
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,360
Look at you.

389
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,640
What did you say?

390
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,440
What did I say?

391
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,560
Did I say something wrong?

392
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
These journalists

393
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,240
are all bastards.

394
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,800
They only follow the powerful ones.

395
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,080
The chaotic situation is what they like to see.

396
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,760
Gu Yanzhen has been severely bullied by the comments.

397
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,520
The fight with his neighbour when he was a kid

398
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,040
becomes a stain in his life.

399
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,160
Can they stop it?

400
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,560
That is too much.

401
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,640
Listen.

402
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,340
I showed them my good manner

403
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,680
just for your sake.

404
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,340
Otherwise, the journalists who

405
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,480
slander Yanzhen most

406
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,340
won¡¯t walk

407
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,360
out of here.

408
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
Manting.

409
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,680
This is a dangerous move. Do you know it?

410
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
You are in trouble now.

411
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,880
You need them to be popular again.

412
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,160
I don't care.

413
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,560
I can bear other things.

414
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,090
But I can't bear that they bully my boyfriend.

415
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,810
But he doesn't think he is your boyfriend.

416
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,760
He will be mine.

417
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,130
What are you arguing on?

418
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,840
Mr. Shen.

419
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,080
You are here finally.

420
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,280
Please persuade her.

421
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,320
Don¡¯t worry.

422
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,200
These journalists won¡¯t write casually.

423
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,340
Mr. Huang invites them to have dinner at Wintersweet.

424
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,540
You are invited, too.

425
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,440
Really?

426
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,760
I thought you would be mature

427
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,690
after you came back from Shanghai.

428
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,680
But nothing changed.

429
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,840
You are a riffraff actually,

430
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,320
like a rascal.

431
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Who do you say is a female rascal?

432
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,840
You.

433
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,600
Do you remember

434
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,760
the hardest time of our family?

435
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,970
My grandpa passed away.

436
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,680
The business corrupted.

437
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,920
My uncles only paid attention on the asset,

438
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
which was published on newspapers.

439
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,280
I was in middle school that time.

440
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,610
My classmates judged me secretly.

441
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,340
How old were you?

442
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,000
You were shorter than a table.

443
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,120
You took your dad¡¯s sword,

444
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,200
and stood in front of our school.

445
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,380
You threatened those who judged me

446
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,920
to cut them into pieces.

447
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,320
The little you!

448
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,250
They were all watching you.

449
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,650
But you were not afraid.

450
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
Do you remember?

451
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,760
That¡¯s impossible.

452
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,620
You were wrong.

453
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,660
I couldn¡¯t do such stupid thing.

454
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,090
Was this stupid?

455
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
It was quite cute.

456
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,600
I like that Qu Manting most.

457
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,200
Manting.

458
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,220
Do you really like Gu Yanzhen?

459
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,880
Yes.

460
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
I like him.

461
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,720
Alright.

462
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
I¡¯ll talk to your dad

463
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,700
to cancel our engagement.

464
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,300
Why are you surprised?

465
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,470
I won¡¯t force you if you don¡¯t agree.

466
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,880
I am not a bandit.

467
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,480
Wait.

468
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,280
I didn’t think you could agree to cancel

469
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,520
our engagement so easily.

470
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,940
It seems that you are not very sad.

471
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,600
You must not love me.

472
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,700
Don¡¯t find excuse for yourself.

473
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,400
Aren¡¯t you afraid that

474
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I break my words to prove I really like you?

475
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,360
Don¡¯t.

476
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,160
You are a generous man.

477
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,220
A generous man should keep his words.

478
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,570
You will understand in the future.

479
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,450
Sadness is not necessarily shown on the face,

480
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,570
and happiness doesnt necessarily need a result.

481
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,520
I¡¯m different from you.

482
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,720
I must get what I like.

483
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,000
Although I didn¡¯t have it

484
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,040
and I don¡¯t have it now,

485
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,480
I will have it one day.

486
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,560
You are lucky that we are different,

487
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,290
otherwise you will be unhappy.

488
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,400
Thank you,

489
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,440
Shen Tingbai.

490
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,610
You're welcome.

491
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,960
Liangchen.

492
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,600
Xie Liangchen.

493
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,240
Xie Xiang.

494
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,080
Why don¡¯t you speak?

495
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,280
Did you hear me?

496
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,680
Go out for dinner with me.

497
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,080
Are you dumb?

498
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,040
Song!

499
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,280
Liangchen?

500
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,120
What¡¯s wrong with your leg?

501
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,320
I... I got sprain.

502
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,320
Where did you go?

503
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,780
Did you fight with others?

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,680
No, I didn't

505
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,200
I couldn¡¯t fight.

506
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,210
You didn¡¯t?

507
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,290
What¡¯s wrong with your mouth?

508
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,330
You have been stealthy these days.

509
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,320
Zhu Yanlin said that you were not in dorm for several nights.

510
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,250
Where did you go?

511
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,680
You are lucky that Sergeant Lv has not been here,

512
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,940
otherwise you would have been expelled.

513
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,720
I have some personal things.

514
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,650
What personal things can you have?

515
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,800
Song.

516
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,800
Tell me if you have difficulties.

517
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,880
I will help you out.

518
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,410
Don’t  hide them from me.

519
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,720
Liangchen.

520
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,320
I don't have difficulties.

521
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,240
I will tell you if

522
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,920
I need help.

523
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,680
Alright.

524
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,720
Let¡¯s go.

525
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,400
Go.

526
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,800
OK. Let me help you.

527
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,200
Let me describe

528
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,260
this scene for you.

529
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,600
Cai Ji¡¯s sister asks you out

530
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
to persuade you to leave him.

531
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,240
But you don¡¯t want to.

532
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,840
So she is very angry and

533
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,360
begins to humiliate you.

534
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,160
She even throws water into your face.

535
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
You are very grieved

536
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,720
and want to cry,

537
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,680
but you have to hold your tears.

538
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,440
Feel this character¡¯s mood.

539
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,440
OK. Sir.

540
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,400
Well, who will play Cai Ji¡¯s sister?

541
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
We will begin.

542
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,680
Time¡¯s up.

543
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,840
Where is she?

544
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,440
She¡¯s here.

545
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,240
Mr. Sheng.

546
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,840
Miss Qu. Miss Qu.

547
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,880
I¡¯m so sorry

548
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,840
that I¡¯m late.

549
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,120
Don¡¯t say that.

550
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
I am very delighted that

551
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,560
you can sing the OST for this movie.

552
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,800
And now it¡¯s my huge pleasure

553
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,920
that you can be a guest player in it.

554
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,560
Thank you. I am flattered.

555
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,520
You, a talented director

556
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
who studied overseas, have a bright future.

557
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,200
Everyone is dying to cooperate with you.

558
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,040
If this movie hadn¡¯t began to be shot,

559
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,760
I would attend the audition

560
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,490
to try to play the leading role.

561
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,520
Really?

562
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,600
Keep your words.

563
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,200
When I invite you to play the leading role next time,

564
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,240
don¡¯t refuse me.

565
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,570
Don¡¯t forget that.

566
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
I am eager to get this chance.

567
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,040
Fine.

568
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,120
Hi, Pingting.

569
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,400
It¡¯s easy.

570
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,480
Just combine yourself with this character.

571
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,000
Thank you.

572
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,840
No worries.

573
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,480
Mr. Sheng.

574
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,010
Someone comes to visit you.

575
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,000
Miss Qu.

576
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,080
I have something to deal with.

577
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,480
My assistant director will direct

578
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,880
this scene.

579
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,160
I think it won't have problems.

580
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
It's alright?

581
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,080
Alright. It is fine.

582
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,720
Go on with your business.

583
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,080
OK.

584
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,480
Play as what we agreed.

585
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,160
OK.

586
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,440
Miss Qu.

587
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,400
Are you ready?

588
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,560
We will begin now.

589
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,960
I¡¯m ready.

590
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,160
OK. Thank you.

591
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
OK. Come on.

592
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,840
Stand by.

593
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,650
Rolling.

594
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,800
The eleventh scene of Clouds, Rain and Flowers

595
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,190
The first time of one camera.

596
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,630
Come on.

597
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,800
Three, two, one.

598
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,360
Action.

599
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,230
I really love him.

600
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,730
What do you mean?

601
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,550
I think these are enough.

602
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,650
Oh my god. What's wrong?

603
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,770
What are you doing?

604
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,080
Director!

605
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,360
Cut. Stop.

606
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,630
Miss Yuan.

607
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,900
What¡¯s wrong?

608
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,520
Sir.

609
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,600
I just think

610
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,220
I should be very angry

611
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,360
when Cai Ji¡¯s sister humiliates me.

612
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,620
In this way, this scene is more dramatic.

613
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,760
You are playing a gentle and kind lady.

614
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
The sister of your loved man¡¯s

615
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
is sitting in front of you.

616
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,200
You should be grieved

617
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,440
and beg to stay by his side

618
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
when she humiliates you.

619
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,280
Let¡¯s play by the script, OK?

620
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,920
OK.

621
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,700
Miss Qu.

622
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,480
I¡¯m so sorry.

623
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,280
Once again.

624
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,880
Excuse me?

625
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Please fix makeup for Miss Qu.

626
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,800
Hurry up.

627
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,960
Everyone, one more time.

628
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,490
The second time.

629
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,120
Come on.

630
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Three, two, one.

631
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,600
Action.

632
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,960
I really love him.

633
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,600
What do you mean?

634
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,280
I think these are enough.

635
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,480
Cut.

636
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,280
Yuan Pingting!

637
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,360
Did you do this deliberately?

638
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,440
Lady Yuan.

639
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,500
You promised me to play by the script.

640
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,080
Sir.

641
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,520
I thought you meant play

642
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
by the script changed by me.

643
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,030
Maybe I misunderstand.

644
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,040
Sorry.

645
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,960
Manting.

646
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,320
Miss. Qu.

647
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,360
I am really sorry.

648
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,480
Maybe she didn¡¯t get

649
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,400
what I meant.

650
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,560
Let me explain it to her again.

651
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,520
Have a rest and fix the makeup.

652
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
Hurry. What are you thinking about?

653
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,080
Hurry.

654
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Take the cup away.

655
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,880
Miss Yuan. Script.

656
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,440
What are you thinking about?

657
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,040
Rolling.

658
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,160
The third time of the eleventh scene.

659
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,600
Come on.

660
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,700
Three, two, one.

661
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,440
Action.

662
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,400
I really love him.

663
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,520
Stop dreaming.

664
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,850
Who do you think you are?

665
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,620
What are you doing?

666
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,140
Are you wronged for I slapped you?

667
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
Don¡¯t forget who you rely on

668
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
to gain this success.

669
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,860
You are just a social girl.

670
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,160
You gain fame in an indecent way.

671
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,680
How dare you be so arrogant

672
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
when you begin to be on the right way?

673
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,800
I warn you.

674
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,640
You¡¯d better know your place.

675
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,480
If you still make troubles for me,

676
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,880
I¡¯ll kill you.

677
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,600
Cut.

678
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,280
Miss Qu.

679
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,720
Wonderful.

680
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,640
I¡¯m really surprised.

681
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,250
Didn¡¯t you see?

682
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,760
That¡¯s good.

683
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,800
Call it a day.

684
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,480
Call it a day.

685
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,160
Call it a day.

686
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Miss Qu.

687
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,120
You played really well.

688
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,000
You opened up my horizon.

689
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,720
I am flattered, Mr. Sheng.

690
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,000
You must

691
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,840
play the leading role in my next film.

692
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,680
Mark your words.

693
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,280
Don¡¯t make me wait for long.

694
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,280
OK. OK.

695
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,560
You can go back. See you.

696
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
OK. See you.

697
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,620
Pingting. I¡¯ve called a cab.

698
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,200
Where is it?

699
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,320
Don¡¯t you know you should prepare the car in advance?

700
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,050
I won¡¯t forgive you next time.

701
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,840
Manting. It seems that you are happy today.

702
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,520
You know why.

703
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,880
So where are we going?

704
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
I¡¯m in a good mood.

705
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,200
Go to Arsenal Military Academy.

706
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,260
To see Mr. Gu again?

707
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,720
It¡¯s none of your business.

708
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Just drive.

709
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,280
I win.

710
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,800
Huang Song.

711
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Give me money.

712
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,130
Can you think before your leap?

713
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,400
Couldn¡¯t you tell that he was waiting for this card?

714
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,640
I thought he gave it out.

715
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,440
Well.

716
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,200
Don¡¯t talk jibber-jabber.

717
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,000
Give me money.

718
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,160
I don¡¯t have money.

719
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,560
Give me one more sticker.

720
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,980
The moneybags Yanzhen and Junshan are not here.

721
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,970
It¡¯s boring to play with you guys.

722
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,760
Liangchen.

723
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,320
Where is Gu Yanzhen?

724
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
I haven¡¯t seen him for two days.

725
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,960
Right. I miss him.

726
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,880
I don¡¯t know.

727
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,800
I think after Sergeant Lv left,

728
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,330
this school will collapse.

729
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,160
I don¡¯t know where Sergeant Guo is.

730
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,200
Two days ago, I heard that

731
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,280
the guys in the Class One

732
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
pissed off the new sergeant.

733
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,400
They¡¯re playing with fire.

734
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,680
When Sergeant Lv is back,

735
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,880
no one can get away with it.

736
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,140
- That¡¯s right. - Yes.

737
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,810
Why do you have to

738
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,400
play cards in my dorm?

739
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,090
Can¡¯t you go back to yours?

740
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,440
If you are caught by our sergeant,

741
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,680
I will be punished together.

742
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,440
We are sacrificing our time

743
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,560
to company you.

744
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
We don¡¯t want you to be lonely.

745
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
- Yes. - Right.

746
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,800
Well, thank you.

747
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,160
Every time after you left,

748
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,280
I had to clean my room for one hour.

749
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,440
I don¡¯t feel lonely.

750
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,280
Look,

751
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,320
that¡¯s the result that we want.

752
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,040
Yes.

753
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,500
We have achieved our goal.

754
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,440
It¡¯s so weird that

755
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,680
Gu yanzhen and you

756
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
were like fighting cocks,

757
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,280
fighting every time you met.

758
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,240
But he treats you well recently.

759
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,080
He takes food

760
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,320
and water for you.

761
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,360
Also, he serves you goodies.

762
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,280
Right.

763
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,680
We won¡¯t come

764
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,760
if there are no goodies.

765
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,320
Right.

766
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,040
Yes.

767
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,200
Liangchen. What happened?

768
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,130
Why are you so close now?

769
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,860
Do you become sworn brothers?

770
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Don¡¯t blather.

771
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,640
He is way out of my league.

772
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,880
I can¡¯t be his sworn brother.

773
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,920
Others can¡¯t,

774
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,560
but I think you can.

775
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,280
He treats you quite well.

776
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,320
Stop talking.

777
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,080
Hurry up.

778
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,440
Shuffle the cards.

779
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,560
Hurry, shuffle the cards.

780
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:33,920
Go on.

781
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,800
Come on. Hurry.

782
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,980
What¡¯s the sound?

783
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,400
What¡¯s the music?

784
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Let¡¯s go and see.

785
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,800
Let¡¯s go.

786
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,040
Let¡¯s go and see.

787
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,400
What¡¯s it?

788
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,200
Wait.

789
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,050
It¡¯s played by Gu Yanzhen.

790
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,000
Look. Gu Yanzhen is playing.

791
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,000
Gu Yanzhen!

792
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,420
What are you doing?

793
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,600
Gu Yanzhen!

794
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,240
You played well.

795
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,360
One more.

796
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,220
Come on. One more.

797
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,480
Another song.

798
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,120
I just play one song

799
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,320
to someone very important.

800
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,840
Someone very important?

801
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,700
Who is it?

802
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,680
Who is it?

803
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,640
Can¡¯t you tell it?

804
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,600
Miss Qu comes.

805
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,600
Qu Manting?

806
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,880
- Super star! - Miss Qu!

807
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,960
Xie Liangchen!

808
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,280
Happy birthday!

809
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,230
My mom didn't have hobbies,

810
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,280
but she liked birthdays.

811
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,320
She bought music instruments on her birthdays.

812
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,680
In our family,

813
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,740
“Happy birthday” means “I love you.”

814
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,120
You know what I mean!
