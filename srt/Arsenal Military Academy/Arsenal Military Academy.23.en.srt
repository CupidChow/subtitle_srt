Episode 23

4
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,000
Miss Yuan!

5
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,800
Miss Yuan!

6
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,160
So pretty!

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,530
You're amazing, Miss Yuan!

8
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,000
Miss Yuan!

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,130
Look here. This way.

10
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Miss Yuan!

11
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,280
Look here, Miss Yuan.

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,079
Miss Yuan!

13
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,920
Look here, Miss Yuan.

14
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,600
Miss Yuan!

15
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,600
Tao,

16
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,300
my shoes are dirty.

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,490
Wipe them for me.

18
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,400
Pingting,

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,560
they're fine.

20
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
Just do what I say.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,660
No more questions!

22
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,820
Yuan Pingting,

23
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,370
how dare you put on airs!

24
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,520
Not as daring as you.

25
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,170
You dare to steal Dong Huiseng's daughter's fiance.

26
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,980
Dong Huiseng was furious.

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,980
Mr. Duan wasn't his match.

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,960
I'm afraid from now on,

29
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,040
I won't be able to see you at work.

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
Did I tell you to get up?

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,360
Continue.

32
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Yuan Pingting,

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
are you holding a grudge?

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,440
Grudge?

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
I have no grudge.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,560
Those losers

37
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,360
don't deserve my time or energy.

38
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
I'm talking to you

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,440
simply for fun.

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,640
You should watch

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,320
who you're talking to.

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,680
Mr. Shen.

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Who is this woman?

44
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,200
Baihua Film Studio

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,240
sent Miss Yuan Pingting

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,530
to replace Ms. Qu

47
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,170
to perform in Shunyuan.

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
Who authorized that?

49
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,120
Well...

50
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,680
From now on,

51
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,800
I don't want to see this woman in Paramo again.

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,320
Yes.

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,440
I see.

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,760
Got it.

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,360
Tao,

56
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,930
come with me.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,560
Tao seems smart.

58
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,360
Find a job for him

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,840
with a high salary.

60
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,560
OK.

61
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,740
What's wrong with you?

62
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,690
Haven't you heard an eye for an eye?

63
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,520
Why didn't you fight back?

64
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,320
You've learned nothing from me?

65
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,880
So useless.

66
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,210
You're nothing like me.

67
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,840
What could I do?

68
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,280
She's the boss.

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,120
She pays my salaries.

70
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,480
Besides, Manting,

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
Pingting's bad temper

72
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,540
is nothing compared with the trouble

73
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840
you caused.

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
You want to die?

75
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
Why are you laughing?

76
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Nothing.

77
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,120
Are you OK?

78
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
Why wouldn't I be?

79
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,920
One day you're in,

80
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,970
the next day you're out.

81
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,740
This is how this circle works.

82
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,800
I mean,

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,440
did Mr. Qu punish you?

84
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,540
I haven't seen Director Guo for days.

85
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,920
What? Has he quit drinking?

86
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,760
Seriously?

87
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
He can quit drinking?

88
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,080
Unless the sun rises from the west.

89
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,740
Just now, he was here drinking

90
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,610
and threw up.

91
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,000
Then he saw someone or he was simply drunk,

92
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,840
he left in a rush.

93
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,320
You didn't get him back?

94
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,640
It's freezing outside. What if he catches a cold?

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,200
I...

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,320
I didn't get to.

97
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,760
He ran away like a rabbit.

98
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,400
It can still work.

99
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
It sounds beautiful.

100
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,400
Xiaoyu,

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,480
Let's dance.

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,160
I'll teach you.

103
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,880
I...I can't dance.

104
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll teach you.

105
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,120
It's simple.

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,760
Here.

107
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,330
Hand on my shoulder.

108
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,960
Then, I step forward and you step back.

109
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,960
Did I step on you?

110
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,640
It's OK.

111
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,440
I'm dizzy.

112
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,720
Does it hurt?

113
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,760
It's fine.

114
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,240
It's common for beginners.

115
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
I really can't.

116
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm clumsy.

117
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,120
Let's continue.

118
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
We should stop.

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Hey,

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
just watch and learn,

121
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,360
Good, right?

122
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,030
Yeah.

123
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,960
The new wine

124
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
tastes good, doesn't it?

125
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,789
It's good.

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,440
Wherever I go, you can always find me.

127
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,800
You know what,

128
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,080
I just saw Pei Nianqing.

129
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,880
I did see her.

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,200
Sit back.

131
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,160
Be good.

132
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,400
Sit.

133
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,280
Come on.

134
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,440
Are you sure you won't go home with me?

135
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,080
No.

136
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,860
I need to go back to school.

137
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
After two weeks in hospital,

138
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,240
I missed lots of lessons.

139
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,040
Besides,

140
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
Shen Junshan

141
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,200
didn't go home to rest.

142
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Neither should I.

143
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,220
-I'm here. -OK.

144
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,920
You're here.

145
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
All packed?

146
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
It's all here.

147
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Let's go.

148
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,280
Didn't Shen Junshan say he'd come to pick you up?

149
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,040
We don't need him.

150
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
We can go back by ourselves.

151
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,080
He already said that.

152
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,880
If he doesn't see you,

153
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,210
he'll be disappointed.

154
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Let's go.

155
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,280
You really don't wait for him?

156
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,960
No need.

157
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,520
You sure?

158
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,760
Huang Song is here.

159
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,920
Alright.

160
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,720
Xianrong?

161
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Junshan's hand is injured.

162
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,620
He can't drive,

163
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,410
so he asked me to pick you up.

164
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,640
Get in.

165
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,880
OK. Thanks.

166
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,480
Liangchen.

167
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,280
Xianrong, you can drive.

168
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,250
Impressive.

169
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,050
Has your wound healed, Liangchen?

170
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,360
Almost.

171
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,080
You and Miss Tan are so close.

172
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,000
It was Miss Tan

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
who was taking care of you this time.

174
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,410
We're good friends.

175
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,760
Junshan told me you have a sister

176
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,450
studying in Shunyuan, too.

177
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,640
Yes.

178
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What's her name?

179
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Xie Xiang.

180
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,220
Which school is she in?

181
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,540
Why are you so concerned about me all of a sudden?

182
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,920
According to you,

183
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,880
may I also assume

184
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
that you have a crush on me?

185
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,080
I can explain.

186
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,040
I care a lot about all

187
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,170
Junshan's friends.

188
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,560
That's all.

189
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,880
What a shame!

190
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,930
What does that mean?

191
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,280
Are you OK?

192
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,200
Yes, I'm fine.

193
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,760
Nurse,

194
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,480
where's the patient in this room?

195
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
He just left.

196
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Look at you,

197
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
so jealous.

198
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
I don't like her.

199
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,920
Why?

200
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,600
She strikes me as odd.

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,520
I also find her weird.

202
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,760
Tell me,

203
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,690
why is she weird?

204
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,720
Does she have a crush on Shen Junshan?

205
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,360
You...you're acute.

206
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,880
You...you've sensed that.

207
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,440
Liangchen, you're back.

208
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Not bad.

209
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,520
Ji Jin,

210
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,560
give me your bike.

211
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,400
What's it for?

212
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,840
Where are you going?

213
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,560
Liangchen.

214
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Where is he going?

215
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,720
No idea.

216
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,120
Boss,

217
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,650
the Rong Mansion is sending out invitations.

218
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,460
Who are they inviting?

219
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,240
Here's the name list.

220
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,000
It's short.

221
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,540
Shunyuan COC received the invitation, too.

222
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,360
Not bad.

223
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,690
Your skills are better.

224
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,040
I almost fell into your trap.

225
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,880
It's not a trap.

226
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,340
It's called skill.

227
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
Knock it off.

228
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,960
I beat you every time.

229
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,520
Can you not bring up the past?

230
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,450
Anyway, you lost again.

231
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm injured.

232
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,600
My hand is still weak.

233
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,440
You refused to play it

234
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,730
with me previously,

235
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,040
yet you have to do it now. You're taking advantage of me

236
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,720
Still,

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,920
I beat you.

238
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,069
Hey,

239
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,040
I need you to

240
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,319
go to the Rong Mansion for me.

241
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,000
Why?

242
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,240
It's for Her Ladyship's birthday.

243
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,770
I received the invitation.

244
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,000
Why won't you go?

245
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Her son is plotting something.

246
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,500
According to my observation,

247
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,060
he's trying to restore the monarchy.

248
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,520
I've met with him.

249
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,080
He tried to win me over

250
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
but I turned him down.

251
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,800
The Rong Mansion is deeply

252
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,080
rooted in the political and military fields in Feng'an.

253
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
They have connections everywhere in the military.

254
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,680
We can't offend them.

255
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,780
But under the current situation,

256
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,680
we can't get too close to them as well.

257
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Sending you there

258
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,800
is a gesture.

259
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,720
OK.

260
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,960
Hey,

261
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,160
you want to continue?

262
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,600
If you dare,

263
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,600
Let's do it again later.

264
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,170
Is beating a patient

265
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,640
something to be proud of?

266
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,370
Where are you going?

267
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,980
To the Academy.

268
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Seriously?

269
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,330
I've only been gone for a few days. My bed is taken?

270
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm talking to you.

271
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,200
Xie Liangchen.

272
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,360
Xie Xiang.

273
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Go on pretending.

274
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,780
What's wrong with you?

275
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,820
I have a real question.

276
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,720
Shoot.

277
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,000
Answer me honestly.

278
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
You want to ask or not?

279
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,100
Are you and Shen Junshan a couple?

280
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm speechless.

281
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,600
So it's a yes.

282
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,720
Cut the crap.

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,720
The room is a mess.

284
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,920
Clean it up now.

285
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,240
You have me.

286
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,440
How come you're attracted to other men?

287
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm hurt.

288
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,920
How is he better than me?

289
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,170
Is he more handsome?

290
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,370
Is he more charming?

291
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,720
Is he more attractive?

292
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,040
Is he richer than me?

293
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,920
He's wearing a long face

294
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,450
every day like a bodyguard.

295
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,240
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

296
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,500
Are you blind? Are you?

297
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,560
Are you done?

298
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm not.

299
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,560
Listen, Xie Liangchen,

300
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,080
I've put up with you long enough.

301
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,940
If you dare hook up with him again,

302
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,680
I'll...

303
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,200
Junshan.

304
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
What's wrong?

305
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,370
I need to talk to you.

306
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,560
OK.

307
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,600
Don't go.

308
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,720
I said don't go.

309
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,160
She won't go.

310
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,040
Stop.

311
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Don't go.

312
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,250
What is it about?

313
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,720
It's about Lingdang.

314
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,520
She can't keep staying at your friend's place.

315
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,920
I've found an orphanage.

316
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,160
We can go take her there

317
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,240
this afternoon.

318
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
An orphanage?

319
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
It's legit and well managed.

320
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,480
The director there is an old friend of our family.

321
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
That place has medical facilities.

322
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,530
Lingdang will be

323
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
able to receive better care and treatment.

324
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,220
I trust your decision.

325
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
She's shy and quiet.

326
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,240
I fear other kids will bully her.

327
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,370
No need to worry.

328
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,960
I've talked to the director.

329
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,090
You can go visit her.

330
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,600
OK.

331
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,480
Then let's go to Xiaojun's place

332
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,140
to pick her up this afternoon.

333
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,000
OK.

334
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,440
Just now,

335
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,300
Gu Yanzhen said...

336
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,210
Don't listen to him.

337
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,520
He's like a kid who doesn't think

338
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,160
before he speaks.

339
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,090
Just ignore him.

340
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
How's your wound?

341
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,130
It's healed.

342
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,720
Good.

343
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,240
You still need to be careful.

344
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
Don't let it get wet.

345
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,040
Lingdang,

346
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,650
you'll be staying here from now on.

347
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,640
Listen to the director

348
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,740
and be friendly to other kids.

349
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,240
We'll come visit you regularly.

350
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,440
Director,

351
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
please take care of her.

352
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,160
I will.

353
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,050
Then I'll bring her inside.

354
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,160
Come, Lingdang.

355
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Lingdang's life is good in some way.

356
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,540
She's living in her own world.

357
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,610
Can't feel sad or happy.

358
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,650
Have no worries or burdens.

359
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,860
Neither will she feel pain about the loss of her family,

360
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,060
nor will she be sad about losing her home.

361
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,440
Maybe deep down inside, she knows everything.

362
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,240
It's just that

363
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
she can't express it.

364
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,900
If that's the case,

365
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,560
it's too cruel to her.

366
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,300
I'd rather she didn't know anything.

367
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,920
Junshan.

368
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
Xianrong.

369
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,600
I came to see you.

370
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,680
They said you had gone out,

371
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,210
so I'm here waiting for you.

372
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,400
What's up?

373
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,680
You guys talk.

374
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,940
I'll go back to my room.

375
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,200
What is it?

376
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,560
Junshan,

377
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,970
do you know anyone in the Rong Mansion?

378
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,160
I don't.

379
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,120
Why ask?

380
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,240
Our family is

381
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,600
doing business with the Rong Mansion.

382
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
I'd like to know

383
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,400
their family situation.

384
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,010
What are their preferences and dislikes?

385
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,420
You know, just in case.

386
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
My brother knows them.

387
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,850
I can ask him for you.

388
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,720
Her Ladyship's birthday is coming.

389
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
We received the invitation.

390
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,560
Really?

391
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,620
Are you going, too?

392
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,240
And you?

393
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,060
Our family business is small.

394
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,260
We aren't qualified to attend it yet.

395
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,900
I'll tell you as soon as I know.

396
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,160
Thanks.

397
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,080
See you.

398
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Why are you laughing?

399
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,920
Your girlfriend's left?

400
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,100
Who told you she's my girlfriend?

401
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,440
She isn't?

402
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,720
No.

403
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,640
We used to be classmates.

404
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,640
Xianrong has a strong personality.

405
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,840
She's independent

406
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,800
and she cares about her friends.

407
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,280
I see.

408
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,620
I think she likes you a lot.

409
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,860
You don't like her?

410
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,240
I like her

411
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,960
the same way as I like you.

412
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,130
We're just friends.

413
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,360
Hey,

414
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,200
Junshan,

415
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,120
what does her family do?

416
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm not sure.

417
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,050
They seem to be in the lumber business.

418
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,810
Let's go.

419
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,800
Go inside.

420
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,930
You wear shoes in bed again.

421
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
If Sergeant Lv sees it, he'll order you to run laps.

422
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,100
None of your business.

423
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,740
So you're reading.

424
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,690
The book is upside down.

425
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,240
It's more fun reading like this.

426
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
This way, I can recite it backwards.

427
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,960
You're a phony!

428
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Stop pretending.

429
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,580
I saw you as soon as I entered the gate.

430
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,600
You were like a monkey

431
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,660
hanging on a stick.

432
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,690
You call me a monkey?

433
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,560
You went on a date with a boy in broad daylight.

434
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
Do you have any shame?

435
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,160
Speak louder

436
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,680
so that everyone on this floor can hear you.

437
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,100
You think I wouldn't dare?

438
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,040
I know you're bold.

439
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,760
Go ahead.

440
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,040
You have no self-esteem.

441
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,480
Not at all.

442
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,120
I share a room with you.

443
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,320
I have no fear.

444
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm different.

445
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,100
How are you different?

446
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,840
If you go on like this, I...

447
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,570
I'll report you to Lv Zhongxin.

448
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Whatever.

449
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,580
Don't think I have a thing for you.

450
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,080
I have different girlfriends every month.

451
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,820
I've dated all sorts of women.

452
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,500
I was messing with you.

453
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,320
I can get a truckload of women

454
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,340
who are all prettier than you,

455
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,840
sexier than you

456
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,370
and more pleasant than you.

457
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,690
I'm leaving.

458
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Cut the crap.

459
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,600
Just go.

460
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,560
If you wait any longer, your truck will get stolen.

461
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,800
Farewell time, trackway side

462
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,040
Green grass spreading up high

463
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,960
Waiter.

464
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,720
Waiter.

465
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,840
Please enjoy.

466
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,800
Mr. Gu,

467
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
how can I help you?

468
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,920
Ask her to stop.

469
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,380
Sing another song.

470
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,000
What song do you like?

471
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,080
It's called

472
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,080
Men Also Cry When They're Sad.

473
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,180
Men Also Cry When They're Sad?

474
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,160
Never heard of it.

475
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,680
You don't know such a famous song?

476
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,060
Then sing another one.

477
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
When Will You Know

478
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,920
I love you.

479
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,920
Never heard of that, either.

480
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,090
She can't sing that.

481
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,120
How come she can't sing?

482
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,080
Then what's she doing here?

483
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,740
Qu Manting can sing all songs.

484
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,760
Mr. Gu,

485
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,800
Qu Manting is a superstar.

486
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,640
Our singer

487
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,530
is only paid 10 dollars a month.

488
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,860
I'll give you one more chance.

489
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,460
Sing another song.

490
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,760
The One Loves Me I Love Not.

491
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,000
The One I Love Loves Me Not.

492
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,120
The One Misses Me I Miss Not.

493
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,040
-The One I miss... -Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu.

494
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,240
Are those songs?

495
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,040
Songs we have here are

496
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,000
Farewell,

497
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,480
Childhood Memories and stuff like that.

498
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,160
We don't know your songs.

499
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,240
Your tiny club

500
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,640
doesn't know, of course.

501
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,080
I apologize.

502
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,920
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,860
Let me sing one for you.

504
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,640
-Mr. Gu. -I'll sing for free.

505
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Be careful.

506
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,520
Mr. Gu, be careful.

507
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,180
Be careful.

508
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,250
Watch your step, Mr. Gu.

509
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,600
Careful.

510
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,900
Slowly, Mr. Gu.

511
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,450
Careful.

512
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,040
Who is this?

513
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,040
What are you looking at?

514
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,720
Let me sing a song for you.

515
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,280
The look in your eyes

516
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,200
Mr. Gu.

517
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,760
Go away.

518
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,040
Who is this?

519
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,760
The look in your eyes

520
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,640
Crystal clear like the moon

521
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,200
Yearnings deepen

522
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu.

523
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,640
Are you in a bad mood?

524
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,780
How about this?

525
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,000
Let me drink with you.

526
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,960
We can have a chat.

527
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,520
OK.

528
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,840
Put it down.

529
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,660
Come here. Come on.

530
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,040
Don't drop it on your foot.

531
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,800
Mr. Gu, be careful.

532
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,160
Mr. Gu,

533
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,560
slowly.

534
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,320
Be careful.

535
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,840
Come here.

536
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,370
Careful.

537
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
What are you looking at?

538
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,360
What's wrong with you?

539
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,760
It's OK. It's OK. Go on drinking.

540
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,600
It's OK.

541
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,440
It's fine. Nothing to worry about.

542
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,100
Enjoy yourselves, everyone.

543
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,680
What's wrong with that guy?

544
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,080
Careful.

545
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,520
Is he drunk?

546
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,040
This way, please.

547
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,880
I think so.

548
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,640
You may leave.

549
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,720
Mr. Gu,

550
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,420
what's bothering you?

551
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,760
I'm heartbroken.

552
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,240
Heartbroken?

553
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,320
Well,

554
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,040
Mr. Gu,

555
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,940
someone broke your heart?

556
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,720
Yeah.

557
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,440
A man like me

558
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,640
get dumped.

559
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,400
It's hard to believe.

560
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,980
I don't believe it myself.

561
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,800
Why?

562
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,160
Her taste is bad.

563
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,320
I'm not her type.

564
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,040
Well,

565
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,200
Mr. Gu,

566
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,720
given your condition,

567
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,840
if you aren't her type,

568
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
then what is her type?

569
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,560
Cool guy,

570
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,040
quiet guy,

571
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,330
just like Shen Junshan,

572
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,880
that ugly guy.

573
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,050
That's hard to find.

574
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,920
I think

575
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,160
you can try to be cool.

576
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
It's not too hard.

577
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,000
Mr. Gu,

578
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,440
the ugly part

579
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,360
is quite tricky.

580
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,200
However hard you torture yourself,

581
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,660
you're nowhere near ugly.

582
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,130
You have good taste.

583
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,040
Mr. Gu,

584
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,080
the glass is empty.

585
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,800
You want more?

586
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,130
Yeah.

587
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,930
The most expensive one?

588
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,240
Hold on.

589
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,360
Here.

590
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,800
Actually,

591
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
for a man like you,

592
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,200
you can have any woman you want.

593
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,960
Why do you have to waste your time

594
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,840
on that ungrateful woman?

595
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,760
Am I right?

596
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,560
The problem is I'm already in love with her.

597
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,210
Mr. Gu, my advice for you is that

598
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,920
you should

599
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,130
suck it up for now

600
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,960
and act like the one

601
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,480
she likes.

602
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,480
Maybe, she'll love you back.

603
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,240
Acting?

604
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,440
Acting.

605
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,360
Yanzhen,

606
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,170
why are you sitting there?

607
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,860
Let's go eat together.

608
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,670
Pass.

609
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,000
I don't need company.

610
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,929
I enjoy being alone.

611
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,440
Move.

612
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,440
Move.

613
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,150
Move.

614
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,670
Move.

615
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
Yes. This is it.

616
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,120
Move.

617
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,520
I've gone as far as I could.

618
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:02,980
Come on.

619
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,240
It's wide enough for you to walk.

620
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,360
Move.

621
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,240
Are you Shen Junshan now?

622
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,600
Let's go.

623
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,320
Awesome!

624
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,880
What's wrong with him?

625
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,600
Who knows?

626
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,170
Let's go eat.

627
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,420
Liangchen,

628
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,850
what's his problem?

629
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,240
Who knows?

630
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,850
He loses his mind again.

631
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,330
Does anyone know

632
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,240
the meaning of self-protecting falls?

633
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,360
Gu Yanzhen.

634
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,000
Yes.

635
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,130
Answer my question.

636
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,840
Did I raise my hand?

637
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,160
Why did you raise your hand if you don't know?

638
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,720
Sit down.

639
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,120
The same as his.

640
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,640
OK.

641
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,840
No more, no less.

642
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,640
What are you doing?

643
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,300
I'm eating,

644
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,940
can't I?

645
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,970
Liangchen, Liangchen,

646
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,680
isn't Gu Yanzhen allergic to tomatoes?

647
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,500
Is he OK now?

648
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,460
Who knows what he's thinking.

649
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,370
Are you done?

650
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,740
I'm eating.

651
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,010
I like this spot,

652
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,680
can't I?

653
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,810
He's been weird these days.

654
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,800
He's weird every day.

655
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,480
You guys eat first,

656
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,610
I'll go check on him.

657
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,780
Liangchen,

658
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,320
when you were in hospital,

659
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,780
did your sister visit you?

660
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,120
She did.

661
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,360
You happened to miss her.

662
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,000
Really?

663
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,680
What a shame!

664
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,440
About what?

665
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,720
Nothing.

666
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,560
I'm saying I

667
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,260
only met your sister once.

668
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,200
You know,

669
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,800
it's...it's...

670
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,940
What do you want to say?

671
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,720
I...

672
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,160
I...

673
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,920
Nothing.

674
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,640
Forget it.

675
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,240
Nothing.

676
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,570
You look weird, too.

677
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,280
Gu Yanzhen,

678
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,400
you...

679
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,770
What happened to your face?

680
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
What's wrong with it?

681
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,360
It's...

682
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,640
I...ate...tomatoes.

683
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,080
So he's still allergic to them.

684
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,660
He deserves it.

685
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,060
Gu Yanzhen,

686
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,340
do you feel better now?

687
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,560
What's wrong?

688
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,320
I'm talking to you. Did you...

689
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,200
Why are you laughing?

690
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,600
The doctor said I'd recover tomorrow.

691
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,080
Stop.

692
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,320
No more laughing.

693
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,080
Hey,

694
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm begging you,

695
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,180
can you stop causing trouble?

696
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,320
Who's causing trouble?

697
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,200
Who else is it?

698
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,140
Look who you see in the mirror.

699
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,480
It's all your fault.

700
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,000
How is it my fault?

701
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Fine, fine, fine.

702
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,760
Yeah, it's my fault.

703
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,000
I apologize.

704
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,400
So can you please

705
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,520
behave yourself

706
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,000
and stop making trouble?

707
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,480
You apologized to me?

708
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,040
Yes.

709
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,840
It's my fault.

710
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm sorry.

711
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,840
You mean it?

712
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,040
Absolutely.

713
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,280
Then can you stop

714
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,940
hooking up with Shen Junshan?

715
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,560
Are you done?

716
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,160
You were

717
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,560
lying to me, weren't you?

718
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,000
Am I right?

719
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,080
Come on,

720
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,280
he thinks I'm a man.

721
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,040
What do you think will happen between us?

722
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,570
You can't like him, either.

723
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,560
I...

724
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,940
Why would I bother talking to you?

725
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,820
I'm hungry.

726
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,480
Go get the food yourself.

727
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,540
Why did you tell me?

728
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,240
How could I go out like this?

729
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,570
Didn't you have dinner?

730
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,360
I threw up.

731
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,450
Where are you going?

732
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
Following your order, master.

733
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
I'll go get some food for you.

734
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,560
Rib noodles, noodles with soybean paste, and beef noodles.

735
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,080
Hurry.

736
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,740
Even pimples can't damage my handsomeness.

737
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,480
How's the preparation going

738
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
in the Rong Mansion?

739
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,080
Going well as you requested.

740
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,540
Everything's set.

741
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,680
You don't need to join this mission.

742
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,120
Stay outside

743
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,250
and don't let Shen Junshan go to the Rong Mansion.

744
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,160
Understand?

745
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,280
Yes.

746
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,340
Whatever it takes,

747
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,400
we cannot let Shen Junshan

748
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,860
see me in the Rong Mansion.

749
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,760
Yes.
