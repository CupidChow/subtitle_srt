00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 04

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,250
Can't you knock?

5
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Are you crazy?

6
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,400
Why did you come back?

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,080
None of your business.

8
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,360
Like I care.

9
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,500
Do you need my help?

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,360
Nope.

11
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,039
Suit yourself.

12
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,820
Xie Liangchen,

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,480
are you a girl?

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,470
Excuse me?

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
You're short and skinny.

16
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
You're poor in stamina and a slow runner.

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,400
You refused to take off your clothes

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,660
in front of the doctor.

19
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,100
Come to think of it,

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
you even sleep with your clothes on.

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,380
I've never seen you in the men' s room.

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
You are a man,

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,520
but you are covering yourself from head to toe.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,240
Why?

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,560
Are you crazy?

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,970
Don't know what you're saying.

27
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,960
You'd better not be a girl.

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,090
A girl with your look

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,170
is hopeless.

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,800
Xiang!

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,920
Hurry up, Xiang!

32
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,040
Xiang. Xiang.

33
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,040
Wake up, time to go home.

34
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,640
Xiang. Xiang.

35
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,649
Quickly.

36
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,209
You're late for school.

37
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,290
Xiang, where's your scarf?

38
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,890
It's snowing outside. It's freezing.

39
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,400
Xiang.

40
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,320
Eat more.

41
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,960
Xiang.

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,820
Have you taken your medicine?

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
Liangchen, you're still up.

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,080
What's wrong?

45
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,290
You can't sleep too?

46
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,700
I'm leaving tomorrow.

47
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,960
Be a good girl

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
and listen to mom and dad.

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
You have to leave?

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,440
Dad said Feng'an is in chaos.

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,520
Your life will be at stake

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
in the army.

53
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,620
Our nation is falling.

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,160
Nowhere is safe.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,060
Now, it's Feng'an.

56
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
Soon it'll be Peking.

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,600
We were born and bred.

58
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,560
in here.

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,420
Where else could we go?

60
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,720
I don't understand what you said.

61
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,570
It's OK if you don't.

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,120
You don't need to know anyway.

63
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
I'll protect you.

64
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,360
When you're in the army and the war breaks out,

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
soldiers will die.

66
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
Aren't you afraid?

67
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,720
I am.

68
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
But what I'm more afraid is that

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,460
when our country or

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,140
our nation is in grave danger,

71
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,720
when our people are suffering,

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,600
I can't do anything.

73
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,560
Compared with death,

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
having no hope

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,010
is more dreadful for a country or a nation.

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,400
On the battlefield,

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,000
at least I can step up

78
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,960
to show our people

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,810
that there are still fighters.

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,490
Our country still has hope.

81
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,360
As long as there's hope,

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,520
even if I die,

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,260
millions of Chinese will continue fighting

84
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,760
and keep the hope alive.

85
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,940
Liangchen,

86
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,200
I don't want you to leave,

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
but I know you must have your reasons.

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,650
Don't worry.

89
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,440
I'll be good.

90
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,570
I'll take care of mom and dad

91
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,840
and wait for your return at home.

92
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,640
Xiang,

93
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
one day, you'll understand.

94
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,000
There are things

95
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
that must be done.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
Though it may not be successful and

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,760
it may be of no use,

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,520
it has to be done.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Drops of water outwear the stone.

100
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
Every great success

101
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,159
is achieved bit by bit.

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,050
If only we don't give up,

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,680
one day,

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,159
we'll make it.

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,360
Xiang.

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,920
Xiang.

107
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,920
Xiang.

108
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,240
Xiang.

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,120
Xiang.

110
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,600
Xiang.

111
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,480
Xiang.

112
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,800
Xiang.

113
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,120
Xiang.

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,080
Xiang.

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Xiang.

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Lights on, the night is deep

117
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,600
Breeze blows through windows and doors

118
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,960
Ask from the bottom of the heart

119
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Is the love true

120
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,440
So grateful in this life

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,160
You're here with me

122
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,680
Wind brings back the memory

123
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,600
In dream shall we meet

124
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,560
Xiang,

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,560
you're a girl after all.

126
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,760
Put other things aside,

127
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,909
let's talk about your roommate.

128
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,760
You eat and sleep together every day.

129
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,960
Eventually,

130
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,480
he'll find out the truth.

131
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,150
If your brother was still alive,

132
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,210
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

133
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,140
You don't understand.

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,300
You think I'm doing this only for myself?

135
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,160
I must do something.

136
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,040
I could no longer

137
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,570
stay at home and do nothing.

138
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,800
I couldn't.

139
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,040
I know.

140
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,960
But you can't force yourself

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,420
to live like your brother.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He had his reasons

143
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,810
for everything he had done.

144
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,240
Maybe, Arsenal Military Academy

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
can teach me how to

146
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,650
be a person like him.

147
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
Shen Junshan.

148
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,130
What are you doing here?

149
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,980
I need some air.

150
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,680
How's your wound?

151
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,410
It's better now.

152
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,880
That's a nice sound.

153
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
You want to have a try?

154
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,760
No thanks.

155
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,800
I can't.

156
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
When I was abroad,

157
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,610
I learned it from my classmate.

158
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,040
The tune is the same,

159
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,760
but now the feeling has changed.

160
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,040
Thank you.

161
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,320
For what?

162
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,520
For helping me in the gym.

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
You should thank Gu Yanzhen.

164
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,400
Him?

165
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,720
What?

166
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,970
You dislike him?

167
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,760
Dislike is too subtle.

168
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
I detest him.

169
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,760
Same here!

170
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,040
I don't like him, either.

171
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,280
Why?

172
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,760
No reason.

173
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,240
Seeing him living a carefree life,

174
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,930
I'm jealous.

175
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,620
You are jealous of him?

176
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,640
No way.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,330
Living the way as he does

178
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
isn't something simple.

179
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,880
Right.

180
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,560
By the way,

181
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,600
why did you come back?

182
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,700
The situation here is bad.

183
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,290
There's chaos everywhere.

184
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,460
Many friends have gone abroad with their families.

185
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,780
That won't solve the problem.

186
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,450
There are things that must be done.

187
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
A string can cut a log in half.

188
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,380
Drops of water outwear the stone.

189
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
One step at a time,

190
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
and the destination is right ahead.

191
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,960
There are things that must be done.

192
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,520
A string can cut a log in half.

193
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,160
Drops of water outwear the stone.

194
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,520
Every great success

195

One round, 6 ring.

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,880

One round, 6 ring.

205
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
One round, 7 ring.

206
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,920
Two misses.

207
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,800
Li Wenzhong.

208
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
Three rounds, 6 ring.

209
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,440
It's OK.

210
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,960
Two rounds, 7 ring.

211
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,680
You're the best.

212
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
One round, 8 ring.

213
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,680
No miss.

214
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
What do you think?

215
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,720
Not bad at all.

216
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,920
Gu Yanzhen.

217
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,180
Two rounds, 6 ring.

218
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
Four misses.

219
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,200
Shen Junshan.

220
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,880
Two rounds, 9 ring.

221
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,680
Four rounds, 10 ring.

222
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,680
No miss.

223
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,160
Impressive!

224
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,040
Excellent!

225
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,860
Huang Song,

226
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,280
how come your name hasn't been called?

227
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,040
I don't know.

228
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm worried, too.

229
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,420
Huang Song.

230
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,200
Six for six.

231
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,560
All 10 ring.

232
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Wonderful!

233
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,920
I know I can do it, Liangchen.

234
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I know I can.

235
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,760
Hey you,

236
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
nice shot.

237
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,240
Where did you learn it?

238
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
It's nothing.

239
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
I was in the mountains with my troop for 6 months.

240
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,080
There was no meat,

241
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
so I shot rabbits.

242
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
The range is so close.

243
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,760
Even a blind man can hit the target.

244
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,160
What's to be happy about?

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,800
Sergeant Guo.

246
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
It's easier said than done.

247
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,770
Show us what you've got.

248
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,520
You arrogant brats!

249
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,520
Just watch and learn.

250
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,600
Time for lunch.

251
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Go eat.

252
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,700
You study at Xinhua Girls' School, Miss Tan?

253
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,480
A cousin of mine is at there, too.

254
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,010
I've been there a few times.

255
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,760
Pretty young girls are abundant,

256
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,160
but I've never seen anyone

257
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
as unique as you.

258
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Thanks. I'm flattered.

259
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,500
May I call you Xiaojun?

260
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,120
I think we can

261
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
be on a first-name basis.

262
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,520
Xiaojun,

263
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,960
what are you doing here?

264
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,840
Do you know someone at our Academy?

265
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,520
My friend.

266
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,480
Friend?

267
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
Is it your boyfriend?

268
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,840
No, no.

269
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,120
We're just friends.

270
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,920
As far as I know,

271
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,330
there are no girls here.

272
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,480
Looks like

273
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,410
you're open-minded, Xiaojun.

274
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,330
It's surprising that you make friends with boys.

275
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Do I have the honor

276
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,660
to be friends with you?

277
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,060
I'm exhausted.

278
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
What's up?

279
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,360
You're sweating all over.

280
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
Your sweat is on my clothes.

281
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,040
Wipe your sweat.

282
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,680
Such an upstart.

283
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,400
Come here.

284
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,880
Wipe for me.

285
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,940
What are you doing?

286
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,829
I...we're...

287
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,089
It's not what you think.

288
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,200
It's OK.

289
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,890
So you and Liangchen...

290
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,109
You two are intimate.

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,040
-I should leave you two alone. -No.

292
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,560
No.

293
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,480
Goodbye.

294
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,839
Why did you come out just now?

295
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,880
Why are you blaming me?

296
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,680
What did I do?

297
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,040
Why are you dressed like this?

298
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,080
You look like a turkey.

299
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,340
You look like a turkey.

300
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
Seriously, why are you here?

301
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,560
Your dad will be in town tomorrow

302
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,280
to attend a conference

303
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,800
and he'll come to see you.

304
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,480
You gave him

305
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,960
my dad's agency's address,

306
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,240
so he sent a telegram to my dad.

307
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,410
My dad will come?

308
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,920
Yeah. You're screwed!

309
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,000
Help me!

310
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
How can I help you?

311
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,320
How about I take tomorrow off?

312
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,720
The weekend is coming anyway.

313
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,280
OK.

314
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
Sergeant Guo.

315
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,360
Sergeant Guo.

316
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,880
Sir...

317
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
Only one hit the bull's eye?

318
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,760
One bullet hole

319
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,690
doesn't necessarily mean one hit.

320
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,720
I don't get it.

321
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,640
You're a newbie.

322
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,690
What do you know?

323
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Back then,

324
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,560
when Sergeant Guo was in service,

325
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,040
you were not born.

326
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,560
Dad.

327
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,040
Xiang,

328
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,020
you received my telegram?

329
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,480
Xiaojun told me about it.

330
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,720
I planned to go to your school,

331
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,460
but here you are picking me up.

332
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,640
What did you bring?

333
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,240
Goodies?

334
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,890
Did I raise a pig?

335
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,940
Your mom made chestnut cakes.

336
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,560
Mom is the best.

337
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,050
Let me help you, dad.

338
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,520
No need.

339
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,160
It's OK.

340
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,280
Cases like this size,

341
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,940
I can carry twenty of them now.

342
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,040
Don't brag.

343
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,200
But

344
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,560
you look a bit different.

345
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
What difference?

346
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,100
You become tanned and skinny.

347
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,820
Your temperament's changed.

348
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,080
Guess the strong breeze here

349
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,720
has toughened you up

350
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,760
quite a lot.

351
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,800
But I know

352
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,440
you're still

353
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,800
a naughty kid

354
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,920
in nature.

355
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,560
Dad.

356
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,320
Dad.

357
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,800
Xiaojun's parents invited us to stay at their place

358
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,000
but I turned them down for convenience.

359
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,320
I booked a hotel for you.

360
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
It's just nearby.

361
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,080
Thanks.

362
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,130
You did the right thing.

363
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,560
You're staying with them already.

364
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,290
We can't trouble them anymore.

365
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,320
Your mom and I prepared some gifts.

366
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,520
Bring them to Xiaojun's parents later.

367
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,480
I have a conference this afternoon

368
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,200
and a banquet at night.

369
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,280
I have to go back tomorrow

370
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,960
so I can't

371
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,320
visit them myself.

372
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,080
OK.

373
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,320
Come.

374
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,160
Xiang,

375
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,850
why don't you go with me to the banquet?

376
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,200
Who's the host?

377
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,200
Do I have to go?

378
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,080
Shunyuan COC is hosting it.

379
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,880
A while ago,

380
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,140
they donated cotton cloth to our school.

381
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,320
Right now, the cloth in shortage.

382
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,440
and the Japanese occupy the market in the north.

383
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,560
Shunyuan COC selling the cotton cloth

384
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,760
at a low price now

385
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,520
is patriotic.

386
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,290
They invited your mom and me

387
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,600
to attend the

388
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
inauguration ceremony of their cotton factory.

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,530
Your mom doesn't feel well,

390
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,160
so you should fill in for her.

391
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,640
Mom is ill again?

392
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,170
The anniversary

393
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,650
of your brother's death is coming.

394
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,720
While I go to the conference,

395
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,250
you go back and get changed.

396
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
I must wear something decent and elegant.

397
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,040
I must look like a lady.

398
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,080
Aren't you a smarty-pants?

399
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,080
Come.

400
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,280
Let's go.

401
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,400
Come, sit here.

402
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,560
Ms. Qu,

403
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,560
Mr. Shen is going to pick up the mayor.

404
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,160
He said if you arrived first,

405
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,020
you could go rest in the side hall.

406
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,920
It's said that Mr. Shen

407
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,360
is obsessed with

408
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,880
this showgirl.

409
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
This is the first time I've seen her.

410
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
She looks OK.

411
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,130
You have a sharp tongue.

412
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,800
She's a famous star in Shanghai.

413
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,800
How come you

414
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,240
call her a showgirl?

415
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,760
She makes a living

416
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,640
by seducing others.

417
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,760
Calling her showgirl is polite enough.

418
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,440
Who does she think she is?

419
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,680
A star?

420
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Ridiculous!

421
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,920
Lower your voice

422
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,980
or she'll hear you.

423
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,260
So what if she hears me.

424
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm not afraid of her.

425
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
I heard her family used to be

426
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,680
prestigious in Shunyuan.

427
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,960
They are friends with the Shens.

428
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,120
However, her family declined

429
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,200
so she came out to work.

430
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,200
Not sure if it's true.

431
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,960
Miss Du, you of all people

432
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,960
should know the answer.

433
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,040
Your cousin Mr. Shen

434
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,320
falls head over heels

435
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,720
in love with Ms. Qu.

436
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
You must know something we don't.

437
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,610
What do you mean?

438
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,900
I don't know anything.

439
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,320
Let's not stand here.

440
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,160
Miss Du,

441
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,650
this is your place, too.

442
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,780
Lead us to the side hall to have a rest.

443
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,160
Don't be harsh on her.

444
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Didn't you hear that Ms. Qu

445
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
went to the side hall?

446
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,440
This is Miss Du's place.

447
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,520
Other than the side hall,

448
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,920
are there no other places where

449
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,880
we can rest in this mansion?

450
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,280
Am I right?

451
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,680
Let's go.

452
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,650
Let's go have a look.

453
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,410
Are we afraid of her?

454
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,000
Manting,

455
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,720
Yanyun Newspaper is going to interview you tomorrow.

456
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
The day after tomorrow,

457
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,760
the company wants to

458
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,050
discuss with you about the poster.

459
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,240
Manting,

460
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,050
it can't be delayed.

461
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,200
You've been back for a while

462
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,760
and haven't done any

463
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,800
work...

464
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,400
Manting,

465
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,480
the interview tomorrow...

466
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,080
I won't go.

467
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,040
And the poster...

468
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,160
I won't go.

469
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,800
You have to go.

470
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,560
Miss Du,

471
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,280
is this

472
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,840
Plum and Bamboo drawn by Zhu Shuzhen?

473
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,440
You have a good eye.

474
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,840
Zhu Shuzhen's poems are my favorites,

475
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,760
as well as her paintings.

476
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,160
I love them.

477
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,160
I heard

478
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,600
this painting

479
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
is stored in Mr. Shen's mansion.

480
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,560
Now that we're here,

481
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,680
I'd like to take some time

482
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
to appreciate it.

483
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,980
Speaking of Zhu Shuzhen's poems,

484
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,640
my favorite line is

485
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,920
¡°Rather age with fragrance on the branch,

486
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,250
than dance with dead leaves in the wind¡±.

487
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,860
Zhu Shuzhen's marriage was a failure

488
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,250
and her family refused to shelter her,

489
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,680
but she had her own principles.

490
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,120
Neither did she drift through life,

491
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,250
nor did she chase after money and fame.

492
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,620
That's admirable.

493
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,840
Zhu Shuzhen

494
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,220
was from a prestigious family after all.

495
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,720
Women from prominent families

496
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,920
are different from those commoners

497
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,720
who have no self-esteem

498
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,840
and make a living on stage.

499
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Although her marriage failed,

500
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,080
in terms of integrity,

501
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,410
she wasn't inferior to anyone.

502
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,120
Ladies,

503
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,280
please be quiet.

504
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,480
Ms. Qu

505
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,840
is resting.

506
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,840
Our superstar Miss Qu is here.

507
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
Did we wake you up?

508
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,200
Hello, Ms. Qu.

509
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,520
Long time no see.

510
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
Shouldn't you at least say hello?

511
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,890
Where are your manners?

512
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,050
Now that you know you are noisy.

513
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,600
Why don't you shut up?

514
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,000
Enough jibber-jabber.

515
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,600
Are you a flock of birds?

516
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Do I even know you?

517
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,760
I am wondering that

518
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,480
how come there are so many people

519
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,440
whom I don't even know

520
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,370
pretend to be close to me every day?

521
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,600
Miss Qu,

522
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,200
you must've forgotten it.

523
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,480
I do have a bad memory.

524
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
I have important things to remember every day.

525
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,480
I'm afraid there's

526
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,000
no extra space

527
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,800
in my brain

528
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,200
for some annoying faces.

529
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
Ms. Qu,

530
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,770
you'd better watch your language.

531
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,580
Where do you think you are?

532
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,000
This isn't a club for showgirls.

533
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,480
Show some respect.

534
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,280
Aren't you afraid others will laugh at you?

535
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,490
I pay respect to people who deserve it.

536
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,800
Stab me, spit on me

537
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,920
or have a fight,

538
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,600
just do it straightly, OK?

539
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,320
Don't beat around the bush.

540
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,850
Stop being condescending.

541
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880
What did you mean?

542
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,600
I mean you!

543
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,720
Are you deaf or what?

544
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,200
You...

545
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,400
What? What is it?

546
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,610
You can't even speak properly.

547
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,800
Aren't you well educated

548
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,200
and elegant ladies?

549
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,660
Shouldn't you have self-esteem?

550
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,840
How come you degraded yourself

551
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,440
by arguing with me in public?

552
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,760
Look at you.

553
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,120
The powder you're wearing

554
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,000
can't cover your bulging veins on your neck.

555
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,280
Go fix it.

556
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,760
You...you shrew!

557
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,600
Shrew?

558
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,680
This is nowhere near it.

559
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,340
You should've seen real ones.

560
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,400
Go home now.

561
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,280
Or I'll let you see

562
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,320
what a commoner

563
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,720
who makes a living on stage really is.

564
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,240
Ms. Qu,

565
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,410
Mr. Shen is back.

566
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,700
Please go downstairs.

567
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,720
Mr. Huang,

568
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,440
that crappy painting on the wall is ugly.

569
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,770
Take it down and burn it.

570
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,400
Yes.

571
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,180
Look how furious they are.

572
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,480
They're chickens.

573
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,140
Beating them is as easy as pie.

574
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,610
You're awesome.

575
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,480
That painter's work is good.

576
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,160
Go ask her

577
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,360
to write a song for me.

578
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,400
Manting.

579
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,600
What?

580
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Is her price high?

581
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,240
She's dead.

582
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,810
When did she die?

583
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,200
Hundreds of years ago.

584
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,540
Hundreds of years?

585
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,130
The Qin Dynasty?

586
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,240
Manting.

587
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,640
What's wrong?

588
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,320
The Qin Dynasty

589
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,880
is way ahead of that.

590
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,640
So the Han Dynasty?

591
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
The Song Dynasty.

592
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,160
Whatever.

593
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,880
So hundreds of years, huh?

594
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,280
That thing is an antique.

595
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,900
Better keep it.

596
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,900
Take it down and bring it back.

597
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,600
If Shen Tingbai goes broke someday,

598
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,930
we can sell it for money.

599
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
You heard it, Tao?

600
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,920
Enough.

601
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,320
You two can leave.

602
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,680
I'm fine.

603
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,680
You don't need to follow me.

604
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,440
Go have fun.

605
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,520
OK.

606
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,080
No one is normal here.

607
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Sweetie,

608
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
you look gorgeous.

609
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,800
Of course.

610
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,840
Dad,

611
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,620
this family is so rich.

612
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,760
Of course.

613
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,740
Shen is a household name in Shunyuan.

614
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,640
They've been around for decades.

615
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,760
Their business

616
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,600
is all over Feng'an.

617
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,120
They have branches in Peking, too.

618
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,840
Their family is beyond rich.

619
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,680
The Shens?

620
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,160
I'll go say hi.

621
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,400
Mr. Wu.

622
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,760
Mr. Xie

623
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,760
It's been a long time.

624
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,440
How are you?

625
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,440
Mr. Xie,

626
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,680
why didn't you tell me

627
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,400
you'd come to Shunyuan?

628
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,780
I came on short notice.

629
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,280
This is...

630
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,940
This is my daughter Xie Xiang.

631
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,400
This is Mr. Wu.

632
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,330
Nice to meet you.

633
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,570
Glad to meet you.

634
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,440
Let's go have a seat.

635
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,000
OK.

636
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,520
Please.

637
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,360
Go have fun.

638
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,700
How's your school?

639
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,520
Quite busy actually.

640
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
I'm weak now.

641
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
I get tired easily at work.

642
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Vice Minister Gu.

643
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Mr. Sato.

644
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,160
Vice Minister Kuang.

645
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,720
I'm sorry.

646
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,480
Excuse me.

647
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,560
Vice Minister Kuang.

648
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,490
Nice to meet you.

649
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,560
Junshan,

650
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,760
all guests here

651
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,690
are powerful figures in Shunyuan.

652
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,480
You just came back.

653
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,159
You should take this chance

654
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,360
to mingle with them.

655
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,800
Tingbai,

656
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
you go mingle.

657
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,409
Events like this

658
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,850
aren't really my thing.

659
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,000
Nonsense.

660
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,080
Sooner or later, you'll have to do this.

661
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,159
Business is all about building connections.

662
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,320
If you don't learn,

663
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,440
who'll take over

664
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,080
our family business?

665
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,960
You will, of course.

666
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,670
I can just sit back and relax.

667
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,929
Such a lazy bone.

668
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,130
You have dreams and ambitions.

669
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,290
I understand that.

670
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,840
But during this chaotic period,

671
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,360
I still think that

672
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,880
joining the army isn't a wise choice.

673
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,340
developing industry is ultimate solution.

674
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,600
Yet you seek far.

675
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,760
It's stupid.

676
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,500
I won't argue with you.

677
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,200
Anyway,

678
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
you must come with me.

679
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,020
Making friends won't do you any harm.

680
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,560
Fine.

681
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,360
You're always right.

682
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,760
Excuse me.

683
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,080
Sorry for bothering you.

684
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,280
Chairman of Japanese COC

685
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,810
Mr. Kazuo Sato has arrived.

686
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,640
OK. I see.

687
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,530
Tingbai,

688
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
that's a bad news.

689
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,000
Let's see what he's up to.

690
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,570
Most of it is occupied by the Japanese.

691
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,680
-That's the current situation. -Yes.

692
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,400
Hello. Hi.

693
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,690
Long time no see.

694
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,720
Please excuse me.

695
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Hello, Mr. Shen.

696
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,240
Hello.

697
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,000
Hello. Hi.

698
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Thanks for your help last time.

699
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Don't mention it.

700
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,640
Thanks. Thank you.

701
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,280
Mr. Shen.

702
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,200
Mr. Shen.

703
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,320
Hello.

704
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,120
You are...

705
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,580
I'm Xie Zhipei.

706
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,280
On behalf of our school,

707
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,010
I come to express my gratitude.

708
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,650
Thank you, Mr. Shen,

709
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,160
for your donation to our school.

710
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,730
You're Mr. Xie from Peking?

711
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,360
Yes.

712
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,440
It's nothing.

713
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,240
It's the least I could do.

714
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,000
Thank you for your help.

715
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,330
Sure. Consider it done.

716
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,800
Gosh, Xie Xiang,

717
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,440
you're such an idiot!

718
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,320
Xiaojun has already told you

719
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,720
Shen Junshan's brother is the chairman of Shunyuan COC.

720
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,180
How could you forget that?

721
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm digging my own grave.

722
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm doomed!

723
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,480
Totally screwed!

724
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,940
This is my daughter Xie Xiang.

725
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,960
She also

726
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,200
studies at a girls' school in Shunyuan.

727
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,120
I brought her

728
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,240
with me today.

729
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,640
Your daughter is in Shunyuan, too?

730
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,160
Yeah.

731
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,480
Xiang,

732
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,200
come and meet Mr. Shen.

733
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,480
Xiang,

734
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,720
Xiang,

735
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,360
what are you doing?

736
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,480
What's wrong with your face?

737
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Someone bumped into me.

738
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
I'm fine. It's OK.

739
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,520
Junshan.

740
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,960
Come.

741
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,800
You're so careless.

742
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
Bring Miss Xie upstairs to freshen up.

743
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,000
There's no need.

744
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,200
I can go there myself.

745
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,880
That's Qu Manting.

746
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,240
Really?

747
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,360
That superstar, right?

748
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,400
This must be Mr. Shen.

749
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,730
Who is this beautiful lady?

750
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,060
Why are you at my place?

751
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,040
So pretty.

752
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,920
I can't believe my eyes.

753
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,380
Shen Tingbai, what are you doing?

754
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Are you crazy?

755
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,320
Listen,

756
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,980
don't invite me to the boring banquets anymore.

757
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,060
I'm afraid I can't.

758
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,200
With you here,

759
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,760
the whole room looks brighter.

760
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,400
I enjoy your company.

761
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,260
It's not boring at all.

762
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,180
What's wrong with you?

763
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,080
Who taught you those words?

764
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
I've tried to win your heart for so long

765
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,490
and haven't succeeded.

766
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,480
So I thought

767
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,890
maybe I should change my strategy.

768
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,360
You might like

769
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,210
someone with a glib tongue.

770
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,920
You seem to be in a good mood.

771
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,520
If you're willing to dance with me,

772
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,410
I'll be in a better mood.

773
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,840
Ms. Qu,

774
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,880
may I have the honor

775
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,640
to invite you

776
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,960
to dance with me later?

777
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,360
Why don't you invite me later?

778
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,480
I don't feel your sincerity

779
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,280
at all.

780
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
I was afraid that if I waited for too long,

781
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,200
someone else would beat me to it.

782
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,680
Lower your voice.

783
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,810
I've looked around.

784
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
All men's eyes

785
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,480
are fixated on you.

786
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,120
I can't afford to make a mistake.

787
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,360
Keep your voice down!

788
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,490
Others can hear you.

789
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,650
You're ridiculous.

790
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,570
Why are you covering your face?

791
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,680
Mr. Shen.

792
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,520
Mr. Sato.

793
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,360
Mr. Shen, congratulations

794
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,650
on your new factory.

795
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,840
Mr. Sato,

796
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,040
you also think it's worthy of

797
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,640
celebration?

798
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,400
Of course.

799
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,360
Competition promotes progresses.

800
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,000
I fancy challenges,

801
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,440
especially those brought by

802
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,450
ambitious young men like Mr. Shen.

803
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,480
You're a generous man, Mr. Sato.

804
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,360
Looks like others

805
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,530
might have wronged you.

806
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,800
What did they say about me?

807
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
They say

808
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,360
you hold grudge against me

809
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
so you try to kill me.

810
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,060
Business is business.

811
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,440
I'm a businessman

812
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,920
not a killer.

813
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm glad

814
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,650
to hear you say that.

815
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,520
I used to think

816
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,760
all Japanese have a habit

817
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,360
of killing.

818
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,880
But then again,

819
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,800
business is like war.

820
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,240
Also,

821
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,240
other Japanese

822
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,960
may not be as law-abiding as me.

823
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,160
There's an old saying in China,

824
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,320
"Where there is a problem there is a solution."

825
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,780
Whether it's business or war,

826
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,000
I will

827
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,000
wait for you

828
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,160
and those

829
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,520
outlaws to fight it out.

830
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,280
You're a brave man.

831
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,920
I appreciate you.

832
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,520
Thanks for your

833
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,240
appreciation, Mr. Sato.

834
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,240
Ms. Qu's beauty is unparalleled.

835
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,960
You're lucky to have

836
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,760
such great company.

837
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,760
I heard a few days ago,

838
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,360
when Ms. Qu was in Club Paramo,

839
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,960
she almost got abducted.

840
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,360
We're in troubled times now.

841
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,000
Bandits are rampant.

842
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,520
You should be more careful

843
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,320
when going outside.
