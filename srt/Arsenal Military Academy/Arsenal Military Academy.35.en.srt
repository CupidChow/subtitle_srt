Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,500
Episode 35

4
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,289
Where are you going?

5
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,520
I will bet all my savings on Song.

6
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,840
This is a rare opportunity

7
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,039
to make a big fortune!

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,940
Ji Jin.

9
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,100
That's right!

10
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,140
Wait for me!

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,880
Ladies

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,060
and gentlemen!

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,720
The highlight tonight

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,039
is about to start.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,440
The challenger tonight is

16
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,400
a young boxer with eleven wins and three defeats.

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,720
His name is Yellow Cricket.

18
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:20,480
Yellow Cricket!

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,440
Yellow Cricket!

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,180
The rival of Yellow Cricket is

21
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,760
a strong man from Russia,

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,360
who can kill a bull with one blow, Andre!

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,040
Andre!

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,620
Let's warmly welcome

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,960
Andre to the stage!

26
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
On the life-and-death arena,

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,250
your life depends on

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,260
the will of god.

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,380
My friends.

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,980
The bet for the match is on.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,640
Bet more and win more.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
Let's wait and see.

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,520
Who will be the winner, the strong man

34
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,880
from Russia or the young man Yellow Cricket?

35
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,520
My friends.

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Lay your bets!

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,360
Andre!

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,320
Whom do you bet?

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,720
Andre!

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,520
Come. Whom do you bet?

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
How much? Tell me!

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,079
Where are you going?

43
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,680
They cheat!

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,210
His rival shouldn't be him!

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,400
But the match has started.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
What should we do?

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,280
I don't think they are simple.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,940
Even Mr. Mu isn't afraid to offend us now.

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
I don't think

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,490
this matter can be settled easily.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,440
Let's watch it first.

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,040
We can act according to circumstances.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,170
If it gets worse, we will intervene it.

54
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,240
The first round!

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,840
Go!

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,520
Song!

57
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,390
Song!

58
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
Great! Andre! Andre!

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,920
Andre!

60
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,600
Andre!

61
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
Hit him! Hit him!

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,480
Good!

63
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,120
Get up! Andre! Get up!

64
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,880
He won! He won!

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,080
Song, you are awesome!

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,480
Song!

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,860
Xie Liangchen!

68
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,760
Song!

69
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,290
What are you doing? Get out!

70
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,120
Yellow Cricket!

71
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,820
Get down!

72
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,260
Andre!

73
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,720
Move!

74
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,400
Wait.

75
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,760
Wait.

76
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,080
Yellow Cricket!

77
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,640
Andre!

78
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,400
Andre!

79
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,040
Andre!

80
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,200
Song.

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,040
Andre!

82
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,720
Andre!

83
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,440
How is it?

84
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,080
You killed him!

85
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,720
What?

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
You murderer!

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,480
What?

88
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,680
Let him go.

89
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,040
What are you doing?

90
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,120
What are you doing?

91
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Let him go!

92
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,420
Let him go!

93
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,360
Let him go!

94
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,960
Cheers!

95
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,680
Come. Come.

96
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,130
Don't you drink?

97
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,040
Junshan can't drink.

98
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,250
Drink it.

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,920
Why did you cheer if you don't drink?

100
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,980
I'll drink for him.

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,120
Guys.

102
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,960
It's so thrilling today.

103
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Drink!

104
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,760
Well.

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,930
We left after the match.

106
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,400
Was the man truly killed?

107
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. Mu said it.

108
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,440
The life depended on the will of god.

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,159
Don't worry about it.

110
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,880
Right.

111
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
He lost the match indeed.

112
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,020
Is it right?

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,240
Do we…

114
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,460
Do we cause any troubles to Mr. Mu?

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,960
Huang Song.

116
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,080
You are so silly.

117
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,480
They found such a strong man to fight you.

118
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
They didn't have good intentions.

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,880
Do you still worry about them?

120
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,400
You...

121
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,920
Drink. Come on.

122
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,880
Drink. Drink.

123
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,060
Xiaoyu.

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
The boat arrives.

125
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,960
Xiaoyu.

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
You did a great favor for us this time.

127
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
It's just a fluke.

128
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,789
I thought it would have been hard to get it.

129
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,909
You are modest.

130
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,419
For these weapons,

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,150
I know

132
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,010
you have taken a great risk.

133
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,140
I will report it to the superiors.

134
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
If it had not been you,

135
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,270
our work in the north would have been very hard.

136
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,160
I will try to get rewards for you.

137
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,040
No need.

138
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,400
I help you

139
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
merely out of my conscience.

140
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,900
Take care of yourself.

141
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,120
Don't take the wrong way.

142
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,130
Don't worry.

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,000
We will live up to your expectations.

144
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,080
Xiaoyu.

145
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,100
It's ready.

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,960
OK.

147
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,120
Leave now.

148
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,780
Be careful on the road.

149
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,440
Cheers!

150
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,090
Why are you so happy?

151
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,760
Xiaoyu.

152
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,700
You don't know.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,000
Song fought in the life-and-death boxing today.

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,930
And he defeated his Russian rival.

155
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,680
Life-and-death boxing?

156
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,200
Siege it!

157
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,240
You can act according to circumstances.

158
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,040
Xiaodao. Liu.

159
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,690
You three follow me out.

160
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,410
What's going on?

161
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,330
I don't know.

162
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,520
Captain He.

163
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,080
Why did you do this?

164
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,960
Ms. Huo.

165
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,440
A gang of men committed a murder in Douwei Club.

166
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,100
Pretend to cooperate with me.

167
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,800
They killed a Russian,

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,040
and injured others.

169
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,940
We received reports that

170
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,360
they were hiding in your tavern.

171
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,770
We need to go inside and search.

172
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
What do you mean?

173
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,840
Our guests are high officials and nobles.

174
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,890
If you offended any of them,

175
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
my business would be ruined.

176
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,160
Unless you have undeniable evidence,

177
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,600
I won't allow you to come in.

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,240
Ms. Huo.

179
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,160
Don't force me to be rude.

180
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,080
It was a Russian that was killed.

181
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,720
A Russian? So what?

182
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,240
If you wanna get in,

183
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,400
you must step over my body!

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,660
Captain He.

185
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,000
You are so majestic today.

186
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,410
Are you alright?

187
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,920
I'm fine.

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Put the guns down.

189
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
Sergeant Guo.

190
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,720
What brings you here?

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,530
I'm telling you.

192
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,360
This matter has been handed over

193
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,920
to Arsenal Military Academy.

194
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
I'll explain it personally

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
to the police station tomorrow.

196
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
This is the order from the Director.

197
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,170
Do you wanna intervene?

198
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,800
Your Director seems so idle.

199
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,920
He even deals with an underground fight

200
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,920
in person.

201
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,200
Now it is intervened by the military.

202
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,330
We'd better go back.

203
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,130
I can do nothing.

204
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,600
We are disappointed!

205
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,840
Go back!

206
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
Why did you come here?

207
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,940
These bastards caused such a trouble to me!

208
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,960
Director.

209
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,980
This matter is very troublesome.

210
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,130
If it had been good to us,

211
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,080
the police would have robbed it.

212
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,740
How could it come to me?

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,720
It isn't an ordinary matter.

214
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,190
It's simple to arrest them.

215
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,000
But

216
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
it would be troublesome after that.

217
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,660
Others are easy to deal with.

218
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,590
But Chu Yunsheng

219
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,660
is said to be from Rong Mansion.

220
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,540
Though we are not ruled

221
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,020
by an emperor any more.

222
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
But Lord Rong

223
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,200
has connections both in the military and the politics,

224
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,930
which shouldn't be belittled.

225
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
The Commander doesn't straightly take actions to him.

226
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,520
He may also have misgivings in this aspect.

227
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,320
This sly fox!

228
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,080
All the benefits have been occupied by him.

229
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,600
He just leaves me this crap!

230
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,200
Director.

231
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,540
Can we postpone

232
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,360
this matter

233
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,420
and then pass it to others?

234
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,880
Report!

235
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,760
Come in.

236
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,780
Liangchen.

237
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,440
What?

238
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,660
Aren't you satisfied?

239
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,850
You killed him in the underground boxing.

240
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,080
The Russians have reported it

241
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
to the Commander.

242
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,220
You have caused such a great trouble.

243
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,040
Do you still dare to complain about it?

244
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,440
For the life-and-death boxing,

245
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,920
the death is determined by god.

246
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,640
What does it matter to kill him?

247
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,840
But it's a foreigner!

248
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,160
Do they stick to the rules?

249
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,120
I tell you.

250
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Don't be bad-tempered here as a childe.

251
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,540
The AMA is not an entertainment club.

252
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
If you don't want to stay,

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,280
get out of here right now.

254
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,520
Continue.

255
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,000
My back is aching all over it.

256
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,000
The body seems to fall apart.

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,730
It's not bad.

258
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
At least we have the beds to lie on.

259
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,720
For Song,

260
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,450
he is still in confinement now.

261
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,000
Sergeant Lv showed no mercy at all.

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,560
Alert Alert Alert

263
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,400
The Black People Were Enslaved

264
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,040
Let's see it.

265
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,570
The Red People Were Extinct

266
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,520
While The Yellow People Are Not Awake Yet

267
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,600
Don't Rely On Enemies

268
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,360
Don't Drink Poison For Thirsty

269
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,640
Don't Take Disasters As Shows

270
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
Eight Hundred Million People

271
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Are Troubled In the Same Trap

272
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
Awake Awake Awake

273
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,360
Alert Alert Alert

274
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,560
Descendants Of Fuxi And Xuanyuan

275
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,080
Disciples Of Confucius And Mencius

276
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,340
-The Saints Passed Away With Nothing Left - So reasonable.

277
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,080
So reasonable.

278
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,010
Foreign Enemies

279
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
Harassed The Nation

280
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,880
Don't Be Slaves

281
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,240
Fight Against It

282
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,640
The Long Centuries Are Like A Long Night

283
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,160
Awake Awake Awake

284
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
Alert Alert Alert

285
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,920
The Country Has Been Suffering In Silence

286
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,040
It's Time For Compatriots To Revolt

287
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,560
Yell To Frighten Enemies

288
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,520
Don't Be Their Running Dogs

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,640
Be Kind To Your Own People

290
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,640
Don't Be Intimidated

291
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,810
Be Awake And Waken Others Up

292
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,829
Take Your Own Responsibility

293
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
Awake Awake Awake

294
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,349
Nice song!

295
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,680
Sergeant Lv.

296
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
I slightly modified this song,

297
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,720
Be Alert and Awake,

298
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
and gave you as a gift.

299
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,810
Is it good or not?

300
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Tell me!

301
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,080
The Arsenal Military Academy

302
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,680
is a place to train soldiers.

303
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,200
Soldiers,

304
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,330
are the sword of the nation,

305
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
and the shield of the people.

306
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,440
It's nothing to kill several foreign enemies.

307
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,240
From now on,

308
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,440
I'll repel all the foreign enemies

309
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,500
out of the country.

310
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,480
Good!

311
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,240
Good! Good!

312
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,970
Good speech!

313
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,680
Yeah.

314
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,100
Gu Yanzhen.

315
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,700
Your patriotism impressed me today!

316
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,780
Don't touch me.

317
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,770
Lv Zhongxin.

318
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
If what you want is a gang of toadies,

319
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,260
without integrity

320
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,090
and without spirit,

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
then you can arrest all of us.

322
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,440
Otherwise,

323
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,050
you release Huang Song now.

324
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,340
Huang Song.

325
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,040
Get in.

326
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,970
Do you come here?

327
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,080
Hit me!

328
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,240
Come!

329
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,280
You are...

330
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,440
Liangchen.

331
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,240
Why were you prisoned?

332
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,320
Ask him.

333
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,300
Huang Song. Give me a massage.

334
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,080
Gu Yanzhen.

335
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,340
He is so bold

336
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,340
in advantage of his father.

337
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,400
Hello.

338
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,130
Lv Zhongxin.

339
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,120
Yes.

340
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,730
I'll handle it as soon as possible.

341
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,960
Director.

342
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,100
The Commander urged it again.

343
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,200
Director.

344
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,430
These troublesome students can be saved.

345
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,100
It's the time to test them.

346
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,480
We can give them one opportunity

347
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,280
to make up for their wrongdoing.

348
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
If they succeed,

349
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,800
we can account for it to the Commander.

350
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,720
And they can stay at the AMA.

351
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,600
If they fail,

352
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,080
there is Gu Zongtang.

353
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,200
Even if they make some troubles,

354
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,930
it won't endanger their lives.

355
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,360
Yanzhen.

356
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,620
How do you feel?

357
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,200
Is it painful here?

358
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,200
It's comfortable, right?

359
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,880
I tell you.

360
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,160
I learned it from my master

361
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
when I was at home.

362
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,440
Be gentle.

363
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,600
OK.

364
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,360
Be gentle.

365
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Is it alright now?

366
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,740
Is the strength OK now?

367
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,740
Your neck seems...

368
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,600
Take it.

369
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,800
This is a list.

370
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,560
It records the opium traffickers

371
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,720
who trade opium

372
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,800
against laws around the province.

373
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
They are also the largest

374
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,220
opium dealer gangs as we know.

375
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,560
They all have decent jobs,

376
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
stable families,

377
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,200
and a legal identity background.

378
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,650
And some even work for the government.

379
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
They are cunning.

380
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,880
They have contacts both in the underground and the authority.

381
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,680
The police wanna to arrest them,

382
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,100
but they don't have concrete evidence.

383
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,630
Even the Commander can't rashly arrest them.

384
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,480
Thanks to you,

385
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,540
we got this detailed name list

386
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,500
of traffickers this time,

387
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,520
because the one who supplied goods to them

388
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,640
was the Russian

389
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,570
who fought with you in Douwei Club.

390
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,260
The police followed this clue

391
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,210
and found the names out.

392
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,610
What do you want us to do?

393
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,040
Each one of them

394
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,370
has lots of blood debts.

395
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
They can't pay it

396
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,570
even though they die hundreds of times for it.

397
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,340
But the government has its own rules,

398
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
and it can't arrest them without evidence.

399
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
Particularly, there are foreigners involved in it.

400
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,280
So,

401
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,200
they hand over the case to us.

402
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,280
Sergeant.

403
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,400
Do you want us to find the evidence?

404
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,660
You're not the police.

405
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,800
The investigation for evidence is the police's work.

406
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
You are soldiers.

407
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,700
Your work is to obey orders

408
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,180
and slain the enemies.

409
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,810
It can't be called as a task.

410
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,200
You can say so.

411
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,520
The task this time is special.

412
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
Due to many aspects involved,

413
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,700
the academy will not directly intervene

414
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,440
or give you any assistance.

415
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,400
Once you fail,

416
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
it will be defined as

417
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,010
your voluntary vengeance,

418
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,860
which has nothing to do with the academy.

419
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,770
So innocent the academy is.

420
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,900
So you can choose to refuse it.

421
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,920
But, in view of your repeated violations of the academy rules,

422
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,850
if you refuse it,

423
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,480
you will be expelled from the academy straightly,

424
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,940
and never enrolled again.

425
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,920
You are forcing us to do it.

426
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,500
I said you could refuse it.

427
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,060
Believe me.

428
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,480
I am glad to see that.

429
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,100
Alright.

430
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,920
I have made it clear.

431
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Make your decisions now.

432
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,360
If you choose the task,

433
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,520
you can leave.

434
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,960
If you choose to reject the task,

435
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,560
stay here.

436
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,430
I'll notice your family

437
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,240
to help you drop out of school tomorrow.

438
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
What should we do?

439
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,410
I'm going first.

440
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,460
Liangchen.

441
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Will you go or not?

442
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,760
Sergeant.

443
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,040
We are not in the same boat.

444
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,280
Your theft is even worse than what they did.

445
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
If Sergeant Guo hadn't interceded for you,

446
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,800
you could have been expelled from school.

447
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Sergeant. I didn't steal anything.

448
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,720
They framed me.

449
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,740
It's up to you to go or not.

450
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,400
Sergeant.

451
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,600
I told you. Go. Go.

452
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,320
Wait! Wait!

453
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,640
Wait! Buy some wine to drink.

454
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,280
Bro!

455
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,520
Bro!

456
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,720
Please.

457
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,960
Bro!

458
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,040
Bro!

459
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,560
Is this what they said

460
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,620
no any assistance?

461
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,180
They don't give any guns to us.

462
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,940
How can they drive us out in the midnight?

463
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,400
You want a gun?

464
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,440
Sergeant Lv deliberately drove us out.

465
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,560
In this way, if something wrong goes with us,

466
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,640
they can say that we escape from school in the midnight

467
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,500
and our actions have nothing to do with the academy.

468
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,880
Lv is so sly.

469
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,300
What should we do now?

470
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
We have no weapon.

471
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,640
The traffickers' information isn't detailed either.

472
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,400
Even the Commander Zhang dares not to deal with them rashly.

473
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
If we act recklessly,

474
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,740
it's just suicide.

475
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,220
About weapons, we can solve it later.

476
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Where is the list?

477
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,720
I have it.

478
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,600
Here.

479
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,700
Pass it on.

480
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,480
Let's distribute the work.

481
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,720
No matter what the method is,

482
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
within three days,

483
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,120
we need to get their detailed information.

484
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,650
Don't you come here?

485
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,900
If I get together with you,

486
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,580
I am afraid to be killed by you.

487
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,960
Come! Come!

488
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,600
Again!

489
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,640
I'll bet this.

490
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,800
Large! Large!

491
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,680
Come! Come!

492
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,520
Lay the bet!

493
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,040
Large or small?

494
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,960
Small!

495
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,160
Large! Large!

496
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,320
Large or small?

497
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,680
Open! open it!

498
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,480
Large! Large!

499
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,000
I won!

500
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,280
Large!

501
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,000
Lay the bet.

502
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,280
Large or small?

503
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,400
Large! Large!

504
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Take hands away when you decide.

505
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,160
I'll open!

506
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,160
Come! Come!

507
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,120
Lay the bet!

508
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,000
Take hands away when you decide!

509
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,080
Do you wanna bet it?

510
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,810
Anyone else?

511
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
Take hands away when you decide.

512
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,400
Small! Small!

513
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Small!

514
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,520
This is Shi Hu.

515
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,500
His brother was Shi Long,

516
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,120
who was killed in a gang fight two years ago.

517
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,160
Shi Hu survived with a narrow escape.

518
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,890
But his two fingers on the right hand were broken.

519
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
At present, Shi Hu controls forty percent

520
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,530
of smuggling channels in Feng'an.

521
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,280
He controls military necessary supplies

522
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,520
such as drugs, arms and others.

523
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,360
In the Wanzhou Battle, he provided

524
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,720
the army with a large quantity of drugs.

525
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,280
He was even awarded by the Commander.

526
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,880
Of course,

527
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,500
he made a big fortune by it.

528
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,920
Shi Hu runs two casinos

529
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,160
and one restaurant.

530
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,560
But the most profitable business is opium.

531
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,010
Before the ban of opium,

532
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Shi Hu owns up to twenty opium stores

533
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
around the three provinces.

534
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,580
After the ban of opium,

535
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,320
he apparently closed the opium stores

536
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,360
and operated the hotels alternatively.

537
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,040
In fact, the opium is still sold

538
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
in the hotels.

539
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,560
Sergeant LV said

540
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,240
they couldn't find the concrete evidence.

541
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,570
I won't comment on that.

542
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,240
But if his crime can be convicted

543
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,360
by his opium business,

544
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
then I can catch him selling opium several times each day,

545
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,980
and without any mistakes.

546
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,240
This man

547
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,760
is very meticulous.

548
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,800
He has several houses

549
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,520
at Yellow River Street,

550
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,260
Civil Road and Nanshikou.

551
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,200
His three concubines

552
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
live in these houses respectively.

553
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,400
I have been following him for three days.

554
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,640
But I still don't know where he lives at night.

555
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,900
If we intend to kill him at his residence,

556
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,920
the success rate isn't high.

557
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,040
This is Chu Yunsheng,

558
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,080
whose English name is Cruz Robert,

559
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
a Chinese-British.

560
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,320
He is a leather businessman apparently.

561
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,880
In fact,

562
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,700
he is the largest tipster in the far east.

563
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,760
He has a gang of professional intelligence personnel,

564
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,280
being close to the famous British mercenaries,

565
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,680
Gurkha Mercenaries.

566
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,640
There is a legend in the intelligence community.

567
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,960
In the first Sino-Japanese War,

568
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,320
Jiyuan Vessel and Guangyi Vessel

569
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,520
escorted three thousand soldiers to Inchon.

570
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,760
One week before the war,

571
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,820
the news spread widely in the market.

572
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,240
Finally, the intelligence was sold to the Japanese at a high price.

573
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,970
The seller of the intelligence was Chu Yunsheng.

574
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,720
He is secretive in his movements,

575
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,560
with many bodyguards.

576
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,220
And he is extremely cautious.

577
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,040
He has a house in Shunyuan,

578
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,570
with a few servants inside.

579
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,420
He hardly goes back there.

580
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,280
By the way,

581
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,600
Shi Hu's sister-in-law

582
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,400
is Chu Yunsheng's nominal daughter.

583
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,360
Shi Long has been dead for two years.

584
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,680
The woman did not remarry

585
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,200
and still lived in Shi Mansion.

586
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,660
It is supposed that she has lived with Shi Hu.

587
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,720
But these aren't confirmed yet.

588
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,100
Wen Jingze.

589
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,040
Forty-two years old.

590
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,920
One of the children studying in the United States at the end of Qing Dynasty,

591
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,780
graduated from Yale University,

592
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,760
majoring in Civil Engineering.

593
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,200
He works as a technical consultant in the Commander's office.

594
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,760
Besides,

595
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,280
he is a professor

596
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,940
at St. John University and Beiyang University.

597
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,900
From the information,

598
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,480
it's hard to believe that

599
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,280
he is the manipulator behind the opium trade in the three provinces.

600
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,200
But many people don't know that

601
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,530
Wen Jingze is an addict,

602
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,170
greatly addicted in opium.

603
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,880
From this, it is speculated that

604
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,680
Wen Jingze got addicted to opium

605
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,200
and then controlled by Shi Hu

606
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,770
and became the agent inside the Commander's office.

607
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,360
Wen Jingze is undefended.

608
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,920
It's easy to kill him.

609
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,480
But he has high prestige in academia,

610
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,680
and owns excellent reputation.

611
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,720
If we kill him,

612
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,130
I'm afraid there will be chaos.

613
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,930
Junshan.

614
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,100
What about you?

615
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,200
Petrovic,

616
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,860
is a famous Russian opium dealer,

617
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,770
with about twenty bodyguards,

618
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,200
living on the second floor of Jinhua Hotel.

619
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,880
Shi Hu sent another twenty men to protect him,

620
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,640
and reserved all the rooms on the first floor.

621
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,720
He seldom goes out,

622
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,980
and mostly stays in the hotel.

623
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,050
Their business has completed now.

624
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,160
He will leave Shunyuan two days after tomorrow.

625
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,840
It means

626
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,880
if we wanna take actions,

627
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,700
only two days are left.

628
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,240
So I suggest

629
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,090
we can start from him

630
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,660
if we want to take actions.

631
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,780
But the problem is that

632
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,300
we don't have any weapons.

633
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,120
How can we fight against

634
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,580
thirty heavily armed men?

635
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,410
Don't worry about this.

636
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,440
I have an idea.

637
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,690
Junshan.

638
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,680
Are these all yours?

639
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,040
It's my hobby.

640
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,520
Well.

641
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,760
It's

642
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,240
unbelievable!

643
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,930
Take it easy.

644
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,840
Take it easy.

645
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,170
You shouldn't take us here.

646
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,500
He can speak to others,

647
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,400
as long as he is bold enough.

648
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,130
With these weapons,

649
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,960
we can go anywhere

650
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,440
even in the most dangerous places.

651
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,040
What are you thinking about?

652
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,449
Jinhua Hotel is next to the police station and the gendarmerie.

653
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,880
And there are heavily armed security guards

654
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,670
at the gate.

655
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,120
With these guns,

656
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,150
can you come out alive?

657
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,400
Well.

658
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,600
Shengping Theater is opposite to the Jinhua Hotel.

659
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,670
We can go to the roof

660
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,360
and snipe him from a long distance.

661
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,000
No.

662
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
The two buildings are too far apart.

663
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,360
It is out of range of sniping.

664
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,150
Well.

665
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
What should we do?

666
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,480
What to do?

667
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,860
Do you have to kill by a gun?

668
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,040
Jinhua Hotel was built in the Eleventh Year, in the Guangxu Era of the Qing Dynasty

669
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,360
by Russian designers.

670
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,520
There are one hundred and forty-six standard rooms,

671
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,520
sixteen luxury rooms and six ultra-luxury rooms in the hotel.

672
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,840
There are also restaurant, concert hall,

673
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,480
club, chess and cards room, library,

674
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,810
billiard room and so on.

675
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,740
The interior decor is of European style.

676
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,560
It is constructed by reinforced concrete wholly,

677
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,880
whose walls are hard.

678
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,080
Even machine guns can't shoot through.

679
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,740
The Room No.1 on each floor is ultra-luxury,

680
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,930
with the same decor,

681
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,960
and the same interior furnishings.

682
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,890
There is an independent stairway,

683
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,880
dedicated to

684
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,400
chefs and servants for this room.

685
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,400
It is difficult for outsiders to enter.

686
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
The security level is very high.

687
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,700
Reservation is not available.

688
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,160
It only serves for government officials

689
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,000
and high-ranked persons.

690
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,720
And our target

691
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,120
is on the third floor.

692
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,200
Petrovic,

693
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,320
a Russian,

694
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
with Dutch blood,

695
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
was born in an aristocratic family.

696
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,440
In the thirty-first year of Guangxu,

697
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,920
the revolution broke out in Russia.

698
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,440
Military police fired at civilians,

699
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,800
causing more than four thousand casualties.

700
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,400
To appease the public anger,

701
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,360
their emperor

702
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,120
took the Petrovic Family

703
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,440
as a scapegoat,

704
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,360
and Petrovic's parents were killed.

705
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,820
He survived the disaster,

706
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,340
and was exiled in Britain.

707
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,280
He met Chu Yunsheng there,

708
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,090
becoming a stable business partner of Chu Yunsheng.

709
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,960
He has extreme fastidiousness,

710
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
and doesn't eat mustard.

711
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,760
He can't even stand the smell.

712
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,920
What's the matter

713
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,720
with his dislike of the mustard?

714
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,480
Do you want to poison him?

715
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,680
He has many foes.

716
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
According to the intelligence I bought,

717
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,760
he dominated at least

718
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,580
twice assassinations against the tsar.

719
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,760
Do you think he hides in the hotel

720
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,090
to avoid from the arrest

721
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,080
by the incapable police?

722
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,680
His meals

723
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,660
are checked more than three times every day.

724
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,120
Only a fool like you

725
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,680
may try to poison him.

726
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,600
This man has many bodyguards,

727
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,940
and he is vigilant.

728
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,880
Even if we get the chance

729
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,080
to lead him out,

730
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,940
it's risky to kill him.

731
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,180
And the rate to succeed is low.

732
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
What should we do now?

733
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,690
He must have a solution.

734
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,800
Just listen to him.

735
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,440
Mr. Song.

736
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Is the room ready?

737
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,000
Yes, sir.

738
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,210
I'll lead you up.

739
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,480
Wait for me.

740
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,800
Mr. Song.

741
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Where should I place your suitcase?

742
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,160
Put it aside.

743
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,280
OK.

744
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,620
What else can I do for you?

745
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,080
Leave.

746
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,010
Thank you, Mr. Song.

747
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,220
Captain He.

748
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,760
Captain.

749
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,170
Do you want to see me?

750
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,480
What's up?

751
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,340
The Russian in Douwei Club

752
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,920
was killed by me.

753
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,800
Hello.

754
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,880
The man who killed Andre was found?

755
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,840
Where is he?

756
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,780
In the police station.

757
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,680
Go.

758
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,060
There are goodies!

759
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,480
Sorry! Sorry!

760
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,630
I didn't mean it.

761
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,120
Mr. Peter.

762
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
