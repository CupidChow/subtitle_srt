Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,420
Episode 37

4
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,039
It sounds that

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,479
you are here to provoke me.

6
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,520
I dare not to provoke you.

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,360
I just have the intention

8
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,440
to extend my greetings.

9
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,320
After all, we have contacted several times,

10
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,120
but I don't even know who you are.

11
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,920
It's a pity.

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,360
Now you know me.

13
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,120
Yes.

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,280
Farewell.

15
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
By the way,

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
I picked someone up on my way.

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,080
I supposed he was the man in your tavern,

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
so I took him to you.

19
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
You may know him.

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Liu!

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,520
Damn you!

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,410
What have you done to my bro?

23
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,560
What the hell do you want?

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,320
I want nothing.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,880
I just took him to meet you

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,200
out of my conscience.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,500
Is this your attitude?

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
My man.

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,520
You'd better let me see if he is alive.

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,760
Of course.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,360
Liu! Liu!

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,880
Liu!

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,560
Liu!

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,170
Xiaoyu. He is still breathing.

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,520
Since he is your man,

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,880
you'd better watch him over.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't allow him to run around outside.

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
Otherwise,

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,160
he may be killed

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,080
for no reason.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Do you leave?

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,820
Do you want to keep me here?

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
Let her leave.

44
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,040
- Liu! - Liu!

45
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
Xiaoyu.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
Get a doctor here!

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,980
Take him upstairs.

48
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,040
Hurry.

49
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,880
Hurry.

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,800
Help him go upstairs.

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,320
Here. Here.

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,400
Here. Be careful.

53
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,400
Here.

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,040
Slowly.

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,520
Hurry.

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,840
Liu!

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,970
Put him on the table.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,120
Here.

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,120
Be gentle.

60
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,840
You go out now.

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,320
Zhameng,

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,510
you stay here.

63
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,240
Yes.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,829
Xiaoyu.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,320
Liu.

66
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
Liu.

67
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,280
Liu.

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Liu.

69
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,920
Liu!

70
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,800
Liu!

71
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,000
Hold on!

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Liu!

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
Liu!

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Liu!

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,170
Liu. Don't scare me!

76
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,360
You bastard!

77
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,760
Liu!

78
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,000
Liu!

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,960
Xiaoyu.

80
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,850
Are you from the Revolutionary Party?

81
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,320
No.

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,250
That woman is Oda Xianrong,

83
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,500
the chairman of the Japanese COC.

84
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,920
She is not an ordinary person.

85
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
Xiaoyu,

86
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,200
be careful.

87
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,560
I know.

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,800
Sergeant Guo.

89
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,700
Where did you go today?

90
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,330
I don't tell you.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,240
Look, Yanzhen.

92
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,040
The superstar!

93
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
Superstar...

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,760
What?

95
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,020
I don't want to see her.

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,120
Come here. Come here.

97
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,920
Come here.

98
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,130
This crazy woman comes here again.

99
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
I can't stand it.

100
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,920
Let's go.

101
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,780
I take you to eat some goodies.

102
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,920
No.

103
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,920
I have classes in the afternoon.

104
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,200
I tell you.

105
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,660
Guo won't come these days.

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
How do you know he won't come?

107
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,960
I just know it.

108
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,920
Go with me.

109
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,560
I don't believe you.

110
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,690
I will go to classes.

111
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,880
Are you my bro?

112
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,120
No.

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,360
Go. Go. Go.

114
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,320
Don't tell her you see me.

115
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,520
No.

116
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,840
I can't lie.

117
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,320
I know.

118
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Gu Yanzhen.

119
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
Qu Manting. What's wrong with you?

120
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,580
Why do you haunt me around?

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,540
Am I a ghost?

122
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,960
Why do you run away from me?

123
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,760
You are right.

124
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,880
You go out.

125
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,640
Don't!

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,520
Go out! Now!

127
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
Qu Manting.

128
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
You care about me so much.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,840
What will you do if I indulge you?

130
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,840
Look at you.

131
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,960
Can you be mature?

132
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,840
I am immature.

133
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm worthless.

134
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't you see it?

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,400
I order all these foods.

136
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,660
But I only eat peanuts.

137
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,600
So what?

138
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,400
The door is over there.

139
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,360
You can leave.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,330
Do you force me to leave?

141
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,160
What are you doing?

142
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,640
Go.

143
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
Can you be reserved?

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,880
This is the last part of the drama.

145
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,520
The male leading role can't resist the pressure from his family,

146
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,880
so he decides to go home to be married.

147
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,400
He farewells to you before leaving.

148
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,440
You try to retain him,

149
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,400
but he is still determined to go.

150
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,280
You are extremely sad in the heart.

151
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,320
But your expression

152
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,360
shows that

153
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,480
you are tough.

154
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,280
When he turns around,

155
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,000
you commit suicide by cutting wrist.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Ms. Qu.

157
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,160
You need to think about

158
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,280
the feeling deep in her heart,

159
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,920
which is a strong sorrow.

160
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,120
So fragrant.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What perfume is it?

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Can you tell me?

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'd like to buy it for my girlfriend.

164
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,040
Do you have a girlfriend?

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,880
Yes.

166
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,540
But she is bad-tempered,

167
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,720
like a man,

168
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,130
not so gentle as you.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,840
Ms. Qu.

170
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,280
I...

171
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
Ms. Qu.

172
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,760
Are you listening to me?

173
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm listening.

174
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,720
You just say it.

175
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,400
I...

176
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Yanzhen.

177
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,410
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,540
Don't leave!

179
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,240
Stand here!

180
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,170
How do you dare to flirt her?

181
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,760
You are taken here by me.

182
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,440
What?

183
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,840
Do you wanna embarrass me?

184
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,640
Listen.

185
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,570
Don't get me mad.

186
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,320
I didn't ask you to take me here.

187
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,380
I was forced by you.

188
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,840
If you dare to look around

189
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,170
with your lustful eyes,

190
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,280
I will go to your school

191
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,010
and disclose all your secrets.

192
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,080
Go ahead!

193
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,810
The whole world has known them.

194
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,900
You don't care, right?

195
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm telling you.

196
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,520
I'll tell Xie Liangchen

197
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,600
that you flirt with other women,

198
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,930
and you are unfaithful.

199
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,720
Alright.

200
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,480
Will she be jealous?

201
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,040
I… Go to hell.

202
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
Listen to me.

203
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,840
If anyone dares to talk to him,

204
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
chat with him,

205
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,880
and if I catch you,

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,120
you are screwed.

207
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,600
Are you sick?

208
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Do you have a cure?

209
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,200
Ms. Qu.

210
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,760
Ms. Qu.

211
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,520
Stand there.

212
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,250
Men can't come here either.

213
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,640
Director.

214
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,640
Manting.

215
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,560
Come…

216
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,360
What?

217
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Come here.

218
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,200
Did you receive Lin Yufei?

219
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,600
No.

220
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,080
Mr. Lin returned to Shanghai.

221
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,680
What?

222
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,480
To Shanghai?

223
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
He left yesterday.

224
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,080
He said his dog was dead.

225
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,720
He went back to attend the funeral.

226
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,240
Are you kidding me?

227
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
He is the leading role of my movie!

228
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
If he left,

229
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,980
how can I make the film?

230
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Director.

231
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,040
It's useless to scold me.

232
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,800
Or else,

233
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,660
can I be the leading actor?

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Damn it.

235
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
How could he be like this?

236
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,160
- He has no professional ethics at all! - Director.

237
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,200
I have an idea.

238
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Look.

239
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,540
My role is the key part

240
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,280
of this play.

241
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,400
Lin Yufei

242
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,640
has no line in this part at all.

243
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,160
We can find someone

244
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,540
with the similar figure as him

245
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,200
and just shoot his back.

246
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,120
We can shoot the close-ups

247
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
when he comes back.

248
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,240
Ms. Qu,

249
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,000
it's so easy as you said.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,660
But where to find this person?

251
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,160
He?

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,500
Can he do it?

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
His back is similar.

254
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
But Mr. Gu must be unwilling to do it.

255
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,640
I have an idea.

256
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Mr. Gu.

257
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,320
Can I help you?

258
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Mr. Gu.

259
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Your mother

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,360
must be a great beauty.

261
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,170
What do you mean?

262
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,640
Nothing.

263
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,760
I just guess it.

264
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,040
Your mother must be a great beauty.

265
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,200
Otherwise, how can you be

266
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,520
so handsome?

267
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,050
When you stand here,

268
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,440
my leading actor

269
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,100
pales by comparison with you.

270
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,340
Who is your leading actor?

271
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,140
He arrived.

272
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,760
But he quarreled with Manting

273
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,520
and left.

274
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,380
She gets mad again?

275
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
Actually,

276
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,480
Manting shouldn't be blamed.

277
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,920
He arrived here.

278
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,480
It's the last part of the play,

279
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,400
so he didn't want to put on the makeup.

280
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,680
Then Manting said:

281
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
Look at your profile.

282
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,440
Gu Yanzhen is much prettier than you.

283
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,640
You don't put on the makeup.

284
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,600
Don't you feel guilty to audiences?

285
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,120
So he got angry and asked:

286
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,100
Who the hell is Gu Yanzhen?

287
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,960
Is he good-looking? Find him to act.

288
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
I quit!

289
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,810
Then he left.

290
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Though Qu Manting is bad-tempered,

291
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
her aesthetic judgment is good.

292
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,680
Yeah.

293
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,600
But Manting was miserable.

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,520
She is being scolded by the director.

295
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,280
With a bad-tempered actress as you,

296
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,800
how can I shoot films afterwards?

297
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
You have offended all my staffs,

298
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,640
and you even offended me.

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,940
The director asked her

300
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,360
to apologize to him.

301
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,200
If she couldn't get him back,

302
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,140
she has to find another actor.

303
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
It's hard to find a triple-legged toad,

304
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,040
but it's easy to find a man.

305
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,920
Inferior men are everywhere.

306
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
But someone as handsome as you,

307
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,120
there is none.

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,530
Don't be like this anymore.

309
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,400
Does it work?

310
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,880
Mr. Gu, you are versatile.

311
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
You are not only handsome,

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,320
but you can also play the piano.

313
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,780
If you become a film actor,

314
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
you will surely be a superstar.

315
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,920
Do you think so?

316
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,080
Of course.

317
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
I never lie.

318
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
I swear it with my professionalism.

319
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,680
Look at you,

320
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,640
not to mention the domestic film community,

321
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,800
even in the world,

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
your temperament is unparalleled.

323
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,320
Really?

324
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Of course.

325
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,120
But you are from a noble and rich family.

326
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,600
You might be reluctant to enter the film industry.

327
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,920
Even you are willing to act,

328
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,850
your family will disagree with it.

329
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,160
It's such a pity

330
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
for the domestic fans.

331
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,160
Actually, my family doesn't care about this.

332
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,040
Really?

333
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,440
But I have no experience.

334
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,040
Your image is so good

335
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,970
and you don't need any experience.

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,320
When you just stand here,

337
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,080
you are a beautiful scenery.

338
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,680
When you smile,

339
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,330
you are the idol of the mass.

340
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,680
Do you really think so?

341
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,880
Yes, it's true!

342
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,890
Mr. Gu. If you don't believe me,

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,160
we can have a try.

344
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,720
Anyway, we are idle now.

345
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,560
If you act in this movie,

346
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,960
it will be a blockbuster.

347
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,680
But it was acted by others before.

348
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
If you change the leading actor,

349
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,480
can the audiences accept it?

350
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,600
It doesn't matter.

351
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,240
The scripter can modify the script.

352
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,680
We can write that the leading role is transformed

353
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,480
when he has the elixir.

354
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,760
Even his appearance is changed.

355
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,480
Is it feasible?

356
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,160
Sure.

357
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,680
OK. It's a deal.

358
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,480
Director.

359
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,720
Mr. Gu agrees.

360
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,200
Really?

361
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,960
Alright. Alright.

362
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,829
Cosmetics! Costume!

363
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,480
Hurry up!

364
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,640
Change costumes!

365
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,589
Great!

366
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,200
Come. Come.

367
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,040
Put on the makeup.

368
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,760
Costumes!

369
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,760
I don't agree yet.

370
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,240
Costumes!

371
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,310
Hurry up!

372
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,829
Change his clothes!

373
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,310
Cheers!

374
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,200
Thanks for your efforts!

375
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,320
Enjoy the food!

376
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,080
Enjoy the food!

377
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,720
Director Sheng, let's drink.

378
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,960
We eat some food first.

379
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,720
Don't.

380
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,780
Let's drink first.

381
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,560
Come. Come.

382
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,440
Your acting is good!

383
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,160
Come.

384
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,160
Not bad.

385
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,160
Why do you act so well?

386
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm gifted.

387
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,480
Come on.

388
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,040
Have a drink.

389
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,970
Because that's your true thought.

390
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,240
In fact, you dearly love me

391
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,800
deep in your heart.

392
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,260
You are just unaware of it.

393
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,200
Nonsense!

394
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,000
You are a good storyteller.

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,880
Why don't you be a director?

396
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,940
Don't you admit it?

397
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,240
Well. Mr. Gu.

398
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,880
What?

399
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
Don't touch him!

400
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,100
Men should keep away from men.

401
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Don't you know it?

402
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,080
Come. Come.

403
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,200
Drink!

404
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,280
Come. Come.

405
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,600
The director is drunk.

406
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,280
Director. You're weak.

407
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,520
Director Sheng.

408
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,450
Are you alright?

409
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,100
Are you drunk?

410
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm fine.

411
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,440
Drink.

412
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,320
I see.

413
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,920
Manting. He is drunk.

414
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,040
I will send him away.

415
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,840
Go ahead.

416
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,700
What about you?

417
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,640
Gu Yanzhen will send me back.

418
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,100
I get worried if he sends you.

419
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,160
What do you mean, bro?

420
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,200
Between us,

421
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,060
can't you see who is being forced?

422
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I worry about you.

423
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,600
What do you say?

424
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Don't blame him!

425
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,520
He is to throw up.

426
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,920
Take him away now.

427
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,040
I'll take him away.

428
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,700
Take care of yourself.

429
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,520
Drink!

430
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,340
I'm not drunk.

431
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,800
OK. You're not drunk.

432
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,680
We're leaving.

433
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,960
Manting. We're leaving.

434
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,400
He's about to throw up.

435
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,440
So disgusting.

436
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,400
I feel sick, too.

437
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
Let's go. Qu Manting.

438
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,560
Go or not?

439
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,360
Let's go.

440
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,920
Gu Yanzhen.

441
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,520
They all left.

442
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,320
Just you and me are here.

443
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,380
What are you doing?

444
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,680
Say what you want,

445
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
but don't hold me.

446
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,320
I am drunk.

447
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,160
Release me.

448
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,680
No.

449
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,200
Hurry.

450
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,080
I am drunk.

451
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,520
You said you are not.

452
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,280
I wasn't drunk just now.

453
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,120
But now I am.

454
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Go. Go. I'll send you back.

455
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll send you back.

456
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,920
Hurry up.

457
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,680
I don't wanna go back.

458
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,560
I have no strength to walk.

459
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,720
What do you want then?

460
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,200
Hold me.

461
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,280
Come up.

462
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,040
Horse riding.

463
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,600
Hurry up.

464
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,520
Be quiet.

465
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,200
Why do you take the flowers?

466
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Whom are they for?

467
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,730
They are not for you anyway.

468
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,160
Mr. Gu.

469
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,920
Ms. Qu.

470
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,280
I am the driver of film crew.

471
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,440
The director asked me to send Ms. Qu back.

472
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
So great.

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,640
No. You send me back.

474
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,680
We have a driver here.

475
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,880
I don't care. You send me back.

476
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,520
Can you be reasonable?

477
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,320
I can't. I'm a woman.

478
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,920
You don't keep your words.

479
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,280
You're lying.

480
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,160
Wait.

481
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,160
Sir,

482
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,090
this was ordered by another guest.

483
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,800
I'll take it.

484
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,340
Help me pack it.

485
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,000
Please pack it at the front desk.

486
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
- I can't eat. - This way, please.

487
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,120
I'm full.

488
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,800
It's not for you.

489
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
What are you doing?

490
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,040
Let the driver take you back.

491
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,520
No.

492
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,040
Gu Yanzhen.

493
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,320
If you don't go with me,

494
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,600
I'll wait here.

495
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,600
Ms. Qu.

496
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Your belongings.

497
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,840
Sir, it's packed.

498
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,440
Keep the change.

499
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,300
Thank you, sir.

500
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,040
Ms. Qu.

501
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,200
May I send you home?

502
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,000
You can leave.

503
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,400
But...

504
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,520
You leave.

505
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Yes.

506
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,820
What are you doing?

507
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,560
Fixing the water pipe.

508
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,960
The water pipe is broken.

509
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,520
I brought you some goodies.

510
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,280
I don't eat.

511
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,920
Go.

512
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,920
What?

513
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
The water pipe is leaking.

514
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,080
Hurry up.

515
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,680
What are you doing?

516
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Don't move.

517
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,600
Sit.

518
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,680
Do you eat?

519
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,240
Yes.

520
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,200
Put the flowers in a vase.

521
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,960
Mind your hands.

522
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,520
How about it?

523
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,280
It's good.

524
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,120
Is it sweet?

525
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,560
Yes.

526
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,400
How sweet is it?

527
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,480
Very sweet.

528
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,600
How sweet is ‘very sweet'?

529
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,400
Nonsense.

530
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Repair your pipe.

531
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,880
Is it sweet as me?

532
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,040
Gu Yanzhen.

533
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Have you fixed it?

534
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Yes, I fixed it.

535
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,000
It's a piece of cake for me.

536
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,040
What noise?

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,960
The toilet.

538
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,240
Cool.

539
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,010
Why do you come here?

540
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,440
Wanna a bath?

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,960
Come. Come.

542
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,300
The temperature is adjusted.

543
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,040
It is so warm.

544
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,600
Look.

545
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,080
When the water is injected,

546
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,040
so comfortable!

547
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,120
Come.

548
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,160
Gu Yanzhen. You are crazy!

549
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,360
Gu Yanzhen.

550
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,000
Gu Yanzhen.

551
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,680
Gu Yanzhen.

552
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,200
Gu Yanzhen.

553
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,360
Hurry.

554
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,840
I...

555
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Gu Yanzhen.

556
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,700
Someone wants to see you downstairs.

557
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,440
Why do you stare at me so angrily?

558
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,100
Qu Manting. You idiot!

559
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,200
You said you would send me back.

560
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,980
So didn't you go back the whole night?

561
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
I said I would wait for you.

562
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,170
Do you feel cold?

563
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,040
This hand.

564
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,400
Go. Go back.

565
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,600
What's up?

566
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,960
I squatted the whole night.

567
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,120
My legs are numb.

568
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,880
Let me help you.

569
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,680
Go.

570
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,760
What's up now?

571
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,280
I can't walk.

572
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,080
What do you want then?

573
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,740
Get off the car.

574
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,640
Get off.

575
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,960
My legs are numb.

576
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,320
I can't walk.

577
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,200
Can you get off?

578
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,600
Gu Yanzhen.

579
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
You are annoying.

580
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,440
You do it again!

581
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,720
Miss.

582
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,440
You… Who are you?

583
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,080
Ms. He! Hush!

584
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,960
Why do you carry her?

585
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,280
It's fine. Fine.

586
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,520
Ms. He. It's fine.

587
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,360
Fine. Fine.

588
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,160
Sister?

589
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,720
It's not a big deal.

590
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,240
Don't make a fuss.

591
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
Where is your room?

592
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,800
Who are you?

593
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,680
Upstairs.

594
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,800
I live upstairs.

595
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,960
I'll tell you later.

596
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,450
Gu Yanzhen. You hurt me.

597
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,320
Gu Yanzhen.

598
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
You broke my door!

599
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,770
Gu Yanzhen. Get me down!

600
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,200
I have a stomachache.

601
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
Stomachache.

602
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,280
Stomachache.

603
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,320
Take a rest.

604
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,960
I'm leaving.

605
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,680
Stop!

606
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,520
Do you have any business?

607
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
It's lunch time.

608
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,090
You can have lunch here.

609
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,040
My parents will be back soon.

610
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,520
You haven't met them yet.

611
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
You can meet them.

612
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,560
Aren't your feet numb?

613
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,160
Right.

614
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,800
So weird!

615
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,360
My feet were numb just now.

616
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,840
But they are well now.

617
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,240
Qu Manting.

618
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I say it again.

619
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,600
No, I don't listen.

620
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
I don't. I don't.

621
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,360
I don't love you.

622
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,010
I just take you as my friend.

623
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,040
Right.

624
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,040
You are beautiful.

625
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
As before,

626
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,520
I might have fallen for you.

627
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,020
But now I love another person.

628
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,360
I have no time

629
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,520
and have no mood to play with you.

630
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,370
Gu Yanzhen. Do you think I'm playing with you?

631
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,960
Are you serious?

632
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,810
What do you regard me as?

633
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,040
We were acting.

634
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,760
Nothing more.

635
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,920
Gu Yanzhen. You idiot!

636
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,440
Yeah.

637
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,600
I am an idiot.

638
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,280
No one can fall for an idiot.

639
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,960
So you shouldn't love me.

640
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
Dislike me?

641
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,840
That's alright.

642
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,040
You don't like me.

643
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,370
I don't like you either.

644
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,840
It is fair.

645
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,960
You work in the north now.

646
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,320
If you need help, tell me.

647
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,420
Afterall, we know each other.

648
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,840
I will help you as I can.

649
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,560
Get away.

650
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,840
Get away.

651
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,040
I'm leaving.

652
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,560
Xiaoyu.

653
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,520
How is it?

654
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
All the locations are clear.

655
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,920
You can be reassured.

656
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,670
The shoes are good.

657
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,630
Where did you buy it?

658
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,670
Of course.

659
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,630
The shoes

660
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,280
were brought by a friend

661
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,000
of my father from abroad.

662
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,360
Really?

663
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,440
So is my car.

664
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,480
Less than ten in the whole Feng'an.

665
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,520
That...

666
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,360
Are you blind?

667
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,800
Sorry, sir.

668
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
So sorry, sir.

669
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,360
Do you know how much my shoes are?

670
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,120
So sorry, sir.

671
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,150
Let me clean it.

672
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,560
Get away.

673
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,040
Damn it.

674
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,190
Let's go.

675
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,800
My new shoes...

676
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,040
Alright.

677
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,760
Just go back and clean it.

678
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,230
So sorry, sir.

679
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,290
Boss. A bunch of flowers for me.

680
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,480
Please.

681
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,920
Xiaojun.

682
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,560
What's up?

683
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,040
Good news.

684
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,840
I'll take you somewhere.

685
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,280
Let's go.

686
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,120
Wait. Wait.

687
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,040
Tell me what it is.

688
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,760
Don't take me

689
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,600
to your annoying female classmates.

690
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
I can't stand it.

691
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,340
Annoying female classmates?

692
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,080
Do you really regard yourself as a boy?

693
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,240
You are a girl.

694
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,220
You stay with the men every day.

695
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,840
You become almost a tomboy now.

696
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,360
Be a tomboy then.

697
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Tell me what it is.

698
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,730
I took a leave of absence and came here.

699
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,120
There is a dance party tonight.

700
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,040
Would you like to go with me?

701
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,000
No.

702
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Why?

703
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm not interested.

704
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,680
How come you are not interested?

705
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,960
It will be fun.

706
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,360
It is jointly held by several schools.

707
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,120
Really.

708
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,440
My lady.

709
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,560
I am so busy.

710
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,800
The water pipe in my dormitory is broken.

711
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,760
I have to repair the water pipe.

712
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,280
You can repair it tomorrow.

713
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,680
The dance is only for today.

714
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,080
Please go with me.

715
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,860
Why do you want me to go?

716
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,820
What are you plotting?

717
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,000
I have no plot.

718
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,040
I just think

719
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,240
you are so good

720
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,700
at dancing.

721
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,700
So I invite you to go dancing with me.

722
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,600
I know there is nothing good.

723
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
Of course it's good.

724
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,420
Dancing is good, isn't it?

725
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,640
Please.

726
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,520
Really.

727
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,000
- I... - Go with me.

728
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,760
The pipe has been broken for three days.

729
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,920
Please go with me.

730
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,370
What are you looking at?

731
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,400
Take this.

732
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,680
Push me again!

733
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,280
You push me again!

734
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,200
So what?

735
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,920
You wanna fight?

736
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,680
Yeah.

737
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
Knock! Knock!

738
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,360
I won't argue with you today.

739
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Where will you go?

740
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,860
None of your business.

741
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,340
Did you repair the water pipe?

742
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,200
Not just me live in the room.

743
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,060
Why should I repair it every time?

744
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,280
What's wrong with you?

745
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,360
Go. Go.

746
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,440
Please go with me.

747
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,880
You are so annoying.

748
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,120
Alright. Alright.

749
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,760
Hello. Welcome.

750
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,360
Hello.

751
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:23,880
Hello.

752
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Look.

753
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,200
So pretty!

754
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,720
Xiaojun.

755
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Whose car is this?

756
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,520
It's my classmate's.

757
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,000
Who is your rich classmate

758
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,460
that can hold a party here?

759
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,640
Don't care about it.

760
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,720
Just follow me.

761
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,800
Welcome, ladies.

762
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,680
This is a masquerade.

763
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,410
- Pick your favorite mask. - OK.

764
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,700
Thank you.

765
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,360
This way.

766
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,720
Thanks.

767
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,640
That guy is so ugly.

768
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,280
Xiaojun.

769
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,560
It's kind of weird.

770
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,000
What is it?

771
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,760
You are poor students.

772
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
How can you afford a party

773
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,400
to be held here?

774
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,700
Besides,

775
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,900
look at these people.

776
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,620
No one looks like your classmate.

777
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,440
Don't care about it.

778
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,640
Just enjoy yourself.

779
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,080
What's your purpose?

780
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,600
What purpose can I have?

781
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,000
I have no purpose.

782
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,680
Miss.

783
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,080
May I dance with you?

784
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,800
Sorry, miss.

785
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm sorry.

786
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,600
It's fine.

787
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,440
I'm sorry.

788
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,400
Thank you.

789
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,760
But your handkerchief gets dirty.

790
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,620
Sorry for that.

791
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,200
Me?

792
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,400
Dance?

793
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,410
I am not good at dancing.

794
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,760
Alright.

795
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,880
Do you often come to the parties like this?

796
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,560
No.

797
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
It's the first time.

798
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,620
You danced so well.

799
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,440
Thank you.

800
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,740
Your friend dances well, too.

801
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,220
Haven't you recognized me?
