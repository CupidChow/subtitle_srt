Arsenal Military Academy

3
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,500
Episode 43

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,520
I'll risk my life

5
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,920
to get the revenge on you!

6
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,000
Then have a try.

7
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,520
You!

8
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,289
Put the gun down.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,730
Put the gun down.

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,330
The old Lord and his son have just passed away.

11
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
And you shoot in their mourning hall.

12
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,890
Is it appropriate to

13
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,800
do that?

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,400
He kept on saying to kill me.

15
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,260
I defended myself.

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,650
Why is that inappropriate?

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,000
He said if you did

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
kill the old Lord and his family,

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,920
he would revenge for his master.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,480
Ms. Oda, you acted in such a rush

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,610
and intended to kill him immediately.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,530
Are you really the murderer

23
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,540
of this family?

24
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
You think I'm the murderer, too?

25
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,610
It doesn't matter what I think.

26
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
The thing matters

27
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,560
is the truth.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,760
OK.

29
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,940
If you all think I'm the murderer,

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,760
why bother asking me?

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,960
Go find your truth.

32
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,460
If you want to revenge,

33
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,360
come at me.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,640
Move.

35
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,560
You're Oda Hideyuki's daughter?

36
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,840
Yes.

37
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,960
Even your late father

38
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,770
didn't dare to speak with me like that.

39
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,600
Lord Rong is an old friend to me.

40
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,040
When I assembled my army,

41
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
he helped me a lot.

42
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,360
Now his families were murdered.

43
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,040
I'm very sad.

44
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,480
Song Xicheng.

45
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,410
Yes. Commander.

46
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,540
Deliver the words.

47
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,130
Find out the murderer of

48
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,220
Lord Rong and his families

49
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,400
no matter what it costs.

50
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,320
Yes.

51
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,240
Mr. Shen,

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,560
I heard that

53
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,600
your family and Rong Mansion

54
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,800
partnered in a graphite mine

55
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,960
of large reserve.

56
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,800
Is it true?

57
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,440
Yes, it is.

58
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,840
Commander.

59
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,340
It's a great undertaking,

60
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,240
concerning people's livelihood.

61
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,320
Do you have any difficulties?

62
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,060
As for equipment and technology,

63
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,160
we can solve it by ourselves.

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,800
But some people are undermining us

65
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,300
by hurting our technical staffs.

66
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,090
It troubled me the most.

67
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,640
Technology

68
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,040
stands for a nation's core competitiveness.

69
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,880
Resources are

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,530
fundamental to technological development.

71
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
They are

72
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
integral and complementary to each other.

73
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,720
What you are doing

74
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,260
is beneficial to the country and the people.

75
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,540
As the guardian of the region,

76
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I shall not allow

77
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,720
anyone to undermine

78
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,210
the big undertaking

79
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,440
under my nose.

80
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,840
You.

81
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Commander.

82
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,560
Are you from the Arsenal Military Academy?

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Yes.

84
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,860
Xie Liangchen, the 7th Batch of the Academy.

85
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
Tell Lv Zhongxin

86
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
I have an assignment for him.

87
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,900
From now on,

88
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,820
the Arsenal Military Academy takes over

89
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,740
the security of technical staffs

90
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,500
of Shunyuan Chamber of Commerce.

91
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,240
Whoever,

92
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,160
regardless of his ranks,

93
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,120
dares to

94
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
undermine the security

95
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,440
of the mining of graphite,

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,900
you have my permission

97
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,740
to take all necessary actions to fight back.

98
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,730
Yes, Commander.

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,960
This gun

100
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,360
is for you.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,960
Tell your pals and colleagues that

102
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,040
you're Chinese

103
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,159
who stand on your own land.

104
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,650
If you're bullied by others

105
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,360
at your own home

106
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,320
you are not qualified

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
soldiers of Arsenal Military Academy.

108
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,170
Yes, Commander.

109
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
Commander Zhang assigned this mission

110
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,120
to the Arsenal Military Academy,

111
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,320
because he trusts us.

112
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,960
So we must ensure the safety of the two experts

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,680
while they're in Shunyuan.

114
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,970
We don't take failures,

115
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
nor excuses.

116
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,340
Anyone who fails to do that

117
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,620
will be punished by military law.

118
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,720
Now,

119
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,909
Sergeant Guo will introduce you

120
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,610
the specific assignments.

121
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
The new addresses of the two experts

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,040
are one street away.

123
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,520
The straight-line distance is

124
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,780
about 300 meters or so.

125
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,120
They're out of the way

126
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,400
with few people dwelling there.

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,720
Their houses are in the open field.

128
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
Perfect for both attack and defense.

129
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,520
Besides,

130
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,240
they're close to the garrison.

131
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,990
Once they're attacked,

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,730
we can get backup in short time.

133
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,720
The two experts

134
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,520
won't stay in Shunyuan for long.

135
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,880
Basically,

136
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,280
they work at home.

137
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,890
So my plan is that

138
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,800
one squad

139
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
takes undercover

140
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,920
outside their houses.

141
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,490
The other two squads

142
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
stay close to them.

143
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,100
Excuse me, Sir.

144
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,840
Yes?

145
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,530
We stay close to them wherever they go?

146
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,170
Any problems with that?

147
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,400
No, Sir.

148
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,280
Good.

149
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
If there's no other questions,

150
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,240
get prepared.

151
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,660
Yes, Sergeant.

152
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,360
What the heck is this?

153
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,520
Ask us to work on the festival.

154
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,360
I heard Commander Zhang was angry about

155
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,490
the assassination.

156
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,290
So we're assigned to protect them.

157
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,200
But...

158
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,060
It's so boring.

159
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
What the heck!

160
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,480
They singled out the festival

161
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
to carry out the assassination.

162
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,760
Yeah.

163
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,020
We don't have a choice.

164
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,810
Li Wenzhong.

165
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,890
What are you talking about?

166
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,640
I...

167
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Forget it.

168
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,620
Go back now.

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
We need to pack up.

170
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,780
Liangchen,

171
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,800
you're nice to Li Wenzhong recently.

172
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,720
Last time when I went to save Xiaojun,

173
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
he came back for help.

174
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,540
Or I don't know whether we could make it.

175
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,760
So I owe him once.

176
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,760
Actually,

177
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
he's a good guy.

178
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,040
A few days ago,

179
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,320
I saw him helping the flower shop with the soil.

180
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,360
An Wen's flower shop?

181
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,880
What's he up to?

182
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,970
It's not what you think.

183
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,040
I heard that

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,440
the owner of the flower shop…

185
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,840
is retarded.

186
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,960
She's stupid.

187
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Who said that?

188
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,360
She's just bad at memorizing.

189
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Bad at memorizing?

190
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,800
That means stupid.

191
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,240
I don't want to argue with you.

192
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,760
No.

193
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,090
I have to remind her.

194
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,820
Liangchen.

195
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,600
Listen,

196
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,900
if you dare to bully

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
this girl again,

198
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,960
I'll let you know the result.

199
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,660
No, no.

200
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,760
I won't do that.

201
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,180
All right. See you.

202
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,000
Where's the landlord?

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,600
He left.

204
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,400
Left?

205
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
I haven't paid him the rent yet.

206
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
You paid it already.

207
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,540
You...you forgot?

208
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,960
The money is in my hands now.

209
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,880
Look at you.

210
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,720
You paid him the rent for six months.

211
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,120
Go back and write it down.

212
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Did you take the medicine I gave you?

213
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,840
Yeah.

214
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,540
I'm feeling much better now.

215
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,840
Then keep taking the medicine,

216
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,900
and the notes, too.

217
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
Write it down on your notebook.

218
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
If the landlord causes any trouble,

219
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,640
ask him to come to me.

220
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,240
OK.

221
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
Well, don't just say it.

222
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,810
Get in and write it down.

223
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Do you like An Wen?

224
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,640
What nonsense!

225
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
You can't deny it.

226
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560
You like her.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,480
Listen. If you dare to speak it out,

228
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,600
I'll pull your teeth out.

229
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,260
Come on. I'm not afraid of you.

230
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,300
So it's true that you like her.

231
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Get out of my sight.

232
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,160
What a surprise!

233
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,120
You have a crush on someone.

234
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,020
Do you women all like gossips?

235
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,920
I...I know your secret, too.

236
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,880
I'll speak it out, if you expose mine.

237
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,610
Go on with it.

238
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,400
I know your secret, too.

239
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,960
If you speak mine out,

240
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,280
I'll report to the administration

241
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,720
that you like An Wen.

242
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,200
An Wen...

243
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
All right. Shut up.

244
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,560
- You hear me? - OK, OK. I'll shut up.

245
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,320
You can't tell anyone. Do you hear me?

246
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,920
Li Wenzhong likes...

247
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,760
You just can't stop.

248
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,020
You just can't, right?

249
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,840
Go.

250
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,060
Deal or not?

251
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,440
I'll deal.

252
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,300
Deal or not?

253
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,760
No deal. Pass.

254
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,320
No deal?

255
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,440
Wait a minute.

256
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,320
Nail it.

257
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,480
Nail him. Nail it.

258
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
You can't, right?

259
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,600
Deal the cards.

260
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,880
Do you know the rules or not?

261
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,340
You should have nailed it.

262
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm done.

263
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,610
Li Wenzhong.

264
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,570
What do you mean?

265
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm done.

266
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,400
You're the one who wants to play.

267
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,120
Now you quit. How are we going to play?

268
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
Enough with the cards.

269
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,940
I can't fall in sleep here.

270
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,300
Do I have tails?

271
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
Don't be so jumpy.

272
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,800
We've been here for a month.

273
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
I haven't met one suspicious man.

274
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,610
We'd better be careful.

275
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,040
Professor Chen's work is about to finish.

276
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
Let's hope nothing wrong will happen.

277
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,760
Yeah.

278
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,000
Song,

279
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,600
what do we have today?

280
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
Noodles.

281
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,000
Again?

282
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,760
And no meat at all?

283
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,080
Mrs. Chen believes in Buddhism.

284
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,280
We can't eat meat.

285
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,940
We can buy some for ourselves,

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
not for her.

287
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,170
If we put meat in the basket,

288
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,560
she'll know.

289
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,160
I'll kill you with the...

290
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,720
Why don't you buy a basket of our own?

291
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,050
Sergeant Guo's orders.

292
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,680
We can only buy vegetables, nothing else.

293
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,160
N..n..nothing.

294
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,760
All right.

295
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,360
Hold on there.

296
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,880
For half a month.

297
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,160
When we finish the job,

298
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,520
we can have whatever we want.

299
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,040
Right?

300
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,120
Take some.

301
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,280
If you don't want it,

302
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,010
give it to me.

303
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,440
I'll throw it away.

304
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,960
I'd rather give it to street dogs.

305
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,560
You...

306
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,160
I can't stand it.

307
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
If the dog bites you,

308
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,610
Yanzhen.

309
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,400
will you bite it back?

310
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,530
Get up and take some.

311
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,200
No.

312
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,720
You want to eat meat, too?

313
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,060
He won't eat it?

314
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,640
I think

315
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,920
he's not picky about food.

316
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,170
It's because

317
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,720
he's jealous.

318
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,720
I mean

319
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,960
why do they let Shen Junshan make the deployment?

320
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,290
What's he got to do that?

321
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,720
Look.

322
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,460
I was right.

323
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,120
Yanzhen,

324
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Shen Junshan and you are different.

325
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Not necessarily.

326
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,069
It's OK.

327
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,829
Let's eat.

328
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,589
Huang Song, you go upstairs with me.

329
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,720
You three stay here.

330
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,120
Mrs. Chen,

331
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,560
are you OK?

332
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,360
It's OK.

333
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,520
He broke a glass.

334
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
Each year in this season,

335
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,200
he coughs.

336
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,320
To complete the drawings,

337
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
he hasn't been sleeping for nights.

338
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
The cough hits him now.

339
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,720
What should we do?

340
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,800
Shall we get him a doctor?

341
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,600
No need.

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,410
I have a prescription here.

343
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,450
Hold on a second.

344
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
It's prescribed

345
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,920
by a Chinese medicine master back in Nanjing.

346
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,400
It works well on him.

347
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,580
Can you help get the medicine?

348
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,720
OK.

349
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,200
We'll leave you now.

350
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,320
Let's go.

351
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,540
Everything all right?

352
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,800
It's OK.

353
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,440
A broken glass.

354
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,770
Professor Chen coughs.

355
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm going to get the medicine.

356
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,720
Song,

357
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
I cough, too.

358
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,880
Cough?

359
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Do you catch cold?

360
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,160
Probably.

361
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,460
Well, I'll buy some medicine for you.

362
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,720
No need.

363
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
I...I have a fever.

364
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,960
Feel it.

365
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,240
My chest pains.

366
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,520
My head aches.

367
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,440
It's OK.

368
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,640
What? Not hot?

369
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,120
It's...it's hot.

370
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,420
What is wrong with you?

371
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,400
Yeah.

372
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
What is wrong with me?

373
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,780
It must be serious.

374
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,880
Um...do you need to see a doctor?

375
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,520
That's for the best.

376
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,760
Well...

377
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,800
You go get Professor Chen's medicine,

378
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
and get yourself diagnosed.

379
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,840
OK.

380
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
Don't worry.

381
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,200
OK.

382
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,270
I'll be careful.

383
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,020
The prescription.

384
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,960
Don't tell Sergeant Guo.

385
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,100
Don't be too late.

386
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,760
Be careful.

387
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,450
Where are you going?

388
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,570
To the bathroom.

389
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,730
You want to come?

390
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,340
Ignore him.

391
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,000
Take some.

392
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,080
You, too.

393
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,570
Let's dance.

394
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,160
I can't.

395
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,120
Anything?

396
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,280
No.

397
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,960
Is it time for dinner?

398
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,290
I'll go downstairs now.

399
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,250
Li Wenzhong.

400
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,560
You were there for ages.

401
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,730
Astriction?

402
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,440
A little bit.

403
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,170
A little bit.

404
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What's the smell?

405
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,340
I...well...I...

406
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,240
It...I...

407
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,000
I just came out of the bathroom.

408
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,130
What smell can it be?

409
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,600
What's wrong with you?

410
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,320
Nuts?

411
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,960
Song,

412
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,500
what are you doing?

413
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,610
Honing my calligraphy.

414
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,080
Calligraphy?

415
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,640
You want to try your luck in academics?

416
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,280
No.

417
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,620
Professor Chen taught me.

418
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,360
He said

419
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,240
practicing calligraphy made

420
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,560
your hands steady,

421
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,300
so you could shoot the target.

422
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,160
Song,

423
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,890
don't listen to him.

424
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,340
Though you're not quite smart,

425
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,120
it's an honor

426
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,250
to be fooled by Professor Chen.

427
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,040
You handle the brush wrong.

428
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,760
You know?

429
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,740
Do you know how?

430
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,170
Show me then.

431
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,800
OK.

432
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
I'll show you how to use paintbrush.

433
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,100
OK.

434
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,720
I don't know you write.

435
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,280
Let me see

436
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,410
who is bragging.

437
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,850
Another phrase.

438
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,200
Rigorous.

439
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,440
Rigorous.

440
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,560
Excuse me. Excuse me.

441
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Make way.

442
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,100
Can you please make way for me?

443
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
Sugar-coated haws.

444
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,520
Who opened the window?

445
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,420
I'll go upstairs and check it.

446
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,080
Professor Chen.

447
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,760
Watch out!

448
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,530
Let's go.

449
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,660
Professor.

450
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,860
Stay there.

451
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,000
Lihua!

452
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,800
Lihua!

453
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,960
Lihua!

454
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,620
Professor.

455
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,130
What's going on?

456
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,330
Stop looking. Let's go.

457
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,400
What's up?

458
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,570
Li Wenzhong.

459
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,340
Huang Song!

460
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,800
Huang Song!

461
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,730
Don't come over.

462
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,860
Huang Song.

463
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,140
Huang Song.

464
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,320
Huang Song!

465
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,400
Huang Song!

466
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,800
Huang Song.

467
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,960
Huang Song.

468
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,680
Sniper.

469
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,440
Fall back.

470
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,320
Go.

471
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,240
Hurry.

472
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,760
Go.

473
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:42,960
Doctor.

474
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,480
The operation room.

475
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,410
Come. Get him in.

476
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,160
This way.

477
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,320
Here.

478
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,660
Huang Song.

479
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,580
Huang Song.

480
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,060
Huang Song.

481
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,730
Stay with me.

482
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,130
Wake up, Huang Song.

483
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,700
Huang Song.

484
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,420
Why do you stop?

485
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,760
Don't shake your head.

486
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,280
You have to save him.

487
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,080
Do you hear me?

488
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,280
You have to save him.

489
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,080
Save him.

490
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
Huang Song.

491
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,680
Huang Song.

492
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,340
Huang Song.

493
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,540
Huang Song.

494
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,820
Don't play with me.

495
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Open your eyes for me.

496
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,840
Look at me.

497
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,640
Huang Song.

498
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,520
Huang Song.

499
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,620
Huang Song.

500
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,720
Huang Song.

501
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,120
Present arms!

502
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,480
Get ready!

503
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,520
Fire!

504
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,880
Recover!

505
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,360
Gu Yanzhen.

506
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,380
Someone reported that

507
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,200
when you were out to get medicine for Huang Song,

508
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,660
you took a different route

509
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,330
and went to Professor Wu's safe house.

510
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,480
Is it true?

511
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,980
Yes, Sergeant.

512
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
It's my fault.

513
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,720
Gu Yanzhen,

514
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,360
you left your post without permission

515
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,620
which led to one death, another wounded,

516
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,520
and your colleague, Huang Song's death.

517
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,640
After thorough discussion,

518
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,840
you'll have a severe negligence in your file

519
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,700
and take a confinement of 15 days.

520
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,160
Are you ready?

521
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm ready.

522
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,920
OK.

523
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,640
Get ready.

524
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,480
Wait a minute.

525
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,440
Is your sister as tall as you?

526
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,840
No.

527
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,400
I think she's shorter.

528
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,400
It's OK.

529
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,800
I'll tiptoe.

530
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,400
Get down.

531
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,360
You are taking a picture with me.

532
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,680
What's it to do with my sister?

533
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,340
Be serious.

534
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,200
Stay close to me.

535
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,000
Close.

536
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,000
Troublesome.

537
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,880
Smile.

538
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,480
OK.

539
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,240
You can take the picture now.

540
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,800
Sergeant Guo.

541
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,360
How is he?

542
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,200
It's been 3 days.

543
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
He refuses to eat.

544
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,120
There'll be casualties.

545
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,700
Haven't you been prepared for it?

546
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,440
All right.

547
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,060
Don't feel guilty.

548
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,010
Now you're still alive.

549
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Do something the deceased can't do.

550
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,080
Don't stay idle like this.

551
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,250
You're so sentimental now.

552
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,840
You have to stay alive

553
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,020
to revenge for him.

554
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,840
Right?

555
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Are you all right?

556
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm OK.

557
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,200
Gu Yanzhen.

558
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,660
I want to take a shower.

559
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,880
Gu Yanzhen.

560
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,780
I reported you to Sergeant Lv.

561
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,880
Whether it was you who exposed us or not,

562
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,920
you'll have to take the responsibility.

563
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,480
Rules

564
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,760
and disciplines

565
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,560
are the fundamentals of an army.

566
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,040
If you can't obey them,

567
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,880
you'd better leave.

568
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,220
Or you'll get your men like Huang Song killed

569
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,480
sooner or later.
