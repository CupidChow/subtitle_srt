Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,539
Episode 18

4
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,280
You...

5
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
You go first.

6
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,240
What are you doing here?

7
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,160
I...

8
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,520
take a walk.

9
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,040
A walk?

10
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,840
Don't you live...

11
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Let's talk about you.

12
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,800
Why do you come back school?

13
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,760
I was bored at home. So I come back.

14
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,320
It's Spring Festival.

15
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,080
And that's what you've had?

16
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,200
There's no one in the school.

17
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,720
The boiler workers are gone.

18
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,080
It's cold.

19
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
Why don't you live in a hotel?

20
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,040
The hotels are closed.

21
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,440
I can't afford the luxurious ones.

22
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,200
There are a lot of rooms in my place.

23
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
Why don't you live in my place?

24
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,760
No, thanks.

25
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,280
I'll put on more clothes.

26
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,920
What's so funny?

27
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,760
Nothing.

28
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm so happy to see you.

29
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Xie Liangchen.

30
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Welcome back.

31
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,840
Ms. Qu.

32
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,840
Happy New Year!

33
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,840
Happy New Year!

34
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,040
It's only you?

35
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,720
Yeah, it's Spring Festival.

36
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,600
They are all at home now.

37
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,800
Send some dinner

38
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,960
to my room then.

39
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm sorry, Ms. Qu.

40
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,560
The chiefs are on holiday.

41
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,320
They're not available until 4 days after the festival.

42
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,320
And except for you, we don't have

43
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,920
any other guests in our hotel.

44
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,880
OK.

45
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,440
Ms. Qu, why don't you go back home?

46
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,400
If you want to have dinner,

47
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,240
you'll need to go a little further.

48
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
The restaurants nearby are closed.

49
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
And the rickshaw is hardly seen on the street.

50
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,520
Do you drive?

51
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,920
No.

52
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
Then it's going to be a long wait.

53
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,800
OK, I got it. Thank you.

54
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,600
My pleasure.

55
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,200
Ms. Qu, see you.

56
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,000
See you.

57
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
The waitress told me it was hard to get a rickshaw.

58
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,200
What a liar!

59
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,240
In recent days,

60
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,159
it is hard to get one.

61
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
Most workers are at home.

62
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,000
But I met you once I came out.

63
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,840
Maybe it's because you're lucky.

64
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
Yes.

65
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm lucky all the time.

66
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
Where to? Miss.

67
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,160
To the Wintersweet.

68
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,680
OK.

69
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
Miss, here we are.

70
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,280
Thank you.

71
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,480
No, it's OK.

72
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,400
No need to pay me again.

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Again?

74
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,400
I mean it's Spring Festival.

75
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,549
Just for good luck.

76
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
So it's free.

77
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,720
Take it as my blessing to you.

78
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,880
I can't. Take it.

79
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
That's too much.

80
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,440
Take it now.

81
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,760
That...that's too much.

82
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,320
Take it.

83
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,680
And this.

84
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,920
It's...

85
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,840
It must be hard for you to work on Spring Festival.

86
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,920
Thank you very much.

87
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
Take it as a red envelope.

88
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,760
Thank you. Thank you, Miss.

89
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,280
God bless you, Miss.

90
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Happy New Year!

91
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
Happy New Year!

92
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,880
Take care.

93
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,920
Hello?

94
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Are you closed for today?

95
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,240
Are you Miss Qu Manting?

96
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,520
Yeah, I am.

97
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,200
We're not closed, yet.

98
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
Ms. Qu, this way, please.

99
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,400
Thank you.

100
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
Ms. Qu, what do you want to eat?

101
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,560
Spaghetti, please.

102
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,200
Only spaghetti?

103
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,760
It's Spring Festival and late in the night.

104
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,520
I can't bother you too much.

105
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,520
Spaghetti, please.

106
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,200
I'll leave as soon as I finish.

107
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,000
So you can go home early.

108
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,680
It's OK. It's OK.

109
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,480
It's our duty to serve you.

110
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,240
No.

111
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,880
That's not what I mean.

112
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
It's our duty to serve the customers.

113
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
You can order whatever you want.

114
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
We're well supplied in the kitchen.

115
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,640
A steak, then.

116
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,080
And

117
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,800
A glass of lemon juice, please.

118
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,440
OK.

119
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,560
Anything else?

120
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,540
No, thanks.

121
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:14,580
In a moment, Ms. Qu.

122
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,240
We'll serve them up soon.

123
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,080
Thank you.

124
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,400
Thank you.

125
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
I...but I...

126
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,480
I...

127
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,200
I didn't order these.

128
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,760
No, Ms. Qu.

129
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,440
These are all on the house.

130
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
All of these?

131
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
On the house?

132
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,360
Yes.

133
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
You must be kidding.

134
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,440
No.

135
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,920
As you said, Ms. Qu,

136
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,720
It's Spring Festival.

137
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,920
We seldom have guests.

138
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,360
And we have so many ingredients.

139
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,080
They are going to rot if we don't cook.

140
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,920
Besides,

141
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,640
you always come to our place.

142
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,480
So...

143
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,920
Your boss has an employee like you.

144
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
How lucky he is.

145
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,360
Ms. Qu,

146
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080
enjoy your dinner then.

147
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Ms. Qu,

148
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
do you need any help?

149
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,440
Lights on, the night is deep.

150
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Breeze blows through windows and doors

151
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,520
Ask from the bottom of the heart

152
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,160
Is the love true

153
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,840
The look in your eyes

154
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,400
Is engraved on my heart

155
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,040
Crystal clear like the moon.

156
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,600
Happy New Year.

157
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,240
Yearnings deepen.

158
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,440
So grateful in this life

159
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,280
You're here with me

160
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,800
Wind brings back the memory

161
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,280
In dream shall we meet

162
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,560
Hope in this life

163
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,480
We'll love and cherish each other

164
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,680
Till death do us part

165
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,680
Don't idle away your youth

166
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,360
Dreams never stop

167
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,520
So grateful in this life

168
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,320
You're here with me

169
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,800
Wind brings back the memory

170
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,040
In dream shall we meet

171
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,840
Hope in this life

172
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,320
We'll love and cherish each other

173
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,520
Till death do us part

174
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,680
Don't idle away your youth

175
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,120
Dreams never stop

176
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,760
So grateful in this life

177
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,800
You're here with me

178
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,880
Wind brings back the memory

179
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,400
In dream shall we meet

180
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,760
Hope in this life

181
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,640
We'll love and cherish each other

182
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,000
Till death do us part

183
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,000
Don't idle away your youth

184
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,480
Dreams never stop

185
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,440
Come. Be careful.

186
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,160
Thank you.

187
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,160
OK.

188
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,040
Be slowly.

189
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,160
Here. Give it to me.

190
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,920
Let's go this way.

191
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,680
Thank you very much.

192
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,800
Cigarettes!

193
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,360
Fruits!

194
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
Fruits!

195
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,520
Fruits!

196
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,160
Song!

197
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,320
Song!

198
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,640
Liangchen.

199
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,200
You come back?

200
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,240
I have been back long ago.

201
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
I had something to deal with nearby.

202
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,280
And I heard that a train

203
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,400
was coming from your hometown.

204
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
I guess you may come back.

205
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,680
So I come and wait.

206
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,000
It surprises me that you really come.

207
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,760
It's such a coincidence.

208
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,240
Did your sister come back, too?

209
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
Her school resumed classes long ago.

210
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,160
She has classes today.

211
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,800
Liangchen.

212
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,160
Let's go to see her

213
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,880
at her school.

214
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,240
I have some seafood.

215
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I want to give some to her and Xiaojun.

216
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,960
No, thanks.

217
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,240
We'll have it all.

218
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,880
It's OK.

219
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,920
We've got so much.

220
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,760
You don't have to.

221
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,560
My sister...she doesn't like seafood.

222
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,800
Don't mention it. Let's go.

223
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,040
Let's go. Liangchen.

224
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,240
Go.

225
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,960
How come you don't know her?

226
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,400
Miss,

227
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,920
let me in.

228
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,040
She's a student here.

229
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,800
You don't believe me?

230
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,760
Ask her brother.

231
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,680
Liangchen?

232
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,240
Liangchen?

233
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,240
Liangchen?

234
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,280
Xie Xiang.

235
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,640
This is Women's School.

236
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,840
I can't let you in.

237
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,040
Miss,

238
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,240
you must miss something.

239
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
She is here.

240
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,000
Why don't you let me in and find her?

241
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,480
Who is this?

242
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,280
Xie Xiang?

243
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,400
Do we have this student?

244
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:47,880
You can't get in.

245
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,340
I'm afraid not.

246
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,840
Miss,

247
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,000
just let me in.

248
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,160
We don't have the person you look for.

249
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,680
Xie Xiang!

250
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
- Didn't I tell you? - Xie Xiang.

251
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,640
You really can't get in. Go away.

252
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,040
Xie Xiang.

253
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
- Xiang. Xie Xiang. - We don't have the person you look for.

254
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,160
Xie Xiang.

255
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,920
We're having classes now.

256
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,760
- Please get out. - Xie Xiang.

257
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,160
Xie Xiang.

258
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,080
We're having classes now.

259
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,200
- What are you yelling about? - Xie Xiang.

260
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,920
Xie Xiang.

261
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,040
Xie Xiang.

262
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,720
We don't have this person here.

263
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,440
Please get out.

264
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,200
Or I'll call the police.

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Huang Song.

266
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,800
Xie Xiang.

267
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,680
- Xie Xiang. - We don't have her here.

268
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,560
Huang Song.

269
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,160
Xie Xiang.

270
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,240
- Xie... - Go now.

271
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,720
Don't come back.

272
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,280
Xie Xiang.

273
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Xie Xiang.

274
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,480
What're you yelling about?

275
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,720
Xiaojun,

276
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,440
I bring some food for you and Liangchen's sister.

277
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,960
The teacher won't let us in.

278
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,800
That's for sure.

279
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,600
This is a Women's School.

280
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,680
They can't let you in.

281
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,160
What do you bring?

282
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,440
Fish, shrimps,

283
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,240
and scallops.

284
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,480
I caught them personally.

285
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,560
And it's pickled.

286
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,280
You may give them to me.

287
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
I'll give them to Xie Xiang.

288
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,840
No way.

289
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,360
I bring them to you and Xie Xiang.

290
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,360
I have to give them to her

291
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,160
in person.

292
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
Xie Xiang, well,

293
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,280
she hasn't come back to Beijing, yet.

294
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
I came back with Liangchen.

295
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,560
He said his sister was back long ago.

296
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,800
Didn't you come back for classes?

297
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,920
Where is Liangchen?

298
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,200
He was here just now.

299
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,440
Now he is gone.

300
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,840
Xiaojun,

301
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,320
is there something wrong with Xie Xiang?

302
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,280
No.

303
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,480
What can be wrong?

304
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,440
It's a chaos on street.

305
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,360
Have she gone missing?

306
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,840
Nonsense.

307
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,880
Don't think too much.

308
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,080
Go back to school.

309
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,280
I'll forward them to her.

310
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,000
OK?

311
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,680
No.

312
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,000
You are good friends.

313
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,560
You don't know whether she's back.

314
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,920
That means she doesn't.

315
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,320
And the teacher said there was no such a person here.

316
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,920
No.

317
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,960
Something must be wrong.

318
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,680
I have to ask him.

319
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Don't. Don't bring him here.

320
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,760
Can she let you in?

321
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,720
You wait here.

322
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
I'll ask for you.

323
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
OK, I'll wait.

324
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,360
Don't yell again.

325
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Wait here.

326
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,840
Hurry up.

327
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,200
Hurry.

328
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,920
Xie Liangchen is so unreliable.

329
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,080
He's gone without saying a word.

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,960
Where did you go?

331
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,520
I went to get my bag.

332
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,240
Take that idiot away with you.

333
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,800
If you don't, you'll be exposed.

334
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,760
I can't.

335
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
His suspicion will grow once I take him back.

336
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,600
What should we do?

337
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,400
Give me your clothes.

338
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,880
Are you planning to...

339
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,360
Change in your clothes

340
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,440
and pretend to be Xie Xiang.

341
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,160
How silly!

342
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,920
Even if you change in my clothes,

343
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,080
your hair will give you out.

344
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,680
I went back and got this.

345
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
You're all prepared?

346
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Anytime and anywhere

347
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,440
in case of emergency.

348
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,360
You think it's funny to dress like a man?

349
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,320
Give me a hand.

350
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,280
Here.

351
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,680
Are you looking for me?

352
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm your brother's friend.

353
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,680
My surname is Huang.

354
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,200
I'm Huang Song.

355
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
I heard about you from my brother.

356
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,720
Nice to meet you.

357
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,720
Nice to meet you, too.

358
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,960
What is it that you want to see me?

359
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,280
I...

360
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,360
I...brought some seafood from my hometown for you.

361
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,320
It's awkward.

362
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,200
I can't take it.

363
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Why is that?

364
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,840
Your brother and I are like brothers.

365
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,400
You're his sister. So you're my sister, too.

366
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
Take it. It's OK.

367
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,920
Take it.

368
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,200
Alright.

369
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,200
Thank you.

370
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,720
It must be heavy.

371
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Let me take it for you.

372
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,400
It's OK.

373
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
It's a Women's School.

374
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,520
You're not allowed to go in.

375
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,200
Right!

376
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
If that's all,

377
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,040
go back then.

378
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,160
It's getting late.

379
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,200
OK.

380
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,680
I'll go then.

381
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,080
You have to eat it.

382
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,080
Or it's going to rot.

383
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,880
OK.

384
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,080
Remember to eat.

385
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,840
See you.

386
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,040
Bye now.

387
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,200
You have to eat it.

388
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,040
See you.

389
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,160
Damn!

390
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,120
The idiot has a crush on you.

391
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,640
What are you talking about?

392
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,720
Take it home for your parents.

393
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,200
You won't take some?

394
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
Song will save some for me.

395
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,560
For Xie Liangchen.

396
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,200
So it works in man's clothes.

397
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,680
You get two in everything.

398
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,720
Cut the craps.

399
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,880
Change back. Give me the clothes.

400
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,960
Song.

401
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,920
Give it to me.

402
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,680
Xie Liangchen.

403
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,880
Where did you go?

404
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,840
To the bathroom.

405
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,720
Did you meet your sister?

406
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,680
Yeah.

407
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
She gave you her gratitude.

408
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,040
Don't mention it.

409
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,720
Don't give me the weird grin.

410
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,720
Liangchen.

411
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,720
Your sister is so beautiful.

412
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Don't you think we look

413
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,080
exactly the same?

414
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,200
Of course not.

415
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,920
How so?

416
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,440
I know you don't.

417
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,400
Her eyes are bigger.

418
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,720
And her skin is smoother.

419
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,440
Her lips are redder.

420
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,080
They're curling when she smiles.

421
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,600
Anyway,

422
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,720
she is more good-looking than you.

423
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,520
Are you sure about it?

424
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,100
I saw her with my eyes.

425
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,600
Then you're blind.

426
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,080
Where is your seafood?

427
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,920
I gave it to your sister.

428
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,160
All?

429
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,680
Yeah, all of them.

430
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,600
What am I going to eat?

431
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,560
It's not for you anyway.

432
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,600
Don't fight with your sister with it.

433
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,160
OK.

434
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,960
Let's go back.

435
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,200
Let's go.

436
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,400
Yanlin,

437
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,840
Ji Jin and Junshan haven't come back yet?

438
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,600
They live close to each other.

439
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,960
I guess they'll be back tomorrow.

440
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,680
How about Gu Yanzhen?

441
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,200
Was he staying at Shunyuan for Spring Festival?

442
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,720
Gu Yanzhen?

443
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
He's probably not coming back in anytime soon.

444
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,000
What's wrong?

445
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,440
Didn't you hear it?

446
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,160
His father was a member of

447
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,480
the negotiation delegation.

448
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,200
The government is likely to accept the terms cowardly.

449
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,400
Really?

450
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,920
Who knows?

451
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,520
Nowadays, everyone is demonstrating on the street.

452
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,880
The government is such a disappointment.

453
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,560
Right, Liangchen,

454
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,080
aren't you from Peking?

455
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,480
Did you go on demonstration?

456
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,360
It's a chaos on the street.

457
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,680
My parents didn't let me out.

458
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,560
Lucky for you.

459
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,200
I heard the authority

460
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,880
sent military and police to suppress the demonstrating people.

461
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,120
Many people were arrested.

462
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,200
If the treaty is signed,

463
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,560
that would be horrible.

464
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
If it is,

465
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,960
the country will break down.

466
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,440
The Peking government is a coward.

467
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,880
They're so unreliable.

468
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Now,

469
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,720
we can only pin our hope on British and America,

470
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,720
hoping that they won't turn a deaf ear to

471
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,720
the Japanese troops.

472
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
How ridiculous!

473
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,000
A skunk bursts in,

474
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,640
and we need to count on another two skunks

475
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,000
to bring justice to us.

476
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,880
What the heck is this?

477
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,520
What can we do about it?

478
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,720
Our country is weak.

479
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
And everyone is stepping a foot on us.

480
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,040
Let's hope they don't sign it.

481
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,160
If they do,

482
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,200
there will be voices against

483
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,840
Gu Yanzhen and his family.

484
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,000
You still have one last chance.

485
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,560
We can leave now.

486
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,600
Miss,

487
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,720
please don't let me go.

488
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,520
I'm all alone.

489
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,320
I want to stay by your side.

490
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Miss.

491
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,360
Lord Chengrui seems to have boarded the train.

492
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Is he following me?

493
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,000
We don't know yet.

494
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,840
Tell me when you see him.

495
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,960
Yes.

496
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,200
Miss.

497
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,400
I found him.

498
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,680
Xianrong.

499
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,200
Chengrui.

500
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,600
It's been a long time.

501
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,920
Yeah.

502
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,200
Fourteen years.

503
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,240
Did you miss me?

504
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,560
You've been back for a while.

505
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,080
Why didn't you come over?

506
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,080
I'm occupied.

507
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,160
So busy.

508
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,200
I don't have your rank.

509
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
So I have to do things by myself.

510
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,440
I'm not like you.

511
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,160
You are one of the royalties.

512
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,960
Your life is so easy.

513
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,400
Ready tongue!

514
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,600
Looks like there's no need to worry about

515
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,760
you being bullied out there.

516
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,920
Maybe you should.

517
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
Besides,

518
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,080
I hope you'd be sorry for that.

519
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,880
In such case,

520
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,240
I can ask you for any favor

521
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
since you owe me.

522
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,800
It's a different time now.

523
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm afraid I can't help you

524
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,600
any longer.

525
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,320
You don't know what the favor is yet.

526
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,960
Don't turn me down now.

527
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,720
If it's about you,

528
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,880
I'll certainly try my best.

529
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,560
However, if it's about the Japanese Daiwa Association and Mr. Oda,

530
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,640
I'm afraid I can't help.

531
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Chengrui, don't say that.

532
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,800
You break my heart.

533
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,160
Yeah.

534
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,080
It's our first meeting after 14 years.

535
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,320
I don't want this to happen.

536
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
I feel sorry about it, too.

537
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
What are you going to Peking for?

538
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,680
I've got plenty of time.

539
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,880
I want to travel around.

540
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,200
I'm not like you.

541
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,720
You're always on something.

542
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,960
Yes.

543
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
The emperor is abdicated.

544
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,680
Royalties like you

545
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,560
are all civilians now.

546
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,160
It's good.

547
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,360
At least it's safe.

548
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,720
The fate of a nation

549
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,560
depends on its people,

550
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
including people like me.

551
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,760
The emperor is well in the Forbidden City.

552
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,880
The throne has been passed down for over 200 years.

553
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,400
There are ups and downs.

554
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,920
The current hardship is nothing.

555
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,240
Given what you said,

556
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,360
you're still hoping to resume the throne.

557
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,560
We humans

558
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,480
need some goals to fight for.

559
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,280
You're right.

560
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,160
In all of a sudden,

561
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,280
I found we have something in common.

562
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,680
Maybe later,

563
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,240
we have opportunities to cooperate.

564
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,560
It might be hard.

565
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
But I won't

566
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
work with invaders.

567
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
I'm sorry to hear

568
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,960
you said that.

569
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,400
Xianrong,

570
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,680
don't make me an enemy to you.

571
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,680
Not every one's eligible to

572
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,680
be my enemy.

573
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,320
By the way,

574
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,400
please give my best to My Lady.

575
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,880
It's going to be her birthday.

576
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,280
I'll go celebrate it

577
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,480
personally.

578
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
My mother believes in Buddhism.

579
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,000
She doesn't like extravagance.

580
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
We haven't thrown birthday parties for years.

581
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
But thank you.

582
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,120
She believes in Buddhism?

583
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,320
Don't joke with me.

584
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,150
Anyway, she adopted me.

585
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,960
We'll meet sooner or later.

586
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,230
You can't hide

587
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,000
from me forever.

588
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,150
Xianrong...

589
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,630
Don't feel sad, Chengrui.

590
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
We'll

591
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,200
have plenty of chances to meet.

592
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,520
Lord Duan's birthday party is in 5 days.

593
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,240
Chengrui was going to the party.

594
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,840
Now he came back to Shunyuan all of a sudden.

595
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,160
Miss.

596
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,920
I'm afraid he's coming back for us.

597
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,840
He and his father had garrisoned at Feng'an for over 30 years.

598
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,280
Though the Qing Dynasty is toppled,

599
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,040
they still have many people

600
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,800
loyal to them in Feng'an.

601
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,800
They are all related to

602
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,440
Lord Chengrui and Rong Mansion.

603
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,240
Even Commander Zhang

604
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,680
has to show some respect to them.

605
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,160
If they get involved,

606
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,280
it would be a big problem.

607
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,640
Now they've known about the transaction.

608
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,880
It seems that we have to sell it.

609
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,600
Maybe we can send Mr. James

610
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,040
to Uiju County

611
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,160
and make the transaction there.

612
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,280
Payment

613
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,000
on delivery.

614
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,880
Even something goes wrong,

615
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,080
it's none of our business.

616
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,920
Idiot!

617
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,640
If we make transaction in Uiju County,

618
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
there wouldn't have anything to do with us.

619
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,400
We have the buyers.

620
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,600
So the transaction

621
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,320
has to be made on our turf.

622
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,480
Yes.

623
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,080
Deliver the words.

624
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,320
Watch over Rong Mansion,

625
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,360
and report each of their moves to me.

626
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,200
Yes.

627
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
Send a telegram to Uiju County.

628
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Ask Takeda

629
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,200
whether he needs our help in delivering the goods.

630
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,080
Mr. Takeda won't ask for our help.

631
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,600
He can turn us down.

632
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
But if something goes wrong,

633
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,520
he has to bear the responsibility himself.

634
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,040
So you mean...

635
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,920
Get some new faces follow

636
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,320
Takeda's men.

637
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,080
If Rong Mansion has their hands in it,

638
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,920
stay out of it for the moment.

639
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,200
When they get the goods,

640
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,760
we'll hijack it.

641
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes.

642
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,480
Gu Yanzhen.

643
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,800
Gu Yanzhen.

644
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,840
Gu Yanzhen.

645
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,240
Gu Yanzhen.

646
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,200
Gu Yanzhen.

647
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,600
Who is it?

648
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,960
Gu... Stop calling. Coming.

649
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Where's Gu Yanzhen?

650
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,760
Ms. Qu,

651
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,440
what brings you here?

652
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,480
I'm coming for Gu Yanzhen.

653
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,280
Get him out for me.

654
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,120
I'm so sorry.

655
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,040
Mr. Gu is not at home.

656
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,400
Not at home?

657
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,240
Where did he go?

658
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,360
Don't tell me he's at school.

659
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,280
I went to his school.

660
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,920
He's not there.

661
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,560
Mr. Gu went to Peking days ago.

662
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,840
Please pick another day.

663
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,560
But...when did he go?

664
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,920
Who was with him?

665
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,600
When will he come back?

666
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,440
Get back here.

667
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,480
I haven't finished yet.

668
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,400
What's wrong?

669
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,360
Nothing.

670
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,080
You're gloomy.

671
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,760
Mr. Gu didn't come to classes recently.

672
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,320
How do you know it?

673
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,560
Your school has resumed class for a month and I haven't seen him.

674
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,000
Are you gloomy because of him?

675
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,280
So I'm right about it.

676
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,120
Where's Gu Yanzhen?

677
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,640
How could I know?

678
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,520
How come you don't?

679
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,200
In Spring Festival,

680
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,480
he went to find you at Peking, right?

681
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,880
I don't know. Don't ask me anymore.

682
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,880
Stop lying to me.

683
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,640
Tell me now. Where is he?

684
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,480
If you want to find him, find him yourself.

685
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,640
Don't bother asking me.

686
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,640
Don't give me that attitude.

687
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,280
I'll tell others about you guys.

688
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,640
You... you've...

689
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,560
known it?

690
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,280
You know it, too?

691
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,000
No.

692
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,360
Keep your mouth shut.

693
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,440
he had nothing to do.

694
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,800
You knew it and you helped him?

695
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,880
He asks you to cover for him, right?

696
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,120
No.

697
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,600
You like him? For real?

698
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,560
No.

699
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,560
So it's true.

700
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh, my god.

701
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Don't be silly, Xiang.

702
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,040
I'm telling you men like him are disgusting.

703
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,520
They use your affection for the sake of themselves.

704
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,800
They're cheaters in love.

705
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Abandon the feelings for him.

706
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,280
What are you laughing at?

707
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,280
What are you laughing at?

708
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,920
Seriously, I mean it.

709
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,920
You would be used without knowing it.

710
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,840
Do you hear me?

711
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,680
Yeah. Yeah. Cheaters in love. I'll forget him.

712
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,320
Stupid!

713
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,600
Where's Aunt Yu?

714
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,760
I didn't see her.

715
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,280
Maybe she's out.

716
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,000
I never see her at night.

717
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,200
I'll leave you now.

718
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,600
To the hotel?

719
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,720
I'm going to find Gu Yanzhen.

720
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,080
I'm telling you.

721
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,800
Cut off your feelings for him. Do you hear me?

722
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,520
Silly girl.

723
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,600
Be careful.

724
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,240
I have to bother you again, Ms. Huo.

725
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,800
A business is a business.

726
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,880
Don't mention it.

727
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,920
This is the advance payment.

728
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,680
When it's done,

729
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,560
you can get the back end.

730
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,760
My lord, you're so generous on the advance payment.

731
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
But I'm afraid I can't

732
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,480
do the job you asked.

733
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,880
If you can't do the job,

734
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
no one can in Shunyuan.

735
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,040
You flattered me.

736
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,120
Tell me about it.

737
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,400
Five days ago,

738
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,800
I heard that

739
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,280
there would be goods

740
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,280
delivered from Uiju County.

741
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,520
Ms. Huo, I hope

742
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,480
you can get the goods for me.

743
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,280
What is it?

744
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Who is delivering it?

745
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Who is the consignor?

746
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,400
Porcelains.

747
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,480
Jades.

748
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,560
Corals.

749
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,240
Agates.

750
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,960
Calligraphy and paintings.

751
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,680
They are treasures we lost in the old Summer Palace.

752
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,960
The consignor

753
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,680
is the chairman of Japan Daiwa Association,

754
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,960
Takeda Syun.

755
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,600
When the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Peking,

756
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
he was a captain.

757
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,640
The receiver is the chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce,

758
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Oda Xianrong.
