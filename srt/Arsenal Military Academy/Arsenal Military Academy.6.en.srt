Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 06

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,280
Let's go.

5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,660
I'll carry you.

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,800
Come on.

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,960
Quickly.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,000
Come.

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,520
Lights on the night is deep

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,880
Breeze blows through windows and doors

11
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,480
Ask from the bottom of the heart

12
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,280
Is the love true

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,079
So grateful in this life

14
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,800
You're here with me

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,400
Wind brings back the memory

16
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Gu Yanzhen

17
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,720
did I owe you in my previous life?

18
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,760
In dream shall we meet

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,079
I'm carrying such

20
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,480
a strong man like you

21
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,520
in high heels and a skirt.

22
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,240
Why have I

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,880
been so unlucky recently?

24
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
I have to

25
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,880
carry you such a good-for-nothing

26
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,400
while being chased.

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,360
I thought you were here to rescue me.

28
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,680
But now I'm carrying you

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
in the middle of nowhere.

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,080
Gu Yanzhen

31
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,560
you know what?

32
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,040
You'll

33
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,360
be in debt to me forever.

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,320
Xie Liangchen!

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,420
Xie Liangchen.

36
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,760
Liangchen.

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,800
Xie Liangchen.

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
Manting.

39
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,079
Manting.

40
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,380
Liangchen.

41
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,880
Xie Liangchen.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Who did this?

43
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,640
Hush.

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,680
Let's go.

45
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,400
Zhu Yanlin come here.

46
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,080
Go.

47
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Let's go.

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,260
Be careful.

49
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,120
Wait here for me.

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
I'll go check.

51
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,960
Be careful.

52
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,040
It must be those students.

53
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,300
They haven't gone far.

54
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Are you all right?

55
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,170
I'm fine.

56
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,480
It's not safe here.

57
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
We must leave now.

58
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,960
Come on.

59
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,080
He is as heavy as a pig!

60
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,800
So heavy!

61
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm exhausted.

62
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
Freeze! Don't move!

63
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,549
Don't move.

64
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,440
Don't move.

65
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,920
Who is it?

66
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,220
Don't move.

67
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
Mr. Sato

68
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
glad to meet you.

69
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
Please forgive me

70
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,130
for my abrupt visit.

71
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,640
Shen Tingbai?

72
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,160
Yes I am.

73
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,320
What are you here for?

74
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,000
I came to talk with you

75
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
about something.

76
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,520
By breaking into my place?

77
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,280
China is a country of etiquette.

78
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,960
We always try fair means before resorting to force.

79
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
But I assume

80
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
that principle

81
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
doesn't apply to you.

82
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
This is Shen Tingbai.

83
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,040
Hello?

84
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
Mr. Sato help me!

85
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,080
Yumi? Yumi!

86
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,040
Yu...

87
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,400
Let them go now!

88
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,640
Are you ordering me?

89
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,760
I warn you

90
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,320
if you dare lay a finger on them

91
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
I swear

92
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,480
you will pay for that.

93
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,040
That's weird.

94
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,770
Why do you always steal my line?

95
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
You must've

96
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
felt the power of the punishment.

97
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,560
But it's far from enough.

98
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,320
Now you'd better pray that

99
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,650
Qu Manting can come back safe and sound

100
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,120
and pray for her health and happiness.

101
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,320
Otherwise

102
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,200
even if she just sneezes for once

103
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,560
you will pay

104
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,680
a hundredfold for it.

105
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm a man of my word.

106
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,760
I always do what I say.

107
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll kill you!

108
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,640
You can try it.

109
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,080
But if you fail

110
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,290
I will kill your entire family.

111
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,240
Shen Tingbai.

112
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,080
Shen Tingbai!

113
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,900
What are you doing?

114
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,080
Good morning.

115
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,820
How do you feel?

116
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,010
I'm cooking.

117
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,040
You can cook?

118
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,770
I can do many things.

119
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,740
You'll be surprised if I tell you.

120
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Liar.

121
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,500
Why were you in the forest?

122
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,820
I had a mission.

123
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,740
What about you?

124
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,160
I was hunted.

125
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,520
I managed to escape.

126
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,770
You were hunted?

127
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,720
By whom?

128
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,530
Maybe the Japanese.

129
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,440
Why did they go after you?

130
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,160
They disliked your singing?

131
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,240
I'll kill you!

132
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,580
Then why did they hunt you?

133
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
I think I know why.

134
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,960
Where are we?

135
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
My aunt's house.

136
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
It has been cleaned the other day

137
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,700
and I was planning to stay here for a few days.

138
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,140
I didn't expect someone would come after me.

139
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,060
What? Are you done?

140
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,690
I'm full.

141
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,040
There's still half of it.

142
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
This is your aunt?

143
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,360
She and my mom are twins

144
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,020
but they don't look alike.

145
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,330
Where is she?

146
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,020
She doesn't live here?

147
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,290
She died of illness a few years ago.

148
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,860
I didn't get to see her.

149
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,900
What's the date today?

150
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,530
The seventh.

151
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,890
The seventh?

152
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,530
Today is my mom's birthday.

153
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,000
Then happy birthday to your mom.

154
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,050
I'm screwed.

155
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,160
I've been so busy these days

156
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,690
that I forgot her birthday.

157
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,060
She'll talk my ear off when I go back home.

158
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,640
Now they must be having a feast

159
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,040
and a cake at home

160
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,240
while I'm hiding here

161
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,260
eating tasteless noodles

162
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,360
and my life is still on the line.

163
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
And the worst thing is

164
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm trapped here with you.

165
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,280
What have I done wrong?

166
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,220
We're in the middle of nowhere

167
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,880
and there are only you and me.

168
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,410
If I want to do something bad

169
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
you'll have nowhere to hide.

170
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't bluff!

171
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,040
You pervert!

172
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,760
Since you know that

173
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,930
you'd better stay away from me.

174
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,400
Leave now!

175
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,440
How is Sachiko?

176
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,440
Not good.

177
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
Her asthma is

178
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,880
already severe.

179
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,480
And this time she had a relapse

180
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,570
and she wasn't treated in time.

181
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,600
Mr. Sato

182
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,040
the medical treatment here is lacking.

183
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,240
If you really care about her

184
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,730
I think you'd better

185
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,130
take her back to Japan as soon as possible.

186
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,960
Thank you.

187
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,280
Excuse me.

188
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,280
Liangchen why are you here?

189
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,080
I was going to bring it to you.

190
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,410
Give it to me. I can do it.

191
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,760
- Fine, be careful. - I need to exercise.

192
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm fine.

193
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm almost recovered.

194
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,130
It takes a hundred days for your wound to recover.

195
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,960
That's exaggerated.

196
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
I'm fine.

197
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,160
Here.

198
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,720
Shen Junshan.

199
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Thank you.

200
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,720
I wouldn't know what to do

201
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,850
if you weren't here.

202
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,920
It's nothing.

203
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,880
Don't mention it.

204
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,080
Just have a good rest.

205
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Go have meals now.

206
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,720
Take care!

207
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,480
Liangchen

208
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,160
the results of the field training have come out.

209
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,080
So soon!

210
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,800
Where?

211
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,160
They are posted outside.

212
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,520
Shen Junshan's points were deducted for not completing

213
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,280
the task on time

214
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,480
ranking second only.

215
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,600
Why?

216
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,520
It's not fair!

217
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,760
We almost died there!

218
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
You can tell Sergeant Lv about this.

219
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,480
What about me?

220
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,560
The last one?

221
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,840
No.

222
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,480
You are the second to last.

223
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,580
Gu Yanzhen is the last one.

224
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,200
He left the training field without permission

225
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,440
and disobeyed orders.

226
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,370
He was even captured by a civilian.

227
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,040
So Sergeant gave him a zero.

228
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,680
Then who is the first?

229
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,080
Ji Jin?

230
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,520
I'm the first.

231
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,320
Really?

232
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
I said I was a master in the wild.

233
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,100
Do you trust me now?

234
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,920
Great.

235
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,810
You were telling the truth.

236
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,320
Have your meal.

237
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,850
Hurry up.

238
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,240
Marriage should be decided by the parents.

239
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,640
How can we let her decide?

240
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,760
Manting is still young.

241
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,320
She doesn't understand.

242
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,960
We can talk to her.

243
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
You don't need to be so angry.

244
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,880
Young?

245
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
She's spoiled by you.

246
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm even embarrassed to say

247
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,120
she is my daughter.

248
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,000
Dad

249
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
keep your voice down.

250
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,840
Why?

251
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,020
I'm not afraid of her hearing.

252
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,700
Although the Shens is not well-known

253
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,820
it is still a well-off family.

254
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,560
Your mother and I have known Shen Tingbai

255
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,920
since his childhood.

256
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,800
He is a good man.

257
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,520
And the most important thing is

258
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,160
he loves your sister deeply.

259
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,900
She won't regret marrying such a man.

260
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,880
No one else

261
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
can ask for such a perfect marriage.

262
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,520
Yet she is still not satisfied.

263
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,050
What on earth does she want?

264
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,700
Does she forget who she is?

265
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
Manting

266
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,080
have some food.

267
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,520
The chicken mushroom soup is still hot.

268
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,450
It's delicious.

269
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Manting

270
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,320
don't be mad at dad.

271
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,980
He is doing this for your good.

272
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,680
Tingbai is such a handsome man

273
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,920
with a distinguished family.

274
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,800
Tons of girls in Shunyuan

275
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,240
are eager to marry him.

276
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,920
He's been treating you so well since childhood.

277
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,600
He offended the entire Japanese

278
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,720
Chamber of Commerce for you.

279
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
I heard that he even killed someone.

280
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,760
We're living in chaos.

281
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,360
It's rare to have someone

282
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
who loves you and can protect you.

283
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,940
Are you trying to convince me?

284
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,320
No I'm not.

285
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,120
I'm just telling the truth.

286
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Truth?

287
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,160
When Uncle Shen's father died of illness

288
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,360
his sons wanted to divide the property.

289
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,220
Their business was in trouble

290
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,680
so Uncle Shen came to us for help.

291
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,540
What did dad do?

292
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,560
He thought highly of himself

293
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,120
and he looked down on the Shens.

294
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,240
So he threw all the gifts

295
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,600
Uncle Shen brought out of the gate.

296
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,530
Everyone in the city knew about it.

297
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,820
You were young then

298
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,090
but you must remember that.

299
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,640
Yes

300
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
I have a good relationship with Shen Tingbai these years.

301
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,480
But ever since that incident

302
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
have you ever seen

303
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,560
Uncle Shen and Mrs. Shen

304
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,320
meet with me

305
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,800
and say a word to me?

306
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,880
Manting but...

307
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,920
You don't need to tell me

308
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,240
about how things are different that parents

309
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,840
can't interfere with our marriage

310
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,680
and also don't need

311
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,120
to tell me Shen Tingbai offended the Japanese

312
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,320
and Kazuo Sato for me.

313
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,160
Hadn't it been for him

314
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,490
the Japanese wouldn't have known who I am.

315
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,740
Rather than protecting me

316
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,850
he was protecting his dignity.

317
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,200
If he hadn't had any courage

318
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,120
he would have been dead long ago.

319
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,170
And there would be no Shunyuan COC.

320
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,320
There are at least dozens of people

321
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,000
who have been killed by him all these years.

322
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,060
Even people in Shanghai have heard his name.

323
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,240
Dad said he is a good man.

324
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,760
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

325
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,400
But

326
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
he is nice to you.

327
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,880
Many people are nice to me.

328
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,280
Should I marry them all?

329
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,440
Then who do you want now?

330
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
I don't know it either.

331
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,920
Maybe

332
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
I haven't met the one

333
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,440
I really like yet.

334
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,960
But at least I know what I want

335
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,280
and what I don't want.

336
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,160
I know what I like

337
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,360
and what I don't like.

338
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
I don't need what I don't want

339
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,740
and I can't like what I don't like.

340
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Why do they have to force me to marry?

341
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,000
No one can force me to do it

342
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,530
not even myself.

343
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,280
Manting.

344
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,760
It's late. Where are you going?

345
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,160
I'm going to see a friend.

346
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,820
Stop there.

347
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,000
Manting

348
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
it's too dangerous outside.

349
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,300
You should listen to your father.

350
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,240
If you really want to go out

351
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,440
you can ask Tingbai

352
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
to accompany you.

353
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,040
Didn't you hear my words?

354
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
Have you ever thought about your family

355
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,760
and your father?

356
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,480
Have you ever cared

357
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,280
about your daughter as a father?

358
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,960
I'm doing all this for you!

359
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,840
For me?

360
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Or for the dignity of our family?

361
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,960
How can you talk to your father like this?

362
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,280
You!

363
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,240
Manting!

364
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,980
Apologize to your father now.

365
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,800
Do you still remember who you are?

366
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,400
You could've been a lady

367
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,970
yet you chose to be a showgirl in Shanghai.

368
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,440
Do you have any self-respect?

369
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,920
You're ruining your reputation.

370
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,360
Who would want to marry you?

371
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,080
Showgirl?

372
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
What's wrong with it?

373
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
I love being a showgirl.

374
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,760
I didn't do anything illegal.

375
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,290
I make money by my own skill.

376
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,120
Isn't this better than those ladies

377
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,360
relying on their husbands to make a living?

378
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,720
- You spoiled brat! - Manting!

379
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,380
Ignore her.

380
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Let her go!

381
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,480
Calm down.

382
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,840
Don't be mad.

383
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,500
Take care of yourself.

384
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,520
Manting!

385
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,970
Where are you going?

386
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,080
Enough.

387
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,640
Are you going to drink yourself to death?

388
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,320
Listen

389
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,660
don't think I'll bury you if you're dead.

390
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,480
Even if I were dead

391
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,370
tons of men would still want me.

392
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,600
Don't worry.

393
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,940
You're really narcissistic.

394
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,960
Xiaojun

395
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,740
sometimes I really think that

396
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,600
only Manzhu is their daughter

397
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm not.

398
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,300
What happened?

399
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,040
I think you are so insatiable.

400
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,380
Shen Tingbai is such a good man

401
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,600
rich and powerful talented and handsome.

402
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,200
He's also obsessed with you.

403
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,280
If there is a man like him who loves me

404
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,680
I will marry him tonight

405
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,880
without hesitation.

406
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,480
Then Shen Tingbai is yours.

407
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,920
What?

408
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,760
I have principles OK?

409
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,720
I can't steal your man.

410
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,260
And you are my best friend.

411
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,720
He's not my man.

412
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,160
Fine I admit

413
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,200
that all men with good looks and shapes

414
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,880
have places in my heart.

415
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,640
Then how big is your heart?

416
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,400
To be a woman

417
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,880
your heart must be as vast as the sea.

418
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,580
You're greedy.

419
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,040
Seriously

420
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,280
why don't you like Shen Tingbai?

421
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,160
You know

422
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,320
I used to have a crush on him.

423
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
But

424
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,650
he started to fawn on my father.

425
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,050
So I thought that

426
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
he was just like the others

427
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,840
who wanted to be with me

428
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,600
simply for fun

429
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,090
and they'd move on when they got tired.

430
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,340
Do you understand?

431
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,740
You're too sensitive.

432
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,240
I'm not being sensitive.

433
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm insightful.

434
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,760
Will you marry a man

435
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,160
who may not love you?

436
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,960
Sure I will.

437
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,800
I can give him everything I have

438
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,960
if there is a man like

439
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,420
Shen Tingbai who loves me.

440
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,880
You just stay here.

441
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,580
I have something to do.

442
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,440
Stop drinking

443
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,810
you need some water.

444
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Don't look around

445
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
all the handsome guys here are mine.

446
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
Alright.

447
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,760
Just go.

448
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm leaving.

449
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,280
Go!

450
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
No more drinking!

451
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,440
Liu

452
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,760
come here.

453
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,800
What's up?

454
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,560
Keep an eye on Qu Manting for me.

455
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,480
Don't let her drink anymore.

456
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,600
I'll go out for a while.

457
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,680
OK I got it.

458
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,880
Give me two dice cups.

459
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,930
Enjoy yourself.

460
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,960
Mr. Gu

461
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,560
welcome!

462
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,690
A bottle of whiskey.

463
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes.

464
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,400
Here.

465
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,800
It's you again.

466
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,480
Can you give me some?

467
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,680
Why?

468
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,520
I'm so sad.

469
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,820
Suit yourself.

470
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,520
You're already drunk and you want more?

471
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,360
I want to drown my sorrows.

472
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,200
There's not enough liquor

473
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,600
to drink my sorrows away.

474
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,040
They're still there.

475
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,020
More liquor brings more sorrows.

476
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,440
That's fine.

477
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
Drink with me.

478
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,040
Who are you?

479
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
You don't need to know.

480
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,040
Just drink with me.

481
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,640
Are you insane?

482
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,920
What's wrong?

483
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,200
Just drink with me.

484
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,860
Who are you?

485
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,610
Let's drink.

486
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,940
- Go away! - Come on.

487
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
Let go of me!

488
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,680
- Drink a little. - Let me go!

489
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,540
Just one glass.

490
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,760
Are you crazy?

491
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,360
Hands off!

492
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Do you want to die?

493
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,640
Do you know who she is?

494
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,640
She is my girl.

495
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,360
You're making me do this.

496
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,040
Sir sir.

497
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,680
Sir stop.

498
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Forget it.

499
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,480
It's OK it's OK.

500
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,240
Calm down calm down.

501
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,640
Let me buy you a drink.

502
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,160
- Don't stop me. - You are drunk.

503
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,040
- It's fine. - Come here if you dare!

504
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,720
Just go home.

505
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,040
- Let's drink. - Come out!

506
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,640
Come here!

507
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Come and sit.

508
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,720
Thank you.

509
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,760
No need.

510
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Don't mention it.

511
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't get drunk anymore.

512
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
It's so busy here.

513
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,760
Xie Xiang?

514
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,530
- Xie Xiang? - What brings you here?

515
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,640
Liangchen

516
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,900
why did she call you Xie Xiang?

517
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,170
Xie Xiang is my pet name.

518
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,740
My family and my friends all call me this.

519
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,040
Then I'll call you Xie Xiang too.

520
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,560
No,

521
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,000
you'd better call me Xie Liangchen.

522
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,630
Why?

523
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,280
Am I not your friend?

524
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,690
I didn't mean that.

525
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,040
Xie Xiang sounds too feminine.

526
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,900
I don't like it.

527
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,690
It does sound feminine.

528
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,580
But it is a beautiful name.

529
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,840
Really?

530
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,150
This is my friend

531
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,880
Tan Xiaojun.

532
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,800
Hello.

533
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,150
Hello.

534
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,520
Hi. Hello.

535
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,630
My name is Huang Song.

536
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,230
I'm Liangchen's classmate.

537
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,810
Nice to meet you.

538
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,480
Be careful!

539
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,160
You almost blew my cover!

540
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,840
I didn't know.

541
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,520
You suddenly appeared.

542
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,680
I wasn't prepared.

543
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Remember

544
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm Xie Liangchen when I wear a man's suit.

545
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,880
I got it.

546
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,800
You'd better leave now.

547
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,930
Qu Manting is there.

548
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,480
Who?

549
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,040
Qu Manting! The big star!

550
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,840
Last time she saw you in a man's suit

551
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,240
and she also saw you in woman's clothes.

552
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,320
If she sees you

553
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,800
she will recognize you.

554
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,280
Go now!

555
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,300
Liangchen!

556
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,320
Come here!

557
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,940
Gu Yanzhen is here!

558
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,120
Come on!

559
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,160
I'm doomed.

560
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,610
What will you do?

561
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,520
Run!

562
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,640
Won't it raise suspicion?

563
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,200
Then what should I do?

564
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,600
You have to face it anyway.

565
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,500
Stop your nonsense. Let's go.

566
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,820
You all know each other right?

567
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,600
Xiaojun

568
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,520
this is Gu Yanzhen.

569
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
He is also a classmate of Liangchen.

570
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,800
He's a regular.

571
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,860
He's been here every night recently.

572
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,040
Every night?

573
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,360
Gu Yanzhen.

574
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,160
The school gate is closed at night.

575
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,220
How did you get out?

576
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,040
The wall can't stop me.

577
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,320
What did you call him?

578
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,640
Liangchen.

579
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,520
Liangchen?

580
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,240
Xiaojun

581
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,480
last time at the Wintersweet...

582
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,960
That was his sister!

583
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,760
Sister?

584
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,400
Twin sister.

585
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,600
You have a sister?

586
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,240
Yeah.

587
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,260
I have a sister.

588
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,720
Her name is Xie Xiang

589
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,650
studying at Xinhua Girl's School.

590
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,440
Xie Xiang?

591
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,680
Isn't your pet name Xie Xiang?

592
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
His Xiang represents the city of Xiangyang.

593
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,280
His sister's Xiang represents the fragrance of flowers.

594
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,410
They are different.

595
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,560
That's weird.

596
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,120
Brother and sister use the same name.

597
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,140
Won't it be confusing?

598
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,560
They are twins.

599
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,200
They always want the same thing.

600
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
They still have their formal names.

601
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,000
You have a sister?

602
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Called Xie Xiang?

603
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,650
You've never mentioned it.

604
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,060
When will you introduce her to us?

605
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
She is still young

606
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,960
and living on campus.

607
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
She can't get out.

608
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,340
Your twin sister is younger than you?

609
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,980
Shouldn't you and your sister

610
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,400
be at the same age?

611
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,040
Elder brothers always thinks their sisters are

612
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,840
too young to be

613
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,420
introduced to others.

614
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,740
So does my brother.

615
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,530
Xiaojun you have a brother?

616
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,600
A cousin who's

617
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,210
my father's brother's son.

618
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,440
Your cousin is your relative

619
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
not your brother.

620
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,880
Right right.

621
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,000
Wait

622
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,160
cousin and brother are both related by blood.

623
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,240
I'm sober.

624
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,200
Anyway they're both men.

625
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,640
Right.

626
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,420
Are you still going home at this hour?

627
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,920
I'm going to a hotel.

628
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,100
You can go to my house tonight.

629
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,560
Your house?

630
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,760
That's not appropriate.

631
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,560
Well...

632
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
I have booked a hotel.

633
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Don't worry.

634
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,720
You're so drunk.

635
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,120
And this place is remote.

636
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,420
And it's too far if I walk you back.

637
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,880
Can anyone of you walk her back?

638
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,860
I'll walk Liangchen back.

639
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,720
I'm fine.

640
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
You take her back.

641
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,440
I'm fine Xiaojun.

642
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,760
I can walk myself.

643
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,840
I'm not drunk.

644
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I can find the way.

645
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,880
That way.

646
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,920
Let me walk you back.

647
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,850
I'll go with you.

648
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,680
Go with them.

649
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,940
It's dangerous for them to go back alone.

650
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,600
Xiaojun! Wait.

651
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,400
Let him walk her back.

652
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,160
Be careful!

653
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,400
Let's go.

654
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,640
Here.

655
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,820
Huang Song.

656
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,140
You take Xiaojun home.

657
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,920
I'm fine.

658
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,240
I walk home myself every day.

659
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,040
Not tonight.

660
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,800
I should make sure of your safety.

661
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,660
What about you?

662
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,450
I'm fine.

663
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,260
My school is not far from here.

664
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,680
Then fine.

665
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:37,890
Let's go.

666
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,200
Go ahead. Be careful!

667
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,760
Take care of yourself!

668
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,560
You too.

669
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
- Take care. - Bye.

670
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,720
Thank you bro.

671
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,040
It's so late that you still have to walk me home.

672
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,050
Sorry to bother you.

673
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,820
Nothing at all.

674
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,610
Your friend asked me to do this.

675
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,200
I didn't ask you to do this.

676
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
You can leave. I'm fine on my own.

677
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,160
Actually I think

678
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,960
you have nothing to worry about.

679
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,170
No one will be interested in you

680
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,280
unless he gets drunk.

681
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,160
Gu Yanzhen!

682
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,840
Mr. Zhao

683
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,280
are you taking a ride this late?

684
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,800
Yes.

685
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
I'm taking a ride.

686
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,170
My father asked you to follow me didn't he?

687
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,850
Young master

688
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,100
he is just worried about your safety.

689
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,770
He is worried about others' safety right?

690
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,920
Oh

691
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,440
this lady needs to go back to her hotel.

692
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
You give her a ride.

693
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,080
Me?

694
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,800
I don't need you.

695
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,480
I can go back myself.

696
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,160
Come here!

697
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,200
Don't touch me.

698
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,200
Gu Yanzhen! Put me down!

699
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,160
What are you doing?

700
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,040
You hurt me!

701
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,040
Get in the car!

702
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,040
Nobody could help you if you were in danger.

703
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,010
Which hotel?

704
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,440
Mr. Zhao

705
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,800
just take her to a random one.

706
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,600
Jinhua Hotel.

707
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,280
Got it.

708
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,610
Young master

709
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,920
last time

710
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,760
you asked me to find the lady in Shen's party.

711
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,420
I found her.

712
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,940
Alright

713
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,280
I already know.

714
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:52,920
Just go.

715
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,040
Bye.

716
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,000
Miss

717
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
what's your name?

718
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,080
Are you a friend of Mr. Gu?

719
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,560
I'm not his friend.

720
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,760
Hands off!

721
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Do you want to die?

722
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
She is my girl.

723
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
He's annoying.
