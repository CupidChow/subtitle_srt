00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,539
Episode 01

4
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
In 1911,

5
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
when the Revolution of 1911 broke out,

6
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,620
the Qing Government quickly collapsed.

7
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,960
Yuan Shikai, the leader of the Beiyang Army,

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,560
soon rose to power.

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,000
The nation was suffering from political unrest,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,240
and the public was in panic.

11
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,960
Western powers continued their oppression

12
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,440
and the bandits were rampant.

13
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,300
New schools were established all over the country.

14
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,760
Under such circumstances,

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
the Feng'an Government received donations from

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,960
a large number of patriots and agreed to

17
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,320
reopen Arsenal Military Academy

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,220
in the hope of cultivating patriotic soldiers.

19
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,079
Our story

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
begins here...

21
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
Breaking news!

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,680

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,880
Breaking news!

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,640

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Breaking news!

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,720

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,440
Breaking news!

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,040
Arsenal Military Academy reopened!

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
We should be the next.

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
Shen Junshan.

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,280
Yes!

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,400
It's time to get off.

33
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Here, take your belongings.

34
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,579
This way, this way.

35
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,340
Be careful.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hurry up.

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,360
Thanks.

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,880
Xiaojun!

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,480
What took you so long?

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,760
I thought you wouldn't come.

41
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,040
Here I am now.

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Are you sure about this?

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,480
You have to make up your mind.

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
Once you cut it,

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,840
there's no coming back.

46
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,040
Arsenal Military Academy isn't a place for fun.

47
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
I didn't prepare a plan B either.

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,640
Xie Liangchen.

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,120
Yes!

50
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,060
It's your turn.

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,440
Thanks.

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,280
Xie Liangchen!

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,160
Name.

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Xie Liangchen.

56
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,840
Age.

57
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
19.

58
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,600
OK.

59
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,480
Take off your clothes and lie down.

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,200
Doctor,

61
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,290
may I keep my clothes on?

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
What's wrong?

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm a bit shy.

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
You're a grown man.

65
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,159
Don't be like a girl.

66
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,520
I've never undressed in front of others.

67
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,200
Cut the crap. Take off.

68
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,720
Doctor,

69
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,360
please do me a favor.

70
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,040
What now? You don't want to pass?

71
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,320
No, I...

72
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,490
Then get out now.

73
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,770
Don't waste my time.

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,440
Doctor, I...

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,760
Get out, get out.

76
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Did you pass?

77
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,760
Really?

78
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,920
How did you make that?

79
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
I had my ways.

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,880
Let's go.

81
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,760
This place is creepy.

82
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,690
I'm a bit scared.

83
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,810
That's because you're guilty.

84
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,400
Come on.

85
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,320
Let's go somewhere else.

86
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,840
Where to?

87
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
Just follow me.

88
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,560
Excuse me, coming through.

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,240
Flowers, fresh flowers.

90
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,100
Cigarettes, fruit, and candies.

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,800
Sir, would you like some flowers?

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
Cigarettes, fruit, and candies.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,280
You...you don't know her?

94
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,880
Why do you take me here?

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,600
The superstar Qu Manting.

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,960
What? You scared?

97
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,920
I joined an all men's academy.

98
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,080
This club is cake.

99
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,330
You're the best.

100
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,640
Did you also come to see that star?

101
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,320
No, she's my friend.

102
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,940
Qu Manting is your friend?

103
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
What? We can't be friends?

104
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

105
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,920
Sure.

106
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Are you really close?

107
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,800
Of course we are. Why would I lie?

108
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,560
Come on, let's go inside.

109
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,090
Let's go.

110
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,880
How did you know each other?

111
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
We grew up together.

112
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,600
You grew up with a superstar?

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,840
Let us in.

114
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,560
We're here to interview Ms. Qu.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,320
Excuse me, please be quiet.

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,480
Please be quiet.

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,440
Everyone, Ms. Qu

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,570
is doing her makeup.

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
You can ask me your questions first.

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,760
Excuse me,

121
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
how long does Ms. Qu Manting plan to

122
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
stay in Shunyuan this time?

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,880
How long will her show in Paramo last?

124
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,480
Yes.

125
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
It's said that Mr. Shen and Ms. Qu

126
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
were childhood sweethearts.

127
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,280
Is this true?

128
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,040
Yes, please answer the question.

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,900
Please tell us.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,080
We're extremely honored

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,760
that Ms. Qu is able to find time

132
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
to come to our club

133
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,440
and perform on stage.

134
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,080
On behalf of the club,

135
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,940
I'd like to extend my sincerest welcome and thanks.

136
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
Her performance

137
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,200
will last three days.

138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm sorry, sir.

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,320
This is the dressing room.

140
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,920
Authorized personnel only.

141
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,640
I see.

142
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,600
Where's the bathroom?

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,480
That way.

144
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,280
Down the hall.

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,160
Thanks.

146
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
Shunyuan is her hometown.

147
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,240
She's never done such commercial performances elsewhere,

148
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
but Shunyuan is different.

149
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,960
She's willing to make an exception for her hometown.

150
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,560
- Yes. That's right. - Right.

151
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,440
As for why she's back,

152
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
how long she can stay,

153
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
and her relationship

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,520
with Mr. Shen...

155
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,640
Yes, what's their relationship?

156
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm afraid you have to ask her yourself.

157
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,880
I don't know the answer, either.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
How old are you?

159
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm asking you.

160
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
Are you deaf or what?

161
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Stop right there.

162
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,460
You like me, don't you?

163
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
It's no big deal. Just admit it.

164
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm used to men's affection.

165
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,440
I don't even know you.

166
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,360
Why would I like you?

167
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,440
You don't know me?

168
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,040
You're good.

169
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
You should be an actor.

170
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,440
I swear I do not know you.

171
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,970
Then why did you follow me to the ladies' room?

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,560
You look young.

173
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
How could you do this at your age?

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Are you an adult?

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm sorry. This is a misunderstanding.

176
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
Stop there!

177
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,170
Misunderstanding?

178
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
For what?

179
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,080
Ms. Qu...

180
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,400
For you stalked me and tried to peep at me?

181
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,880
Ms. Qu, are you in there?

182
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,010
Did you take photos?

183
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
-Ms. Qu. -Give me the camera!

184
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,850
Delete them!

185
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
I don't have a camera.

186
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,160
Give it to me now.

187
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,810
How could you attack me?

188
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,920
I attacked you. So what?

189
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,480
I knew you did it.

190
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,920
Give me the camera.

191
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,240
Stop it, or I'll fight back.

192
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,120
Then do it.

193
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Hit me if you dare.

194
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,800
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

195
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,040
You're such a shrew.

196
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,440
You hit me and call me a shrew?

197
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,400
Ms. Qu!

198
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,320
You're dead!

199
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,970
You bastard! Stop right there.

200
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,480
Ms. Qu!

201
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,010
Bastard!

202
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,880
Ms. Qu.

203
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
- Stop there! Don't take photos! - Ms. Qu,

204
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,160
I have a question for you.

205
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,620
Enough.

206
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,490
Stop taking photos.

207
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,540
Here's your wine, sir.

208
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
OK, a moment, please.

209
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Here's your wine.

210
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
Xiaojun, let's go.

211
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,320
I said I'll

212
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,560
introduce Manting to you.

213
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Ladies and gentlemen,

214
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,400
dear friends,

215
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,040
good evening.

216
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
Welcome to Club Paramo.

217
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm sure tonight...

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,160
Come, let's go have a look.

219
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,960
You all came for the same person.

220
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,040
Then ladies and gentlemen,

221
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,120
please give a big round of applause

222
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,180
to welcome our superstar of the night

223
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,040
Ms. Qu Manting to sing for us.

224
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,400
Xiaojun, we should leave.

225
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,040
We just came here.

226
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Don't you want to meet Manting?

227
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,280
No, I just...

228
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,480
She's out, she's out.

229
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,800
Moonlight reflects the loneliness of the night

230
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,600
Fingertips bring out the sadness of the keys

231
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,560
Gorgeous dance shoes are locked in the window

232
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,200
And you sing alone in the wind

233
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,000
Memories become blurred under the street light

234
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,360
Colors fade from the image

235
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,680
I keep wandering in the dreams

236
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,080
I don't know the way out

237
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
Tango under the moonlight before dawn

238
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,960
I only want you to hold my hands

239
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,960
Don't say anything that will break my heart

240
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,480
Let us keep this night in our mind

241
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
Tango under the moonlight before dawn

242
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,160
I only want you to follow my lead

243
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,320
Enjoy this brief moment before separation

244
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,840
Wish time could stop here and now

245
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,080
- Good! - Bravo! - Great!

246
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Thanks.

247
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,640
Thank you.

248
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,080
Is she really a star?

249
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,280
She sang like a crow.

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,330
What are you looking at?

251
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,720
What's wrong?

252
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,120
Was I wrong?

253
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,920
I don't think she deserved her fame.

254
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,320
So rude!

255
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,770
Where are your manners?

256
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Hey you, show some respect!

257
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,760
Right, so rude!

258
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,040
How could you say that?

259
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,500
You have no manners at all.

260
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,120
Your voice isn't pleasant,

261
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,040
but

262
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,760
I have to say you're good-looking.

263
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,760
You're a star, right?

264
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,520
Would you like to

265
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,800
drink with me tonight?

266
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,000
Sorry, sir.

267
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm not a social girl.

268
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,290
You asked the wrong person.

269
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,440
I...

270
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,880
Who is it that dares

271
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,200
to make a scene here?

272
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,840
Boss,

273
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,880
it's Gu Zongtang's son.

274
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,040
Who?

275
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,360
The vice Minister of the Ministry of the Interior.

276
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,360
And the grandson of the Director of the Education Department, Hu Liuweng.

277
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,720
Let go!

278
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,640
Commander Hu, Hu Yunsheng's nephew.

279
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,200
Are you nuts?

280
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,930
General Xu's brother-in-law.

281
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,760
Boss, don't poke the bear.

282
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,920
Go.

283
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
Call young master.

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,560
Yes.

285
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,080
Let go of me!

286
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,520
You pervert!

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,160
I'll show you

288
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,320
what a pervert can do!

289
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,280
Let go!

290
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,160
Let go of me!

291
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,160
Bastard! Let me go!

292
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
Let me...let...

293
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,240
Stop it!

294
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,480
Stop!

295
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,360
Help!

296
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,920
Let me down, you pig!

297
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,960
Isn't she your friend? Shouldn't you do something?

298
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,400
I... What could I do?

299
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,320
Manager Huang didn't do anything.

300
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,080
Then you just stand and watch

301
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,160
that perv take her away?

302
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,400
What should I do?

303
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,840
I don't know what to do.

304
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,120
Stop it! Stop! Stop taking photos!

305
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,360
Let go!

306
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Help! Help me!

307
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,760
Please help me!

308
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,680
Help me!

309
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,960
What? You want to play the hero?

310
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,000
Stop it!

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,760
Save it.

312
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,040
You disgusting pig!

313
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Let me down!

314
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,480
-Let me down! -You stay, I'll go.

315
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,680
Oh my god!

316
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,840
Let me down, you pig!

317
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,360
Wait.

318
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,520
Let her go.

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
You!

320
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
You two are partners?

321
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,240
No!

322
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,280
You followed me to the bathroom,

323
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
and he kidnapped me.

324
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,560
You're a team!

325
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,600
I told you we weren't.

326
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,760
I'm here to help you.

327
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,640
Cut the crap.

328
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,080
Let me down, both of you!

329
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,360
Coming through.

330
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,960
Step aside. Stand straight.

331
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,560
What's wrong?

332
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,520
Step back. Step back.

333
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,840
I'll kill you!

334
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,040
Are you hurt?

335
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,960
I'm hurt.

336
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,080
Let me see.

337
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,760
They ganged up against me.

338
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
They're partners!

339
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm not his partner.

340
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,640
I can prove that.

341
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,760
You two even held each other!

342
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,960
Don't try to deny it!

343
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,400
I swear I'm really not his partner!

344
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,800
You're still denying it?

345
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,640
You...

346
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,040
Captain He.

347
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,040
Mr. Shen.

348
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,800
Thank you.

349
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,920
Don't mention it.

350
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,880
Protecting every citizen in town

351
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,740
is the police's responsibility.

352
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,160
Mr. Shen, don't worry,

353
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,440
criminals will be brought to justice.

354
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,589
Thanks.

355
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,200
Then please

356
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,460
take care of the rest here.

357
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
I'll bring Ms. Qu back first.

358
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,900
What's your attitude?

359
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
You tell me!

360
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,320
What are you doing?

361
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,840
Do you have a problem with me?

362
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Listen,

363
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,560
you can't let them go.

364
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,560
Bye-bye!

365
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,720
What?

366
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
Your family is powerful, right?

367
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,620
Tell them now. They'll be scared.

368
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,280
Well, look,

369
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,000
I never rely on my family. I'm self-dependent.

370
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,280
Unless I'm desperate.

371
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
You're desperate now.

372
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,560
I can beat 10 people.

373
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,320
There's more than 10.

374
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,560
Hey,

375
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,440
let's teach them a lesson for Mr. Shen.

376
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,640
Beat them!

377
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,160
What did you say?

378
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,720
Arrested by the police?

379
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,720
Yes.

380
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,800
Yanzhen had an accident in Paramo.

381
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,570
It was a misunderstanding.

382
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,800
An accident?

383
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,320
He just came to Shunyuan,

384
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,580
and now he's in prison.

385
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
He won't cease causing me trouble

386
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,080
as long as he can breathe.

387
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,120
Then Yanzhen...

388
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,440
Let him rot in prison.

389
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
So we'll

390
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,240
leave him there?

391
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,480
Of course not!

392
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,640
He's my only son.

393
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,520
If something happens to him,

394
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,250
our family line will be cut off.

395
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,280
Leave him there?

396
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,610
What were you thinking?

397
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,880
What are you waiting for?

398
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,040
Go bring him back now!

399
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,440
Look,

400
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,120
it was a trivial matter,

401
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,800
but you had to make it big.

402
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,560
And now,

403
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
all powerful figures in Shunyuan

404
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,800
know that

405
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,560
the new Vice Governor of Feng'an,

406
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,620
Gu Zongtang's son is a troublemaker.

407
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,460
He's locked up in prison soon after he came to Shunyuan.

408
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,120
When the day breaks,

409
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,120
the Gu family

410
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,680
will become a laughing stock in town.

411
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
Captain He.

412
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,920
You have an air of command.

413
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,760
Two bamboos.

414
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Mr. Gu,

415
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
we failed to recognize you.

416
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,240
It's our fault.

417
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,440
It's a misunderstanding.

418
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,570
Misunderstanding?

419
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,680
I don't think so.

420
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,720
I remember

421
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,520
you said that criminals would be

422
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,040
brought to justice.

423
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,200
Well...

424
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,400
I had no choice.

425
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,000
I ran into Ms. Qu

426
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,280
in the big crowd.

427
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,000
I admired her charm

428
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,970
and meant to treat her to dinner

429
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
while discussing life and whatnot.

430
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,440
Then what happened?

431
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,320
You locked me up in a cell.

432
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,880
Can you make it up to me?

433
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,000
Please calm down, Mr. Gu.

434
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,200
I was deceived by others

435
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,760
and offended you.

436
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
How come a mannerless punk

437
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,290
is on the moral high ground?

438
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,560
Would you like to be imprisoned again?

439
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,800
Think carefully whose side you are on.

440
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

441
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,200
It's my fault.

442
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,560
Please have mercy on me

443
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,560
and spare my life.

444
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,880
From now on,

445
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,200
your wish is my command.

446
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,760
You're too kind. We got off to a bad start,

447
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,800
but we've become friends.

448
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,600
Thank you for your forgiveness.

449
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Now that we're friends,

450
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,200
I want you to convey a message to...

451
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,920
What's his name?

452
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,000
Shen...

453
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,320
Shen Tingbai.

454
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah him.

455
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Do you think you can do it?

456
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,440
What...what's the message?

457
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,040
It's OK if you can't do it.

458
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
I can.

459
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,800
No problem.

460
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I quit.

461
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,880
I can't win anyway.

462
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,160
You've won!

463
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,960
Mr. Gu, you've won.

464
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
What are you waiting for?

465
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,640
Mr. Gu's won.

466
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Pay up.

467
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,480
Hurry. Hurry up.

468
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,820
Take out the money.

469
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,680
Mr. Gu, here's your money.

470
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,880
You play this simply for fun, don't you?

471
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
The wager is so small.

472
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,160
Hand over your money. Hurry.

473
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,200
All of it.

474
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,920
Mr. Gu,

475
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
thanks to Commander Zhang and Vice Minister Gu,

476
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,640
we're well paid.

477
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,900
Our salaries are high.

478
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
We often play big.

479
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,320
Please accept it, Mr. Gu.

480
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,640
Alright.

481
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,680
This can be used for his

482
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,160
medical treatment.

483
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,540
You're so kind, Mr. Gu.

484
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,920
I don't need it.

485
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,920
When can I leave?

486
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,040
Anytime as you wish.

487
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,280
So mean.

488
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
We were cellmates after all.

489
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Mr. Gu, this...

490
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,000
Captain,

491
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,760
Mr. Gu's men are waiting for him.

492
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
Mr. Gu,

493
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360
please.

494
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,820
I'm done playing with you.

495
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,440
Gotta go.

496
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,760
- This is mine. - It's mine. - It's mine.

497
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,120
Enough. It's mine.

498
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,200
Captain He.

499
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,920
I believe we're friends now, right?

500
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,600
Yes, of course.

501
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,320
We're friends.

502
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,280
Friends should be honest and

503
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,130
loyal to each other, right?

504
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,000
Don't forget to bring my message

505
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,440
to that Shen guy, every word of it.

506
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,520
Of course.

507
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,520
Thank you.

508
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Captain He.

509
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,120
They say strangers shouldn't challenge locals.

510
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,320
We've learned our lesson.

511
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,920
But take this as a reminder that

512
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,280
the locals may be strong,

513
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,320
but the strangers aren't some pushovers.

514
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,640
A fire at the city gate

515
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,120
brings disaster to the fish in the moat.

516
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,930
You'd better take care.

517
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,760
Yes.

518
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,200
I know what I should do.

519
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,800
What the heck is this?

520
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,480
Captain,

521
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,080
we were used by them.

522
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
I know that!

523
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,600
Master, Yanzhen is back.

524
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,320
Yanzhen.

525
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Stop there.

526
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,120
Master,

527
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,440
look at young master's face.

528
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,120
It's all bruised.

529
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,760
Those Shunyuan people are rogue.

530
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,840
How dare they use violence!

531
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,080
He deserved it.

532
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,200
They should've beaten him

533
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
harder than that.

534
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,720
Look at you.

535
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,130
You already caused so much trouble in Peking.

536
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,560
Back then,

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
others respected me.

538
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,840
But now,

539
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,160
I'm practically

540
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,720
expelled to this place.

541
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,680
Zhang Xihou, Li Tingchang, and Shen Bonian

542
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,480
won't follow my orders anymore.

543
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,720
You failed to understand the situation

544
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,320
and continued to abuse your power,

545
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,040
cause trouble,

546
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,280
and humiliate me.

547
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,080
Stupid! Utterly stupid!

548
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,600
Are you done?

549
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,200
I need to take shower.

550
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,440
You punk!

551
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,840
Bastard!

552
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,760
Master.

553
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,600
What have I done to have you as my son?

554
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,040
Calm down, dad.

555
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,480
It's not like

556
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,040
you can put me back.

557
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,800
Don't get too angry.

558
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,320
Bastard!

559
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,240
Mr. Zhu, bring my dad some tea

560
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,000
- to calm him down. - Come back!

561
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,930
You little brat!

562
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,800
Master.

563
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,360
Look at him! Look what he's done!

564
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,040
If I knew he'd be like this,

565
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,560
I'd let him die there.

566
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,400
I must do something.

567
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,640
If he continues to be like this,

568
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,800
he'll get into huge trouble someday.

569
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,220
I've pulled some strings.

570
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,680
I'll send him

571
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,290
to Arsenal Military Academy in a few days.

572
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,120
I thought it was closed.

573
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,080
That's what the Japanese said. You believe them?

574
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Besides,

575
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,960
Zhang Xihou's a hard nut to crack.

576
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,580
Arsenal Military Academy

577
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,680
won't pamper any student.

578
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
Let him be disciplined

579
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,120
so that he'll cause less trouble.

580
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,560
I apologize

581
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,640
for what happened today.

582
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,480
I knew he wasn't an ordinary person,

583
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,680
yet I asked you to handle him.

584
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,040
Sorry for the inconvenience.

585
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,040
It doesn't matter.

586
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,160
I did what I should do.

587
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,840
My father and Vice Director Gu are acquaintances.

588
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,280
I'll

589
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,760
handle the rest of the matter.

590
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,840
You won't be implicated.

591
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,640
You're too kind, Mr. Shen.

592
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,600
Is there anything else, Captain He?

593
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
Mr. Gu

594
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,520
asked me to convey a message to you.

595
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,680
What is it?

596
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,560
He thanked you for

597
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,440
what you did to him today.

598
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,000
He heard you're a well-known figure in town,

599
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,680
and he's looking forward to

600
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,640
meeting you again in the future.

601
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,200
Anything else?

602
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,760
He...also said...

603
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,040
Ms...

604
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,680
Ms. Qu's waist is so soft.

605
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,280
Brother.

606
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm a student at Arsenal Military Academy now.

607
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,320
I promise

608
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,080
I'll become an excellent soldier.

609
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,240
I won't let you down.

610
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,840
Take care of yourself.

611
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,040
Go back.

612
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,840
Take care.

613
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,680
So grand!

614
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,360
Hello.

615
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
You must be new here.

616
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm Xie...

617
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm Xie Liangchen.

618
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,000
Hello.

619
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm Huang Song.

620
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,860
I'm from Jinan, Shandong.

621
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,640
Why did you come all the way here?

622
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,680
I fled my hometown

623
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,240
and enlisted in the army.

624
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I fought in the war

625
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,160
and won merits.

626
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,080
Then I was ordered to come here.

627
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,880
Wow, so you fought in the war?

628
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,840
I barely touched the gun.

629
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,760
I ran too slowly.

630
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,210
When I arrived, the enemies were all gone.

631
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,840
The enemies were gone.

632
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,400
That means you had won.

633
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,040
These are all yours?

634
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,200
Yes, it's a lot.

635
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,200
Why did you bring so many things?

636
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,680
They're expensive here,

637
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,480
so I brought my own.

638
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,180
You even brought a pot?

639
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,840
We can eat in the canteen.

640
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,240
What?

641
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,000
We have a canteen?

642
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,440
I thought we had to cook ourselves.

643
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,280
Go away, you bumpkin!

644
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,040
Get lost, beggars!

645
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,920
What did you say?

646
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,960
You heard me.

647
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,120
Get out of my sight!

648
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,960
Come back.

649
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,280
How dare...

650
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,920
Never mind.

651
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,640
Let it go.

652
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,640
Listen to me,

653
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
in this Academy,

654
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,050
if you're too soft, they'll bully you.

655
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,920
It's OK.

656
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,800
My dad often tells me

657
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
hardship is a blessing in disguise.

658
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,560
Let's go.

659
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,120
OK.

660
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,080
Hello, everyone.

661
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,040
Last time, they caused so much trouble,

662
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,250
yet I made it go away in two days.

663
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
They hold those crappy guns

664
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,250
and think they can scare us.

665
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,320
Last month on my birthday,

666
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,080
my old man gave me two Mausers.

667
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,120
Really?

668
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,080
- You have them now? - Is it true?

669
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,120
Let us have a look.

670
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Show us the gun.

671
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,600
Not now.

672
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,880
Why not?

673
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,400
Take it out!

674
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
You are so mean.

675
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,440
Hey, how about this?

676
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,840
After the registration,

677
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,240
I'll hold a banquet in Deyue Restaurant.

678
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,720
Join me if you're interested.

679
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Then you can play with my gun.

680
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,200
Deal.

681
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,320
We can have fun.

682
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,880
Sure.

683
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,320
Hello, everyone.

684
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,980
Put it here.

685
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,120
Is he the one

686
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,450
who scratched our car just now?

687
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,800
That's a treasure.

688
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,560
MP 18.

689
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,400
- Its rate of fire is 400 bullets per minute. - Idiot.

690
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,440
The firing range is 150 meters.

691
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,900
It's light and easy to use,

692
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,960
but it's a little expensive.

693
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,600
A little expensive.

694
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,360
Our school is rich.

695
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,480
You know so much.

696
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,960
I've never used it before.

697
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,880
I wish I could use it

698
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,760
to shoot a few rounds.

699
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,320
You will have the chance.

700
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,320
Hey, bumpkin.

701
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,160
Ignore him.

702
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,280
My stuff is a bit heavy,

703
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,400
but it has everything

704
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,880
I...

705
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
I'm talking to you, bumpkin.

706
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,960
Are you blind?

707
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,080
Who's the bumpkin?

708
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,360
He asked me who the bumpkin is.

709
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,160
Take a look.

710
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,320
Look, who's dressed more like a bumpkin?

711
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
You know what,

712
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
you should be grateful

713
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,760
that I didn't call you untouchable, got it?

714
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,640
What's the matter?

715
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Your trolley scratched our car just now.

716
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,840
You hit us with your car.

717
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,630
Look,

718
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,030
let's revisit the facts.

719
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,800
You put the trolley in the middle of the road.

720
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,710
I drove past it

721
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,150
and hit on it

722
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,560
We're both responsible.

723
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,710
Look,

724
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,570
we'll pay for your broken things.

725
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,940
What's broken?

726
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,120
Is it this basin? This one?

727
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,040
You know what,

728
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,400
in Feng'an,

729
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
there are less than 10 cars similar to mine.

730
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,630
You scratched my car,

731
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,230
and the paint was off.

732
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,960
Can you afford a new one?

733
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,050
I don't need to tell you the price.

734
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Judging by your look,

735
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,050
there's no way you could afford it.

736
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,120
Hey, how about this?

737
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,630
I'll be lenient with you.

738
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,120
You only need to kneel down and kowtow

739
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,920
while saying,

740
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,160
Dad, I'm sorry.

741
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,120
Then we're even.

742
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,520
You've crossed the line.

743
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Now you're quiet.

744
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,320
Can you afford it?

745
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,960
Well,

746
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,520
accept your fate if you can't.

747
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,890
People like you want to be commanders?

748
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,040
Just go home and farm!

749
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
Bumpkin.

750
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,440
Bumpkin.

751
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,330
A bumpkin is better than a traitor.

752
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,450
What did you say?

753
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,720
Aren't you wearing a badge of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce?

754
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Are you Japanese?

755
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,460
If you aren't, then you must be a traitor.

756
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,440
Excuse me?

757
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,240
What? Am I wrong?

758
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,130
Why are you mad if I'm not wrong?

759
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,720
I...

760
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,560
Liangchen,

761
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
just ignore them.

762
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,200
Sorry.

763
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,000
That's it?

764
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,880
I...

765
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,960
Someone scratched your damn car

766
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,760
and you asked him to kneel.

767
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,400
You hit me.

768
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,290
You think an apology is enough?

769
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,000
Then what do you want?

770
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,200
Kneel down and kowtow.

771
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,010
Say "Master, I'm sorry"

772
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,160
then I'll forgive you.

773
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,840
Shen Junshan,

774
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,880
if it not for your father and brother,

775
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,400
I wouldn't be so nice to you.

776
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,460
You should know I'm not scared of you.

777
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,060
Apologizing for your mistake

778
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
is natural.

779
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,400
When you lectured others,

780
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,840
you had so much to say.

781
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,720
Now it's my turn,

782
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,960
you want me to cut you some slack.

783
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
OK.

784
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,880
Today,

785
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,240
for the sake of Shen Junshan,

786
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,840
I'll let you go.

787
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,570
You'd better behave yourself.

788
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,840
Stop.

789
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,400
Wenzhong.

790
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Shen Junshan!

791
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,640
Your matter is over,

792
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,840
but mine isn't.

793
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
I asked you to kowtow. You think it's a joke?

794
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
Hey you, I'll kill you!

795
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,200
Junshan, do you know him?

796
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,740
Are you familiar with him?

797
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,240
I'm also familiar with the stray dogs who often come

798
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,370
to my house for food.

799
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,320
Look, when others are stronger, he becomes weak.

800
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Look at him.

801
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,640
What are you doing? Go back in line.

802
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,000
Stand straight!

803
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,720
What are you doing?

804
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,560
Stand straight!

805
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,400
Go back in line!

806
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,330
Stand straight!

807
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,600
You look energetic.

808
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,720
Who participated in the fight?

809
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,520
Step forward.

810
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,000
Are you stepping forward or not?

811
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,480
Be a man and step out here!

812
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,760
Yes!

813
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,080
You!

814
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
You!

815
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,640
And you?

816
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,000
I didn't do anything.

817
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,160
You were with him, right?

818
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
Your friend was in a fight, but you just stood there and watched?

819
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,130
You call yourself a friend?

820
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,930
On the battlefield,

821
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,160
will you also stand there and watch your friend get shot?

822
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,960
Step forward!

823
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,120
Step forward!

824
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,080
For those who fought,

825
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
carry your luggage

826
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,400
and run 50 laps.

827
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
50 laps?

828
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,120
Sir,

829
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,160
my luggage is a bit heavy.

830
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,240
Are you joking with me?

831
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
I...I dare not.

832
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,520
You came for training

833
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
or you moved your entire house here?

834
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,260
You even brought a pot?

835
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,360
Do you want to be a chef?

836
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,560
No, sir.

837
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,280
On the battlefield, your gear is your life.

838
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,520
Look at you.

839
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,880
A bunch of good-for-nothings.

840
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,400
All losers!

841
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,080
I don't know

842
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,400
why I should waste my time

843
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,200
on you people.

844
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
But don't worry.

845
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,280
Now that you're here,

846
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
I'll take good care of you.

847
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,040
Now,

848
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,120
while they run 50 laps,

849
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,400
the rest of you

850
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,080
carry your luggage

851
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,120
and run 30 laps.

852
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,760
Gather in front of the dormitory building

853
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,880
in two hours.

854
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,000
Those who can't finish on time

855
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
will have no food or bed.

856
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,540
Go to the training ground now!

857
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,160
Sir.

858
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,560
My car...

859
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,760
Your car what?

860
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,680
Carry your pot and luggage

861
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,940
and start running now!

862
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,280
Yes.

863
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,640
Sir, can we talk in private?

864
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,160
Sir,

865
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,880
this is Vice Minister Gu, Gu Zongtang's son.

866
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,680
Here's a massage from Commander Liu.

867
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,880
Please be easy on him.

868
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,200
Hello everyone.

869
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm Gu Yanzhen.

870
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,220
What's this moron doing here?

871
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,240
Who is this?

872
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,520
Who is he?

873
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,880
Guards!

874
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,880
Hang him up on the training ground!

875
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,520
Yes.

876
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,600
Sir, it's from Commander Liu.

877
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,760
He's Vice Minister Gu's son.

878
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
I don't care about your background.

879
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,320
In this place,

880
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,600
you have only one status.

881
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,720
You're all reservists.

882
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,640
From now on,

883
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,320
whoever dares to

884
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,650
bring up their families

885
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,760
will be severely punished!
