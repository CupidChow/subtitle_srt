Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 42

4
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,039
Miss, keep chasing?

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,720
Why?

6
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,560
That was already ruined.

7
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,960
Wasn't this burnt?

8
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,080
There is another note book on the desk.

9
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,160
I got two.

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,280
Only one was burnt.

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,759
Brilliant!

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
How can I let such an important thing

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,880
be burnt?

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
What's on this?

15
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,080
I don't understand.

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Can you?

17
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,520
Don't look at me!

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm nearly illiterate!

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,680
Song,

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,080
we know this.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,880
It sounds like

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
you can understand this.

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
We almost lost our lives

24
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,800
on making great efforts

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,880
to get this useless thing.

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
We don't even understand it.

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,240
No matter what it is,

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,320
it means a lot to the Japanese.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
Or, Oda Xianrong wouldn't have come for this.

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
Isn't the man a translator?

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
But he has left.

32
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,520
Well,

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,079
let me try.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,120
You are not the only one who can look it up.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,760
I can, too.

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
Shut up!

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,960
Why should I shut up?

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,320
Don't say that.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
- I want! - Stop that.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,640
I want to say!

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,079
I…

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,040
Seriously?

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,120
I want!

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,800
I said it!

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,880
I want!

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,520
Really?

47
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
So what? I said it!

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,240
Can you understand?

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,960
Say it again!

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,680
Go.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Look at you.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,000
What's wrong?

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,720
Why should I go?

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,240
Enough!

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,120
Hey.

56
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,640
Coming!

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,480
Song?

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,840
What's up?

59
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,079
What happened?

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,280
Liangchen,

61
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,520
I,

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,920
I want to ask you,

63
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,200
where is Xie Xiang?

64
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
I can't find her at her school

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,160
recently.

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Did something happen to her?

67
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,320
No.

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,680
She has gone back to Peking.

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,800
Back to Peking?

70
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,520
When will she come back?

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,880
She won't.

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,800
What?

73
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,240
Then where will she go?

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,040
She will

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,920
study abroad.

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Abroad?

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,400
She has already left.

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,000
She won't come back?

79
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
Song.

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,160
Huang Song!

81
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,480
What happened?

82
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't know.

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
What's going on?

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,159
Coming!

85
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,040
Liangchen,

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,520
let's go.

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,360
Follow me to a place.

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,040
Where?

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,440
A good place.

90
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,360
Go dress up.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,560
Now!

92
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,040
What's that?

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Why so mysterious?

94
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Cut your question.

95
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,400
Go now.

96
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
Dress neatly.

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,440
Got it.

98
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,159
OK.

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,159
Ready?

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,240
Wait a second.

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,680
Is your sister as tall as you?

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Wait,

103
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,440
she is a little shorter than you.

104
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,400
That's fine.

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,120
I can stand on my toes.

106
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
Get down here!

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,760
You are taking photos with me,

108
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,520
and what do you have to do with my sister?

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,480
Be serious.

110
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,400
OK.

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,400
Sir, you can start.

112
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,560
OK.

113
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait!

114
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,720
What again?

115
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,280
Liangchen,

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,360
stay close to me.

117
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,440
Closer.

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,440
You are so annoying.

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,720
More smile.

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,680
Smile.

121
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes, right.

122
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Is it OK?

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,560
Yes.

124
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,400
We can start.

125
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,440
One, two, three.

126
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,280
Why do you want to take photos now?

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,360
Nothing.

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,920
I just want to take photos.

129
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,520
After I earn money later,

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
I will take my sister,

131
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,840
brother-in-law and He

132
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,000
to take photos together.

133
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,400
We haven't got a family photo yet.

134
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,200
A photo doesn't cost so much.

135
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,600
Why should you wait later?

136
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,120
I can borrow a camera

137
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,400
and take photos for you and your family.

138
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,240
Really?

139
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,080
Sure.

140
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,840
Why should I lie to you?

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,960
Great!

142
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,080
Liangchen,

143
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,400
my sister is pregnant.

144
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,360
I will

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,720
become an uncle!

146
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,600
Really?

147
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,200
That'll be great!

148
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
We can go together then.

149
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,920
Perfect.

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
Huang Song?

151
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,640
Gu Yanzhen.

152
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
Why are you back now?

153
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,880
Grown up, huh?

154
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,440
You dare to drink here.

155
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
Aren't you afraid of being caught by Lv?

156
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,680
I'm sad now.

157
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,680
What happened?

158
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I lost my love.

159
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,040
What?

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,960
Have you ever fallen in love?

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,880
No.

162
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,240
Then why did you say that?

163
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
I've made a decision

164
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,000
that I'll keep studying

165
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,120
and find a good job

166
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,680
with a good salary.

167
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
When I get enough money,

168
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
I'll build a big house for my

169
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,030
sister and her husband.

170
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
The biggest one in our village.

171
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,640
And after that,

172
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
I will think about marriage.

173
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,800
Come on,

174
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,400
cheers.

175
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,640
Tell you what,

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
I'm not drunk.

177
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,760
Yes, right.

178
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,120
Go get more wine for me.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,800
You're not drunk.

180
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,660
Go wait outside.

181
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll bring you wine.

182
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,080
Alcoholic.

183
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
I tell you...

184
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,000
Open the door!

185
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,440
Open the door!

186
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,920
Last time,

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
you said you would marry me.

188
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,800
Is that still counting?

189
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,640
Yes.

190
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,080
Why are you back?

191
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Didn't I tell you not to drink so much?

192
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
Why are you drunk again?

193
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
I'm bored.

194
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,240
What could I do

195
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,520
if I don't drink?

196
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,400
You drunk because you were bored?

197
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,840
Are you hungry?

198
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,040
Yes.

199
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,200
Let's go back

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
and I'll make noodles for you.

201
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,440
Back to where?

202
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,120
Back to home!

203
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,200
Do you have a home?

204
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,680
The tavern.

205
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,040
The house

206
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,000
of the tavern is mine.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,080
But that is my home.

208
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,760
Tell me why,

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,640
why did you come back?

210
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,440
You are not happy?

211
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,440
No.

212
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,640
I thought you wouldn't be back.

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
It was

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,480
like a dream.

215
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,880
On the 7th,

216
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,120
Evan went to Mozi Mountain with the translator

217
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,160
and stayed for three days.

218
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,800
On the 13th,

219
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
they went to Yushantun

220
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
and stayed for two days.

221
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
And then Gutainan

222
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,800
for one day.

223
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,480
On the 25th,

224
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,360
he took the translator to Xiantao Village

225
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
and stayed for days

226
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
until he accidentally

227
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,480
died in the gunfight on the 29th.

228
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,520
This is Evan's whole trip

229
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,920
in Shunyuan this month.

230
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,480
The location should be around here.

231
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,840
There should still be under the government's control,

232
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,600
and it's large.

233
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,280
It's not easy for us to get it.

234
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,840
Make an appointment with Mayor Bai for me.

235
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,040
Yes.

236
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,640
According to the contents,

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,920
this Russian

238
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,960
should be an excellent geologist.

239
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,240
The distribution of minerals in Shunyuan

240
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,720
is recorded in detail in the notebook.

241
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,840
I thought it should be something important.

242
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,440
What is important

243
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,880
is about the distribution of graphite ore.

244
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,200
What is graphite ore?

245
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,360
A kind of minerals.

246
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,360
Graphite has good

247
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,440
chemical stability at high temperatures.

248
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,640
The specially processed graphite

249
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
is corrosion-resistant,

250
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,000
heat-conductive and

251
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,240
has low permeability.

252
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,720
The most important

253
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,520
is that graphite can make steel.

254
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,840
If enough graphite were available,

255
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
Japanese steel production

256
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,480
would at least

257
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,880
be triple.

258
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,600
What do iron and steel mean

259
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,720
to the country?

260
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,480
Do I need to explain it?

261
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,560
That

262
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,040
seems to be their purpose.

263
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,680
They are so greedy.

264
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,040
I still have a question.

265
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,320
What

266
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,200
do iron and steel mean to a country?

267
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
I don't understand.

268
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,760
The iron and steel are…

269
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,800
Song,

270
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,040
you don't need to

271
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,160
understand this kind of things.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,880
Just forget it.

273
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,840
Then what should we do now?

274
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,920
Here is it,

275
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,240
since this is so important to them,

276
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,760
it means that they still

277
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,200
don't know the location of it yet.

278
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,520
Then let's start first

279
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,400
and get the land.

280
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,440
This is mining!

281
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,560
It can't be this easy!

282
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
It's difficult for others,

283
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,440
but for me…

284
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,840
Wait for my news.

285
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,200
Let me see this.

286
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Take this one there.

287
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,960
Go.

288
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,120
Master,

289
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,760
did young master cause trouble again?

290
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,360
This time

291
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
he did a good job.

292
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Yes,

293
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,960
yes, right.

294
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,800
You are totally right.

295
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,040
Yes.

296
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,720
Don't worry,

297
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,840
I can handle this.

298
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,760
OK.

299
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,000
OK. Alright. Yes.

300
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,000
Then that's it.

301
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,040
OK.

302
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,840
Bye.

303
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,600
Bye.

304
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
What's wrong?

305
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,440
The phone calls can't stop for the whole morning.

306
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,680
Who was it this time?

307
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,720
Vice Director Gu.

308
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,000
He asked me for help.

309
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,840
Isn't he in Nanjing?

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,280
Yes. So what?

311
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,680
Don't you know his power?

312
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,600
Since he has asked,

313
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,349
I should help him anyway.

314
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,560
Well,

315
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,480
what's that?

316
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,829
He wants me

317
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,640
to give the No.9 land

318
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,440
to Shen Family.

319
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,720
They want to mine that place.

320
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,310
What does it have to do with Shen Family?

321
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,589
Mr. Gu's son and Mr. Shen's second son

322
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,200
are classmates in the Academy.

323
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,000
Then just give it to them.

324
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,109
It's about Gu Family

325
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,109
and Shen Family.

326
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,560
That's not difficult to decide.

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,160
It's easy to say it,

328
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,360
but the problem is

329
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,480
that the Japanese COC also called me

330
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,960
for lands just now.

331
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,920
And the

332
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,800
No.9 land is in them.

333
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
I have already promised them.

334
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,520
Japanese?

335
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,320
Why did they get involved too?

336
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
Who knows?

337
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,800
So what to do now?

338
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,840
If you promise one,

339
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,560
the other will surely be offended.

340
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,000
Miss,

341
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,320
a call from the government

342
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,680
told us that

343
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,440
No.9,

344
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
No.10 and No.11 land

345
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,200
will be auctioned

346
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,920
at the City Hall

347
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,240
in seven days.

348
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,440
Auction?

349
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,040
Didn't Mayor Bai promise us

350
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,560
that he would sell these three lands to us?

351
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,360
Something must have happened.

352
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,240
Documents about the auction

353
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,320
have been formally issued.

354
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,120
There's no way to change it.

355
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,480
How to?

356
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,560
The auction

357
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,400
is open to people from all walks of life.

358
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,840
The main items are these lands.

359
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,600
The rest

360
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,960
are some antiques and shops.

361
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
Old fox!

362
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,640
It seems that someone

363
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
wants to compete with us for these lands.

364
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,320
Prepare the money now.

365
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,600
Yes.

366
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,480
Shop No. 10 on Shunyuan South Street.

367
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
120,000 first!

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,120
120,000 second!

369
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,000
Last chance!

370
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,000
3.

371
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,360
2.

372
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,720
1.

373
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,880
Shop No.10 is sold at the price

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,640
120,000 to the bidder No.4!

375
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,160
Congratulations!

376
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,480
Alright.

377
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,320
Next lot!

378
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,720
This one

379
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
is very special.

380
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,920
I think you have been waiting for it for so long.

381
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes!

382
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,720
This is the No.5 lot!

383
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,560
You can look at the catalogue.

384
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,840
The No.5 lot

385
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
is at a good location with a large area.

386
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
It's a hot item at this auction.

387
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,200
We'll start at 50,000,

388
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,480
and every bid should be more than 2,000.

389
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,080
Now let's start!

390
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,800
No.41, 52,000.

391
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,200
No.88, 54,000.

392
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,120
No.63, 56,000.

393
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,440
No.18, 58,000.

394
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,920
Any more bids?

395
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,120
Anyone?

396
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,920
Any?

397
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,000
This is a bundle of the three lands.

398
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,480
And market value

399
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,960
of each of them is more than 30,000.

400
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
It's a good chance!

401
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,800
It's a good chance!

402
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,960
Any more bids?

403
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,880
Anyone?

404
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,080
100,000!

405
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,560
No.75 gives 100,000!

406
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,960
Any higher bids?

407
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,240
Anyone?

408
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
100,000 first!

409
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,840
What about us?

410
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,320
100,000 second!

411
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
No.44 gives 102,000!

412
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
No.44, 102,000!

413
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,440
110,000!

414
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,560
No.75 gives 110,000!

415
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,720
110,000!

416
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
Any higher bids?

417
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Any more?

418
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,720
No.44!

419
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
112,000!

420
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,440
112,000!

421
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,400
150,000!

422
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,200
150,000!

423
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
No.75 gives 150,000!

424
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,160
150,000!

425
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,000
Any higher bids?

426
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,080
No?

427
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,240
150,000 first!

428
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,960
Wait a second.

429
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,880
150,000 second!

430
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,480
Last…

431
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
200,000!

432
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
200,000!

433
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,320
200,000!

434
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
No.44 gives 200,000!

435
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,120
Any more bids?

436
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,480
Looks like we don't have to do it anymore.

437
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,560
Any more bids?

438
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,480
Miss,

439
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,960
our deposit is not enough.

440
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
200,000 first!

441
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,880
200,000 second!

442
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,800
Last chance!

443
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
3, 2, 1!

444
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,320
No.9, No.10 and

445
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,360
No.12 land at the suburb

446
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,920
are sold at the price 200,000

447
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,600
to the bidder No.44!

448
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,760
Congratulations!

449
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,320
This is the end of this auction.

450
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,640
Thanks for your coming!

451
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Lord Chengrui!

452
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,240
Congratulations on

453
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,600
buying these three lands with 200,000.

454
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,880
This is a big deal in Shunyuan.

455
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
Lord is so generous!

456
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,640
That's nothing.

457
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,960
And I should thank for your help.

458
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,880
I wonder what you will do with them.

459
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,440
For some business?

460
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,280
I don't know yet.

461
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,440
I want to ask you

462
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,960
for your advice.

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,400
Stop kidding me.

464
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,160
You spent 200,000 on it.

465
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,760
You must have your own purpose.

466
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,240
Why did you ask me?

467
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,000
To be honest, I know nothing about them.

468
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,040
I came today because

469
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,800
I heard that

470
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,560
Oda Xianrong from the COC

471
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,240
wants to get these lands intensely.

472
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,800
And you, Shunyuan COC

473
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,320
is also interested in them.

474
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
I belong to the lost Qing Dynasty.

475
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,520
And I was too idle

476
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,480
to run a business,

477
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,040
not like you,

478
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,520
a business elite.

479
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,080
If you could

480
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
help me with these three lands,

481
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,040
and make some difficulties for the Japanese,

482
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,840
I would like to cooperate with you.

483
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,680
This is not a good place for talking.

484
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,840
Lord,

485
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,920
please.

486
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,600
Although news from Rong Mansion

487
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,000
said that her ladyship died of illness,

488
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,040
it must have something to do with Oda Xianrong.

489
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,040
If that's true,

490
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
then maybe we could

491
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,320
trust Lord's words.

492
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,840
Rong Mansion is rich and generous.

493
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,840
As for money,

494
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,920
none of us and the Japanese can fight against him.

495
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,920
And Lord Chengrui has studied abroad

496
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,480
and is open-minded,

497
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,280
who is different

498
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
from those

499
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,240
stubborn people who always want to

500
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,000
restore Qing Dynasty.

501
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,840
Except for these three lands,

502
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,440
he even paid 300,000 for the mining.

503
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,640
He is so sincere.

504
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,400
Compared with the Japanese,

505
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,320
he is already on our side.

506
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,320
Mine construction and mining are not that easy,

507
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
and we have no technician,

508
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,200
and no equipment,

509
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,520
although we temporarily get the lands,

510
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,920
there is still a lot to do.

511
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,160
Gu Yanzhen's father

512
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,400
transported a batch of equipments

513
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,680
for our early exploration.

514
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,400
Professor He of Peking University

515
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,000
introduced several experts to me in this field

516
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,280
and wrote us the recommendation letter.

517
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,040
We'll set off

518
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
early tomorrow morning

519
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,160
and visit them one by one.

520
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,400
We must invite them over.

521
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,080
As for the Academy,

522
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,000
I have talked to Director Guo.

523
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,280
OK.

524
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,560
Wish us a success.

525
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,560
This matter

526
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,680
is too important

527
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,160
for both our family

528
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,200
and our country.

529
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,400
Junshan!

530
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,400
You're back.

531
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,200
Are you going out?

532
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,840
Where are you going?

533
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,520
Let me send you to there.

534
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,720
Don't bother.

535
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,880
I will go with Gu Yanzhen.

536
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,120
I haven't seen you much lately.

537
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,880
I'm doing something for my family.

538
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,040
About the graphite mine?

539
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,160
Did you start?

540
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,560
Almost.

541
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,080
The machines will arrive this afternoon.

542
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Didn't Gu Yanzhen tell you?

543
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,760
He also has shares.

544
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
He said he didn't want to care about this.

545
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,400
I'm leaving now.

546
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,360
Bye.

547
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,440
Professor Chen,

548
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,080
you must be tired.

549
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,760
Professor Wu,

550
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,560
welcome!

551
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,400
OK.

552
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,520
Let's go.

553
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,240
This way.

554
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,760
Please.

555
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,920
This is Chen Yue and Wu Jinzhi?

556
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,240
Yes,

557
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,040
both of them

558
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,600
came back from England,

559
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,360
and are Mr. Matsumoto's classmates.

560
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
They are famous in the field of geology.

561
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Mr. Matsumoto

562
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,840
recommended them in particular.

563
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,360
We sent people to invite them for several times,

564
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,000
but they all refused.

565
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Unexpectedly,

566
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,320
they went to Shen Family.

567
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,480
Mr. Miyazawa said

568
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,040
if they can't

569
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,160
work for us,

570
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
then they don't have to exist.

571
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,800
Professor.

572
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,680
Get on the car.

573
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,120
Professor Chen,

574
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,720
Mrs. Chen,

575
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,760
today is the New Year's Day.

576
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
We want to invite you for dinner.

577
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,320
OK.

578
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Thank you.

579
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:47,960
Come on.

580
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,800
Watch out!

581
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,360
Come on!

582
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,960
Follow me!

583
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,880
Professor, are you OK?

584
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm fine.

585
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,080
How is it?

586
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,560
Everything all right?

587
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,120
That's fine.

588
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,000
It's not safe here.

589
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,440
Get on first.

590
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,360
Hurry, I'll drive.

591
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,160
Hurry up!

592
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,960
Go!

593
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,400
Come on!

594
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,760
You got the tomatoes on sticks.

595
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,560
Happy now?

596
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes.

597
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,680
That's great.

598
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Dad,

599
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,880
the sugar falls on my hand.

600
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,440
Really?

601
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:18,920
Come here,

602
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,000
let me help you.

603
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,360
Let me see…

604
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,520
OK.

605
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,560
Let's go.

606
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,360
Only a few words.

607
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,360
I'll leave after that.

608
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,360
The three lands you got

609
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,840
are really important to me.

610
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,160
And if they are in your hands,

611
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,840
it's not good

612
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,200
for both of you

613
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,600
and the Rong Mansion.

614
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,000
Are you threatening me?

615
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,800
You can think so.

616
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,200
If you are willing to sell them to me,

617
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,040
I could pay you double the price.

618
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,880
I'm not.

619
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,600
You should know,

620
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,600
in order to get these lands,

621
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
we will do whatever it takes,

622
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,520
regardless of the consequences.

623
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,040
Not only our COC,

624
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,760
also the Japanese military.

625
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,880
You can't stop that.

626
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,520
If I don't give you,

627
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,400
what would you do?

628
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,080
You want to know what

629
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,080
I would do?

630
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,360
Yes.

631
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,440
But the more I want to know

632
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,280
is how black your heart is now.

633
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,560
I will give you three days

634
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,240
to think about it.

635
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,720
You'd better persuade him.

636
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,880
Lord.

637
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,190
Dad, let's go.

638
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,920
Lord!

639
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,880
- Chengrui! - Lord!

640
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,710
Chengrui!

641
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,960
- Lord! - Chengrui!

642
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,880
Lord!

643
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,000
What's wrong?

644
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,080
Chengrui!

645
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,400
Chengrui!

646
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,960
Chengrui!

647
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,360
- Chengrui! Hang in there! - Lord.

648
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,560
- Chengrui! - Lord!

649
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,520
Chengrui!

650
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,320
Chengrui!

651
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,600
My Lord!

652
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,040
My Lord!

653
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,320
My Lord!

654
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,440
Lord!

655
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,960
Ms. Oda,

656
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,080
we meet again.

657
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,080
You have

658
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
been trying to kill them for a long time.

659
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,360
And now they have unknowingly become the

660
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,880
obstacles for you and General Miyazawa.

661
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,000
We used to be master and servant,

662
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,360
and we haven't seen each other for a while.

663
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,080
Just treat them as the gift to you.

664
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Now I'm an officer in General

665
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,560
Miyazawa's troop.

666
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,680
We will often meet later.

667
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,200
See you.

668
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,320
Strengthen the protection to the professors.

669
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,080
If the machines broke down,

670
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
go order a new batch of them.

671
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,000
We lost a lot on the mine.

672
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,080
There were many workers and machines.

673
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,960
We also have been there.

674
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,040
As for the professors,

675
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm afraid that we can't care about both of them.

676
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,700
How about…

677
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,680
You don't worry about this.

678
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,680
I'll figure it out by myself.

679
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,040
Tingbai! Junshan!

680
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,520
Bad news from Rong Mansion!

681
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,560
Gu Yanzhen, from the Gu Family,

682
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,800
is here to worship.

683
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,360
The old Lord

684
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,200
was always kind

685
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,560
to everyone

686
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,720
in Shunyuan city.

687
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,040
I never heard that

688
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,240
he ever offended anyone.

689
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,480
If he

690
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,080
hadn't been framed this time,

691
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,040
he wouldn't have ended like this.

692
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
Forget it.

693
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,640
Forget?

694
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,240
We all are the old servants in the Mansion.

695
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,960
If it hadn't been the Lord and her ladyship,

696
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,220
each of us

697
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,080
would have been homeless with a miserable life.

698
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,800
Now the Lord's family

699
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,080
was framed.

700
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,040
Are we who have received

701
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,080
his favor not brave enough

702
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,760
to stand out and speak for them?

703
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,280
The Qing Dynasty has fallen,

704
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
and why didn't you, slaves of Qing Dynasty,

705
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
all die?

706
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm not a slave of Qing Dynasty!

707
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm one of Lord's servants!

708
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Without the Lord,

709
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,760
there would be no me today!

710
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,400
Today!

711
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,440
Today in front of Lord and Lord Chengrui!

712
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,800
I, Pei Shun!

713
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,320
This is not done yet!

714
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,080
Mr. Shen,

715
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
tell me,

716
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,000
what did the old Lord and Lord Chengrui

717
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,080
die of?

718
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,880
Captain He of the police station is here.

719
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,080
You shouldn't ask me

720
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,320
about this question.

721
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,560
I want you to tell me.

722
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,240
Lord Chengrui and the old Lord

723
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,000
died of the gunshots.

724
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,480
Gunshots?

725
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,760
Gunshots?

726
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,080
I'm asking you

727
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
what did they die for?

728
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,560
Who killed them?

729
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,400
The Chairman of Japanese COC,

730
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,480
Ms. Oda Xianrong is here.

731
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,520
Stop there!

732
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,000
Xianrong.

733
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,800
You can't leave like this!

734
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,240
I want to know,

735
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,040
whether the old Lord and her ladyship,

736
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,440
and Lord Chengrui

737
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,120
were killed by you?

738
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,240
What if

739
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,680
it's me?

740
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,240
What if

741
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,800
it's not me?

742
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,220
If you did this,

743
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,240
I'll risk my life

744
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,640
to get the revenge on you!

745
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,720
Then have a try.

746
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,240
You!
