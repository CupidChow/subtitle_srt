00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,580
Episode 15

4
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Junshan?

5
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,160
Liangchen?

6
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,280
Why are you here?

7
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,729
I should ask you.

8
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,930
Why are you dressing like this?

9
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
Someone came to make troubles.

10
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
The waiters were hurt.

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
Qu Manting asked us to help.

12
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,759
And you?

13
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,759
I am a guest.

14
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,680
Yeah.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,680
I almost forget

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,080
that you know Qu Manting.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,090
She is the fiancée of your brother.

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,890
Look how stupid I am.

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
What are you happily talking about?

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,880
Get your hands off me.

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,920
Do you forget why you are here?

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,639
Go to serve these guests.

23
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,110
Stop gossiping here.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,360
Go.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
See you later.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,960
It doesn't look good

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
that a girl is too close

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,520
with a man.

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,800
You know I am girl.

30
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,880
Why don't you go far away from me?

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,079
It's different.

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,650
We are close friends

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,640
who are living together.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
What rubbish are you talking about?

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
What?

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,500
Haven't they arrived?

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,890
The man has gone to pick them up.

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,450
They are still not back.

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,800
Why are you standing here stupidly?

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,660
Do you forget how Zhang Yuzhi die?

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,240
What's wrong?

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,960
We sent someone to pick up Mr. Zhang's son.

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,620
But they haven't arrived now.

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,890
How long has he gone?

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,760
He left in the afternoon.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,930
What's the address?

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,720
Room 16, Wencheng Building, Siping Street, the South City.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Junshan,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
don't go alone.

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,660
Take more people with you.

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,840
Junshan.

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm talking to you.

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,400
Don't go alone.

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,930
You never know what they...

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
Dad, why are you here?

56
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,960
Wait for a while. I'll talk to you later.

57
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,880
I also have other things.

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Pack up your things and go home with me.

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,000
Go home?

60
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,280
I have a charity show.

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,340
What charity show?

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,040
You are being used by Shen Tingbai.

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,170
You don't know that?

64
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,540
You quite like him, don't you?

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,200
You hope I marry him, don't you?

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,800
The situation is different now.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
It was not him who made the burst.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,880
I know.

69
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,170
But whether he is the criminal,

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,120
you shouldn't be involved.

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,520
This is his own business.

72
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
Many people died.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,120
Don't you know the background of his rival?

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,480
You are risking your life for

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,240
you let yourself be involved.

76
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,120
Dad.

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,760
Stop here.

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,800
Go with me.

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,320
Dad.

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,120
I know you do this for my good.

81
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,180
But I have grown up.

82
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,120
This was not made

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
by Shen Tingbai in any case.

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,120
I can distinguish the right from the wrong.

85
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
You go home alone.

86
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Manting.

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
First, thank you for coming.

88
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,780
I am so sorry for

89
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,090
I can't offer you a better service.

90
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,040
Since before this feast,

91
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,320
some gangsters broke

92
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,200
all things that we prepared.

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
Their intention is obvious,

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,730
which is interfering this charity feast.

95
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,320
But with the help of the students from

96
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,280
the Arsenal Military Academy and the Xinhua Girls School

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,880
and people from all walks of life,

98
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,120
this feast can be held on the date.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Now, let's show your appreciation for

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,200
their kindness with our applause.

101
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,700
I will be exposed by Gu Yanzhen sooner and later.

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,159
Get out of the way.

103
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,920
Shen Junshan,

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
are you all right?

105
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm all right.

106
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Go there to check.

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,320
OK.

108
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
I think you must have heard of

109
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,800
the tragedies that happened recently.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,920
To comfort the family of the victims,

111
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,560
I specially invited

112
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Shen Tingbai from Shunyuan COC,

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Xu Jianqiao from Shanxi COC,

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,400
and Liu Wenbo from Sichuan COC

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,600
to hold this charity feast with me.

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Here,

117
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,000
I would like to appreciate

118
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,080
the donation of theirs and yours.

119
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,120
The money raised tonight

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,320
will be donated to the victims' family.

121
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,240
Hope this can give comfort and warmness

122
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,000
to their hurtful heart.

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,080
Miss Qu.

124
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Base on the evidence that we have,

125
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,920
as the suspect,

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Mr. Shen holds the feast and donates

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,400
to the victims' family.

128
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,640
Does he try to cover the crime that he did

129
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,170
and win the public support?

130
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,400
I think everyone sitting here

131
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,880
is doubtful about this.

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
I don't know who the criminal is,

133
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,560
but I'm sure that

134
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,480
it can't be Shen Tingbai.

135
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,560
Do you have any evidence to

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
prove what you said?

137
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,560
Is that only because of your relationship,

138
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
you trust him without a reason?

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
Before we start our feast,

140
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,780
I would like to introduce two important guests.

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,640
This is Captain He from the police station.

142
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,000
My name is He Lvming.

143
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,120
Through the anatomy of Wu Bin's body,

144
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,530
the time when he died has been cleared.

145
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,740
We're sure that

146
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,030
Wu Bin had died before

147
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,549
he appeared at the door of the press.

148
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,400
Everybody.

149
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,640
Everybody, please think of that.

150
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,000
How could a dead man

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,760
crawl to the press

152
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,080
to report Mr. Shen?

153
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,800
Captain He.

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,850
Although the scene was forged,

155
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,400
it can't prove that

156
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,530
the letter that Wu Bin took was forged.

157
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,760
Maybe Wu Bin's friend took

158
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,520
his body to the press

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,960
and falsified the scene

160
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,820
to make the report successfully.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,160
You have a very good imagination.

162
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
We can't deny that

163
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,480
what I said is possible.

164
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,600
And

165
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,960
how can we prove that

166
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,360
you have not been bought

167
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,560
and your words are true?

168
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
Someone

169
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
prefers to believe a

170
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,160
trafficker with a lot of sin

171
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,520
rather than believe the police.

172
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
If so, I have nothing to say.

173
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,560
Next,

174
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
I'll introduce our second important guest,

175
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
Zhang Haoran, from Minduo News,

176
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,760
the son of Zhang Yuzhi's.

177
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,040
Welcome.

178
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
Good evening, everyone.

179
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,320
I'm Zhang Haoran,

180
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,520
the son of Zhang Yuzhi.

181
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,560
First,

182
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,680
let me apologize to a friend.

183
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Just now

184
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,240
when we were on our way,

185
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,240
the driver died in a gun-shooting.

186
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,920
He died for me.

187
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
So,

188
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm so grieved for this.

189
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,240
Everybody,

190
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,320
I promise you,

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,560
in the name of my father,

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,800
what I will be saying

193
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
is totally true.

194
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,560
If I tell a lie,

195
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,760
my father can't rest in peace

196
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,480
in another world.

197
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,460
The other night, my father

198
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,760
came back with a long face, telling me

199
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,360
he met the chairman of Shunyuan COC.

200
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,560
Shen Tingbai…

201
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,160
I know from my father that Mr. Shen

202
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
does have evidence to prove his innocence.

203
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,840
My father did everything carefully.

204
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,920
He might know that he did something wrong.

205
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,580
But luckily, there was a chance to make up for it.

206
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,520
Thinking of my father's words,

207
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,720
I guess he

208
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,240
knew it was not Mr. Shen

209
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,960
who committed the crime.

210
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,340
So he wanted to write to claim for him.

211
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,500
Unexpectedly,

212
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,560
he was murdered on the way

213
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,840
to the press the next day.

214
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,120
Mr. Zhang,

215
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,160
you didn't see the article that your father

216
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,490
wrote to claim for Chairman Shen, did you?

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,480
No.

218
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,280
So how can you be sure that

219
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,760
your father was disturbed because

220
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
Chairman Shen was misunderstood,

221
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,040
and be sure that his death

222
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
was not because of

223
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,160
Chairman Shen's revenge?

224
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I have a normal ability of judgment.

225
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,860
The son knows his father best.

226
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,810
My father did nothing immoral in his life,

227
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,140
so few things made him guilty and unease.

228
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,120
Today, I am standing here

229
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,600
and telling you this

230
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,360
to comfort the soul of my father.

231
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,480
What I said is totally true.

232
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
Everything in the world can prove that.

233
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,620
Haoran, go back to have a rest.

234
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,560
Everybody,

235
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
you know that it was

236
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,840
the policemen who destroyed

237
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,560
the organization of Wu Bin and

238
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
rescued the trapped labors.

239
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,120
But you may not know that

240
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,120
students of the seventh season from

241
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,980
Arsenal Military Academy took part in this action.

242
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
And the bravest one was

243
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,440
Shen Tingbai's brother,

244
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Shen Junshan.

245
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,680
He rushed to the forefront

246
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,040
and almost was killed by Wu Bin.

247
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,400
He was also sent to hospital after the action.

248
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,480
The doctors, nurses,

249
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,400
the teachers and students of

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
the Arsenal Military Academy

251
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,960
can prove this.

252
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
If Wu Bin's organization belongs to the Shens,

253
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,240
Shen Junshan had no reason to risk his life.

254
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,120
You may say that

255
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,960
Shen Junshan might

256
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
know nothing about this

257
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,360
or he just pretended in front of others.

258
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,480
Sir,

259
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,520
faced with these evidence,

260
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,600
you are persistent in what you think.

261
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
Could you tell me why?

262
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,680
Are you bought by the real criminal

263
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,960
to lead the comments

264
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,640
and vilify the innocent?

265
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,600
Now,

266
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,160
we are at a sensitive time,

267
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
but there are someone holding self-opinion,

268
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
helping the evil to fight against the good.

269
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,090
However, evils cannot be successful.

270
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,280
No matter how many tricks

271
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,960
that they use,

272
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,960
a lot of people

273
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,970
like Captain He,

274
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Mr. Zhang Zhiyu

275
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,480
and you who are with breath of vision

276
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,040
cannot be cheated by

277
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,200
such illogical intrigues.

278
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,360
I believe that

279
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
the truth will be uncovered one day,

280
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,240
and the family of the victims will

281
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,170
get the justice.

282
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,920
Evil cannot survive

283
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,960
at somewhere is

284
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,240
under justice.

285
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,680
Shen Junshan,

286
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,520
do you still have a headache?

287
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I just feel dizzy.

288
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
Got hurt?

289
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,000
Shen Junshan,

290
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,600
your brother is not the murderer, right?

291
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,640
Of course not.

292
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,240
Everything is possible.

293
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
Why are you looking at me?

294
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,200
Why are you looking at me?

295
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,560
How can you prove

296
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,930
what you say without evidence?

297
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,040
And you?

298
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,440
Why should others believe you?

299
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,760
A mean thought.

300
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,680
Is this OK?

301
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,400
OK.

302
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,760
Please be quick.

303
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,600
Miss Qu.

304
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,120
Miss Qu.

305
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,320
Excuse me.

306
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,640
I believe what you said.

307
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,040
I also think

308
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,000
Mr. Shen is innocent.

309
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,680
Thank you.

310
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,800
Go ahead.

311
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
I know your following word is "but".

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,280
Yes, that's right.

313
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,120
But…

314
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,960
I want to say that

315
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,640
you did these

316
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,680
only because of these evidences?

317
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,680
Or because

318
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,880
Mr. Shen and you are in a relationship,

319
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,560
you come out to clarify it?

320
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,640
Please don't misunderstand.

321
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,120
I won't doubt everything

322
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,840
only because

323
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,560
you admit.

324
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,880
I may disappoint you.

325
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,640
Mr. Shen is outstanding.

326
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,600
Many ladies admire him.

327
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,440
I don't have the idea

328
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,720
who will be lucky enough

329
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,109
to marry him.

330
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
But I'm sure that person is not me.

331
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,310
Since I have my loved one already.

332
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,720
Could you tell me

333
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,109
who the person is?

334
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,109
OK.

335
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,400
Gu Yanzhen!

336
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
Chop, chop.

337
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,400
See you.

338
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,120
See you.

339
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,720
Sorry.

340
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,640
No worries.

341
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,720
Come here.

342
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,040
What?

343
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,600
What's wrong with you?

344
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
What do you mean?

345
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,200
Didn't I perform well?

346
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,320
Those journalists were silent.

347
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,380
I don't ask you about this.

348
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,500
What do you want to ask?

349
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
I mean...

350
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,530
I want to know...

351
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,360
Well...

352
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,080
What you want to ask is

353
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,040
why I told them my crush on you.

354
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,360
Just ask what you want to know.

355
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,080
Don't be shy like a girl.

356
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,680
That's what I mean.

358
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,160
Why?

359
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,120
What?

360
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,000
I said what I thought.

361
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,930
I just told them when they asked me.

362
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,880
Stop talking nonsense.

363
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,200
This is an excuse to avoid others

364
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,280
talking gossips about Shen Tingbai.

365
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Gu Yanzhen, mind your words.

366
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,570
Do you have conscience?

367
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,640
Liangchen.

368
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,080
Do we need to tell Gu Yanzhen

369
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
that we go back?

370
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,080
He did a favour for me.

371
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,400
It's not necessary to tell him.

372
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,280
He is busy enough with his own business.

373
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,200
Let's go.

374
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,320
When did I take my feeling casually?

375
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,440
Do I need to tell a lie?

376
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,560
You are a girl.

377
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,120
Can you be a little reserved?

378
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Although you really think so,

379
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,760
you can't tell it in public...

380
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,690
Is there anything wrong in public?

381
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,000
When we first met,

382
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
you carried me off in public

383
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,860
and you patted my butt.

384
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,800
But I am a man.

385
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,330
What advantage do you have?

386
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,410
I can do everything that you can do.

387
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,720
OK. You are great.

388
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,520
You have crush on me.

389
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,880
I really appreciate it.

390
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,810
You are welcome.

391
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,960
But sorry.

392
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't have crush on you.

393
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,760
This is the end.

394
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,760
OK? Bye.

395
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,920
That's enough, Gu Yanzhen.

396
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,040
Don't go too far.

397
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
It's not interesting to play hard-to-get.

398
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,090
End on good note.

399
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
You think I'm playing hard-to-get?

400
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Aren't you clear?

401
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,500
Which man does not like me?

402
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,320
Look at what you are doing.

403
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,560
Play hard-to-get.

404
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,560
And then?

405
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,860
Then what she said?

406
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,120
Then she said

407
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,130
how could there be a man that does not like her.

408
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,040
Gu Yanzhen.

409
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,000
Now you realize

410
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,680
how horrifying when a person is narcissistic.

411
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah.

412
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,080
Xie Liangchen.

413
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,040
Why do I think you are talking about me?

414
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,180
Congratulations! You are right.

415
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
How can I be same as her?

416
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,920
What's your difference?

417
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
We are different.

418
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,320
Gosh!

419
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,800
I feel my reputation and honesty

420
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,120
have gone far from me.

421
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,160
Reputation and honesty?

422
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,480
Are you sure that you have them?

423
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,800
Gu Yanzhen.

424
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,480
We have had a deal.

425
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,640
I take care of your daily life.

426
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,820
And you keep the secret for me.

427
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,000
I have been doing so

428
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,640
since the very beginning.

429
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,960
Blather.

430
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,720
Xie Liangchen.

431
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,720
Junshan.

432
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,010
Are you going to take water?

433
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Thank you for saving me again

434
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,080
at Paramo last night.

435
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,080
Yes.

436
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,360
Recently, I've been saving you.

437
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,600
Yes.

438
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,680
I think so.

439
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,520
I've been

440
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,480
encountering various unlucky things.

441
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,520
Whether do you think I should

442
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,320
pray and get a amulet at a temple?

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You need to.

444
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,080
I'll go to take water now.

445
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,720
Liangchen.

446
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,720
How are you?

447
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,240
Have you seen Li Wenzhong?

448
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,360
No.

449
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,720
Is someone here?

450
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,920
I want meat.

451
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm so hungry.

452
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,680
Is someone here?

453
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,800
The exam will be concluded.

454
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,920
You have completed the

455
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,090
physical fitness exam.

456
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
The knowledge exam is in 3 days.

457
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,100
So you have three-day's break to prepare it.

458
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,200
Hope you

459
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,840
make the most of this break,

460
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,090
reviewing the knowledge to

461
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,760
get a good result at the end of this year.

462
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,560
Do you hear it?

463
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,840
Yes, sir.

464
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
The class is over.

465
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,560
Thank you, sir.

466
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,920
Why are you sighing again?

467
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,520
I will fail this time.

468
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
Why are you always saying that?

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,440
You have been working hard, haven't you?

470
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,760
Does that work?

471
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,480
I spent a whole night to

472
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,080
memorize these.

473
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,680
But I forget them after a sleep.

474
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,840
Don't worry.

475
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,600
I'll help you on this.

476
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
You will pass undoubtedly.

477
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,640
Hopefully.

478
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,240
What?

479
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,300
Don't you trust me?

480
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,680
I trust you,

481
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,760
but I don't trust myself.

482
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
I also don't trust myself.

483
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,480
I don't have a good memory.

484
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,960
I also need your help.

485
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,160
Go to find Miss Qu for help.

486
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,900
I don't have that time.

487
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,560
Are you jealous?

488
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,120
Look at him.

489
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,000
Who is jealous?

490
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,540
Liangchen.

491
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,920
Do you like that super star?

492
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,240
You are dating Xiaojun, right?

493
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,400
Who likes her?

494
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm telling you, he doesn't like her.

495
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,840
He likes me.

496
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,960
Can't you see it?

497
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,200
Gets your hands off me. Ignore him.

498
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,160
Why are you shy?

499
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,440
Huang Song is not a stranger.

500
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,800
You can say it straightly.

501
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,480
Are you crazy, Gu Yanzhen?

502
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,720
I can't put up with the way

503
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
of your conversation.

504
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
We are men.

505
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
I'll leave now. See you.

506
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,200
Song.

507
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,880
Wait. Wait me.

508
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,640
What?

509
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
Don't come back late.

510
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,530
Get out of my way.

511
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,640
Pervert!

512
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,640
Why is Gu Yanzhen so weird?

513
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,800
He is always like that.

514
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,000
I can't pass the final.

515
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,000
Please stop talking the cliché.

516
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You look such upset

517
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
but we haven't taken our exam.

518
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,680
Also,

519
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,140
does it matter if you fail?

520
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,600
Your physical fitness exam's mark is high.

521
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,760
The sergeant won't punish you

522
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,200
even if you fail the knowledge exam.

523
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,880
Forget it.

524
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,170
What you say is reasonable,

525
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,960
but I...

526
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
There is no "but".

527
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,680
I treat you some delicious food.

528
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,800
Forget the exam for a while.

529
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,640
What food?

530
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,280
You decide.

531
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,000
Nice.

532
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,680
Zhu Yanlin.

533
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,480
What's wrong?

534
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,100
It's Wenzhong.

535
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,800
He is locked in the utility room.

536
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,240
I want meat.

537
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,400
It's been several days that he doesn't have food.

538
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,480
When I found him... - Water.

539
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,410
...he was dying.

540
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,160
I'm so hungry.

541
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,840
What are you waiting for?

542
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,600
Save him.

543
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,800
Go. Go.

544
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,960
I have to stop our talk

545
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,290
and go there to check it.

546
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,580
He hasn't eaten for several days.

547
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,480
Pity.

548
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
That's miraculous.

549
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,360
He's still alive.

550
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Xie Liangchen!

551
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,400
Qu Manting. - Super star.

552
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,320
Follow me.

553
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,250
Do you come to me?

554
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,640
Wait.

555
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,480
For what?

556
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,600
None of your business.

557
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
Liangchen. Very important thing.

558
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,440
Why can't you talk to me here?

559
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,900
I have to tell you outside.

560
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,200
Song.

561
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,820
Don't get too close with a man.

562
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,280
My dinner, Liangchen?

563
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,120
You took me here,

564
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,120
so what's your important thing?

565
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,720
I have a question.

566
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,560
You have to tell me the truth.

567
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,840
Go ahead.

568
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,020
What do you think of me?

569
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,880
You?

570
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,800
Quite good.

571
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,200
Say something specific.

572
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,680
Am I sexy?

573
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,360
Am I cute?

574
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,000
Am I charming?

575
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,010
Speak straightforwardly,

576
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,560
do you like me?

577
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,680
I don't mean the feeling between friends.

578
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,210
I mean that between lovers.

579
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,360
I mean love and crush.

580
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,960
Do I like you?

581
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,760
Are you crazy?

582
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,920
I understand you.

583
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,320
Facing a girl like me,

584
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,560
you may be shy and you are afraid

585
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,800
that we can't even be friends if I refuse you.

586
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,480
Right?

587
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,360
You think too much.

588
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,520
I can answer you now.

589
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,680
I only take you as an ordinary friend.

590
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I never think of something that way.

591
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,780
You are not honest.

592
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,330
OK. I'll ask you in another way.

593
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,170
Which kind of girls do you like?

594
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,200
Which kind of girls do I like?

595
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,280
What?

596
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,210
What on earth do you want to ask?

597
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,440
These are

598
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,640
the girls who I sought for you.

599
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,760
Have a look.

600
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,650
Is there someone that you like?

601
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
The first one.

602
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,360
She has white skin,

603
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,200
big eyes,

604
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,740
and cherry-like lips.

605
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,620
The most important is that

606
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,640
she has a good figure.

607
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,560
Does she make you feel

608
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,760
a warmness like that from mother?

609
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,440
No, I don't like.

610
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,400
I can see it.

611
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,840
Next.

612
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,800
Look at her slim figure.

613
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,800
She can perform Lin Daiyu

614
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,760
if she changes her clothes.

615
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,480
Do you like the skinny girl?

616
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,160
Qu Manting.

617
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,000
Could you stop it?

618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,280
You don't like her. Next one.

619
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,800
This girl

620
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,340
looks thin, but

621
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,240
you can feel her chubbiness when touching.

622
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,500
Do you like this style?

623
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,160
Good to touch.

624
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,890
Enjoy your game.

625
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,680
See you.

626
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Stop!

627
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,840
Go back.

628
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,480
You are too picky.

629
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,480
None of them is your cup of tea?

630
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,840
What do you want exactly?

631
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,720
I just want to know

632
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,160
what kind of girls you like.

633
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,400
What kind of girls I like?

634
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,120
It's none of your business.

635
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,600
Of course it's my business!

636
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,240
Don't waste my time.

637
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,200
Come back.

638
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,250
You don't like me, and you don't like them.

639
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,280
Why?

640
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,360
Tell me why?

641
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,360
Why don't you look them

642
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,480
when they are dressing that way?

643
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,720
This is not the reaction of

644
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,960
a normal man, is it?

645
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,360
What do you mean?

646
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,080
I think I have known why.

647
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,680
It is impossible that a man doesn't like me.

648
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,840
Otherwise...

649
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,000
Unless what?

650
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,400
Unless you don't like girls.

651
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,040
I don't know what you are saying.

652
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,770
I'm leaving.

653
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,900
Xie Liangchen!

654
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,100
I won't waste time talking to you.

655
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,740
Stop laughing. You have lost your voice.

656
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Do you have to laugh while I am angry?

657
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,960
What? Why are you angry?

658
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,920
It's better than suspecting

659
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,320
you are girl.

660
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,400
But I think

661
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,880
her thought may be right.

662
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,440
Since when facing such thing,

663
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,200
women's instinct is exactly right.

664
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,000
What is right?

665
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,280
Look.

666
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,800
You are not a man.

667
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
And Gu Yanzhen knows it, right?

668
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,800
But he doesn't give away your secret.

669
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,600
You also said

670
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,160
he helped you many times.

671
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,290
What does this mean?

672
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,600
He loves you.

673
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Are you insane?

674
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,220
He's blackmailing me to help him.

675
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,360
Only you believe such excuse.

676
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,820
I don't believe it anyway.

677
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,480
That's impossible.

678
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,610
He always bullies me and treats me bad.

679
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,080
Some people are silly.

680
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,160
They bully the one who they like,

681
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,320
which is like little boys

682
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,640
always pull little girls' hair.

683
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,280
Do you know why?

684
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,340
They are trying to attract the girls.

685
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,940
Don't blather.

686
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,240
Whatever.

687
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,880
But

688
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,040
you shouldn't come back

689
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,800
after you go back

690
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,760
during this winter break.

691
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,400
What if

692
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,130
your real identity is exposed?

693
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000
If I leave without a word,

694
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
the consequence will be worse

695
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,500
when the school investigates it.

696
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,320
It's Qu Manting.

697
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm leaving now.

698
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,000
Where are you going?

699
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm scared of her.

700
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,480
Give me a cup of water. I tell you something.

701
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,880
You will tell me even if I don't give you.

702
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,240
I have fallen in love.

703
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,640
Is your one-side love?

704
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,200
Who told you?

705
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,960
He does like me.

706
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,040
He's just playing hard-to-get.

707
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,920
I know it's men's trick.

708
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm really curious about

709
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,330
where your confidence is from.

710
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I was born to be confident.

711
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,760
My confidence makes me a star.

712
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,000
You were born to be narcissistic.

713
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,240
I know clearly

714
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,560
how charming I am.

715
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,480
Song?

716
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,880
Liangchen.

717
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,240
Why don't you go in?

718
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,920
Yanlin is sleeping inside.

719
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,450
I don't want to disturb him.

720
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,080
Why did that star come to you today?

721
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,570
Nothing important.

722
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,560
Song.

723
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,440
Why do you come to the military academy?

724
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,680
You asked me this question, didn't you?

725
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,320
I mean

726
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,180
whether you come on your own will.

727
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,120
This school offers food, drinks

728
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,360
and lessons.

729
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,240
If I can be a general in the future,

730
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
I can take care of my family. So nice.

731
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,890
That's good.

732
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,410
You have a clear aim.

733
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,200
Liangchen. Are you all right?

734
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,240
I'm all right.

735
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,360
I'll go to bed now.

736
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,320
Go on what you are doing.

737
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,250
Don't stay late.

738
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
You owe me a big dinner.

739
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,880
I know.

740
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,600
Zhu Yanlin, let me have a look.

741
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
Let me have a look.

742
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,699
Why do you write so many words?

743
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,360
Get out.

744
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,880
The paper.

745
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Let me have a look.

746
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Let me have a look.

747
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,630
This is cheating.

748
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,520
Are you crazy?

749
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Yes, I am.

750
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,630
Give me.

751
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,400
Well.

752
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,120
Go there.

753
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,360
I'll kill you if you don't give me next time.

754
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,560
Who threw it?

755
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,320
Come out.

756
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,560
Liangchen.

757
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,840
I'll go.

758
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,880
You go now?

759
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,480
My train is leaving at 1 pm.

760
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,140
I need to pick up my little brother at his school.

761
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,680
I'm sorry that you have to go alone.

762
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,740
Are you going to your sister's house?

763
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,280
I'll put the luggage in my car.

764
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Please be quick.

765
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,120
Farewell.

766
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,580
Bring my wishes to your sister's family.

767
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
See you next year.

768
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
See you next year.

769
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,120
Xie Liangchen.

770
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,960
Are you still here?

771
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,760
I'll go later.

772
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,320
OK.

773
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,560
Shen Junshan?

774
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,080
Are you going back to Peking?

775
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,280
When will your train leave?

776
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Half past twelve.

777
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,080
See you.

778
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,840
There is not much time left. I can send you there.

779
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,500
No, thanks.

780
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,890
Gu Yanzhen will send me.

781
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
See you.

782
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,240
Bye.

783
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
The weather looks good today.

784
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,060
Can't you see that?

785
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,520
It's going to snow.

786
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,400
Really?

787
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,040
Thank you for bringing me here.

788
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,120
It seems it's really going to snow.

789
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,800
Be careful on your way back.

790
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,520
Gu Yanzhen.

791
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,000
Thank you.

792
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,440
Happy New Year.

793
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,680
Why am I a little upset?

794
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,700
It must because I didn't have breakfast.

795
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,920
Thank you.

796
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,860
No worries.

797
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,920
Here.

798
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,280
I have some eggs.

799
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,160
Would like one?

800
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,560
No, thanks.

801
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,440
My name is Lin Xianwei.

802
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,080
My name is Xie Liangchen.

803
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,320
Are you also leaving for Peking?

804
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,260
My family is in Peking.

805
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,800
Peking cultivates intellects.

806
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,520
It's a good place.

807
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,730
Our country is wide.

808
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,090
Everywhere is good in our country.

809
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,240
You are right.

810
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Are you a student?

811
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,960
I am a student of Arsenal Military Academy.

812
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,490
Arsenal Military Academy?

813
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,700
Military academy?

814
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,880
You don't look like a student

815
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
of a military academy.

816
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,810
Since you are quite gentle.

817
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Don't be hurried.

818
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,000
Wait a moment.

819
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,360
Chick.

820
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,040
Wait for me.

821
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,640
Chick.

822
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,720
Wait for me. Don't go.
