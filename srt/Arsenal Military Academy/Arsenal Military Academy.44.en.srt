Arsenal Military Academy

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,539
Episode 44

4
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,360
Next time,

5
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,660
- let's go there again. - Yeah.

6
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,160
It's fun.

7
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,090
Let's drink. Together. Together.

8
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,760
Look.

9
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,360
What are you looking at?

10
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,480
What are you looking at?

11
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Never saw a handsome guy?

12
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,760
The restaurant I told you...

13
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,000
The one by the cinema?

14
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Yeah. Their steak is delicious.

15
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,320
Really?

16
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,980
The chicks are pretty.

17
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
What are you doing?

18
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
Come. Come with me.

19
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,480
Go.

20
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,600
Let's go find girls.

21
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,829
Go.

22
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:21,829
Let's go find girls.

23
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,680
Let's go.

24
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,340
Over there.

25
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,120
Over there.

26
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,940
Let me tell you.

27
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,250
Let me tell you. Over there.

28
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,380
Where's Fujiwara Ichiro?

29
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,280
The Suburb. In the suburb.

30
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,680
Specifically.

31
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,120
To the west.

32
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,520
The Nakata warehouse.

33
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,600
He hijacked Ms. Oda's goods.

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
And he's afraid of her revenge.

35
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,240
He is there making inventory now.

36
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,640
And?

37
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
You can't kill him.

38
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,100
He has a lot of bodyguards.

39
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,820
Even that Japanese businesswoman can't kill him.

40
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,160
Neither can you.

41
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
Please spare my life.

42
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm a Chinese, too.

43
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm just a driver.

44
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Do you consider yourself a Chinese?

45
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
I don't agree.

46
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,680
My lady.

47
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,880
You have a visitor.

48
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,280
Am I right?

49
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,980
I can't wait...

50
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
Enough.

51
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,480
Stop.

52
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,400
Stop. Stop it.

53
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,720
Stop.

54
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,080
Stop now.

55
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Fire.

56
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,040
Stop.

57
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,960
Right now! Stop.

58
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,640
Stop. Stop it.

59
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,480
Fire.

60
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,480
It's coming.

61
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,140
Bomb! Move!

62
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,760
Fall back.

63
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,360
Run him over.

64
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,360
Who are you?

65
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,080
I know where Fujiwara Ichiro is.

66
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,040
And I know where your goods are.

67
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,880
You come to tell me this?

68
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,520
I know you hate him so much.

69
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,620
And you want to kill him by your own hands.

70
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,600
And I know you're in dilemma

71
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,970
because you lost the goods.

72
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,280
So what?

73
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,800
I can give him to you.

74
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,000
On what terms?

75
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,560
Give the mine up.

76
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,440
The mine costs so many people's lives.

77
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,760
I don't want anyone to die for it.

78
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,760
Deal.

79
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
Miss Oda.

80
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,920
Even the man I hate is low,

81
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,420
I won't let you help me get him.

82
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,640
Don't let him get out alive.

83
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,280
Yes.

84
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,160
Guards.

85
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,120
Guards.

86
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,480
Sniper.

87
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,800
Don't move.

88
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,720
Mr. Gu.

89
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
What do you mean?

90
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,600
This is a good question.

91
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,640
What's this?

92
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,840
I underestimated you.

93
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,840
Now look carefully.

94
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,050
You think you can get out of here

95
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,660
with your friends.

96
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,680
Sniper.

97
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
Where is him?

98
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,360
Find him.

99
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,360
Find him. Guard that area. Find him.

100
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,560
It must hurt.

101
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,829
Can we leave now?

102
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,440
Song,

103
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,440
I've revenged for you.

104
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Rest in peace now.

105
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,480
Hey,

106
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
when we first came here,

107
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,720
Careful.

108
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,850
we complained about everything here.

109
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,360
Except that every day was torture to us,

110
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,080
what we thought about were only two things.

111
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,480
Zhang Fu!

112
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,240
- When we got to eat, - A bit right.

113
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,720
A bit right.

114
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,050
and when we got to sleep.

115
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,100
And now our life is better.

116
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,820
The torture is about to end.

117
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,100
A bit more right. More.

118
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,700
But I miss the days back then.

119
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Who doesn't?

120
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,850
After all the sweats we shed

121
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,400
and all the pains...

122
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Don't bring it up.

123
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
Each time it was brought up,

124
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I feel so guilty.

125
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,400
By the way,

126
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
what are you going to do after graduation?

127
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,560
My dad gets me in the Q branch.

128
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,760
He doesn't want me to be in a combat unit.

129
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,080
He said it was dangerous.

130
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,640
And you?

131
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,400
I...

132
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,880
Follow sergeant's orders.

133
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
I'll go wherever he orders me to.

134
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,340
Let's move this over there.

135
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,920
OK.

136
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,340
Be careful.

137
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,280
Zhu Yanlin.

138
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,920
What are you doing?

139
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,780
Loafing about?

140
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,940
Leave me alone.

141
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,420
Not in the mood.

142
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,650
I met Song's brother today.

143
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,640
He said his sister gave birth to a child.

144
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,700
With the compensation from the army,

145
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,900
their life is well.

146
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,920
Really?

147
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,300
Is it a boy or a girl?

148
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,920
A girl!

149
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,400
A girl is good.

150
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,920
In the current situation,

151
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,580
a girl lives longer than a boy.

152
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,300
Liangchen.

153
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,260
He's changed a lot.

154
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
After so many things,

155
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,520
how can he not change?

156
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,100
What's that noise?

157
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,800
Commander Zhang is coming.

158
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,440
Hurry up.

159
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,960
Get ready.

160
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,860
Here. Give it to me.

161
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,560
Come in.

162
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,820
Guard the area.

163
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,180
What do you say about this?

164
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Commander Zhang.

165
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,640
This is...

166
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,800
Pick it up.

167
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,480
Look closer.

168
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,400
It's Qing Dynasty's Royal Seal.

169
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,340
You know it's Qing Dynasty's Royal Seal?

170
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,720
If you knew it, why didn't you hand it in?

171
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,370
Why did you give it to the Revolutionary Army?

172
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,040
If it weren't my men who found

173
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,560
Qing Dynasty's Royal Seal

174
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,360
in the search,

175
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,660
it would have disappeared

176
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,880
right under my nose.

177
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,840
It turned out that

178
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,080
it's the man whom I trust the most

179
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
wants to give it away.

180
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,630
Commander, don't be angry.

181
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,890
I don't understand.

182
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,760
What does the Royal Seal

183
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,320
have to do with the Arsenal Military Academy.

184
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,040
You ask me?

185
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,000
It comes from a student of

186
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,530
Arsenal Military Academy.

187
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,450
The student has confessed.

188
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,000
You don't know it?

189
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't know.

190
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,210
But I'll find out the truth.

191
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,400
I don't care whether

192
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
you knew it or not.

193
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,280
The Royal Seal comes out of the Academy.

194
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,800
You're responsible.

195
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,160
You're right, Sir.

196
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,520
Carry out the investigation now.

197
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,520
And

198
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,290
I want to know the truth.

199
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,360
Yes, Sir.

200
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,400
Today

201
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,680
marks the end of your study

202
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,880
and the beginning of your life as a soldier.

203
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,560
So on behalf of

204
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,500
the faulty of the Arsenal Military Academy,

205
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,680
I want to express the warmest congratulations

206
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,560
and the best wishes to you.

207
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
Besides, I want to say thank you,

208
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,280
and well done.

209
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,840
Thank you for your passionate patriotism.

210
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,160
Thank you for sharing

211
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,440
your best ages of life

212
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,720
with the army.

213
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,760
Thank you for

214
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,240
choosing the Arsenal Military Academy

215
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,880
and hanging on to it.

216
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,430
You let veterans like me

217
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
see the undying hope

218
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
in your spirits.

219
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,620
I hope in the future

220
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,000
whatever difficulties you may encounter,

221
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,600
you'll bear in mind who you are.

222
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,040
Remember

223
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,120
what you've learned

224
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,120
in the Academy.

225
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,680
Commander.

226
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,320
What's up?

227
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,520
Nothing.

228
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
Now

229
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,700
let's welcome Commander Zhang to give his command.

230
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,000
Commander!

231
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,820
Commander!

232
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,540
Commander!

233
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,160
To the hospital.

234
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,820
Commander!

235
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,940
Commander!

236
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,680
Go.

237
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,840
Hurry up.

238
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,280
What's up?

239
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,810
Old illness?

240
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,560
Probably.

241
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,400
Deputy Commander,

242
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,040
the Royal Seal is gone.

243
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,680
What?

244
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,320
Aren't there guards?

245
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,120
They're dead.

246
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,800
Stay calm.

247
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,800
Go.

248
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,520
OK.

249
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
Sergeant Guo.

250
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Can you come here?

251
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,480
What's up?

252
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,160
Block the Arsenal Military Academy.

253
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,490
Don't cause any uproar.

254
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,160
Why?

255
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,920
The Royal Seal is missing.

256
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,180
The guards are killed.

257
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,200
There's no sign of struggle.

258
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,340
It's a clean kill with a knife.

259
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,720
The murderer is experienced.

260
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
The room is clean.

261
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,610
The lock is not damaged.

262
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,920
It seems like the murderer's target is clear.

263
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,080
It's the Royal Seal.

264
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,920
To me,

265
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,700
it's probably an inside job.

266
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,680
You mean

267
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,170
it's one of our faculties who stole it?

268
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,340
You should know

269
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,000
we didn't even know about

270
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,120
the Royal Seal

271
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,440
before you told us.

272
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,210
You may not know.

273
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,770
But it doesn't mean that others don't.

274
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,680
You didn't even know the Royal Seal

275
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,140
was hiding in the Academy.

276
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,170
I'm not curious that

277
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,320
you don't know about this one.

278
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,640
Sergeant Guo.

279
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,530
We haven't reached a convict, yet.

280
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,490
Why the anxiety?

281
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,040
To make sure the safety of Commander Zhang,

282
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,100
the guards have taken over

283
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,200
the security of the Arsenal Military Academy,

284
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,930
including guards to each exit.

285
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
I've asked around.

286
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,000
Except for the guards taking Commander to hospital,

287
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,400
no one has left the Arsenal Military Academy.

288
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,960
Maybe the lost Royal Seal

289
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,260
and the man who stole it are still in here.

290
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,250
I have sent men on guards

291
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,660
with Commander Zhang.

292
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,170
Are there any leads?

293
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,780
It covers a large area.

294
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,960
From the Commander left the office

295
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,340
to he showed up on the stage, there is a time gap.

296
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,320
The Academy's faculty and Commander Zhang's men

297
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,250
didn't all show up at the ceremony.

298
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,610
So with all due respect,

299
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,960
anyone of us, including myself,

300
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,440
is a suspect.

301
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,080
Search it.

302
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,970
We can't let the murderer get away.

303
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,960
Yes, Sir.

304
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,720
Sir.

305
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,680
We searched all the people.

306
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Nothing unusual.

307
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
All the people?

308
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,760
Sir.

309
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,640
Nothing.

310
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,280
Come on.

311
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,080
Nothing.

312
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,160
What do you think happened to Commander Zhang?

313
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,360
Judging from the symptom,

314
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,890
it's likely a heart attack.

315
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,400
I remember when my grandma had a heart attack.

316
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,460
It's just the same.

317
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,160
Look, if he merely had a heart attack,

318
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,820
why would they hold us up here?

319
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,720
Who knows?

320
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,340
What's that sound?

321
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,960
Not good.

322
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,800
What happened?

323
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,640
What's up?

324
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,240
I saw 3 trucks.

325
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,800
And a lot of soldiers.

326
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Search the place.

327
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,240
The headquarter lost

328
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,640
an important thing here.

329
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,160
We've searched all the other locations,

330
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,090
except for here.

331
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,410
I hope the faculties of Arsenal Military Academy

332
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,440
understand

333
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,480
and cope with our search.

334
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,480
Wait.

335
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,100
Deputy Commander,

336
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,320
since you suspected us,

337
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,200
I think

338
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,890
we should look into it by ourselves first.

339
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Sergeant Guo.

340
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,290
You're so confident

341
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
in your students.

342
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,240
Of course.

343
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,920
Gu Yanzhen.

344
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,120
Shen Junshan.

345
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,940
You two are in charge of

346
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,040
searching all the people in here.

347
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,960
Yes, Sir.

348
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,680
Wait.

349
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,280
Whether it's carried out

350
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,460
by your men or mine,

351
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,090
the result will be the same, right?

352
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,090
What's the difference?

353
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,580
The truth is the truth.

354
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Guards.

355
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,320
Search them.

356
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,330
Search me first.

357
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,920
What are you doing? Back off.

358
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,600
What are you doing?

359
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,160
Huh?

360
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,760
You want to get killed?

361
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,240
What are you doing?

362
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,800
Back off.

363
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,560
What are you doing?

364
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,420
I'll open fire.

365
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,460
Back off. Put the gun down.

366
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,940
These are students from the Academy.

367
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,720
Now I've seen who you are.

368
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
What are you doing?

369
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,040
Put it down. Put the gun down.

370
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,000
Fire at me. Don't you have the guts?

371
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,640
Do it.

372
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,320
Put the gun down.

373
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,200
What are you doing?

374
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,400
Do it. Open fire.

375
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,280
If anyone dares to move again,

376
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I'll get you shot.

377
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,200
Don't scare us.

378
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,320
Try me.

379
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,320
See if I'm just scaring you.

380
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Yanzhen.

381
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,739
I need a female doctor.

382
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
I can take off my clothes and let you search.

383
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,830
But not here.

384
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,120
What?

385
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,860
Female doctor?

386
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,480
Yes.

387
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,219
Men in the Arsenal Military Academy

388
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,929
need a female doctor to do the search?

389
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,389
I'm a woman.

390
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,610
Guo Shuting.

391
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,760
Explain it.

392
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,940
Why is there a female student in the Academy?

393
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,760
Take her away.

394
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,960
What do you want to do?

395
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,480
Liangchen.

396
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,400
What are you doing?

397
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,060
Gu Yanzhen.

398
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,080
Step back.

399
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,440
It's OK.

400
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,330
Keep searching.

401
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,200
What?

402
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,880
Xie Liangchen is a girl.

403
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,000
So you knew long ago.

404
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,120
Tingbai,

405
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,600
will she be OK?

406
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It depends on whether she is related

407
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,800
to the missing object of the Commander's mansion.

408
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,060
She's definitely not.

409
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,130
That's for the best.

410
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,760
She disguised and got in the Academy.

411
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,480
It's just fraud.

412
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
With enough money

413
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,360
and the right person to work for us,

414
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,420
we'll deal with it.

415
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,610
But she can't stay in the Academy anymore.

416
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,680
This is Shen Tingbai.

417
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,320
What?

418
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,000
OK.

419
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,960
Got it.

420
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,520
What's up?

421
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,610
Zhang Xihou is dead.

422
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,960
Dead?

423
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,490
The military blocked the news.

424
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,130
But as far as I can see, it doesn't work.

425
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,440
The news will be out soon.

426
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,960
So it won't be easy

427
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,370
for Miss Xie to get rid of it.

428
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,000
Hello?

429
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,260
Can I speak with Shen Junshan?

430
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,530
It's for you.

431
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,960
Hello, this is Shen Junshan.

432
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,600
Junshan,

433
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,960
the Commander is dead.

434
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,600
Poisoned.

435
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,770
Now they accused Liangchen of the murder.

436
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,000
She was put in

437
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,060
the cell in the west of the 1st Prison.

438
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,000
Isn't it where they locked up

439
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,860
prisoners under death sentence?

440
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,920
Is it convicted?

441
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,120
Is the news reliable?

442
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,240
It's not convicted, yet.

443
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
But the document says she's highly suspicious.

444
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,850
Hence she was put in prison.

445
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,560
My uncle works in the prison.

446
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,640
He filed all Liangchen's paperwork.

447
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,690
So you can trust me about it.

448
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,000
Get in.

449
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,090
What are you looking at?

450
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,290
Take off your new shoes.

451
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Shoes.

452
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:05,960
Off now.

453
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,840
Are you deaf?

454
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,160
What?

455
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,890
You want a fight.

456
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,820
Look at her.

457
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,160
Fairly beautiful.

458
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,560
Maybe a lady of some rich family.

459
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,720
What brings a lady here?

460
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,880
As far as I can see,

461
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,220
she's probably

462
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,280
discovered cheating on her husband.

463
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,600
I don't want any trouble.

464
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,400
Don't push me.

465
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,060
She said we pushed her.

466
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,280
Who do you think you are?

467
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,840
I just push you.

468
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,840
Manting!

469
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,120
What's the hurry?

470
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,220
A ghost is after you?

471
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,440
Xie Liangchen from the Arsenal Military Academy

472
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,200
is a woman.

473
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,840
What are you talking about?

474
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,200
It's all on the newspapers now.

475
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,080
She disguised and got in the Academy.

476
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,280
On the commencement ceremony,

477
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,740
she killed the Commander.

478
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,640
Hello.

479
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,480
What do you want?

480
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,160
A visit.

481
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,720
A visit?

482
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,400
To whom?

483
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,240
Xie Xiang.

484
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,520
Xie Xiang?

485
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,840
The one who got in the Academy by disguise?

486
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,360
Yeah.

487
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,760
Go back. Go back.

488
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,890
No one can visit her.

489
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,680
Why?

490
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,680
Orders from the above.

491
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,610
It's not my place to ask questions.

492
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,480
Please cut me some slack.

493
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,080
No way.

494
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,360
What's it all about?

495
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,920
Captain,

496
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,480
he wants to see someone.

497
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,080
Xie Xiang.

498
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Who are you to her?

499
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,880
I'm her friend.

500
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,560
So

501
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,520
you're one of us.

502
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,320
Yes.

503
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,880
Then you should

504
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,360
know the rules.

505
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,400
Do me a favor.

506
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,320
I really want to help.

507
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,900
But we've got orders.

508
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
No one visits her.

509
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,760
You make

510
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,810
it such a trouble for me.

511
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,480
That's all I have.

512
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,160
Thank you.

513
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,200
OK.

514
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,240
Wait here.

515
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,440
Let me make some arrangements.

516
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,040
OK, OK.

517
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:14,840
Thank you very much.
