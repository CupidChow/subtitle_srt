00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,740
You are Mr. Matsumoto's student?

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,680
Your classroom is upstairs.

6
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,920
Why are you here?

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,840
Alright.

8
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,759
Come on.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
Follow me.

10
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,440
Thank you.

00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Yoshida Keiichi.

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,600
Here.

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,360
Alright.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,240
Here it is. Go in there.

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,520
Back to your seat.

16
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600
Kitajima Akari.

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Here.

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,880
OK.

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,760
Kitajima Takeshi.

Miyazaki Tomoko.

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,400
Here!

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,360
Here.

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Gu Yanzhen!

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,079
Hush!

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Are you here for Xie Liangchen?

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,140
Keep quiet!

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,120
- Quiet! - That's fine.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Don't be shy.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,420
I don't…

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,920
Stop talking.

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,079
That's fine.

36
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,760
I'll call him for you.

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm…I'm…

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,640
Here for you.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,079
You're so shy.

40
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,000
No! No! I am…

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,079
I am really here for you!

42
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,610
I'm just…

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
I thought that

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
you…you would be scared.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
You're…looking for me?

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,560
Yes.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,120
Here? For me?

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,320
Yes…I was wondering…

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,440
What?

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,200
This is the safest place.

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
You, here...

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,920
Look…

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's go. Go.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Wait.

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Are you really here for me?

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Yes. Not wrong.

57
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,280
OK.

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,620
Everyone.

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,280
That's all for today's class.

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Class is over.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,040
Teacher, thank you.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Do you understand all of these?

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,040
Not very clear.

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,280
Sorry, I thought no one is here.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
Wait.

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,390
Doctor,

67
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,280
what's your name?

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
How come I've never seen you before?

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,320
Doctor!

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,040
Yumi.

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,560
Mr. Dazo,

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,720
she is my student,

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,840
Miura Yumi.

74
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,650
What are you doing here?

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,480
I asked you to come to my office.

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,140
Why are you wasting time here?

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,380
Sorry, sir.

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,640
Come with me.

79
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,080
Leave now!

80
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,410
It is so dangerous here!

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,420
Why did you help me?

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,920
Go!

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,690
You will be unable to leave after the dawn.

84
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,159
My friend is still here.

85
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,159
I have to find her.

86
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,800
It was already so hard for you

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
to escape from the basement.

88
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,730
You can't save anyone else!

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,120
Now!

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Leave here with me!

91
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,560
Let go of me!

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,480
Go!

93
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,520
Teacher!

94
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Why are you wearing my clothes?

95
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,280
You…

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,850
You're not escaped from the basement.

97
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,200
Who are you?

98
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,080
Hurry up!

99
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,840
Hurry!

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,260
Go!

101
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,200
Let's go and see.

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,570
What's going on?

103
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,440
What happened?

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
I don't know.

105
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,250
What's going on?

106
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,660
Let's check it out.

107
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,200
Who are you?

108
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,480
Please don't kill me!

109
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,159
I'm just a doctor!

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,280
No.

111
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
You're a monster.

112
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,320
Where are the others?

113
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,050
I don't know.

114
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
I've just been sent here.

115
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,560
Let's leave first.

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
Alright.

117
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
That way.

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,280
Go.

119
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,320
Go! After them!

120
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,400
Damn!

121
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,240
They are there!

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,680
Go!

123
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,520
Yes!

124
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,840
Damn!

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They are out of bullets! Use bayonets!

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I want them alive.

127
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,120
Let's go now.

128
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,440
This way. Here.

129
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,400
What happened?

130
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Withdraw! This way.

131
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,840
Oh no. Hurry up!

132
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,520
Follow me.

133
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
Xiang, are you okay?

134
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,480
You got hurt!

135
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm fine.

136
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,650
Let's leave now.

137
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,690
They will catch up with us soon.

138
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,640
Let me carry you.

139
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,770
I can walk by myself.

140
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,120
Xiang.

141
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Xiang, stop that.

142
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,020
You'll bleed too much in this way.

143
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm fine.

144
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,660
What are you doing?

145
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,000
Something happened.

146
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,960
Xie Liangchen needs help.

147
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,600
What?

148
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,060
What happened?

149
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,560
Your friend, called Tan Xiaojun

150
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,400
was kidnapped this afternoon.

151
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,260
Xie Liangchen went after the car.

152
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,040
Bunch of junks!

153
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
Can't even do anything well.

154
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,130
It was fine that the waitress escaped.

155
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,600
But the boy surnamed Chen

156
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,930
escaped with them, too!

157
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,920
He probably knows a lot!

158
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,960
Do you know who saved them?

159
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,160
A doctor saw them.

160
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,860
He has drawn a picture.

161
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,440
It looks like Xie Xiang.

162
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,440
What a coincidence.

163
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,080
Last night we searched all over Shunyuan.

164
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,880
Gu Yanzhen hasn't come back yet.

165
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,280
But fortunately,

166
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
you are fine here.

167
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,040
Don't worry.

168
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,370
It's not that easy for me to die.

169
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Have you told Sergeant Guo

170
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
what I have told you?

171
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,840
Yes, I have.

172
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,400
And he said

173
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
he would report it to the Commander immediately.

174
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
But this matter

175
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,200
concerns the Japanese army,

176
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,400
is beyond the authority of our Academy.

177
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,440
So he wanted us

178
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,040
not to get involved in it.

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,840
He also said that

180
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,200
you and Xiaojun should be careful.

181
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,690
This matter is not a trifle.

182
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,440
The Japanese will not leave the matter at that.

183
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,920
My parents are scared.

184
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,680
They want me to hide in my

185
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
grandma's place for days in Suzhou.

186
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,120
I'll leave the day after tomorrow.

187
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,880
So soon.

188
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,760
Why did they kidnap you?

189
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
Have they said anything?

190
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,880
No.

191
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,480
They didn't talk all the way there.

192
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,810
And they locked me up as soon as we arrived.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,120
But I guessed

194
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,810
it may had something to do with Ms. Huo.

195
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,920
How could that be possible?

196
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,520
I'm just an ordinary person,

197
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,120
and I never offended anyone.

198
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,720
Why should I deserve this?

199
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,960
It could only be that

200
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
I used to work in Mountsouth Tavern.

201
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,840
And Ms. Huo,

202
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,560
you know that.

203
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't think too much.

204
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,920
It's none of your business.

205
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,000
The more you're involved, the more danger you would be.

206
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,320
Just listen to your father.

207
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,580
You should leave soon.

208
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,640
Song,

209
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,040
see her off when she leaves.

210
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,960
OK.

211
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,610
When you get better,

212
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,760
go home and rest in a few days.

213
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
Sergeant has permitted your leave.

214
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
I will walk you home then.

215
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,420
No, thanks.

216
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,080
Can you walk

217
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,440
on your own like this?

218
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,320
Mr. Gu.

219
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,520
Liangchen.

220
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,480
We're going out first.

221
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,560
Mr. Shen,

222
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,490
could you please send us back home?

223
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,480
OK.

224
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,720
Then I'm leaving now.

225
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,680
Let's go.

226
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,720
Have a seat.

227
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,359
Are you out there to find me?

228
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,120
You must be tired by

229
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,040
searching me.

230
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
Are you hungry?

231
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
Do you want something to eat?

232
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Or do you want to go back home for a sleep?

233
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,770
You look exhausted.

234
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,360
Sorry.

235
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,970
I should have found you were not at school.

236
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,400
I didn't even go in at the gate.

237
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,200
I…I…

238
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,760
I should have known that.

239
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,160
If I have known…

240
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
Gu Yanzhen.

241
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,240
That's not a big deal.

242
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,380
Look! I'm fine here right now.

243
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,320
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,340
Gu Yanzhen,

245
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm really fine.

246
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,090
Thank you for finding me disappeared.

247
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,170
Thanks for your searching.

248
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,040
So grateful in this life

249
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,080
You're here with me

250
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Wind brings back the memory

251
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,880
In dream shall we meet

252
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,100
Waiter,

253
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,500
bring me another bottle.

254
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,810
I'm sorry to trouble you

255
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,540
to come and walk me home again.

256
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,100
Please

257
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,270
take good care of Liangchen for me.

258
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,840
Xiaojun.

259
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,480
I will.

260
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,320
When you arrive,

261
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,520
remember to send us

262
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,240
a telegram.

263
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,260
We are worrying about you.

264
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,000
Tastes good?

265
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,160
Do you feel better?

266
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm fine.

267
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,880
It's just my limbs are stiff

268
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,960
by lying in bed for a long time.

269
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,890
It has nothing to do with the wound.

270
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,930
Xiaojun has left today?

271
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,940
Huang Song went to see her off.

272
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,040
What about the boy who escaped

273
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,100
from the hospital?

274
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,600
He wants me

275
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,800
to give this letter to you.

276
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,320
Mr. Xie,

277
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,640
I got something to deal with at home.

278
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,970
I can't go to see you now.

279
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,280
This is my address.

280
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,640
When you recover,

281
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,900
please come to my home.

282
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,840
I have to thank you face to face.

283
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,000
No.132 Tonghua Lane,

284
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Fu'an Road.

285
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,480
Chen Zhuo.

286
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,440
Why didn't he say the reason of being caught?

287
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,280
Teacher Guo tried him day and night,

288
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,000
and he refused to say anything.

289
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,880
He only gave

290
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,570
this letter to me secretly.

291
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,900
Didn't Gu Yanzhen come

292
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,840
these days?

293
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
Since you are better now,

294
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,470
I'll go buy tickets,

295
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,420
I will send you back to Peking.

296
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,440
OK.

297
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,440
Thank you.

298
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Don't mention it.

299
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,480
Manting,

300
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,600
you should attach importance to this play.

301
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,520
It will become your turnaround probably.

302
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,180
You should take it seriously.

303
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,730
Stop the car!

304
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,080
Wait!

305
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,170
Where are you going?

306
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,800
Yanzhen!

307
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,120
Gu Yanzhen!

308
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,340
Manting? Man…

309
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,960
Get up!

310
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,520
Come here!

311
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Manting, we are going to be late.

312
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,480
Take him with us.

313
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,360
Take him?

314
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,960
Stop your nonsense!

315
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,760
I…

316
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,440
Manting,

317
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,000
where should we send Mr. Gu to?

318
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,400
His home? Or the Academy?

319
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,340
Hurry up.

320
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,460
We will be late.

321
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,400
To the train station.

322
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,440
Train station?

323
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,400
Then what about Mr. Gu?

324
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,240
Put him there?

325
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,200
Just listen to me!

326
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,330
Stop your nonsense!

327
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,340
Manting,

328
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,600
are we really going to take him to Peking?

329
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,080
Do I look like I'm kidding?

330
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,540
No, but,

331
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,560
if we just

332
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,080
kidnap him to Peking like this,

333
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,000
will it cause some troubles?

334
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,880
What do you mean by kidnap?

335
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,410
I won't leave him alone, OK?

336
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Be careful.

337
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,730
That's here.

338
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,280
Sit.

339
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,100
Want something to eat?

340
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,020
My home is here.

341
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,440
I can't

342
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
invite you to come in.

343
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
I don't want my parents to know this.

344
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,060
I don't want them to worry.

345
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,640
I know.

346
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,720
Be careful.

347
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,200
Watch out your wound.

348
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,240
Shen Junshan.

349
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,640
I'm sorry.

350
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,690
You don't need to say this to me.

351
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,370
The dinner is ready!

352
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,040
Get up!

353
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,360
What time is it, Chen?

354
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,760
What Chen?

355
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,640
Get up now!

356
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,500
Or I will send you to the hospital.

357
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,320
You're so funny.

358
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,600
Why are you here?

359
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,160
Why can't I be here?

360
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,780
I'm not that kind of people you think!

361
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,160
You were drunk like an idiot

362
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,360
last night at Jinhua Hotel.

363
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,960
I brought you back by the way.

364
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,040
If I leave you there,

365
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,900
you would have died on the street.

366
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,560
Then I'm leaving now.

367
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,080
Leaving?

368
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,400
To where?

369
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,960
Back to the Academy.

370
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,410
Then ask Tao to buy a ticket for you.

371
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,840
Ticket?

372
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,850
Don't you need ticket to go back to Shunyuan from Peking?

373
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,760
I'm filming in Peking,

374
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,640
have no time to send you back to Academy.

375
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,080
Moreover,

376
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
the men in the Academy

377
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,920
can't take good care of you.

378
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,450
So I take you here by the way.

379
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,610
What are you glaring at?

380
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,700
It was me who took care of you the whole night.

381
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,840
You were so drunk.

382
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,800
That's OK that you didn't thank me,

383
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,280
but how can you be mad at me?

384
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,520
Thank you.

385
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,800
Gu Yanzhen!

386
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
I'm so nosy!

387
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,200
Damn it.

388
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,760
What a jerk!

389
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,760
Dad.

390
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,560
Mom.

391
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,120
I need to go out.

392
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,280
OK.

393
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,720
Where are you going?

394
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I got a stuffy nose.

395
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,200
I may have caught a cold.

396
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,640
I want to go buy some medicine.

397
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,680
Are you all right?

398
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,080
Then I'll go buy a fish.

399
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,960
How about soy-braised fish tonight?

400
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,600
OK.

401
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,760
Be careful!

402
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,440
Got it!

403
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,280
Bye.

404
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,960
Doctor,

405
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,640
I need some medicine.

406
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,960
Is there anything wrong with you?

407
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,420
Do you need to be examined?

408
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,660
No, thanks.

409
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,060
I'm almost recovered.

410
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,640
OK, wait a second.

411
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,600
Tomatoes on sticks!

412
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,320
Run?

413
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,760
Run, huh?

414
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,280
Run again?

415
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,640
Hide?

416
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,600
You are an adult

417
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,400
and you still play this with him.

418
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,000
Don't you feel embarrassed?

419
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,200
Who are you?

420
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,160
Don't move!

421
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,720
Or I will kill you!

422
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,000
Mr. Gu?

423
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,280
Mrs. Xie.

424
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,630
Why are you here?

425
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,670
I…passed by here.

426
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,760
Pass by?

427
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,630
I thought

428
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,190
you were here for Xiang.

429
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,630
Is Xie Xiang at home?

430
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,400
Yes.

431
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,480
She went to buy medicine.

432
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,679
She will be back soon.

433
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,050
Do you want to wait for her in our house?

434
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,600
Gu!

435
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Open the door!

436
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,080
Coming!

437
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,080
Yanzhen,

438
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,010
why are you back?

439
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,020
Mr. and Mrs. Gu are in Nanjing now.

440
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,400
Yanzhen, what happened?

441
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,360
Why do you take the money?

442
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,960
Yanzhen! Yanzhen!

443
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,320
Big or small?

444
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,200
Ready?

445
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,120
Open now.

446
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,480
1, 2, 3!

447
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,080
Here!

448
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,960
Small! Come on!

449
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,160
It's the small!

450
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,960
Come on!

451
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,800
Next round!

452
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,840
If you could find her,

453
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
the money would be yours.

454
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,520
Bro,

455
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,520
bro,

456
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,480
who did she offend?

457
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,360
I don't know.

458
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,490
Maybe the Japanese.

459
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,440
Japanese?

460
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,640
Who is she?

461
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,570
How could she offend the Japanese?

462
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,840
We only take the money and do the job.

463
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,570
Don't care about other things.

464
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,880
Bro,

465
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,960
it's better

466
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,420
to save trouble nowadays.

467
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,220
Take the money

468
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,800
and give them the girl.

469
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,860
Just listen to him.

470
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,960
OK.

471
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,240
You

472
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,280
go check that

473
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,900
if the cut-out is here.

474
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
And find out what is happening now by the way.

475
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,640
OK.

476
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,720
Bro, come on, cheers.

477
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,840
Cheers.

478
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,800
Have you ever seen this girl?

479
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,960
No.

480
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,640
Thank you.

481
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,640
Have you seen this girl?

482
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,240
No.

483
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,290
Have you seen this girl?

484
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,960
No.

485
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,030
Have you seen this girl?

486
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,840
No.

487
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
Have you seen this girl?

488
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,000
No.

489
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,440
Hello.

490
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,930
Have you seen this girl?

491
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,640
No.

492
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,440
Excuse me.

493
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,970
Have you seen this girl?

494
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,040
No.

495
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,410
I don't know.

496
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,880
Have you seen a girl

497
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,700
with two plaits?

498
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,320
This one.

499
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,850
Have you?

500
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,120
I can check it for you.

501
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,700
OK.

502
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,830
Then I'll wait for your news tomorrow.

503
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,530
Have you seen this girl?

504
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,640
No.

505
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,720
No.

506
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,600
Turn the whole hotel over to find her!

507
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,840
Don't miss any room!

508
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,360
Don't move!

509
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,290
Which department do you belong to?

510
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,480
This is Cuiwanglou, Mr. Liu's business.

511
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,160
We have certificate and documents!

512
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,320
Ridiculous.

513
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,740
You have certificate of selling people?

514
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,520
Xie Xiang!

515
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,240
Mr. Gu.

516
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,840
Is she here?

517
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,880
Don't worry.

518
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,010
We can keep finding.

519
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,400
You

520
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,720
take all of them away.

521
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,200
Go!

522
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,760
Go!

523
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,080
Hurry up!

524
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,120
When will he come back?

525
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,020
Let's wait longer.

526
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,560
How is it?

527
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,490
What's going on?

528
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,720
Say it!

529
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,560
Bro,

530
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,960
this girl's background is not so simple.

531
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,890
All the police are finding her now.

532
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,220
I have been checked

533
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,400
for four times about that.

534
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
There are check points everywhere.

535
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,760
I didn't expect her

536
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,080
to be such a problem.

537
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,440
When will the

538
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,040
Japanese come here?

539
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,640
Let's have the meal first.

540
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,360
Here.

541
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,480
You're awake?

542
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,000
Who are you?

543
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,200
Money-takers.

544
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,840
You just want money.

545
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,900
As long as you let me go,

546
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,680
I'll give you double.

547
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,960
We also have our rules.

548
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
If you break that,

549
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,760
how can we continue

550
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,440
our job to make livings?

551
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,960
She is pretty beautiful.

552
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,840
What a pity.

553
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,040
Come on!

554
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,680
Tell me!

555
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,250
Who asked you to do this?

556
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,080
Say it!

557
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,280
Two Japanese.

558
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,120
They gave us a photo of you.

559
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,720
So we caught you here.

560
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,960
Give me the photo!
