00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,420
Episode 45

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,259
Why are you still here?

5
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,030
Go back home.

6
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,560
It's dark.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,400
You've missed the visiting hours.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,530
Come back tomorrow.

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,130
What do you mean?

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,240
What do you mean?

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,640
What are you doing?

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
You think I'm a fool?

13
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,520
Get your hands off me.

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,120
Off now.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,780
Let me tell you.

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,520
If you keep doing this,

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,640
it does nothing good to

18
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
the girl inside here.

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,160
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,520
Sorry.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Sorry. Sorry.

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,240
Mr. Gu,

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,000
I asked around.

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,560
I know who you are.

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
I can give you a favor.

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
It's a rare opportunity.

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,000
I won't be too hard on her.

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,560
But today I can't

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
let you meet with each other.

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,640
I have orders that

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,880
no one

32
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,320
should visit her.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
You're a big shot.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,760
And you've got connections.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,960
Try your luck around.

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Don't waste your time with me.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,640
Am I right?

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,200
But you can rest assured.

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,960
I'll do

40
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,079
what you paid for.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,200
Your friend

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,530
will be fine here under my protection.

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,000
I won't let her suffer.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,200
Thank you.

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
Who is Xie Xiang?

46
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,079
Me.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,690
Someone gives you this.

48
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,440
You guys leave her alone.

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,050
Don't be afraid.

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll get you out.

51
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,920
Wait for me.

52
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,850
You're back.

53
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
You drink again?

54
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Did you have dinner?

55
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,820
Are you hungry?

56
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,880
No.

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,930
Where is dad?

58
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
In his room.

59
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,260
Your uncle is with him.

60
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,440
They have important things to discuss.

61
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,320
Uncle is here?

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,440
All right.

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,640
Go back to your room.

64
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,570
I'll get you a cup of tea to sober up.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
So you're saying that

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,770
the Commander died of chronic poisoning.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,760
Yes.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,760
According to the hospital's autopsy report,

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,680
the Commander had been

70
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,080
poisoned for a long time.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,920
He had liver imperfections.

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,240
So I presume

73
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,680
he might have taken over doses of medicine,

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,210
which led to heart failure.

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,640
Is it possible that

76
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,330
he took the wrong medicine?

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,600
At first, we thought so

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,730
and reported our presumption.

79
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,320
But later, his deputy, Commander Song,

80
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,600
took all the reports away,

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,100
and President Fu of our hospital.

82
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
Now there are rumors that

83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,320
the female student dressed in man

84
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
poisoned the Commander.

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,320
Now it seems

86
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,520
she is just a scapegoat.

87
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,720
Listen to me.

88
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,300
Don't get yourself

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,080
involved in this incident.

90
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,420
It's an inside job.

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,920
And they make the call.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,159
As for you,

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
you just pretend you don't know.

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,810
It's too late. Brother.

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,050
What do you mean?

96
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
Commander Song was keen in finding out the truth.

97
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
We believed him.

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Who knows that

99
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,300
we really found out the truth.

100
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,000
When President Fu handed in the report.

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
Commander Song

102
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,720
praised us for our work.

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,980
But I saw something unusual from his eye.

104
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
That night,

105
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
President Fu was taken away.

106
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,680
The worst thing is

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,640
I was one of the doctors doing the examination.

108
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,520
I think I can't get away this time.

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,040
You...

110
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,040
You idiot!

111
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,920
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
You believe everything he said?

113
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
You...you're not a kid anymore.

114
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
What should I do with you?

115
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,960
Brother,

116
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,159
how about this?

117
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,360
Aren't you familiar with the Japanese?

118
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,260
Can you ask them to ...

119
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,840
Shut up!

120
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,520
Run away.

121
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,770
Leave immediately.

122
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,610
It's going to be a disaster.

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,740
No one can protect you.

124
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,420
I'll get the money for you.

125
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,640
Take Shuyan

126
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,360
and Xiaowen with you.

127
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Do you hear me?

128
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,440
Wenzhong,

129
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,400
get in my study.

130
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,200
Dad.

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Come here, Wenzhong.

132
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,160
Sit.

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,400
Wenzhong,

134
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,400
is there anything unusual

135
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,260
in the Arsenal Military Academy?

136
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,200
Except for

137
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,060
the commencement being delayed,

138
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,530
everything is in order.

139
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,080
Dad,

140
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,250
are you worried about my uncle?

141
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,940
You heard that?

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
Your uncle.

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,330
He made no progress in these years,

144
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,080
and still couldn't see it through in politics.

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
Look at the current situation.

146
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,679
It's a troubled time.

147
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,360
Everyone is careful about everything.

148
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,530
But look at him.

149
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,000
He's really got in my nerves.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
Don't worry, dad.

151
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,450
Maybe you made it complicated.

152
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Wenzhong,

153
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,480
nowadays,

154
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
you have to be smart.

155
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,560
Think twice before you take actions.

156
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,570
Listen to me.

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
In recent days,

158
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,140
you have to stay low profile.

159
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,060
It's different from the past now.

160
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,640
There is a coup in the military.

161
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,920
What is it?

162
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,240
I'll go check out.

163
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,840
No, no, no.

164
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,560
Stay here.

165
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,650
Don't go.

166
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,240
He Xing,

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,730
go and have a look

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
what's going on outside.

169
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,240
Yes, master.

170
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,600
Is it a gunshot?

171
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,600
Go.

172
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
We'll leave, too.

173
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,990
Take the fastest train.

174
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,800
Pack up now.

175
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,360
Wenzhong,

176
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,640
go pack up now.

177
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,480
Leave?

178
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,100
Where are we going?

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,560
Dad,

180
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,440
you are overreacting.

181
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,840
Wenzhong,

182
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
it's better to be cautious.

183
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,000
Stop quietly standing here.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,860
Say something.

185
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,360
It's...

186
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,900
It's your brother.

187
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,200
What happened to him?

188
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
I...I didn't dare to get closer.

189
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,080
I saw from far away

190
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,210
that there is blood.

191
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
The driver

192
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,570
was also killed.

193
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,640
They are killing everyone who knows the truth.

194
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,720
Everyone.

195
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,130
We have to go now.

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
Immediately.

197
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,720
Wenzhong,

198
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,920
go book

199
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
the tickets of the latest train.

200
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,520
Hurry.

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Go.

202
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,840
I'll pack up my things.

203
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,480
Go.

204
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,640
Don't stand there.

205
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,610
You're here.

206
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,360
I think

207
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,880
I seldom see you recently.

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm busy

209
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,760
about the academy.

210
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,320
Are you closed?

211
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,480
I don't know why.

212
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,120
There are barely people on the street.

213
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,850
But there are lots of soldiers.

214
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,780
It's a chaos out there.

215
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,120
Let me help.

216
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,720
OK.

217
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,170
Li Wenzhong.

218
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,440
Mr. Li.

219
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
What's up?

220
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,680
This afternoon,

221
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
a guest gave me

222
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,960
two tickets of the theatre.

223
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,200
I want to go.

224
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,040
But I dare not to go alone.

225
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,560
So I want to check

226
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,760
if you're available tomorrow.

227
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
If you are,

228
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,200
can we go together?

229
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,860
It doesn't matter.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
If you're not,

231
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
I can go by myself.

232
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,280
OK.

233
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,640
You agreed?

234
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,130
Then I'll write it down.

235
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,980
I'll find the tickets.

236
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,450
I'll get the ticket for you.

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,840
Li Wen...

238
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,600
Mr. Gu,

239
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,760
your father is back.

240
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,690
But he's asleep.

241
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,280
Asleep?

242
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,760
I...

243
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,880
He knew about

244
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,400
what happened in Shunyuan.

245
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,660
He said, word for word,

246
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,760
that the current situation was complicated.

247
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,640
And it involved many stakeholders.

248
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,360
He didn't want to

249
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
and can't get involved.

250
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,120
And he warned you

251
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,580
to be careful in Shunyuan.

252
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,220
He asked you to go to Nanjing for the best.

253
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,880
Mr. Gu,

254
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,410
someone is here for you.

255
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,960
Not the right time.

256
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,760
He wants to talk about Xie Xiang.

257
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Come. Keep going.

258
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,450
Get on the train.

259
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,520
Wenzhong,

260
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,880
what are you doing?

261
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,540
Why don't you get on the train?

262
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,040
Dad.

263
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,400
Mom.

264
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,010
I'm not leaving.

265
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,760
What?

266
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
Why?

267
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,040
Wenzhong,

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,640
didn't we agreed about that?

269
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,280
Yeah.

270
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,400
Your son here

271
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,400
is a student of the Arsenal Military Academy.

272
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
A true soldier.

273
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,600
I can't be a deserter.

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,400
My pals and colleagues

275
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
are fighting the war.

276
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,520
I can't be so selfish and run away.

277
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,480
Dad.

278
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,360
Mom.

279
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,060
Forgive me for my infidelity.

280
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,130
- Wenzhong. - Wenzhong.

281
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,680
Get up.

282
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,079
You...

283
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,360
Wenzhong!

284
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,400
Wenzhong!

285
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,280
Cheers.

286
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,320
Cheers.

287
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,760
You. Who are you?

288
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm a Chinese.

289
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,520
Huang Song.

290
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,520
I have

291
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,240
revenged for you.

292
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,520
Our men in the academy

293
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,840
are all

294
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,440
heroes

295
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,080
with guts.

296
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
How did you get in?

297
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,560
Even Gu Yanzhen couldn't make it yesterday.

298
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,480
It's Ji Jin's uncle.

299
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,280
He works here.

300
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,680
He sent me in.

301
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,840
Are you...

302
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Are you all right?

303
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,920
Good.

304
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,200
The meals are good.

305
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
Inmates in the same cell room

306
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,040
are very nice.

307
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,960
Don't worry.

308
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,680
What's wrong?

309
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,320
If…

310
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,080
it was Gu Yanzhen,

311
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,270
maybe you would tell him the truth.

312
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,300
You need anything?

313
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,900
Anyone bully you here?

314
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,800
Such a terrible thing happened.

315
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,460
My parents must be terrified.

316
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,730
Have they arrived in Shunyuan yet?

317
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,080
Probably not.

318
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,970
I'll keep an eye on them.

319
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,680
Thank you.

320
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
The Commander...

321
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,200
died.

322
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,400
Remember.

323
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,160
No matter who asks,

324
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,010
just tell the truth.

325
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,100
As for the others,

326
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
don't admit them.

327
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,170
They think I killed the Commander?

328
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,780
That's all rumors.

329
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,290
I'll find out the truth.

330
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,800
I promise.

331
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,800
I'll get you out soon.

332
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
Time's up.

333
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,620
I'll go now.

334
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,220
Uncle Ji will take care of you.

335
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,760
Remember.

336
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,260
Don't admit things you didn't do.

337
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,520
Shen Junshan!

338
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,250
Keep an eye on Gu Yanzhen for me.

339
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,140
Don't let him do anything stupid.

340
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,730
And you, either.

341
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,620
Be careful.

342
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,600
Junshan.

343
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,400
Junshan.

344
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Don't you have anything to say to me?

345
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,660
What do you want to say?

346
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,360
OK.

347
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,820
Let's be frank.

348
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,200
I want the three parcels of land.

349
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,080
Junshan, you should know.

350
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,010
Even if your family doesn't agree,

351
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
I'll try my best to

352
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
get the land.

353
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,960
It just takes me more time and energy.

354
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,420
- About Lord Rong, - You...

355
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,580
and Lord Chengrui.

356
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,370
You killed them, right?

357
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,470
Why bother having this conversation?

358
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,360
You can do the same to our family.

359
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,660
About the Commander's death,

360
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,660
you planned it, right?

361
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,530
Now you're not talking.

362
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,980
Listen carefully.

363
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,500
If Xie Xiang is convicted of the assassination,

364
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,660
I won't let you get away with this.

365
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,760
All right.

366
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Since you care so much about her,

367
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,370
trade the land for her life.

368
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,160
Let's make a deal.

369
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,200
Is a man's life

370
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,880
so cheap for you?

371
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,800
You want to be a lover

372
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
and an upright patriot.

373
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,120
There's no such a thing.

374
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,240
I won't let your scheme succeed.

375
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,920
Let's see.

376
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,240
Mr. Gu,

377
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,850
someone is here for you.

378
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,760
Not the right time.

379
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,560
He wants to talk about Xie Xiang.

380
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,920
Xie Liangcheng didn't do it.

381
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,320
My uncle worked in the hospital.

382
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,040
According to the Commander's autopsy report,

383
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,240
he had been poisoned.

384
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,400
All doctors who know about it

385
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,360
were confined.

386
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,160
My uncle

387
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,080
was murdered.

388
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,770
This is his address.

389
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Maybe you can find something there.

390
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,290
Commander, Sir.

391
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,600
Yes?

392
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,360
We lost Commander Zhang's body.

393
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,600
What?

394
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
The Commander...

395
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,120
died.

396
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,040
Remember.

397
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,560
No matter who asks,

398
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,530
just tell the truth.

399
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
As for the others, don't admit them.

400
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,520
Xie Xiang.

401
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,200
Get out.

402
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,560
Is there someone here to see me?

403
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,240
Kind of.

404
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,160
Let's go.

405
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,730
This is your testament.

406
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,440
Sign it.

407
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,920
Poisoned the Commander?

408
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,450
I didn't.

409
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,780
I won't sign it.

410
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Why would I confess for things I didn't do?

411
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,650
Give me that.

412
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,760
The suspect, Xie Xiang, has confessed

413
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,219
and signed the testament.

414
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,840
She's sentenced to death

415
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,500
for poisoning the Commander.

416
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,199
Effective immediately.

417
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,920
I said I didn't do it.

418
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,320
You're cheating with people's lives.

419
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,150
I didn't do that.

420
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:33,710
Noisy.

421
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,150
You set me up.

422
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,710
Make her quiet.

423
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,280
You…

424
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,920
Idiots.

425
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
A bunch of losers.

426
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,280
Get ready.

427
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,920
Fire.

428
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,520
Breaking news.

429
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,800
Student from Arsenal Military Academy,

430
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,280
who poisoned the Commander, has been executed.

431
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,440
Breaking news.

432
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Student from Arsenal Military Academy…

433
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
Give me a copy.

434
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,840
OK.

435
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,440
Breaking news.

436
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,640
Kid, give me a copy.

437
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,300
Here you go.

438
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,160
Kid.

439
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,800
One for me.

440
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,640
Here.

441
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,320
Here.

442
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,920
Thank you.

443
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,700
No investigation.

444
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
No trial.

445
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,800
And they convicted Xie Liangchen

446
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,240
for such a crime.

447
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,170
What is this?

448
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,880
It's a cover-up with her life.

449
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,290
We have been classmates for two years.

450
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,720
As for Liangchen,

451
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,840
I think all of us know clearly who she is.

452
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,400
Though that she disguised herself

453
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,600
and got in the academy

454
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,450
is against the discipline,

455
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
she did it for a right cause.

456
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,330
Now the Commander's mansion convicts

457
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
her for a crime that she didn't make.

458
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,260
As her friends,

459
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,340
we can't turn a blind eye to it.

460
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
What's your plan?

461
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,280
I'll go to the Commander's mansion,

462
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
and the city hall.

463
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,500
If it doesn't work,

464
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
I'll go to Peking.

465
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,140
I don't believe

466
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,840
there's no justice

467
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,400
in such a big country.

468
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,770
I'll go with you.

469
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,440
Me, too.

470
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,880
And me.

471
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,010
Yeah, let's do this.

472
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,480
Hold on.

473
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,480
We haven't made it clear yet.

474
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,580
And our teachers are not here.

475
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,040
If you go there now,

476
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,920
it only makes things worse.

477
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,760
Who cares!

478
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,480
It's worse enough now.

479
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,180
Liangchen and Wenzhong are dead now.

480
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,960
Gu Yanzhen is missing.

481
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
Even Sergeant Lv

482
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,060
was questioned at the Commander's mansion.

483
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,080
Sergeant Guo

484
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,360
and other teachers

485
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
are locked up in the police station.

486
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,200
Now the Academy

487
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,480
has become the target.

488
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,770
If we don't do anything,

489
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
we'll be taken down.

490
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,560
You're right.

491
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,840
If we are convicted

492
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,440
the murder of the Commander,

493
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,000
the Arsenal Military Academy

494
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,480
will have no future.

495
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,080
So this time,

496
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,040
whether it's for our friend,

497
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,880
or our future,

498
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
we can't stand idle here

499
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
and let them blame us.

500
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,840
Friends,

501
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,060
what's our purpose

502
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,810
of joining the army?

503
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,820
It's to promote people's livelihood

504
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,420
and stand up for our homeland.

505
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,960
If we can't

506
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
stop such things around us

507
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,520
from happening,

508
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,010
how can we protect our people and our country?

509
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,800
So now

510
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm going to the city hall

511
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,540
and the Commander's mansion.

512
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,500
Those who have guts

513
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:02,960
should follow me.

514
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
Are you crazy?

515
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,220
What are you going?

516
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,480
Sergeant Guo.

517
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,220
What's it all about?

518
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,020
Sergeant Guo,

519
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,860
Lianghchen was set up.

520
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
We can't let them get away with this.

521
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,200
Things about Xie Liangchen

522
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,330
is settled for sure.

523
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,530
As for the truth,

524
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,080
one day,

525
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,540
it will reveal itself.

526
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,920
What you need to do now

527
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,250
is to stay here and wait.

528
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,650
Don't make any trouble.

529
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,080
But...

530
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,120
Liangchen didn't do it.

531
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,160
But what?

532
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,880
Many of you

533
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,000
here

534
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,760
are from a good family background.

535
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,960
You should know

536
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,410
the meaning behind this incident.

537
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,840
I don't want any of you to

538
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,890
sacrifice for nothing.

539
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,000
Sir,

540
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,640
can you tell me

541
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,130
what the meaning behind

542
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,530
the incident is?

543
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,000
We'll find out the fact.

544
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,880
Don't ask so many questions.

545
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,560
I know we will.

546
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,160
But what did Liangchen do?

547
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,060
Her problem is that

548
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,800
she exposed her identity

549
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,760
at the wrong time and in a wrong location.

550
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,280
The evil men took advantage of it

551
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,680
and made her a scapegoat.

552
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
I understand that

553
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,290
the academy wants to stay out of it.

554
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,820
But I can't accept that

555
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,000
the academy turns a blind eye to

556
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,860
the hideous crime and do nothing.

557
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,480
The point is

558
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,480
it's a game of the authorities.

559
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,680
They play with powers.

560
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,600
As for civilians like us,

561
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,460
they take our lives

562
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,240
for granted.

563
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,820
Is that right, Sir?

564
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,280
Anyway, I've told you

565
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,240
to stay here and wait.

566
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,600
You don't believe me now?

567
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,520
No.

568
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,200
Sir,

569
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,850
we have to speak out for her.

570
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,040
Let us go.

571
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,450
Yeah, sergeant.

572
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,960
Sergeant, let us go.

573
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,490
Let us go.

574
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,920
Let us go, Sir.

575
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,760
Sergeant, we have to do this.

576
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,800
Sir, we can't keep silence here.

577
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
Sergeant, let us go.

578
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,780
- Sergeant, let us go. - Sergeant.

579
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,240
Sergeant.

580
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,960
Is she really dead?

581
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
What do you think?

582
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,700
I don't believe it.

583
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,800
I'll find out.

584
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,360
Stop.

585
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,680
Only if you shoot me dead.
