Episode 36

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,250
I didn't mean it.

6
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,720
Mr. Peter.

7
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,250
So reckless you are.

9
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,160
Are you blind?

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,420
I said I didn't mean it.

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,570
So hard to serve.

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,360
I quit!

13
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,840
You...

14
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Damn it.

15
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,040
Mr. Song.

16
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
You just went to rest.

17
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,920
Why did you get up so soon?

18
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
There is something to deal with.

19
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,720
Why didn't he come out yet?

20
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,240
Did you talk all of it?

21
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,450
Yes, that's all.

22
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,640
I truly beat the Russian to death.

23
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Say it.

24
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,320
Yes.

25
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,840
Yes.

26
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,720
I'll go there with my men.

27
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,159
Attention!

28
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,720
Captain.

29
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,520
What's up?

30
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,159
I'll go out with some men.

31
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,120
You watch over him here.

32
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
How about prisoning him in the cell?

33
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,880
No need.

34
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,320
Hurry up.

35
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
You have run away.

36
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,850
Why did you come back again?

37
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
I don't need to run.

38
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,320
We signed the life-and-death contract.

39
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,780
It's clearly written that

40
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
life and death depended on the fate.

41
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,440
Why did you arrest me?

42
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,160
You are so obstinate.

43
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,440
Sir,

44
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,090
do you have any food?

45
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,040
I'm hungry.

46
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,409
Do you want food in the jail?

47
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,520
Forget it.

48
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm really hungry.

49
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,520
Sir.

50
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,640
Could you

51
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,880
buy me some buns or the like?

52
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,680
You can take all the rest.

53
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,160
If I leave,

54
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,860
no one will watch you over.

55
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,040
I won't escape.

56
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,090
If I had intended to escape,

57
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,940
I couldn't have come back.

58
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,200
Alright.

59
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,040
Stay where you are.

60
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,530
Don't try to escape.

61
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,660
I won't escape.

62
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,760
Sir.

63
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,669
Thank you.

64
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,030
You are a good man.

65
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,120
Change it for me.

66
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,880
Hurry up.

67
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,800
Hurry up.

68
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't wait. Come on.

69
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,760
Hurry up.

70
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,690
Change it for me.

71
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,880
Hello?

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,720
Hello. Is that Dafa Casino?

73
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,540
This is the police station.

74
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,920
An explosion occurred at Jinhua Hotel.

75
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,040
Several Russians were killed,

76
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
and several Chinese were injured.

77
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,000
Wait a second.

78
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,040
The injured Chinese said

79
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,720
the killer were the men of your boss Mr. Shi.

80
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,050
Is Mr. Shi at the casino?

81
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,720
What?

82
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,080
My boss isn't at the casino.

83
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,280
Find your boss now

84
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,010
and tell him to identify the dead in Jinhua Hotel.

85
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,770
Something is wrong.

86
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,480
Drive.

87
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,500
Why didn't he come yet?

88
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,090
Though this road is far,

89
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,540
the road condition is better

90
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
with less people.

91
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
No matter from the opium store, the casino,

92
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,200
or one of Shi Hu's three residences,

93
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,330
it's the fastest way

94
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,400
for Shi Hu

95
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,760
to go to

96
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,240
Jinhua Hotel.

97
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,280
So Shi Hu will surely take this road.

98
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,090
It's coming.

99
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,600
Sir.

100
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,340
Go to check it.

101
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,890
Reverse.

102
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,330
Who the hell are you?

103
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,980
The one who wanna kill you.

104
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,320
Go.

105
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,040
Who are you?

106
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,130
What do you want?

107
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,840
Mr. Wen.

108
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,660
An accident occurred at Jinhua Hotel.

109
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,860
Mr. Peter was killed.

110
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,140
None of his bodyguards survived.

111
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,680
Mr. Shi asked us to guard you to a safe place.

112
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,280
You mean, Mr. Peter is dead?

113
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,080
Yes.

114
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
I'll get my luggage.

115
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,770
You only have five minutes.

116
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,730
Please be quick.

117
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
OK. I know.

118
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,360
Thank you.

119
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,040
How is it?

120
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,160
What did Mr. Shi say?

121
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,840
He was out.

122
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,160
Neither at home

123
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
nor at the casino.

124
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,720
Is Peter truly dead?

125
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,060
The police station called us.

126
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,970
There was an explosion indeed.

127
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,760
Let's go.

128
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,520
Do you take my opium pipe?

129
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,160
It's urgent.

130
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
We must leave now.

131
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,400
Do you take it?

132
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,450
The child has it.

133
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Hurry. Follow up.

134
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,880
Come.

135
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,000
Wait.

136
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,840
Only you can we take away.

137
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,320
No.

138
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,960
How to do it?

139
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,560
Mr. Wen.

140
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
Your families will get in danger if they follow you.

141
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,660
They will be safe

142
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
only if you leave.

143
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,560
And no one can save you

144
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,640
if you don't go now.

145
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,220
When you leave,

146
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,260
we will look after your families.

147
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,720
My dear.

148
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,560
You may leave now.

149
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
We'll be fine.

150
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Be careful then.

151
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Can you hear me?

152
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,920
Tell me all about it.

153
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,360
Say it.

154
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,720
Your turn.

155
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm telling you.

156
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,320
So noisy.

157
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,240
If you don't tell me,

158
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,400
I'll kill you.

159
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,400
Don't!

160
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,920
Say it!

161
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,840
Tell me know!

162
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
Say it!

163
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,360
Say it!

164
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,040
Where does Chu Yunsheng live usually?

165
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,960
How many guards are with him?

166
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,040
Tell me

167
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,720
whatever you know.

168
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,960
Get it?

169
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,440
Get it?

170
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,960
Listen.

171
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,480
Tell me now, or you will suffer more.

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
What is he doing?

173
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,840
Do you hear me?

174
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,410
Tell me all about it.

175
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,280
Give it to me.

176
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Watch it.

177
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,240
Will you say it?

178
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,120
Say it!

179
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,880
Say it!

180
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,840
Say it!

181
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,810
Damn you.

182
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Say it or not?

183
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,800
He is tough indeed.

184
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,120
Alright.

185
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,060
I will pry your mouth open.

186
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Let's see if I can pry your mouth open.

187
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,160
Say it or not?

188
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,920
Say it.

189
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,560
Say it!

190
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,080
Stop.

191
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,010
He will say it when the opium addiction comes.

192
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,880
That's right!

193
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,140
Why can't I think of it?

194
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,880
You are silly.

195
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,280
Hurry up.

196
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,920
Do you wanna follow?

197
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,650
I'll follow.

198
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,120
I can't follow.

199
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,600
You can follow nothing.

200
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,840
Quick! Quick!

201
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,480
I want opium!

202
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,680
Please, please.

203
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,400
I want opium!

204
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,920
I... I will say it.

205
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
His opium addiction comes.

206
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,520
Please! Please!

207
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,680
I want opium!

208
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,260
Be careful.

209
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,520
Help me!

210
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,240
Let me go!

211
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,300
I don't want to die.

212
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,120
I don't want to die

213
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,920
Let me go!

214
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,400
Help me!

215
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,060
Are you insane?

216
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,240
He's dead.

217
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,200
Get down!

218
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,320
Run!

219
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,440
Run!

220
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,119
Sergeant.

221
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,210
Why did you come?

222
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,040
Hadn't I come,

223
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,770
you could have been killed.

224
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,109
You idiots!

225
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,040
Sergeant.

226
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,970
We captured the opium dealer!

227
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,800
Everyone in Shunyuan

228
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,560
knows that Chu Yunsheng was

229
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,160
the manipulator behind the scenes.

230
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,690
From the police to the municipal government,

231
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,480
no one dares to offend him.

232
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,560
But you guys

233
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,960
are so bold and reckless!

234
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,000
It's suicide!

235
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,200
It's the task given by Sergeant Lv.

236
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,480
Will you suicide if he orders you?

237
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,520
Sergeant.

238
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,720
What should we do now?

239
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,960
What to do?

240
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,800
We need to go back to school of course.

241
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,360
You have become the targets

242
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,290
of Chu Yunsheng.

243
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,850
It doesn't mean you will be safe in school.

244
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,560
You have no idea whom you have offended.

245
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,440
So what should we do, Sergeant?

246
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Anyway, things have gone so far.

247
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,000
In for a penny, in for a pound.

248
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,520
Since he doesn't defend himself yet,

249
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,680
kill him now.

250
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,120
Really? Sergeant.

251
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,640
You boasted him as a god.

252
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,360
Just a few of us who have no preparation at all!

253
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,520
We would be killed!

254
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,120
You are already dead now.

255
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,640
Sergeant.

256
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,770
Why do we get in the police station?

257
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,240
You'll know it later.

258
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,160
Right!

259
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,760
Go to the police!

260
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,290
Go to the police. Sergeant.

261
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,360
What's going on, Sergeant?

262
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,000
Sergeant.

263
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,890
Why does he take the gun?

264
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,640
What for?

265
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
Sergeant. Where are we heading?

266
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
The gendarmerie.

267
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,840
What?

268
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,840
Sir.

269
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,060
Those men escaped.

270
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,960
Escaped?

271
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Right.

272
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,080
Someone supported them.

273
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,000
Seemingly Zhang Xihou plans to kill me now.

274
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,040
Sir.

275
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,930
I think he just dares to send

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,480
some boys here

277
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,680
to try his luck.

278
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Anyway,

279
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,180
I can't stay in Shunyuan anymore.

280
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,960
I must leave tonight.

281
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,040
Take some capable men

282
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
and kill those students.

283
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes, sir.

284
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,720
I suffered such a loss.

285
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,520
If we don't fight back,

286
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,250
our prestige will fade.

287
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,240
Remember.

288
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,600
Kill them all.

289
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,640
Yes, sir.

290
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,120
Secure yourself!

291
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,130
We're going to knock in!

292
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,170
Stop firing!

293
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,440
Well.

294
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,800
Zhang Xihou really intends to kill me.

295
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,560
Sergeant.

296
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
What should we do now?

297
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,610
Wait until the battle ends.

298
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,520
And then?

299
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,160
Then

300
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,440
go back to school for dinner.

301
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,970
You are so bold, aren't you?

302
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,320
Be gentle.

303
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,960
I feel dizzy.

304
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,920
Don't you feel ashamed?

305
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
As a Sergeant,

306
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,080
as their mentor,

307
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
could you behave yourself normally?

308
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
At least I didn't send them to die.

309
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
You are near to be dead now.

310
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,320
Look at what you've done.

311
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
You fired ahead the police station,

312
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
and fired in front of the gendarmerie.

313
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,520
You even fired to gendarmes and policemen.

314
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,720
But we didn't hit anyone.

315
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,280
Shut up!

316
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,440
You rampaged on the streets of the city

317
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,320
by the car,

318
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,720
and led the policemen and the gendarmes

319
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,250
to fight with Chu Yunsheng.

320
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,480
You fired recklessly in the daytime

321
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,610
and acted so boldly!

322
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,800
Do you know what behavior it is?

323
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,280
It's lawless!

324
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,520
It is a rebellion!

325
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,440
A rebellion?

326
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
The emperor has abdicated.

327
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,480
Whom did we rebel?

328
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,560
The President?

329
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,720
Or you Lv Zhongxin?

330
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,240
Be careful of your attitude!

331
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,720
That was my attitude!

332
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,100
Do you think I wanted to deal with your troubles?

333
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,760
You, and the guys from the police station.

334
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,280
If you want to kill Shi Hu and Chu Yunsheng,

335
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,210
do it on your own.

336
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,080
Don't send these students to die.

337
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
You hide behind it and wanna take benefits from it.

338
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,000
What is it?

339
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,360
Is it honorable to do so?

340
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,080
You...

341
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,760
You get out now.

342
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,360
All of you listen to me.

343
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,600
If someone asks you about this matter,

344
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,000
tell him I did it.

345
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,400
Let them come to me.

346
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,200
Get it?

347
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,440
Yes.

348
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,490
Go back to sleep.

349
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,440
Right.

350
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,330
Classmates.

351
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Follow what our Sergeant said.

352
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,040
Go back to sleep now.

353
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,080
Will Sergeant Guo get in trouble?

354
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,480
We have done such a big deal.

355
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
At worst, we go to the court.

356
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
This is our own business.

357
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,720
Guo is so loyal to us.

358
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,690
He shouldn't be our scapegoat.

359
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,720
It's my fault.

360
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,320
Because of me,

361
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,600
you get in confinement

362
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,520
and get involved in this matter.

363
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,200
Don't think so highly of yourself.

364
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,440
Even if you hadn't done anything,

365
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,970
Lv would have taken others as the scapegoats.

366
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,480
Well.

367
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,560
Is what Sergeant Guo said true?

368
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,760
Did Lv mean to send us to die?

369
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,800
I think

370
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,200
it was possible.

371
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,930
Alright.

372
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,820
Stop talking about it.

373
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,760
Don't mention it to classmates.

374
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,260
It may cause troubles.

375
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Let's wait and see

376
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,940
what will happen next.

377
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,200
If Sergeant Guo

378
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
gets implicated,

379
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,120
we find solutions for it.

380
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,960
Alright.

381
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,560
Go back to the dormitory now.

382
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,740
Liangchen.

383
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm going home.

384
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,680
Now?

385
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,000
Call me if any problems.

386
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,560
OK.

387
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,220
Liangchen.

388
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,360
Go.

389
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,490
Stand there.

390
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,280
Any injections tonight?

391
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,680
There's one for tonight.

392
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,080
Wait.

393
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,160
Who are you?

394
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,080
What do you want?

395
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,920
Mr. Chu.

396
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,300
Lord Chengrui sent me here to pick you up.

397
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,920
Let's go.

398
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,520
Sir.

399
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,810
You are back.

400
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,160
Who is this?

401
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,120
Zhou Lixin.

402
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,970
The agent of Revolutionary Party in Feng'an.

403
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,240
They come to lobby father again.

404
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,970
It's like the last time.

405
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,960
Goodnow, the adviser of the President,

406
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,220
published the "Republic and Monarchy".

407
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,720
He touted the monarchy.

408
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
Delegations around the nation for the restoration

409
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,680
of monarchy have arrived in Peking.

410
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
And the Shunyuan delegation is on the way.

411
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,120
Do you think they can keep silent and still?

412
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,890
Does Yuan Shikai really intend to be emperor?

413
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,890
He wanna be the emperor indeed.

414
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,930
It depends on if he can succeed.

415
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,520
To establish a new flourishing dynasty for hundreds of years,

416
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,240
it can be called the monarchy restoration.

417
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,800
To serve as an emperor just for one day,

418
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
it can also be called the monarchy restoration.

419
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,460
It depends on how far he can go.

420
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,330
What did father say?

421
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,340
Father has no interest to join the petition.

422
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,200
He has no interest to

423
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,610
fight against Yuan Shikai either.

424
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,300
We should be careful then.

425
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,120
The Party is very active in Shunyuan.

426
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,280
They established the National Salvation Association (NSA)

427
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,610
and killed many people.

428
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,320
The men the NSA killed

429
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
are the traitors

430
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,880
of the nation.

431
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,850
It has nothing to do with us.

432
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,200
Hello. Shen Junshan.

433
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,760
What?

434
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,240
Was he rescued?

435
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,600
The policemen are searching him in the city.

436
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,000
Two policemen who guarded him were killed.

437
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,480
Idiots!

438
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,960
A gang of fatheads!

439
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,840
What we did is in vain!

440
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,800
Wenzhong.

441
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,480
Where are you going?

442
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,320
Where are you heading

443
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,040
with the case?

444
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880
Move to another place.

445
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,140
I'm tired of this room.

446
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,520
Look at him.

447
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,000
Wenzhong.

448
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,760
Why do you take these?

449
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,800
Move to a new room.

450
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,440
Miss Oda.

451
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,720
Thank you so much.

452
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,120
I'll pay you back for it.

453
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,480
You're welcome, Mr. Chu.

454
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,840
You're the friend of Lord Chengrui.

455
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,360
And I was entrusted by him.

456
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,760
You can't stay in Shunyuan for too long.

457
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,690
You must leave as soon as possible.

458
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,660
My men will guard you to leave now.

459
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,520
Thank you.

460
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,600
Take Mr. Chu to rest.

461
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,520
Mr. Chu.

462
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,280
Any actions in Rong Mansion?

463
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,280
No.

464
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,880
Chu Yunsheng

465
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,340
hasn't been obedient to Rong Mansion

466
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,440
since the emperor stepped down.

467
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,210
These two years, he is even indifferent to Rong Mansion.

468
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,000
They don't do it, so I have to handle it personally.

469
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,140
Release the information.

470
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,240
The train will be at 4 a.m.

471
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,120
These guys play tricks behind us

472
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,840
for so many times.

473
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,200
It's time to see them.

474
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,920
Yes.

475
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,280
Chu Yunsheng is a national sinner.

476
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,960
We can't let him go.

477
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,280
Where did you get the information?

478
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,560
I heard it from a guest.

479
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,660
This matter is confidential.

480
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,600
It just happened five hours ago.

481
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,400
How could the information have spread so fast?

482
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,480
The whole story is so clear,

483
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,080
even the schedule is known.

484
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,760
Don't you think it's weird?

485
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,520
Maybe it's a coincidence.

486
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,850
Nothing can be such a coincidence as this.

487
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Do you think this is a trap?

488
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,080
Probably.

489
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,440
Xiaoyu.

490
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,640
We'd better send someone to check it.

491
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,840
If the plan is unfeasible, we give up.

492
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,960
If it's feasible,

493
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,160
we intercept him.

494
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,400
He is a sinner of the country,

495
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,600
slaughtering countless of compatriots.

496
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,160
If he runs away,

497
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,920
we will feel guilty to our country

498
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,400
and to our conscience.

499
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,200
Xiaoyu.

500
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,660
It's significant.

501
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,680
I cannot act rashly.

502
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,600
But...

503
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,920
I decided it.

504
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,880
Mr. Zhou,

505
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,860
I am not your subordinate.

506
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,680
Spring Breeze Blows As Yarn

507
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,240
Dressing Of Beauty Looks Like Painting

508
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,880
Travelers Wander In A Picture

509
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,480
Flowers Blossom Aside The Road

510
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,880
With White Pear Flowers And Yellow Cabbage Flowers

511
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,760
Bastard!

512
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,840
Willow Flowers Sweep Above The Ground

513
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,360
Birds Are Singing While Walkers Return

514
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,000
The Bell Sounds To See Off The Sun

515
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,320
Miss.

516
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,489
He passed out again.

517
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,360
He didn't say anything.

518
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,489
I've started the investigation.

519
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,969
I suppose there would be results soon.

520
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,800
Flowers Blossom Aside The Road

521
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,680
Why did you come back?

522
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,800
Why did you come back?

523
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,440
You don't understand.

524
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,920
Hadn't you come back,

525
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,080
you could have always been the innocent girl in my memory.

526
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,320
Report to the police.

527
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,440
Chu Yunsheng's corpse is in Rong Mansion.

528
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,770
Let them get the corpse.

529
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,880
Yes.

530
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,480
Was Chu Yunsheng dead?

531
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,040
The police

532
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,570
straightly found his corpse in Rong Mansion.

533
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
They said it was sent from the Japanese COC.

534
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,740
But the Japanese didn't admit it.

535
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,200
Rong Mansion had connections with Chu Yunsheng before.

536
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,600
Now it's more confusing.

537
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,520
Fortunately, he was dead.

538
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,120
Can you guess who did it?

539
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,520
It could be anyone.

540
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,080
Maybe a road cleaner stabbed him

541
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,040
out of hatred.

542
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,880
Right.

543
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,780
Evil has its retribution.

544
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,760
Well.

545
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,440
Is it possible that Sergeant Guo did it?

546
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,640
Don't talk nonsense.

547
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,810
How can you say that?

548
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,120
It is possible.

549
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,680
We don't know Sergeant Guo's condition.

550
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,040
I wonder if he was punished.

551
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,200
This is his class.

552
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,000
In the class today,

553
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,780
read books on your own.

554
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,480
If you have any question,

555
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
ask Shen Junshan.

556
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,210
What are you looking at?

557
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,000
Start your business!

558
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,080
Sergeant.

559
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,370
Are you alright?

560
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm fine.

561
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,410
Just a bit tired.

562
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,530
I need a rest.

563
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,080
Really?

564
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,560
So many things happened

565
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,680
in such a few days!

566
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
Yeah.

567
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,720
Fortunately, they're all over.

568
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,840
But you know,

569
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,720
there is something weird.

570
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,600
Xiaojun.

571
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,000
Where should I put the wine?

572
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,730
Put it there.

573
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,200
Where was I?

574
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,120
You said there was something weird.

575
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,920
Right.

576
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,900
Did Shen Junshan invite you for a dance show?

577
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,880
Yeah.

578
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,200
Huang Song is too silly

579
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,530
to figure out the truth.

580
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
But Shen Junshan is shrewd.

581
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,000
He stayed with you all day along.

582
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,080
Didn't he find that

583
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,520
Xie Liangchen and Xie Xiang

584
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,800
are the same person?

585
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,880
He didn't see it through.

586
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,120
Maybe he trusts me too much.

587
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,160
So…

588
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
You lied so much and

589
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,940
feel guilty for it?

590
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,640
Go. Go.

591
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,720
I visit you at the deep night.

592
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,880
Sorry to disturb you.

593
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,360
Never mind, my lady.

594
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,960
This is my tavern.

595
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,600
We welcome all the guests to come.

596
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,720
We don't mind any disturb.

597
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,560
Ms. Huo.

598
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,160
As I remembered,

599
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,980
this is not the first time we meet.

600
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,960
Really?

601
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Look at me.

602
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,800
I'm so old.

603
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,160
I can't recall it.

604
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,810
My lady, you don't look familiar to me.

605
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,640
Where did we meet before?

606
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,680
It doesn't matter.

607
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
You always hide away from me.

608
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,440
Remember it from now on.

609
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,440
You come with such a great spectacle.

610
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,440
I'm afraid I'm impressed on it.

611
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,720
That's good.

612
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,080
Alright.

613
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,200
Guests are all here.

614
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
What are you waiting for?

615
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,160
Serve the wine!

616
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,520
Ms. Huo.

617
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,200
No need for wine.

618
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,240
Your wine,

619
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,900
I dare not to drink.

620
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,680
Don't say that, my lady.

621
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,000
I am not a bandit

622
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,650
who runs an illegal tavern.

623
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,160
We serve so many guests every day.

624
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,860
No one said there was any problems in my wine.

625
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,240
There is no problem in your wine.

626
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,410
There are some problems

627
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,440
with your men.
