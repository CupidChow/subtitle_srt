JIALIN PUBLIC
TRANSPORT GROUP LTD.

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WANG XINGDE

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Yes.

5
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,360
Please sign here.

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,360
Leave your thumbprint.

7
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
Everything is done now.

8
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,240
It's obvious what happened.

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,120
We have to do what
needs to be done, right?

10
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,000
All right. All the necessary
procedures are done.

11
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
There won't be
any more disputes.

12
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
- Yes.
- That's good for both sides.

13
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Yes.

14
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,720
Mr. Wang, do you have
any other requests?

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,040
You can tell me directly.

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,320
We can discuss it.

17
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Isn't that right?

18
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
12TH GRADE, CLASS 8

19
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Who did it?

20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,240
Who? What happened?

21
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,120
- What happened?
- I don't know either.

22
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Take it out.

23
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,160
Take it out.

24
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Ms. Tao.

25
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,760
I posted an on-screen comment
to retort against them.

26
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,760
Where is it?

27
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,840
I really posted it.

28
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
There are too many comments.

29
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
It's covered up.

30
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,480
SHE MUST'VE LEFT
HER BRAIN AT HOME

31
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,440
ENOUGH ABOUT THIS

32
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,640
NOW THAT SHE'S DEAD, SHE HAS
A CHANCE TO FIX HER BRAIN

33
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,280
I wanted to buy fish,
but they weren't fresh.

34
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
Let's make do with what we have.

35
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,080
The school called.

36
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,680
The head of the school and the
teachers are concerned about you.

37
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
They told you to take a break.

38
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,760
Turn off the ringtone.

39
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,360
Stay still.

40
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Can you sit down?

41
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Can we talk?

42
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,480
You haven't answered me yet.

43
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,200
On the day of our
daughter's accident,

44
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,040
she called you twice.

45
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,240
You didn't pick up.

46
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
Why?

47
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,800
Why didn't you answer?

48
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,760
Let me ask you.

49
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
Did your daughter
call you often?

50
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
No.

51
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,120
Because she knows you're
always on the road,

52
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,840
so it might be dangerous.

53
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,360
Did she call me often?

54
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,520
No.

55
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,440
Because I'm a good teacher.

56
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
I never bring my phone to class.

57
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,400
But that day,

58
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,680
at 1:42 p.m.

59
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,800
and 1:44 p.m.,

60
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,040
right before she
got off the bus,

61
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,760
she called you twice.

62
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,880
But you didn't pick up.

63
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,840
I want to know why.

64
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
Look at me.

65
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,560
Answer me.

66
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,000
Why didn't you answer either of
your daughter's calls for help?

67
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,480
It was a call for help!

68
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,840
Look at me.

69
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
Look at me!

70
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,400
What a great dad.

71
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Your daughter
asked you for help,

72
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,280
but you just ignored her.

73
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,920
You didn't care about her life.

74
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,520
You're an accomplice.

75
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,480
1:44 p.m.

76
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,400
I have a really bad memory now.

77
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm afraid I'll forget.

78
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,960
I'm afraid you'll forget too.

79
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,560
Do you know

80
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
why she called you?

81
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,480
Do you know why she called you?

82
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
She must have run into trouble

83
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
on the bus.

84
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,760
It must have been something
she couldn't solve.

85
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,080
She got scared.

86
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,320
But you didn't answer.

87
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,080
You could have saved her.

88
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,680
You could have saved
your own daughter,

89
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,280
but you didn't
answer your phone.

90
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,360
We're both murderers!

91
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,880
Tell me what in
the world happened.

92
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,200
Tell me what in
the world happened.

93
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
They all know,

94
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,800
- but they don't want to tell me.
- Yinghong.

95
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,840
They are all hiding it from me.

96
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,960
Yinghong.

97
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
Let's go to Jialin.

98
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,600
Okay.

99
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,880
I'll pack my things now.

100
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,600
How many times have I told you?

101
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
You can't park in the fire lane.

102
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,240
Yes, Mr. Yang.

103
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Are you a job applicant?

104
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Here. Have a seat.

105
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,680
Come.

106
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,680
Let me have a look.

107
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Sir.

108
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
Have we met before?

109
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,920
Or did you come to our public
transport company before?

110
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
I don't think so.

111
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,040
Have some water.

112
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm sure I've seen
you somewhere.

113
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,160
Mr. Yang, I'll get back to work.

114
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,120
Don't forget what I told you.

115
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,320
Mr. Wang.

116
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,000
I've had a look at your résumé.

117
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,840
Did you work in the transport unit
for a state enterprise in Jiaodao?

118
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,920
Let me ask you one more thing.

119
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,840
You're already at this age.

120
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,840
Why do you want
to work in Jialin?

121
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I moved here with my
wife due to her transfer.

122
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,720
I see.

123
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,880
But Mr. Wang,

124
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,560
your pay here in Jialin

125
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,600
won't be as good as
your old company.

126
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,120
You need to consider
that carefully.

127
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,120
How about this?

128
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,040
There is a new tourist
route to Binhai in Jialin.

129
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,160
Are you interested?

130
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,240
I want to have Route 45.

131
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,360
Route 45?

132
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,440
It seems you know
Jialin quite well.

133
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,400
I heard it's not an easy route.

134
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
That's true.

135
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,880
It's indeed not easy.

136
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,680
We usually put experienced
drivers on that route.

137
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,760
It's a longer route

138
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,000
and a lot of trouble happens.

139
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,080
What?

140
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,800
Are you sure you want
to do Route No. 45?

141
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,600
I've been a driver
for so many years.

142
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,960
I've never had an accident
or any violations.

143
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,440
How could they not recognize me?

144
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,960
Mengmeng has only been
gone for 174 days.

145
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,600
How could they
forget everything?

146
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,960
Those people…

147
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,560
are all garbage.

148
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Eat up.

149
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,920
There's still a
lot of work to do.

150
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,560
Are you okay?

151
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,680
You came back after all.

152
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,720
Look at this. Do you
still want to continue?

153
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,160
Are you really okay?

154
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm fine.

155
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,200
Do you know how
the fire started?

156
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
I succeeded.

157
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I dreamed of Mengmeng.

158
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
She told us…

159
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,840
to live a good life.

160
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,240
- Tomorrow is Tomb-Sweeping Day.
- You can live a good life.

161
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,839
Let's go see her.

162
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
You can live on.

163
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,280
You're a good driver.

164
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,520
You find joy in helping others.

165
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,680
You're a good Samaritan.
People trust you.

166
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,440
You can start over and choose
the way you want to live.

167
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,520
I'm fine with that.

168
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,440
We can get divorced anytime.

169
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,920
I can set you free
whenever you want.

170
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,360
Let's go and see Mengmeng, okay?

171
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
It has been five years.
Why can't you let it go?

172
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,400
Have you let go?

173
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,000
Can you let it go?

174
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,120
You have two choices.

175
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,600
Either we stay together

176
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,240
or you hurry and leave Jialin.

177
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
Choose.

178
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,240
Go.

179
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,280
Hurry back to your dormitory.

180
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,560
I'll be fine.

181
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,920
Go.

182
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,120
Go.

183
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Go.

184
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,560
Goodbye, Mr. Nice Guy of Jialin.

185
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Go.

186
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,400
Ms. Du.

187
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,880
We're almost done gathering
evidence from Gangwu New Village.

188
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,640
We even found online
transaction records of chemicals

189
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,520
in Tao Yinghong's computer.

190
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,760
We've sent the order to the
tech team for verification.

191
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
They lurked for four years

192
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,600
to make a bomb

193
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,520
just for this fiasco today.

194
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Ms. Du.

195
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,336
We've checked the
records from Jiaodao.

196
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,536
Wang Xingde, his wife, and
the two youngsters on the bus

197
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,000
never crossed paths before.

198
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,560
Do you think there
will be another loop?

199
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,760
I don't know.

200
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,680
But I keep having this feeling
that it's not over yet.

201
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,760
It's not supposed
to end like this.

202
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,680
The only thing we can do now

203
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,160
is to try and find
out the truth.

204
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,040
That way, no matter
what happens after,

205
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,440
if we at least know the truth,

206
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,920
we'll have the key to solving
this, giving us the upper hand.

207
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,600
But we can't leave now.
How can we investigate?

208
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,040
I was thinking

209
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
that we could ask my
guidance counselor.

210
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,656
Actually, when I found out Wang
Mengmeng went to my university,

211
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
I wanted to find her.

212
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,880
But I never had the chance.

213
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,120
Her accident caused such
a big commotion back then.

214
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,720
The university teachers
should know something, right?

215
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Let's ask her.

216
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,520
Li Shiqing.

217
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Ms. Wu.

218
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,840
You brat.

219
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,320
This was a serious accident.
Why didn't you call me sooner?

220
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

221
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,560
Did you call your family?

222
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,800
I haven't had the time.

223
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm really okay.

224
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,160
You were just riding on a bus.

225
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
How did you run
into such a thing?

226
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Well…

227
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Hello.

228
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,360
He's my boyfriend.

229
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,960
We were together when the
incident happened on the bus.

230
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,560
Have a seat. Don't
just stand there.

231
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,840
Are you really okay?

232
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,240
Did you confirm with the doctor?

233
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,360
I'm fine. I'm safe
and sound, aren't I?

234
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,160
Why don't you do a full checkup?

235
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,480
I'm really fine. Don't worry.

236
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm relieved then.

237
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,560
You scared me.

238
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,560
I almost passed out when
I answered your call.

239
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,920
Why is it the
Route 45 bus again?

240
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,600
"Again"?

241
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,600
Did something else
happen on Route 45?

242
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,920
When I first started working
as a counselor five years ago,

243
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,520
the Route 45 bus

244
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,120
also had an accident.

245
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,320
The victim of the accident was
also a student I looked after.

246
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,560
You looked after her?

247
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,800
Right when she got off the bus,

248
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,560
she was hit by a truck.

249
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
She died on the spot.

250
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,000
I had nightmares for
a month back then.

251
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,000
I kept dreaming
about that afternoon

252
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,480
when the police called
me to identify her body.

253
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,200
Thank goodness.

254
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,840
Nothing happened
to you this time.

255
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Ms. Wu.

256
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,880
Was the student
you just mentioned…

257
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,840
named Wang Mengmeng?

258
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
Record the statements
of the other passengers.

259
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,840
I'll take care of
those two youngsters.

260
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,720
- No. In your condition...
- Don't worry.

261
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,320
I won't cross the line.

262
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,000
I know what to do.

263
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,400
What did you say?

264
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,680
That's right.

265
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,920
The driver of the bus today
is Wang Mengmeng's dad.

266
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,160
How is that possible?

267
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,280
Mengmeng got into an
accident on a Route 45 bus.

268
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,440
Why did her dad…

269
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,000
It has already been five years.

270
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,600
How did you know Mengmeng?

271
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,056
She takes the Route
45 bus all the time,

272
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,280
so she knows the driver.

273
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,240
He told her himself.

274
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,200
Yes.

275
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,080
Moreover, when we
were on the bus,

276
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,360
Wang Mengmeng's parents
were very agitated.

277
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,000
It sounded like they've been
wanting to investigate something.

278
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,760
If the police hadn't
gotten there in time,

279
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,360
I can't imagine
the consequences.

280
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,280
So Ms. Wu,

281
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,480
can you tell us

282
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,160
exactly what happened back then?

283
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,080
Why did those two want to drag
the whole bus to death with them?

284
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,760
I actually don't
know the details.

285
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,400
But I know

286
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,280
that Mengmeng's parents never
asked the university for anything.

287
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,600
The police closed the case
soon after the accident.

288
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
They signed a settlement
agreement too.

289
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,600
After that,

290
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,880
I stopped following
their situation.

291
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,880
What about the
situation on the bus?

292
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,240
Were there any other students?

293
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,720
Did they see anything?

294
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,960
Or…

295
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,360
There must've been a lot of
chatter about it at university.

296
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,920
That's enough.

297
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,280
Stay out of it.

298
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,720
I think this is something I
should be telling the police.

299
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
STAY TRUE TO YOUR
ORIGINAL ASPIRATIONS

300
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,520
REMEMBER YOUR MISSION

301
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Ms. Du.

302
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,960
Ms. Du.

303
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,416
We've reported the results of the
interrogations to Director Xia.

304
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,576
Xiaoyuan is currently visiting
the witnesses on the bus

305
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,000
for their statements.

306
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,880
What about the two youngsters
who called the police?

307
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,656
Jiang Feng has been watching
them at the hospital.

308
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,760
I'll call him.

309
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,816
There must be a
problem with those two.

310
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,880
Come back.

311
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,920
I know.

312
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
After losing Mr. Zhang,

313
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,200
we're all holding in
a lot of emotions.

314
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
But we have to stay calm
at a time like this.

315
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,360
Don't jump to conclusions.

316
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Got it?

317
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,920
I got it.

318
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I got it.

319
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Go.

320
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,400
After the accident
happened that year,

321
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,760
there were a lot of posts
about Wang Mengmeng's incident

322
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,240
on the university forum.

323
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,320
But later on, the
administrator locked them all.

324
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,681
The university wouldn't allow
any more discussion on this.

325
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,760
Ms. Wu, so…

326
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,440
What kind of girl
was Wang Mengmeng?

327
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
Mengmeng was a very good kid.

328
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
She was a bit of an introvert.

329
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,120
She didn't like
interacting with others,

330
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,680
so she didn't have many friends.

331
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,320
But she definitely wasn't the
type to unreasonably cause trouble

332
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
and demand to get off in
the middle of the road.

333
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
That's what Wang
Xingde said too.

334
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Ms. Wu.

335
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
Can we still see those posts
on the university forum?

336
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
The posts have been locked.

337
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,760
I don't have the
authority either.

338
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,376
You might have to find the administrator
of the university network center.

339
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,440
Ms. Wu, I hope you can cooperate
with our investigation.

340
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,640
I think I need to ask
my boss for permission.

341
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,040
We can't wait for the approval.

342
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,320
I'll take responsibility for
whatever happens. Let's go.

343
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,880
Let's go to the university now.

344
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,520
I'm coming too.

345
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Mr. Jiang.

346
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
I know you still
have doubts about us.

347
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,960
But can you trust
us just this once?

348
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
Just…

349
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,240
Just trust us once,
like Mr. Zhang did.

350
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,920
There are officers
on duty outside.

351
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,040
Contact us if anything happens.

352
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,520
INPATIENT DEPARTMENT

353
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,056
HOW COULD THERE BE SUCH AN
IDIOT AT OUR UNIVERSITY?

354
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,616
THE BUS WILL PROBABLY
BE HAUNTED BY HER SPIRIT

355
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,040
WAS SHE HALLUCINATING
DUE TO DRUGS?

356
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,840
Why are they all poking
fun at her death?

357
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,360
Wang Mengmeng was the victim.

358
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,200
Why did they curse
her like that?

359
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,800
It's anonymous after all.

360
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
They feel they don't have to take
responsibility for their words.

361
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,040
Let me take a look
at the third comment.

362
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Okay.

363
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
Yes, this one.

364
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Put it in speaker mode.

365
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,640
XIAO HEYUN

366
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,600
<i>Shiqing, take a look
at the 45th comment.</i>

367
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
Go to the 45th comment.

368
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,760
SHE WASN'T A PSYCHO! SHE
ENCOUNTERED A PERVERT ON THE BUS!

369
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,720
Yes.

370
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,320
"She wasn't a psycho.

371
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,960
She encountered a
pervert on the bus."

372
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
This person sounds so certain.

373
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,160
It's probably not a guess.

374
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,880
This was posted three days
after Wang Mengmeng's accident.

375
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,600
The thread was locked that day,

376
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,560
so not many people
would've seen it.

377
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,320
Let me see the
comments after that.

378
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,656
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE YOU SAW IT
YOURSELF. ARE YOU DELUSIONAL?

379
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,056
IS IT TRUE JUST
BECAUSE YOU SAY SO?

380
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,576
I'LL BELIEVE YOU IF
YOU SHOW US EVIDENCE

381
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,856
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT
WRITING STORIES

382
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,016
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYONE
FROM OUR SCHOOL IN THE VIDEO

383
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,136
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE CALLED THE
POLICE IF THERE WAS A PERVERT?

384
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,440
DEVILS DON'T HAVE A CONSCIENCE

385
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,776
THAT'S LIKE KILLING
HER INDIRECTLY

386
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,560
THOSE WHO TURN A BLIND
EYE DESERVE TO DIE TOO

387
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
Seeing all these comments,

388
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,640
even if this person knows something,
they wouldn't dare to come forward.

389
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,400
Hold on.

390
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
This person's IP address

391
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,960
is the same as a
lot of the users.

392
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,960
I think it was posted
from the dormitories too.

393
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,680
Can we find out which
building it was?

394
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,000
Can you look into it for us?

395
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,200
Okay, hold on.

396
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
I got it.

397
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,640
It's Building 3, Room 324.

398
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,760
Ms. Wu.

399
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,800
Can you help us check all the
users at this IP address back then?

400
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
It was such a long time ago.

401
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,280
The school keeps updating
the student records.

402
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
In such a short time,

403
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I can only try my best
to find them for you.

404
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,160
We can help you find them.

405
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,720
Ms. Wu.

406
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
This is urgent.

407
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,200
This case has created
a huge social impact.

408
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,280
We lost an officer
because of this.

409
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,840
I have to find out
the entire story.

410
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,576
Wang Mengmeng's motive
for getting off the bus

411
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,200
is what caused this tragedy.

412
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,680
Ms. Wu.

413
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,160
I hope you can
understand our job.

414
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,080
Li Shiqing, I'll send a car

415
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,520
to take you to the station to
assist with the investigation.

416
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll take care of
the rest by myself.

417
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,600
Mr. Jiang.

418
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
You're a police officer.

419
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,720
If the insider feels pressured

420
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,560
when you talk to them,

421
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,840
they may choose to remain
silent or run away again.

422
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,040
But I'm a student.

423
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,000
If I talk to them,

424
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,480
they won't feel any pressure.

425
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,920
So…

426
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,400
You need someone like me
to interview them for you.

427
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,120
Hello, Jiang Feng.

428
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,520
What's going on?

429
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
The people at the
hospital said you left.

430
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,656
<i>Aren't you bringing the two who
called the police back here?</i>

431
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
<i>Where are you now?</i>

432
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,360
I have a new lead

433
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,640
that I need to look into.

434
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,720
What new lead?

435
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,160
I'll report to
Ms. Du right away.

436
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,720
It's about a witness on
the Route 45 bus back then.

437
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,560
Why didn't you report
such an important thing?

438
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,440
Where are you? We'll
send backups right away.

439
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,400
I don't need help yet.

440
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,440
I'll return to the station
as soon as I find them.

441
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,000
JIALIN NORMAL UNIVERSITY
CAMPUS TELEVISION STATION

442
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,440
Building 3, Room 324
is a girls' dormitory.

443
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,280
All the information
from that year is here.

444
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,280
Let's split this up.

445
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,800
- Okay.
- Here.

446
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,040
324…

447
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,720
Here it is.

448
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,880
324.

449
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,176
GONG RUOXI, LIU YAO, JIANG JIANG,
ZOU YANRAN, LIU TINGHONG, JIA YINYIN

450
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,600
Liu Yao.

451
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,160
Liu Yao, something
terrible happened.

452
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,480
What's wrong? Slow
down. Don't fall.

453
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
Look.

454
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,720
A Route 45 bus exploded.

455
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
Let me tell you.

456
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,000
I used to take this
bus all the time.

457
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,280
I'm kind of scared now
that I think about it.

458
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Liu Yao.

459
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,160
Liu Yao, what's wrong?

460
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
I'm fine.

461
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,880
It's time for you
to go. Hurry home.

462
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Okay.

463
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,800
Don't stay too late.

464
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,560
- I'll go after I crunch these numbers.
- Okay, I'll get going then.

465
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,280
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

466
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,216
BOMB ON BUS EXPLODES, AN OFFICER
KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY

467
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,496
THE POLICE RECEIVED A REPORT,
SAYING A BOMB WAS ON THE BUS

468
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,080
JIALIN POLICE IMMEDIATELY SET
UP A ROADBLOCK TO STOP THE BUS

469
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
THANK YOU, HERO

470
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,680
SLOW PHOTO STUDIO

471
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,640
Sorry, we're closed.

472
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Liu Yao.

473
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
Ms. Wu.

474
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,840
Can we talk?

475
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,360
On May 16th, 5 years ago,

476
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,760
you left a comment on
our university forum.

477
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,520
It was around 3 a.m.

478
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Take a look.

479
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,800
Do you remember?

480
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,199
We want to know

481
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,239
why you wrote this reply.

482
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,600
Do you know something?

483
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't know what
you're talking about.

484
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
I didn't post this.

485
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,600
The port of our school forum
connects to every dorm.

486
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,120
I asked your roommate.

487
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,960
That night, you were the only
one still surfing the Internet.

488
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,600
You asked my roommate?

489
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,600
What do you want?

490
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,639
Liu Yao, don't be nervous.

491
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,520
We really just want to know

492
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,320
what made you write this?

493
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Did you see or hear something?

494
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,840
No. I don't know.

495
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I just made it up.

496
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,280
Ms. Liu.

497
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,000
Please cooperate.

498
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,800
This is related to a bus
explosion that happened today.

499
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,440
Who are you?

500
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,000
- You called the police?
- Please cooperate with our investigation.

501
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,560
I'll say it again.

502
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,200
This is related to a bus
explosion that happened today.

503
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,560
Explosion?

504
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,320
What do you mean?

505
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
What do I have to do
with the explosion today?

506
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Liu Yao.

507
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,320
I was on that bus today.

508
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,280
The culprits behind the explosion
are Wang Mengmeng's parents.

509
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,360
They're taking revenge on society
for Wang Mengmeng's death.

510
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,960
Someone died in the explosion.

511
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,280
Do you know how serious this is?

512
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,400
Please don't hide
the truth anymore.

513
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,560
Liu Yao.

514
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,520
As for what happened back then,

515
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,240
if you know anything else,

516
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,280
please be honest.

517
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,800
I promise you.

518
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,760
No one will blame you.

519
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,760
It's easy for you to say.

520
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,440
Does your promise mean anything?

521
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,240
Why should I believe you?

522
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,760
I'm your teacher.

523
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,560
Of course I have to protect you.

524
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,440
Yes, at school,

525
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,080
you can indeed protect me.

526
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,040
But what about
outside the school?

527
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
If such promises actually help,

528
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,800
then why did Wang Mengmeng
still get criticized back then?

529
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,600
If I remember correctly,

530
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,560
her mom is a teacher, right?

531
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,400
You also saw

532
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,680
what all those people
said in those posts.

533
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,320
None of them care whether
you'll be retaliated against.

534
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,080
They only hold you to
the standards of a saint.

535
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,240
So if my information is leaked,

536
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,640
I'll be the one to get blamed.

537
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,360
None of you can help me.

538
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,280
Liu Yao.

539
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,080
I'm a police officer
from the municipal CID.

540
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,560
My name is Jiang Feng.

541
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,680
I promise you

542
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,080
that the police will never reveal
your information to anyone.

543
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,400
Don't be nervous.

544
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,320
We're not here to criticize you.

545
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,360
Liu Yao.

546
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,000
Deep inside,

547
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,680
you want to tell the
truth, don't you?

548
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,800
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
written that reply, right?

549
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,320
All these years,

550
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,880
I'm sure it must've been
hard for you as well.

551
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,600
So tell us.

552
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,880
Let's resolve this together.

553
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,920
Back then,

554
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,400
why did you write that comment?

555
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,000
Five years ago,

556
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,760
when Wang Mengmeng died,

557
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,160
were you on the bus too?

558
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
If I tell you,

559
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,400
can you promise me

560
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,440
that I'll definitely be safe?

561
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,800
I swear on my profession.

562
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,040
I was so scared.

563
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,320
I didn't hide
anything on purpose.

564
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,360
I was actually going
to call the police.

565
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
But…

566
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,000
I was afraid he
would get back at me.

567
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Who is he?

568
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,560
It was a middle-aged
man with glasses.

569
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,720
He indecently assaulted
Wang Mengmeng.

570
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,440
So you saw it?

571
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,080
Not only did I see it, I…

572
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,880
I even took a picture.

573
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,840
You have a picture?

574
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,520
I took it by accident.

575
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,480
- He even discovered me.
- Do you still have that photo?

576
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,680
