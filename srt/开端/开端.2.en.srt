1
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,480
You, come with me.

2
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,800
It's not my stop. Why should I?

3
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,680
Get off!

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,560
Why did you drag him off?

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,920
He's a pervert!

6
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Why are you smiling?

7
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's go to the police station.

8
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,400
We don't have to go anymore.

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
We don't?

10
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,440
Aren't I a pervert?

11
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
Let's check the footage.

12
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,600
We have to get to
the bottom of this.

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
I know you're not a pervert.

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,640
I don't know how to explain it.

15
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Anyway…

16
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,880
Thank you.

18
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,480
Are you out of your mind?

19
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,320
Crazy.

20
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Sir, Digital Plaza, please.

21
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
The one in the Old Town?

22
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,680
- Yes.
- Okay.

23
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,720
Sir, can you open the window?

24
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,816
- Aren't you hot?
- I turned on the air conditioner.

25
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,000
I need some air.

26
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Okay.

27
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,976
LIU PENG: WHERE ARE YOU? HURRY!

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,840
I'M ALMOST THERE.

29
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
HURRY. WE'RE ALL
WAITING FOR YOU.

30
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
I'M ON THE WAY.
I'LL BE THERE SOON.

31
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,320
STOP RUSHING ME. I
JUST GOT INTO A TAXI.

32
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,280
There are two more people here!

33
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,880
Come on, we need help here!

34
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Hey.

35
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Can you hear me? Hey.

36
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,760
EMERGENCY

37
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,320
That dream was
way too realistic.

38
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,080
Excuse me, is this…

39
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,120
Is this our first time meeting…

40
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
I'm…

41
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,440
Never mind.

42
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Did you…

43
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,720
Did you come in too?

44
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
Where?

45
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
The time loop.

46
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,440
You're in the time
loop too, aren't you?

47
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,200
Didn't you just think
you had seen me before?

48
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Last time, we were here.

49
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,160
When I woke up,

50
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
you gave me a tissue.
Do you remember?

51
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
- You…
- I'm sorry. I…

52
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
This is my stop.

53
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
Think about it.

54
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,560
Be careful.

55
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,159
Pervert!

56
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,400
Someone is groping me!

57
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,120
Do you think it was a dream?

58
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
But it wasn't a
dream. It was real.

59
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
It really happened to us.

60
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
It's true.

61
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,000
Sir, I need to get off.

62
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,880
I can't stop until we
get to the next stop.

63
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
There aren't many cars
or people up in front.

64
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Just stop for me.

65
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,480
Hey, did you miss your stop?

66
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,361
He can't stop for you here.
Just get off at the next stop.

67
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,216
It will only take a bit of
time to go one stop back.

68
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,320
The next stop is past the
bridge. I have no time.

69
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,576
- Sir, just pull over for a bit.
- I've tried this before.

70
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
It's no use.

71
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
Do you remember I said…

72
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,480
Stop talking to me.

73
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,640
-I said you were a pervert
-Sir, open the door.

74
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,216
- And dragged you off. Do you remember?
- Sir.

75
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,376
- Don't shake the door.
- Can you open

76
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,320
- the door?
- Can you calm down and listen to me?

77
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,360
It's a red light anyway.

78
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,920
Can't you open the door?

79
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,976
- Don't get hurt.
- What's going on?

80
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,776
- You're wasting your efforts.
- Look. It's a red light.

81
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,256
You've stopped anyway.
Just open the door.

82
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,736
- What are you doing?
- Don't grab the steering wheel.

83
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,200
What are you doing?

84
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,520
What's going on?

85
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,736
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
You grabbed the steering wheel!

86
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,280
Are you trying to get us killed?

87
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,760
You're in trouble
now, aren't you?

88
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
You're good, man.

89
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,016
- Did you learn wrestling?
- No, I'm just a bungee jump instructor.

90
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,160
Bungee jump instructor?

91
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,200
- Grab him tight.
- What are you doing now?

92
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,120
Let go of me.

93
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
- Why did you grab the wheel?
- I want to get off.

94
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,336
Why do you need to grab
the wheel to get off?

95
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,656
- Something is wrong with the bus.
- I think there's something wrong with you.

96
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
Let me go! It's
going to explode!

97
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
You're going to explode?

98
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,960
Okay, show me.

99
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,120
Show me.

100
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,480
You should believe
me now, right?

101
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm not lying.

102
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
We're really in a time loop.

103
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
You were pinned down
over there just now.

104
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,040
We're really in a time loop.

105
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,080
We're continuously on this bus…

106
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
What are you doing?

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
Stop being rash.

108
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,200
EMERGENCY DOOR CONTROL VALVE

109
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
Young man.

110
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
Are you carsick?

111
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,320
No.

112
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,656
- No.
- I have some medicine here.

113
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,560
It's okay. Thank you.

114
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,560
It's just too stuffy.

115
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,160
Tell me if you're
not feeling well.

116
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,760
What's that sound?

117
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,880
What's happening?

118
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,640
- What is that sound?
- What are you doing?

119
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,960
What are you doing?

120
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
- Hey!
- Hey!

121
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
- Hey!
- Hey!

122
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,200
- He's going to break the glass!
- What are you doing?

123
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,960
What are you doing?

124
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
What are you doing?

125
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,640
- Let go of me.
- What are you going out for?

126
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,080
Give me the hammer.

127
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,240
Let go of me.

128
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you crazy? Calm down.

129
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,640
Sir, stop the bus!

130
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
Someone wants to jump off!

131
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I want to get off.

132
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,520
Sir, please stop the car.

133
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,480
Let everybody off.

134
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,080
- It's too dangerous.
- That's right.

135
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,216
The bus can't stop until it's
at a bus stop. That's the rule.

136
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,296
The window is already broken.
Who cares about the rules?

137
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,936
- Why are you so professional?
- You're one to talk.

138
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,440
You're the one who
broke the window.

139
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,160
That emergency hammer
is for emergencies.

140
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,320
This is an emergency.

141
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,640
What's the emergency?

142
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,720
Sir, we've stopped anyway.

143
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,160
Just let me off.

144
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,521
How can he stop? Can't you see
if this is an intersection?

145
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,320
Why can't I get off
even in this situation?

146
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,040
I don't know. I've
tried many times before.

147
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,560
I don't know how I got
into this time loop either.

148
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,600
But I've been through it
more times than you have.

149
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,920
What are you two talking about?

150
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,840
Tell him that love isn't
everything in life.

151
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,656
- Nothing is more important than life.
- And…

152
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,480
It's no use even if we get off.

153
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,360
Also, it's too late.

154
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,400
So do we just wait and die?

155
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,520
Yes.

156
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,760
We can only wait and die.

157
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
But can you not be
so rash next time?

158
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,360
Let me finish talking.

159
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
EXPLOSIVE

160
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,360
Have you calmed down?

161
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,560
Actually, you can tell yourself

162
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,200
that the pain is
just psychological.

163
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
It can't hurt you.

164
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
It's not real.

165
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,440
Believe it or not,

166
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,480
I've never been this impulsive.

167
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,720
I believe you.

168
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,240
What's with this loop?

169
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,040
Have we been hypnotized
or something?

170
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,360
I wish we were hypnotized.

171
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,400
I don't know how we encountered
such a strange thing either.

172
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,320
That time I dragged
you out of the car,

173
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,920
I was trying to save you.

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,440
I never thought I'd pull
you into the time loop too.

175
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,200
So you mean

176
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,000
I went into the time loop

177
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
because you dragged
me off the bus?

178
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,600
Yes.

179
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,960
You've been through it twice.

180
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,480
But I've already gone through
this many times before you.

181
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,880
I've been trying everything
to get out of the time loop.

182
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,080
I tried everything to
get off the bus too,

183
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,640
but I couldn't succeed at all.

184
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
Until the time

185
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,960
I falsely accused you
of being a pervert.

186
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,840
So it's no use
even if we get off.

187
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,080
Will we still come back?

188
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,800
That's what it looks like.

189
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,040
I don't know what will
happen next either.

190
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,800
This is what I think.

191
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,920
We've been thinking we need
to get off all this time.

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,320
We thought we could solve
this by getting off the bus.

193
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,040
But just now, we saw that

194
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,960
it's too hard to
forcefully get off.

195
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,320
Besides, it's useless
even if we do.

196
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
We have proved that, right?

197
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,840
If we think of it
the other way around,

198
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
does that mean we
don't have to get off?

199
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Look.

200
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,040
Every time we get
to that intersection

201
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,320
and pass the red light,

202
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,160
a delivery bike forces
its way in from this side.

203
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,400
And in order to avoid it,

204
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,640
we turn this way

205
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,760
and crash into that
tank truck over there.

206
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,440
Then when the two cars
collide, an explosion occurs.

207
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,600
So I'm thinking

208
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
if we can prevent
the car accident,

209
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,400
maybe we can prevent
an explosion.

210
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,400
That makes sense.

211
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Sir.

212
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,839
My heart hurts.

213
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,920
I don't feel well.

214
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,760
Is it serious?

215
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,280
I haven't been able to
breathe since just now.

216
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,280
And…

217
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,079
- Why don't you pull over?
- Please drive faster.

218
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,400
- Driving faster is fine too.
- Why don't you stop?

219
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,760
You talk.

220
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,680
Actually, I'll be
fine if you pull over

221
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,840
and let me catch my breath.

222
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,720
Can you hang in there?

223
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,640
I can't take it anymore, sir.

224
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,040
What's happening?

225
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,720
You should help her sit first.

226
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
Have some water first.

227
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
Do you have water in your bag?

228
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,720
Do you want me to get off with
you and call an ambulance?

229
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,280
I forgot she has her medicine.

230
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,640
Who has medicine?

231
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,040
I have medicine here.

232
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,000
Don't worry, miss.

233
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Don't panic.

234
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Move aside.

235
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
Miss, don't be afraid.

236
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
I have some medicine
here. Don't be nervous.

237
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
That's the wrong bag.

238
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
I'm going to record a video.

239
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,520
You're right.

240
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,440
What medicine is this, ma'am?

241
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,080
- A heart reliever.
- A heart reliever…

242
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,680
That's right. It's a
quick-acting heart reliever.

243
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,560
You'll be fine
after taking this.

244
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,280
Here you go.

245
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,520
Take a few pills.

246
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,840
You don't have to swallow it.

247
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
Just keep it in your mouth.

248
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,000
Let me tell you.

249
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,120
Chest pain isn't
a trivial matter.

250
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,240
Be careful.

251
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,000
Young man, why are
you sitting there?

252
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,880
Come here. You have
to look after her.

253
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,880
Sit here and take care of her.

254
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm telling you. A heart
problem is serious.

255
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,600
You have to pay attention to it.

256
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,320
When you get off, you must
take her to the hospital.

257
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,720
- Okay, thank you.
- Get it checked out.

258
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Thank you, ma'am.

259
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,840
You were a great help.

260
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,640
I recorded it all, ma'am.

261
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
I was nervous, so I forgot.

262
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,200
How could you forget that?

263
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,960
What do we do now?

264
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,400
Since that old lady came, we
have hit another red light.

265
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,040
It's the same as last time now.

266
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
If we just warn the driver
to watch out for the cars,

267
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,680
we can prevent the accident.

268
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,720
<i>I told you I'm not sick.</i>

269
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,480
<i>I'm completely healthy.</i>

270
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,920
Couldn't you have reminded me?

271
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,560
What do you mean I
didn't remind you?

272
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,600
You know how long it takes
to fill this tank up.

273
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,200
You were free all
afternoon yesterday.

274
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
It's not like I
made the schedule.

275
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,000
Are you blaming me now?

276
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,080
NO OPEN FLAMES, EXPLOSIVE

277
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,560
Turn your phone off.

278
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm annoyed.

279
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Sir, don't rush.

280
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,160
There are a lot of cars here.

281
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,400
It's a bit dangerous.

282
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,960
Are you teaching the
driver how to drive?

283
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,000
His driving skills are great.

284
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Besides,

285
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,760
the bus goes on this route
every day, 365 days a year.

286
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,760
The driver knows every
ditch and bumps clearly.

287
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,560
- The driver is skilled.
- Is it that one?

288
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,736
- We're not there yet.
- Sir.

289
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,560
How long have you
been driving the bus?

290
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Four years.

291
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,160
Has it only been four years?

292
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,536
It doesn't look like it. I thought
you were an experienced driver.

293
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,960
I used to drive trucks.

294
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,720
Did you hear that? He
used to drive trucks.

295
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
Can you stop talking?

296
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,840
- Why are you everywhere?
- Look how nervous she is.

297
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,600
If you don't have a
heart attack, who will?

298
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
You can't live in
anxiety all the time.

299
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,560
You need to live
with an open mind.

300
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,800
Whether you're happy or
sad, the day will go by.

301
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,760
You have to be happy.

302
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,240
What will be, will be.

303
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,840
People need to be forthright.

304
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,760
<i>The order you are delivering will
exceed the time limit in one minute.</i>

305
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,560
You can't stand here. Go back.

306
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,280
Don't worry about the driver.

307
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,800
Worry about her.

308
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,280
She has chest pains.

309
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,040
That's you. I'm talking
about your chest.

310
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
Will you turn it off or not?

311
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,520
When I'm driving,

312
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,560
you're allowed to
play on your phone.

313
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,840
Yet I can't play on my phone
now that you're driving?

314
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,560
Just a moment, sir.

315
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,760
Wait a few more seconds.

316
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,200
Please.

317
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,480
Sir, the bike!

318
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Do you want to die?

319
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,760
Do you want to die?

320
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,200
Nice one. You can
predict the future.

321
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,600
What happened?

322
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,360
That was so dangerous.

323
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,360
NEXT STOP, YANJIANG WEST ROAD

324
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,120
My gosh, are you serious?

325
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,640
You're even making me nervous.

326
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,160
Sit down and rest.

327
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,720
I'll sit down too.

328
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,920
We should be okay here, right?

329
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,280
The bus is going so slowly.

330
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,720
There aren't many cars either.

331
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,200
We didn't get off and
there was no accident.

332
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,480
There was no explosion either.

333
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,000
Is the time loop broken?

334
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
I think so too.

335
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Then…

336
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,920
We're almost across the bridge.

337
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,600
Thank goodness for you.

338
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,720
I definitely couldn't
have done it alone.

339
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
What's wrong?

340
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,000
This music…

341
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,680
I remember now.

342
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,480
I remember everything.

343
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,520
That ringtone…

344
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,160
I only heard it the
first and second time.

345
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,280
After that,

346
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,840
every time I tried to get
out, I disturbed the driver.

347
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,760
Then the accident happened.

348
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,520
I never heard it again.

349
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Hold on.

350
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,680
Does the explosion also happen
when the ringtone goes off?

351
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Ringtone…

352
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,640
Ringtone…

353
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,600
Explosion…

354
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,000
There's…

355
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,680
There's a bomb on the bus.

356
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,480
We have to get off.

357
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,680
How do we do that?

358
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,360
I've only succeeded
that one time before.

359
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
That time?

360
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Pervert!

361
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,280
Someone is groping me!

362
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,640
Yes, hand him over
to the police!

363
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
If I was free, I
would go with you.

364
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,040
Don't be scared!

365
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,520
Hello, this is
the Jialin police.

366
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,880
I want to report a bomb
on the Route 45 bus.

367
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,040
<i>It is about to cross the
river-crossing bridge now.</i>

368
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,920
What's the license plate?

369
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
<i>The license plate?</i>

370
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,200
- Jia…
- Jia A77651.

371
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,920
Jia A77651.

372
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,520
You need to stop
the bus quickly.

373
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,720
<i>There are passengers aboard.</i>

374
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,000
Are you on the bus right now?

375
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,896
I just got off, but there
are still passengers on it.

376
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,080
The bomb is still on the bus.

377
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,960
Can you tell us the details?

378
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,280
How many people are on the bus?

379
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,200
There are about seven or eight of
them. But I don't remember exactly.

380
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,736
You have to stop the
bus. There's no time.

381
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,120
Please give me your name
and contact information.

382
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm Li Shiqing. You can
contact me on this number.

383
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,440
<i>Which characters?</i>

384
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,560
"Shi" as in "poem,"
"Qing" as in "feelings."

385
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

386
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm at Qing Shui Xiang.

387
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,120
I'm in the area just
before the bridge.

388
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
<i>Do you know where the
bomb is on the bus?</i>

389
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
I don't know.

390
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,600
Stop asking. We're
running out of time.

391
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,840
Turn your phone off.

392
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,920
Keep contacting the caller.

393
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,000
POLICE

394
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
Do you think they'll make it?

395
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
I don't know.

396
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,680
There's nothing else we can do.

397
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,840
Is this your first time
calling the police?

398
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
Yes.

399
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
JIALIN POLICE

400
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,376
Have you contacted the explosives
unit and the traffic squad?

401
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,320
Yes, we're making arrangements
as fast as we can.

402
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,120
Did you call the officers
nearby for backup?

403
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,360
Jiang Feng is on his way.

404
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,080
Did you get in
touch with the girl?

405
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,480
We've been trying to reach her,
but her phone is turned off.

406
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,600
Keep calling her.

407
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,160
Mr. Zhang.

408
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,760
Could it be a prank call?

409
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,760
This is a serious incident.
Why is her phone off?

410
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,920
The operator said the caller
may have been threatened.

411
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,096
She heard a man forcing her
to hang up over the phone.

412
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,080
Her phone has been
turned off since then.

413
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,080
It hasn't exploded yet.

414
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,840
Does that mean the
police took care of it?

415
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,720
It can't be that fast.

416
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,040
It has only been a few minutes.

417
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,160
It's turned off.

418
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Right.

419
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,040
That time at the hospital,

420
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,440
the police came to question me.

421
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,800
They said it
exploded at 1:42 p.m.

422
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,520
Since I used the same reason
to affect the speed of the bus,

423
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,160
then this time, the bus will
also explode at 1:42 p.m.

424
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
No.

425
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,616
When I called the police, I said
there was a bomb on the bus.

426
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
But…

427
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,360
If we affected the speed,

428
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,280
the car wouldn't explode
because of the bomb.

429
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,440
It will only explode when it collides
with the tank truck at the intersection.

430
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,160
As long as there's an explosion,

431
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,720
the police will eventually find
out there's a bomb on the bus.

432
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,880
Unless the bomb
is on the bridge.

433
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,160
I thought you weren't at the
scene when you got off last time.

434
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,080
- Why were you at the hospital too?
- I didn't get far. I was right there.

435
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,440
The explosion startled
a motorcyclist.

436
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,920
The motorcycle knocked me down.

437
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,600
The explosion could
even be felt from here?

438
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,520
Everyone, get ready.
Prepare for rescue.

439
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
<i>Please give me your name
and contact information.</i>

440
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,040
<i>I'm Li Shiqing. You can
contact me on this number.</i>

441
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,720
<i>Which characters?</i>

442
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
<i>"Shi" as in "poem,"
"Qing" as in "feelings."</i>

443
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,280
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

444
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,280
<i>I'm at Qing Shui Xiang.</i>

445
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,400
<i>I'm in the area just
before the bridge.</i>

446
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,120
<i>Do you know where the
bomb is on the bus?</i>

447
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,040
<i>I don't know.</i>

448
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,960
<i>- Stop asking. We're running out of time.
- Turn off your phone.</i>

449
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,960
Have you checked the
cameras at the intersection?

450
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,280
Yes, from the footage,
the explosion was indeed

451
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,120
due to the collision of
the bus and the tank truck.

452
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,760
But if there really
is a bomb on the bus,

453
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,160
that would be a
huge coincidence.

454
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,280
Check the surveillance cameras
around Qing Shui Xiang.

455
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,800
Make sure you check
them carefully.

456
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Cong Rong.

457
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,760
It's a call from Zhang
Cheng of the CID.

458
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,480
Hello.

459
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,600
<i>I'm Vice-Captain Zhang
Cheng from the CID.</i>

460
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,960
How's the scene of the accident?

461
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,960
Mr. Zhang.

462
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,520
There is severe
damage at the scene,

463
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,280
especially on the tank truck, which
was the source of the explosion.

464
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,440
Listen.

465
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,360
The report we got said that

466
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,600
there's a bomb on the bus.

467
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,840
<i>You have to be careful</i>

468
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,120
<i>to prevent a second explosion.</i>

469
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,696
Find out if there's an explosive
on the bus as soon as possible.

470
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
<i>I got it.</i>

471
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,096
After we've ruled out the
possibility of a second explosion,

472
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,840
we'll check the explosive
on the bus immediately.

473
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,000
Okay.

474
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,320
Let's keep in touch.

475
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,560
Okay, don't worry.

476
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,720
<i>Hello, this is
the Jialin police.</i>

477
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,880
<i>I want to report a bomb
on the Route 45 bus.</i>

478
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
<i>It is about to cross the
river-crossing bridge now.</i>

479
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,640
Did the explosion
happen in every loop?

480
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,760
How did you get
into the time loop?

481
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,280
Actually, the first few times,

482
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,800
it ended before I even
realized what was going on.

483
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,520
Later on, I tried to tell everyone that
disaster was going to hit this bus,

484
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,480
but no one believed me.

485
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,880
Even the driver wouldn't
let me off midway.

486
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,280
That time I was with you
was the only time I got off.

487
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,280
Then I was sent to the hospital.

488
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,680
The police kept
asking me questions.

489
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I was too tired,

490
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,440
so I fell asleep in a daze.

491
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,360
And then…

492
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,640
You know the rest.

493
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,160
Why did the police go to you?

494
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,880
Because the police saw
footage of us getting off.

495
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,720
Then this…

496
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,696
We reported it to
the police anyway.

497
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,800
It's only a matter of time
before we're interrogated.

498
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Is your phone still off?

499
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,320
Maybe I should keep
it off for now.

500
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
We have to look into this first.

501
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Let's go this way.

502
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ROOM

503
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,360
- Mr. Zhang.
- Sit.

504
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,960
Look, the caller was indeed on
Qing Shui Xiang at the time.

505
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,040
THURSDAY, QING
SHUI XIANG, JIALIN

506
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,199
1:38 p.m.

507
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,719
That was the time we
got the first call.

508
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,639
Why did they get off here?

509
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,879
This isn't a bus stop, is it?

510
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,800
No.

511
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,400
The last stop was
Yanjiang East Road.

512
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,080
The next stop is
Yanjiang West Road.

513
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
The next stop is after
the river-crossing bridge.

514
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,880
Mr. Zhang, look at this.

515
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,040

517
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
1:42 p.m.

518
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,040
That's the exact time
of the explosion.

519
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,576
Did they confirm the explosion
happened before leaving the bridge?

520
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,120
Maybe they wanted to see if the
police could stop the explosion.

521
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,360
Ms. Du, her identity
has been confirmed.

522
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,240
- Did you call her?
- Her phone is off.

523
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,760
Jiang Feng.

524
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,776
Go to the tech department
and find out what's going on.

525
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Yes.

526
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,600
"Xiao Heyun."

REGISTERED RESIDENT CHART

528
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,520
When I was in the hospital,

529
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,600
I saw these birds.

530
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,520
What's wrong with the birds?

531
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,880
I feel like

532
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,320
they are flying around us.

533
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,360
Do you think maybe…

534
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,880
we're actually already dead?

535
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,440
I've heard this before.

536
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,960
If a person wrongfully dies,

537
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,880
then his soul will be trapped in
the place where he died forever.

538
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,160
Then the events of the day he died
will keep repeating themselves.

539
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,800
Just like what's
happening to us now.

540
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,920
We are trapped on the bus

541
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,960
and we keep dying
again and again.

542
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,240
But it's not quite
the same for us.

543
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,200
Think about it.

544
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,360
We can experience things
that didn't happen before.

545
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,560
Besides, have you
heard of this saying?

546
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,120
"Once a vengeful soul
finds a substitute,

547
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,520
it can get out of
the time loop."

548
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,680
You already found one.

549
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
I didn't.

550
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
No.

551
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,840
I didn't want you
to be my substitute.

552
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,640
- No, that's not what I…
- I dragged you off

553
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,040
because I thought I should get
as many people off as I can.

554
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,920
I really wanted to save you.

555
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm sorry. I didn't
expect this to happen.

556
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,376
Wait, throughout all the times
you were in the time loop,

557
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,080
did you only drag
me off the bus?

558
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Why me?

559
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,320
It's probably because…

560
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,600
throughout all my attempts,

561
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,080
you were the only one who wanted to
help me by looking from my perspective.

562
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
I guess good deeds
don't go unnoticed.

563
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,440
Actually, there's one thing
I've been worried about.

564
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,280
We never actually saw the bomb.

565
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,240
What if the police ask
us where the bomb was?

566
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,120
- What do we say?
- Tell the truth.

567
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,480
That we've been
experiencing a time loop?

568
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
They will never believe that.

569
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,960
How else can we explain it?

570
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Anyway, we didn't
set off the bomb.

571
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,360
We don't have a motive either.

572
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,840
If the police don't believe us,

573
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,200
they'll just think
we're talking nonsense.

574
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,600
If it gets any worse,

575
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,280
they will treat us like
suspects for a while.

576
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,720
Police investigations
require evidence.

577
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,080
They will have to let us
go if there's no evidence.

578
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,880
If we make up our own story

579
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,520
and they find a flaw,

580
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,360
it will only make them
more suspicious of us.

581
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
What's the point?

582
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Ms. Du.

583
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,016
We checked the CCTVs along the route
and tracked them down at Qingshui Park.

584
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
The park is a bit complicated.

585
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
The CCTVs are scattered.
Moreover, it's summer.

586
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,456
The vegetation is lush
so there are blind spots.

587
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,600
- Get the tracking vehicle over there.
- Okay.

588
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,240
- Jiang Feng.
- Mr. Zhang.

589
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,000
Gather a team to come
to the park with me.

590
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,640
- Yes.
- Ye Qian.

591
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,880
Go to the security department

592
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,920
and keep an eye on the
cameras at every park gate.

593
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Keep me updated.

594
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,440
- Share this footage with me.
- I got it.

595
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,600
Ms. Du, I'll head over
there with my team first.

596
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,880
Okay.

597
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,160
