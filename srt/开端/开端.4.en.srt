1
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
- Are you nervous?
- No!

2
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Keep it down.

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Okay.

4
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
It's your first time
out in the field.

5
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,000
Be observant.

6
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,560
Look at how others do it.

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,320
I got it.

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,280
Don't act furtively
either. Just be normal.

9
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,680
Keep your eyes open.

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Yes.

11
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,216
Give me one of your
Chinese crullers.

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
What are you looking
at? Let's go.

13
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
Stop!

14
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Are you okay?

15
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Your hand.

16
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Come on.

17
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

18
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>

19
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,440
1:35 P.M., MAY 9TH, THURSDAY

20
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Are you okay?

21
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,641
- Your concerns were right.
- Are we really doing nothing?

22
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,960
I'm sorry, I…

23
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,760
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

24
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
I wasn't right either.

25
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,200
It's true that I didn't
trust you before.

26
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
I even suspected you.

27
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
Then just let it pass.

28
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Let's not talk about it.

29
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Are you okay? You were
sweating a lot just now.

30
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
I was locked up in that
dark room for too long.

31
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,040
I couldn't take it
anymore, so I fell asleep.

32
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,320
I fell asleep too.

33
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
So that means…

34
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,960
we go back into the time
loop once we fall asleep?

35
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,600
I think so too.

36
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,920
I got a very important
piece of information.

37
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,920
The police have confirmed that
there was a bomb on the bus.

38
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,320
Mr. Zhang reminded
me of something too.

39
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,240
He asked me if I knew
there was a bomb,

40
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,160
why didn't I tell the
driver and the passengers

41
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,440
and have them get off the bus?

42
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
We were in such a hurry that
we didn't think of this.

43
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,960
We've already tried it before.

44
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,280
We said an accident would
happen, but no one believed us.

45
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,520
An accident and a bomb on the bus
will evoke different reactions.

46
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,440
Sir, stop the bus!

47
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,720
There's a bomb on the bus!

48
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,560
Someone set it off.

49
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
That person is on the bus.

50
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,720
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

51
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,920
Are you looking for the bomb?

52
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,480
Watch what you say from now on.

53
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I got it. I know.

54
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,160
We don't know how
it's detonated,

55
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,560
so we have to find…

56
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
it first.

57
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,040
If he planted it on
the bus in advance,

58
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
then there's nothing we can do.

59
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
But let's say he brought it

60
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,640
on the bus.

61
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Something so powerful
must be in a bag.

62
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,040
So we can rule out
the two at the front.

63
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
They don't even have bags.

64
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,040
In the previous loops, these two

65
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,360
always had their
eyes on their bags.

66
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,160
This lady…

67
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,440
I think we can
rule out the lady.

68
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,440
Her bag was full of
medication. Do you remember?

69
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,520
That person…

70
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,400
There is a red bag at her feet.

71
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
What about the guy
in the last row?

72
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,960
Was there someone
in the last row?

73
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes.

74
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,440
It was a guy with a hat and a
mask. He was really strange.

75
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,640
He was dressed all in black.

76
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,440
Right. There was one.

77
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,600
When I saw him, I
thought it was strange.

78
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
Why was he covered up so
tightly in this hot weather?

79
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Right?

80
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,720
Where did he go?

81
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,440
"Next stop, Yanjiang East Road."

82
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,200
He hasn't gotten on the bus yet.

83
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
The time moved up again.

84
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,440
Does that mean we can simply
get off at the next stop?

85
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Yes.

86
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,760
What's wrong?

87
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,200
I want to find that ringtone.

88
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
Whenever the bus
explodes on the bridge,

89
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
the ringtone goes off.

90
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,960
If it really has to do with…

91
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
that thing,

92
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,440
that person will
definitely react to it

93
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
when he hears it.

94
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
That makes sense.

95
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,840
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

96
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,840
<i>Please exit through the rear door.
Please tap your card when exiting.</i>

97
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,056
<i>- Please mind the doors.</i>
- It could've just been someone's phone.

98
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Let's get off first.

99
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,920
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

100
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
What's going on?

101
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,960
I want to make a report.

102
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,920
There's a bomb on
the Route 45 bus.

103
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600
The license plate is Jia A77651.

104
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,160
The bus just left
Yanjiang East Road.

105
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,176
It is about to cross the
river-crossing bridge now.

106
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,800
The bomber is on the bus.
He is among the passengers.

107
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,016
My name is Li Shiqing. You
can contact me on this number.

108
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,120
Please believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

109
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,000
There's no time to waste.
You have to act now.

110
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,560
POLICE

111
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
I got it.

112
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,560
Understood.

113
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

114
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
- Xiao Heyun.
- Don't say my name.

115
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
What are you doing?

116
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,240
Keep a distance from me.

117
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Act natural.

118
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,600
- Why?
- So…

119
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
I'll find a place
with fewer people.

120
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
Just follow me.

121
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,960
There aren't many people or
surveillance cameras here.

122
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Hold on.

123
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,800
Why do you keep
avoiding the cameras?

124
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,720
Why did you call
the police again?

125
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
Of course I have
to call the police.

126
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,240
If there's nothing we can do,

127
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,520
then shouldn't we inform
the police to act quickly?

128
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,200
I don't want to go back
to the police station.

129
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,536
It doesn't matter even
if you don't want to.

130
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,496
It's only a matter of time
before we get called in.

131
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,400
We got off at a bus
stop normally this time.

132
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,840
If you don't call the police,

133
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,560
they won't suspect us at all.

134
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
I'm not blaming you.

135
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,000
We got off at a
bus stop this time.

136
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,000
This has never happened before.

137
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,640
This changes the
situation entirely.

138
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,520
We have plenty of time to
figure the situation out.

139
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,176
Then we can decide how
we're going to do this.

140
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,856
If you call the police
right after we get off,

141
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,000
we'll get questioned and
won't be able to do anything.

142
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,080
Besides, have you
thought about this?

143
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,200
What if getting off
the bus normally

144
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,880
is a way out of the time loop?

145
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,480
What if this is the last loop?

146
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,880
The last loop?

147
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,640
If this is the last loop,

148
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,280
isn't this the last chance for
those people on the bus to live?

149
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,880
That's all the more
reason to call the police.

150
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
But we already called
the police before.

151
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,720
The police can't make
it in such a short time.

152
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,120
The last time I called the
police, I was inexperienced,

153
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,600
so it wasted too much time.

154
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,080
But it's different this time.

155
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,480
The police have
more time to act.

156
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,160
Also, we got more information.

157
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,680
What information?

158
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,440
We don't know where the bomb is.

159
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,920
We don't know who's
controlling it.

160
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,480
What do we tell the police?

161
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,336
Do we say it's because
of the time loop again?

162
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,600
If we can't even explain things clearly,
how can we assist with the investigation?

163
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Yes.

164
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,720
You're right. I didn't
think it through.

165
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,880
But I didn't think
much at the time.

166
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,760
I just want to save them.

167
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,320
When I was in the hospital,

168
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
I witnessed
resuscitation attempts.

169
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
It was so tragic.

170
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,040
You just witnessed it.

171
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,281
I've been through resuscitation.
I know how painful it is.

172
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,280
But you can't save people
simply with a kind heart.

173
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,079
We have to think.

174
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,240
Besides, who are
we to save anyone?

175
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,599
In many of the loops,

176
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,240
we were corpses ourselves.

177
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
If the people on the
bus are destined to die,

178
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
perhaps this chance to escape

179
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,120
is God helping us.

180
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,120
We have to cherish
the opportunity.

181
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,560
We are not murderers.

182
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,520
There's no need to feel guilty

183
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,920
because of these people
on the bus, right?

184
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,120
Kindness is not a cheap virtue.

185
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,720
It has to match your ability.

186
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,800
Otherwise, it just
causes more trouble.

187
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,240
I…

188
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,360
It's nothing personal. It's…

189
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,640
You can see the
bridge from there.

190
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,880
Maybe the police can make it.

191
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm sorry.

192
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,200
I was too harsh just now.

193
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,080
I just wanted to say

194
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,000
that we should discuss
things together.

195
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,520
You hid so well just now.

196
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,000
Didn't you already
decide to run away?

197
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,200
I didn't think that much.

198
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,000
I just feel like

199
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,361
if we both go to the police
station, we'll be too passive.

200
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,040
This is what I was thinking.

201
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,440
Since we were able to get
off at a bus stop normally,

202
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,240
let's get through
this whole day first

203
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,440
and collect more clues.

204
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
Doesn't the time loop
move up every time?

205
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,080
Let's just wait until it's early enough
for the police to stop the explosion.

206
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,240
Then we'll call the police.

207
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,600
This way, we can cooperate
with the police effectively

208
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,840
and avoid dying
over and over again.

209
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,320
Moreover, we won't be locked up.

210
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,560
If the time loop
does keep moving up,

211
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,480
I'll still get on the bus
at the University Town stop.

212
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,160
But what about you?

213
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,560
Will you still get on?

214
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,560
My gosh.

215
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,200
Don't worry. You don't have
to go to the police station.

216
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,960
I trust the police.

217
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,160
They'll be in time to
stop the explosion.

218
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,040
POLICE

219
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,960
Mr. Zhang.

220
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,400
As per the arranged plan,

221
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,840
we have full control of
both ends of the bridge.

222
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,760
Where is Jiang Feng?

223
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,640
Mr. Jiang has taken some
of the traffic police

224
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
to the intercept point.

225
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,320
POLICE

226
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,240
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

227
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
What's happening?

228
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,000
Sir, open the door.

229
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,640
Everyone,

230
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,120
there's an accident up ahead.

231
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,280
The bus can't get through.

232
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,280
You can get off
and leave on foot.

233
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,200
What's happening?

234
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,760
Is there a backup on the bridge?

235
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,080
How long will it take?

236
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,280
I have something to do.

237
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
It will take at least an hour.

238
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,760
That's too long.

239
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,160
I have something to do at home.

240
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,880
Sir, please open the door.

241
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,440
- We're getting off.
- Everyone, get off, but leave your stuff.

242
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,560
- Stay still!
- Stay still!

243
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,640
Stay still!

244
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Jiang Feng.

245
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,840
Do you read me?

246
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,880
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, 1,500 M

247
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,280
Jiang Feng.

248
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,520
Do you read me?

249
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
You should go.

250
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,880
I'll explain everything
to the police.

251
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,280
I won't mention you.

252
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,120
What are you going
to tell the police?

253
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,520
I've been interrogated
twice. I know what to say.

254
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,440
Anyway, I won't mention you.

255
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
You hid pretty well just now.

256
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,240
I don't think
they'll suspect you.

257
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,200
You're right.

258
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,200
There's indeed no point
to implicate both of us.

259
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,000
Besides, this was my own
problem in the first place.

260
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,960
Whatever the result is,
I should bear it alone.

261
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,440
Yes, I'm Li Shiqing.

262
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm at Little West Lake Park.

263
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,240
Okay, I'll wait for
you at the entrance.

264
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,800
Can't you discuss things
before you do something?

265
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,760
I already called the
police. What else can I do?

266
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,040
The police will be here soon.

267
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,720
Don't rush to go out. Hide
in the park for a while.

268
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,440
If this really is the last loop,

269
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,640
I'll take responsibility
for what I've done myself.

270
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,320
This has nothing to do with whether
this is the last time or not.

271
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
It's even better if
it's not the last time.

272
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,336
From now on, you can just get
off at the next stop normally

273
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,880
and live your regular life.

274
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,040
How can I have a
regular life again?

275
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,440
Every day, when I open my eyes, I'll
see you sending yourself to death.

276
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,200
Do I just ignore that
and go to my meeting?

277
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,800
At least you won't
die in the explosion.

278
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,600
It's better than the
passengers who get blown up.

279
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,760
The passengers
don't know anything.

280
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,800
Death just happens in a moment.

281
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,440
They can't even feel the pain.

282
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
But what about us?

283
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,600
We have to face fear.

284
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,080
Is it wrong to be
afraid of death?

285
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,256
Isn't it human nature to
seek benefits and evade harm?

286
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,240
Just because I can't be
as kind as you, does that…

287
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,360
Does that make me evil?

288
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,600
Wait. Give me your number.

289
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
In case anything happens.

290
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,280
I'll be fine.

291
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,680
- Give me your number.
- 13959288109.

292
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,880
We're the municipal police.

293
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Are you Li Shiqing?

294
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,200
Get in the car.

295
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Hello. How are things?

296
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,680
Is there no chance
of saving him at all?

297
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Okay, I got it.

298
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,080
LIU PENG

299
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,640
LIU PENG

300
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Hello.

301
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,720
<i>Where are you?</i>

302
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,400
You're there, right?

303
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,920
Why don't you talk to them?

304
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
<i>I asked you where you are.</i>

305
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,560
I haven't crossed
the bridge yet.

306
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,240
There was an accident
on the bridge.

307
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,040
<i>Can't you hail a taxi
and take a detour?</i>

308
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,320
I can't get a taxi now.

309
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,760
<i>Xiao Heyun, their
top boss is here.</i>

310
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
<i>They are very sincere.</i>

311
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,400
<i>Hurry and think of
a way to get here.</i>

312
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,480
<i>I can explain to
them why you're late.</i>

313
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,280
<i>But you designed this game.</i>

314
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,120
<i>You have to be here no
matter what. Hurry up.</i>

315
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
I…

316
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,640
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- What happened?

317
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,320
- I think there was an explosion.
- Did it explode?

318
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,400
- Someone died.
- A lot of people died.

319
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,240
- My goodness.
- On the bridge…

320
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,720
You saw it too, right?

321
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,840
The terrorists set off the bomb
in the middle of the bridge.

322
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,720
Are you kidding me?

323
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,560
How could there be
terrorists in China?

324
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,320
- I have something urgent to do.
- Right?

325
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm late now.

326
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,200
The call she made was
the police report.

327
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,560
The timing matches.

328
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,040
Who is the guy that
got off with her?

329
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,080
We're still pulling up CCTV footage to
look for people she interacted with.

330
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,600
- Verify this man's identity.
- I got it.

331
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,200
Xiao Heyun, where are you?
I'm at the big staircase.

332
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,840
- Hello?
- I…

333
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Hello?

334
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Hello?

335
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Hello? Xiao Heyun?

336
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
Xiao Heyun!

337
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,800
Xiao Heyun, I know
what you're thinking.

338
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,520
You've been hesitating
for a month.

339
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,360
It's just deleting
the violent settings.

340
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,280
I just don't get it.

341
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,480
What's so bad about a game
being a little violent?

342
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,080
How many times have I told you?

343
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,400
With violent settings,
it won't sell.

344
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,976
If it doesn't sell and
no one invests in it,

345
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,360
we really can't do this game
anymore. Do you understand?

346
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,080
Hide!

347
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,920
Good for you! Just keep hiding!

348
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,520
If this is the last loop,

349
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,120
isn't this the last chance for
those people on the bus to live?

350
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
DIGITAL PLAZA

351
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,360
When I was in the hospital,

352
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,840
I witnessed
resuscitation attempts.

353
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
It was so tragic.

354
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,760
If the time loop
continues to move up,

355
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,400
I will get on the bus at
the University Town stop.

356
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,280
But what about you?

357
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,520
Will you still get on?

358
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,000
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE BUS EXPLOSION

359
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,480
LATEST EXPLOSION INCIDENT

360
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,520
LATEST EXPLOSION NEWS

361
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,280
ON MAY 9TH AT 1:45
P.M., A BUS EXPLODED

362
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,600
A BUS IN JIALIN EXPLODED, A BLACK
BOX RECORDS THE TERRIFYING MOMENT

363
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,480
A ROUTE 45 BUS EXPLODES
ON A BRIDGE IN JIALIN

364
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,160
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES
IS STILL UNKNOWN.

365
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,400
THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS
STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.

366
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,496
THE DRIVER USED A
LIGHTER TO HAVE A SMOKE,

367
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,640
BUT IT ACCIDENTALLY EXPLODED

368
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,320
JIANG FENG, BRAVELY SACRIFICED

369
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,120
- About Jiang Feng...
- Is she the one who called the police?

370
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,960
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

371
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,160
Here's the information.

372
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,040
We interrogated her
for almost two hours.

373
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,040
All she talked about
was a time loop.

374
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,520
Did you know her before?

375
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
No. I don't remember her.

376
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,360
What did she say?

377
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
A time loop?

378
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,400
She's stuck in a
time loop on the bus?

379
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,320
It sounds crazy,

380
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,840
but she insists on her story.

381
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,000
Moreover, she's not alone.

382
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,920
She seems to be very concerned

383
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,000
about whether the
police dispatched.

384
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,120
That's what's suspicious.

385
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,400
She is very concerned,
especially about you.

386
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
She said that she saw
you and Jiang Feng

387
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,880
in a previous loop,

388
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,640
but not this time.

389
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,440
That's why I asked
if you knew her.

390
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,720
Also, there's something
else that's strange.

391
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,400
Our task force was just formed.

392
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,840
How does she know about
you and Jiang Feng?

393
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,920
Mr. Zhang.

394
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,840
I HAVE READ THE ABOVE TRANSCRIPT

395
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,560
AND IT IS A TRUE
COPY OF MY STATEMENT.

396
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Li Shiqing.

397
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,360
I read your statement.

398
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,480
I got the gist

399
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,440
of the time loop you mentioned.

400
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,840
In your statement,

401
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,400
I see that you said this twice.

402
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,800
"Why don't I see
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Jiang?"

403
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,800
Is that right?

404
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,440
How did you know they would
take part in this operation?

405
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,480
Because every time the police took
action, you both would be there.

406
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
But I didn't see you this time.

407
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,000
I thought something
happened to you.

408
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,480
We indeed

409
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,080
lost an officer.

410
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,560
Is it Mr. Jiang?

411
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,600
I'm sorry.

412
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
I'm sorry.

413
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,240
Why do you say that?

414
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,520
I called the police.

415
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,080
That's why Mr. Jiang died.

416
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,880
You were right to
call the police.

417
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,600
It's because you
called the police

418
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,960
that we were able to plan ahead

419
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,680
and stop the bus on the
river-crossing bridge.

420
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Li Shiqing.

421
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,176
Calling the police right
away in an emergency

422
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,480
is the duty of every citizen.

423
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,280
Cooperating with the police

424
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
after the accident

425
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,080
and telling the truth

426
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,560
is also the duty
of every caller.

427
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Do you understand?

428
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,080
I told the truth.

429
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,280
But no matter what I say,
whether I tell the truth or not,

430
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,400
you guys won't believe me.

431
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
I'm really at my wits' end.

432
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,200
I don't know what to do.

433
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,080
Li Shiqing.

434
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880
I have a few more
questions for you.

435
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
After you called the police,

436
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,400
you turned off your
phone right away.

437
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,080
Why?

438
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,880
I wanted you guys to
dispatch immediately

439
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,520
and not waste time
questioning me on the phone.

440
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,720
It's because there
really wasn't any time.

441
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,680
After you turned off your phone,

442
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,600
as you were leaving
the bus stop,

443
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,240
you were mumbling.

444
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,720
Were you talking to yourself?

445
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
Or…

446
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,600
Were you talking
to someone else?

447
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
Do you not remember?

448
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,680
Do you know this boy?

449
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,880
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP, JIALIN

450
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
UNKNOWN NUMBER

451
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
Track this number and verify
the caller's identity.

452
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,800
Answer it. I'll
put it on speaker.

453
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,200
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

454
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,920
<i>Li Shiqing.</i>

455
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Who is it?

456
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
<i>It's Xiao Heyun.</i>

457
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,080
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

458
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,520
Are you still there?

459
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,200
We've broken up.
Don't call me again.

460
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Go to sleep.

461
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,440
You'll be fine

462
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,600
after some sleep.

463
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,760
