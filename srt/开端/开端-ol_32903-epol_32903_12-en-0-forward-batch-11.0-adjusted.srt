JIALIN PUBLIC TRANSPORT
GROUP LTD., OFFICE 403

2
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,000
First, they went to the bus
company pretending to be reporters.

3
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,960
Then they went to Wang
Xingde's dormitory.

4
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
The last call made
from Xiao Heyun's phone

5
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,720
was to a locksmith.

6
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,040
What are they trying to do?

7
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,240
Are they trying to
destroy some evidence?

8
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,120
Wang Xingde's roommate
just happened to come back

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
so the locksmith
company didn't go there.

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,536
But the people they interacted
with have already been picked up.

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
They are on their way.

12
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Maybe these two
aren't witnesses.

13
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Perhaps…

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,640
it's possible that they coerced
Tao Yinghong and Wang Xingde.

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
They purposely came to us

16
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,440
to lead the investigation
in the wrong direction

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
and bury evidence against them.

18
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,800
Don't jump to conclusions.

19
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,200
Play this video for me.

20
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Okay.

21
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,680
Just to let you know,

22
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,240
we need both of your phones

23
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,440
and all other electronic
devices for investigation.

24
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Of course.

25
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,760
You can use your phones to
contact your family first

26
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,720
and let them know

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,400
that you've been cooperating
here at the police station.

28
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Do you have two phones?

29
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,920
Yes.

30
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,600
- Is this yours too?
- Yes.

31
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,216
Are you sure you don't
want to call home?

32
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,760
It's okay. I've
already told them.

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
Thank you for your cooperation.

34
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,600
It's okay. We want to stay.

35
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,040
We want to see if we can help.

36
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,320
We won't feel at
ease if we go home.

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Yes.

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,160
Your girlfriend is indeed
not in a good condition.

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,400
- Mr. Zhang, I'm here for the electronics.
- Here.

40
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Mr. Zhang.

41
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,600
Do you have any new leads?

42
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Yes, a few.

43
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you know where
the bomb came from?

44
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
We're still verifying it.

45
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,720
It's related to that lady with
the plastic bag, isn't it?

46
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,880
Tell me. Why do you ask that?

47
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,400
Didn't you say she worked
at a chemical plant?

48
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
You heard everything?

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,880
I thought you weren't paying attention
since you weren't feeling well.

50
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,400
- I was the one who told her.
- I…

51
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,200
We analyzed it just now.

52
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,240
If this woman worked
in a chemical plant,

53
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,280
isn't it easy for her
to collect chemicals?

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,240
If she had enough knowledge,

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,040
<i>could she have created
the bomb herself?</i>

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,080
<i>I have another question for you.</i>

57
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,600
<i>You said you smelled
chemicals in the bus</i>

58
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
<i>and that it came from
the pressure cooker.</i>

59
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,400
<i>Can you describe
the smell to me?</i>

60
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
It's…

61
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
It's hard to say. It
was kind of pungent.

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,600
It was a sharp smell that you
don't commonly come across.

63
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,400
It stank a little.

64
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,880
It was…

65
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,800
<i>I don't know what
chemical it was.</i>

66
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,280
<i>I don't know much
about that stuff.</i>

67
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,480
<i>- Anyway…
- It was a little…</i>

68
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,160
<i>- Did you smell it too?
- Yes.</i>

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
<i>I didn't pay much attention.</i>

70
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
<i>It did smell a bit.</i>

71
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,200
<i>But it's summer. It's normal
for the bus to smell a bit.</i>

72
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Ms. Du.

73
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,480
PHONE RECORD

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,160
PHONE RECORD

75
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,920
Mr. Zhang, Wang Xingde
and Tao Yinghong

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,680
never had any direct contact
with Li Shiqing and Xiao Heyun.

77
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,856
There's nothing suspicious
on any of their call records.

78
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,360
They had no interactions either.

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,920
There's nothing
suspicious so far.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
<i>We're still digging for more.</i>

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,760
You both smelled
such a unique smell.

82
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,920
Then the other passengers
must have smelled it too.

83
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,080
How did they react?

84
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,376
I don't think they had
much of a reaction.

85
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,320
There were so many people
on the bus. A bit of...

86
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,120
Mr. Zhang, I suddenly
thought of a question.

87
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,480
What did she do at
the chemical plant?

88
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,320
She was a quality inspector.

89
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Quality inspector?

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
In that case,

91
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,240
she has the ability to
make her own bomb, right?

92
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,840
Then we were right.

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,600
She had the ability
and the means to do it.

94
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,320
Can't that prove she
made the bomb herself?

95
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,120
WHAT ABOUT XIAO
HEYUN'S OTHER PHONE?

96
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,880
MR. ZHANG: WHAT ABOUT
XIAO HEYUN'S OTHER PHONE?

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,960
It's still being recovered.

98
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,280
It really doesn't.

99
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,200
It only proves that she had
the means to commit the crime,

100
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,440
but none of this can
be used as evidence.

101
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,880
So are you not going
to investigate?

102
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
<i>Mr. Zhang.</i>

103
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
The fish has taken the bait.

104
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
You can reel it in.

105
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,080
Of course we'll look into it.

106
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,480
I have a question
for both of you.

107
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
Before you came here
after getting off the bus,

108
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,640
you two pretended to be reporters
and went to the bus company.

109
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,760
Can you tell me

110
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640
why you went there?

111
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,320
CITIZENS ARE LIKE THE SEA,
TREASURE EVERY DROP OF WATER

112
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,960
AUTHORITY CARRIES
WEIGHT, DON'T ABUSE IT

113
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,360
JIALIN CRIME POLICE

114
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,600
Recall your memories.

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,800
Did these two go
to the bus company

116
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
to ask about Wang Xingde?

117
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,400
Yes, it's them.

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,016
They said they're students from
the university television station

119
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,520
who want to interview
Wang Xingde.

120
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,400
That's not what they told me.

121
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,120
He said he was Wang
Xingde's relative.

122
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,680
I knew something
was off about them.

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
Just after they came to
look for Wang Xingde,

124
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,760
we were notified that Wang
Xingde was in an accident.

125
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,720
In the blink of an
eye, they disappeared.

126
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,280
Did they get any
information from you?

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,840
They didn't have the chance.

128
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,760
When we started talking about Wang Xingde,
I got notified that he died and left.

129
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,960
I didn't get to tell them.

130
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,320
What about you?

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,520
The man said he came to
get the household register.

132
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,720
I realized they
searched the whole house

133
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,880
only after they left.

134
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,120
The woman kept
asking me questions

135
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,120
about Mr. Wang's family.

136
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,600
Other than that,

137
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,840
she didn't say anything else.

138
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,800
She was very emotional
after watching the news.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,440
She kept saying she indirectly caused
the deaths of everyone on the bus.

140
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,560
What does it have
to do with her?

141
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,680
But she kept saying that, so I…

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,640
We happened to be nearby,

143
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,480
so I took her to the company,
thinking she might feel more at ease

144
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
if we figure things out.

145
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,400
At first, I didn't really believe
there would be a bomb on the bus.

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
But the more we dug,
the more serious it got.

147
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,520
This has gone beyond
our capabilities,

148
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,960
so we thought we'd
report it to the police.

149
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,520
I know we're being
very suspicious,

150
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,240
but we're definitely
not bad people.

151
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,440
If you don't believe us, you
can check our identities,

152
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,320
our school, or our workplaces.

153
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,240
We'll cooperate.

154
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,040
After a disaster happens,

155
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,040
many survivors feel a
strong sense of guilt.

156
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
They feel like disaster struck

157
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,520
because they didn't
do well enough.

158
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,600
They even question themselves,

159
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,200
"Why am I still alive?"

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
The more moral you are,

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,720
the stronger that feeling is.

162
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
We call this condition

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,920
"survivor syndrome."

164
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,800
Is there such a thing?

165
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,760
We gave all the information
we know to you right away.

166
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,360
Could you

167
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,480
also update us with all the
information you currently have?

168
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,680
That way…

169
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm just quite
worried about her.

170
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,600
Ignore me and tell
her. It's fine.

171
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,920
I really just want an answer.

172
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,920
Mr. Zhang, come to
the surveillance room.

173
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

174
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,600
<i>Sit for a bit first.</i>

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Do you think he'll believe us?

176
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,480
I don't know.

177
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,200
She made the bomb in a garage.

178
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,736
The residence is on the second floor
and the first floor is the garage.

179
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,840
In addition to raw materials
used to make explosives,

180
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,520
we also detected traces of a
chemical explosion at the scene.

181
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,640
What about fingerprints?

182
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,440
Among the fingerprints
found at the scene,

183
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,040
they all belong only
to Tao Yinghong.

184
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,760
That matches up.

185
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
She made a bomb in the
garage that she rented.

186
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Aside from the garage,
did you search her house?

187
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,640
Yes.

188
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,600
Our colleagues
from the cyber team

189
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
found transaction records of
chemicals on her computer.

190
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,120
They were all done online.

191
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
We're in the process
of verifying them.

192
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,800
I'll get Xiaoliu to
update you later.

193
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,496
Arrange for the relevant departments
to cooperate with the investigation.

194
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,760
Call the cyber team to follow
up on the transactions.

195
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,720
Verify the merchants.

196
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I got it.

197
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
From the looks of it,

198
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,440
it's becoming less and less
likely that these two are guilty.

199
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
By the way,

200
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,280
what's the situation
at the bus company now?

201
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,120
Wang Xingde's roommate said

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,280
that after the two arrived,

203
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
one of them went
rummaging inside,

204
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,200
while the other one probed
for details outside.

205
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,920
The topic mainly revolved around

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,960
how Tao Yinghong and Wang
Xingde's relationship is

207
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
and how they get along.

208
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,360
So it seems like Shiqing
and Heyun's tracks

209
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,560
basically match up
with what they said.

210
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,480
They are indeed looking
for their motives.

211
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,240
Was there anything suspicious
at Wang Xingde's place?

212
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,520
It was turned over.

213
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,376
Logically speaking, these two should've
been there to destroy evidence.

214
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,880
Then why did they leave such
obvious traces of a rummage?

215
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,320
And according to what
the roommate said,

216
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,400
if these two didn't
approach him,

217
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,920
they wouldn't have
made any contact.

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,680
Why would they leave
another witness?

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,960
When can the flower-patterned
phone be recovered?

220
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
Soon. I'll ask the
tech team to hurry.

221
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Mr. Zhang.

222
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,280
Right now, these two witnesses
have me a little puzzled.

223
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
We need to find out the
truth as soon as possible

224
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,160
no matter what it takes.

225
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,000
They are here with us now,

226
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,600
so everything is in our control.

227
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
I got it.

228
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,480
JIALIN POLICE STATION,
YANJIANG BRANCH

229
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,080
What is the meaning of this?

230
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,200
Don't worry.

231
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,520
It's just a routine inspection.

232
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Thank you.

233
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,080
We can almost be certain

234
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,760
that the bomb

235
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,520
was made by Tao
Yinghong herself.

236
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,280
<i>In that case,</i>

237
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,800
<i>over the four years that the
couple has been in Jialin,</i>

238
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,360
one got familiar with the route
and the other created the bomb.

239
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,960
Was all of this just to
cause today's incident?

240
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,280
Your deduction makes sense.

241
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,280
I just want to know

242
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
what other details you remember

243
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,640
that you can provide to us?

244
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,760
That pressure cooker…

245
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,720
I remember she was
very alert at the time.

246
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,760
She kept her hands on
the pressure cooker,

247
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,560
<i>so I'm wondering</i>

248
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,880
<i>if it could be the device
used to detonate the bomb?</i>

249
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,480
But I think

250
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,360
since she's capable
of making a bomb,

251
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,280
could it be a time bomb?

252
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,440
Because she kept going
on and on about 1:45 p.m.

253
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,200
Could it have

254
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,360
a special meaning to them?

255
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm just guessing.

256
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
Yezi.

257
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,560
Check the case files.

258
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,000
See if there are any past accidents
on the river-crossing bridge

259
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,760
that are related to
the time of 1:45 p.m.

260
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I got it.

261
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
By the way,

262
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,200
about the flower-patterned phone
that you guys took away just now…

263
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,160
I got it from Wang
Xingde's dormitory.

264
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
Why didn't you tell me just now?

265
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,160
Well, I was a bit scared.

266
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,839
This is the police station.

267
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,640
I stole it after all.

268
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,760
I felt that the phone
was so out of place

269
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,680
in that environment.

270
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,920
I don't think it's his.

271
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,880
So I wanted to take it out and
see if there was any information.

272
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,599
We already knew that
the phone wasn't yours.

273
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm glad you told us yourself.

274
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,520
Do they have kids?

275
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,640
What I mean is,

276
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,840
could the phone
belong to their child?

277
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,480
SPOUSE INFORMATION: TAO YINGHONG

278
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,216
CHILDREN INFORMATION: WANG MENGMENG,
BIRTH DATE: DECEMBER 21ST, 1993

279
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,360
HOUSEHOLD REGISTRY: CANCELED

280
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Mr. Zhang.

281
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,280
<i>They indeed have a daughter.</i>

282
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
<i>Wang Mengmeng.</i>

283
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
She died five years ago.

284
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,000
We found out that they
do have a daughter.

285
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,200
Her name is Wang Mengmeng.

286
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
However,

287
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,600
she passed away five years ago.

288
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,760
<i>Miss.</i>

289
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,600
Are you studying at
Jialin Normal University?

290
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Yes.

291
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
My daughter goes there too.

292
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,840
Your daughter goes there too?

293
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
Which graduation
class is she in?

294
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,560
What major?

295
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,760
She's working now.

296
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,560
Following this logic,

297
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,880
the death of his
daughter, Wang Mengmeng,

298
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,760
could be the key to
solving this case.

299
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,880
<i>Mr. Zhang, come to
the conference room.</i>

300
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,120
By the way, if you two

301
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,440
think of any details,

302
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,880
tell me right away.

303
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Okay.

304
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,480
You must be hungry.

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,280
I'll have someone bring
you some food later.

306
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,520
Thank you.

307
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,240
He said his daughter
died five years ago.

308
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,240
But I remember

309
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,600
Wang Xingde told me that his
daughter also went to my school

310
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,520
and that she had graduated
and started working.

311
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,800
Why did he lie?

312
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,680
Right.

313
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
When we went to his dormitory,

314
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,080
his roommate told me

315
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,680
that they didn't
have a good marriage.

316
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,080
So do you think those two
were in on it together

317
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,880
or was Wang Xingde coerced?

318
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Mr. Zhang.

319
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,360
Mr. Zhang.

320
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,136
- What is it?
- The phone can't be turned on.

321
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,040
The tech team said it will take
some time to pull out what's inside.

322
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,800
But we checked the SIM card.

323
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,976
It belongs to Wang Xingde
and Tao Yinghong's daughter,

324
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Wang Mengmeng.

325
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,520
- Did you check the call history?
- I did.

326
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,320
Wang Mengmeng's last call

327
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,440
was 5 years ago on
May 13th, at 1:44 p.m.

328
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,160
The person she called
was Wang Xingde,

329
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,560
but he didn't answer.

330
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
1:44 p.m.?

331
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,520
Mr. Zhang, come.
Have a seat first.

332
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Yezi.

333
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Play it.

334
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,600
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, JIALIN

335
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,160
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, JIALIN

336
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,560
Stop.

337
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,520
The time was exactly 1:45 p.m.

338
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,040
That's Wang Xingde and Tao Yinghong's
daughter, Wang Mengmeng, right?

339
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,040
On May 13th, 5 years ago,

340
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,560
there was a car accident on the
river-crossing bridge in Jialin.

341
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
She died on the spot.

342
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,720
The time of the incident just
so happens to be 1:45 p.m.

343
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,880
It's quite obvious

344
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,760
that the time and
place of the bombing

345
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,000
were the same as Wang Mengmeng's
accident five years ago.

346
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,960
Also, at the time
of the incident,

347
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,280
Wang Mengmeng was also
on the Route 45 bus.

348
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
There's one more thing.

349
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,160
The accident happened on
May 13th, 5 years ago.

350
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,520
It's only May 9th today.

351
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,680
Why did they move it up?

352
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,320
I visited the place where the
couple lived in Gangwu New Village.

353
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,976
Someone in their neighborhood told
me that starting this afternoon,

354
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,960
fireproof tests are being
done in all the garages,

355
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,640
so it's highly likely they were
forced to push it up to today

356
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
because they can no
longer hide the evidence.

357
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,440
What's coincidental is that

358
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,080
the reason for this
fire inspection

359
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,000
is because on April 4th,

360
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
there was a small fire
in Tao Yinghong's garage.

361
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,720
Notice of today's fire inspection
was given at the last minute.

362
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,520
This case…

363
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,560
Everything adds up too easily.

364
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,840
This entire case

365
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,680
has taken less than eight hours
since the incident happened.

366
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,040
Every step we've made

367
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,880
was in the right direction.

368
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,160
Every breakthrough we've
made has been smooth.

369
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
That's why it seems too easy.

370
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,600
If these two young people
hadn't come forward,

371
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,080
we would've taken
a few wrong turns.

372
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,320
With our usual
investigation routine.

373
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Mr. Zhang.

374
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,600
What do you think
they are after?

375
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,280
- Mr. Zhang.
- What did you say?

376
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,520
I asked you what you
think they're after.

377
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,040
According to them,

378
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,840
they just want to know

379
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,840
Wang Xingde's real motive.

380
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
But no matter what,

381
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,800
with all the information
we have gathered so far,

382
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,800
we have a very clear direction
on how to solve this case.

383
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
While you two wait
for the case file,

384
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,920
contact the civilian police

385
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,680
who handled Wang
Mengmeng's case back then.

386
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,600
Get all the surveillance footage
inside and outside the bus.

387
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,120
- Yes.
- I got it.

388
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Come on.

389
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,920
As for the two youngsters…

390
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,240
I'll handle them.

391
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Okay.

392
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,800
I realized a problem.

393
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,480
We went to all this trouble

394
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,000
to find the driver's motive

395
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,400
so we can try to get him to
stop the bus and open the door.

396
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
But if the motive

397
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,320
is really related to
his daughter's death,

398
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,440
then there's nothing we can do.

399
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,120
His daughter's death
is already a fact.

400
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
We can't change it.

401
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,040
So we still have to
stop the explosion.

402
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,840
Actually, the best way

403
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,040
is to find out what the police would
do if they faced a situation like this.

404
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,280
But the problem is…

405
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,800
Will they tell us?

406
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,560
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
I arranged such a
late dinner for you.

408
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,160
I wasn't sure if you
could eat spicy food.

409
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,440
How is it?

410
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,040
Do you like rice
noodles with clams?

411
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,440
It's good.

412
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,760
Did you recall any details?

413
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,960
I just wanted to ask

414
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
if you're sure that the
phone is Wang Mengmeng's?

415
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,520
Also,

416
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
can you tell me how
Wang Mengmeng died?

417
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,560
We just want to know
if the couple's motive

418
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,520
has something to do with
their daughter's death.

419
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,640
It's like this.

420
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,840
The incident has
already happened.

421
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,800
Even if you know their motive,

422
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,160
what can you do?

423
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,440
Then what if…

424
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,120
What if it didn't happen?

425
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,240
I mean, what if…

426
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,840
What if the moment
I open my eyes,

427
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,360
I find myself back
on the bus again?

428
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,520
The bomb is already on the bus

429
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,640
and there are less
than 20 minutes

430
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,440
until the explosion
happens at 1:45 p.m.

431
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,960
There's such little time.

432
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,480
Knowing that there's a bomb
and who the culprit is,

433
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,120
what can the two of us
do to stop the explosion?

434
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,080
That's enough. Stop asking.

435
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,600
This had nothing to do with you.

436
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
From the time the woman
got on until we got off,

437
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,880
it was only five minutes.

438
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,080
We're not secret
agents. What can we do?

439
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
Then should we do
nothing and just wait?

440
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,080
Do we just wait to be blown up?

441
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,760
This incident has
already happened.

442
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,560
There's no way to
change it. You…

443
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,000
Stop thinking about it.

444
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,840
I had no idea you were
this kind of person.

445
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Let me explain.

446
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,040
If that were to happen,

447
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,016
the police usually wouldn't
choose to stop the bus.

448
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,200
That's because it could
provoke the suspect

449
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,920
and end up detonating
the bomb earlier.

450
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,520
The police would usually choose

451
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,440
to have a police officer pretend
to be a passenger in advance

452
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,120
and get on the bus
at the next stop.

453
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,960
We would position our people
based on the suspect's location

454
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
and find the right moment

455
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,040
to control them.

456
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,520
Then we would defuse the bomb.

457
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,760
In that case,

458
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
there's only Yanjiang
East Road stop.

459
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,440
There are no more
stops after that.

460
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,040
Would you guys be able to
make it in five minutes?

461
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,400
Five minutes?

462
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,600
That's too tight.

463
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,120
So the safest way

464
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,800
is to get on the bus at
Yanjiang East Road stop.

465
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,480
Delaying the time that the
bus arrives at the stop

466
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,760
might be able to buy the police some time
to get arranged. That's all I'm saying.

467
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,640
Delay the time…

468
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,640
Mr. Zhang, we're having a meeting
in the task force conference room.

469
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
Okay, I'll be right there.

470
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,200
Mr. Zhang.

471
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,640
I still want to know
how Wang Mengmeng died.

472
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,600
She…

473
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,920
She died in a car accident.

474
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,320
Five years ago,

475
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,040
on a Route 45 bus,

476
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,000
on May 13th at 1:45 p.m.,

477
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,440
Wang Mengmeng got off the bus ahead
of time on the river-crossing bridge

478
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,560
and got into an accident.

479
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Why did she get
off on the bridge?

480
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,280
If one day,

481
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,560
you get a text from a stranger,

482
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,920
saying that there's a bus that
will explode in 20 minutes

483
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,560
and they need your help,

484
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,520
would you trust him and
dispatch right away?

485
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,280
I would dispatch
with no hesitation.

486
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,520
Wouldn't you think
it could be a prank

487
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,920
or someone making
a false report?

488
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
We'll find him no matter what

489
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,880
and hold him
legally responsible.

490
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
But if it's true,

491
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
dispatching right away

492
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,600
could save a whole
bus of people, right?

493
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,520
I'm sure it's not just me.

494
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,400
All my colleagues would
make the same choice.

495
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
That's why we are
police officers.

496
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
I got it.

497
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,920
Mr. Zhang.

498
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
May I have your number?

499
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,440
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

500
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,680
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang East Road.</i>

501
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
What happened to you?

502
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
Why are you bleeding?

503
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Here.

504
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,360
Are you okay?

505
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm okay.

506
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,640
Actually, after the
time stopped moving up,

507
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,920
I could feel that

508
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,040
my health has been
deteriorating.

509
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,240
If the time loop
isn't infinite for me…

510
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,360
It's okay.

511
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,800
We did so much
preparation this time.

512
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,360
We'll definitely succeed.

513
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,840
MR. ZHANG, THE ROUTE 45 BUS THAT
JUST LEFT GANGWU NEW VILLAGE…

514
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,960
These two are the
most likely suspects.

515
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,200
Pull out their files
and show them to me.

516
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Okay.

517
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,880
UNKNOWN NUMBER

518
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,000
Hello. Who is it?

519
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,440
Mr. Zhang,

520
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,800
I sent you a picture.
Take a look at it.

521
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,920
Who are you?

522
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,080
<i>Take a look at it.</i>

523
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,000
Then get back to me.

524
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,360
MR. ZHANG, THERE IS A BOMB
ONBOARD THE ROUTE 45 BUS

525
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,040
THAT JUST LEFT
GANGWU NEW VILLAGE!

526
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
I got it.

527
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,600
I GOT IT

528
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Pervert!

529
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
Ma'am, this man is a pervert.

530
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
He just touched me.

531
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,560
- Young man, how could you do that?
- I…

532
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,480
What's happening?

533
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,920
- I didn't do anything.
- Sir.

534
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Let's pull over.

535
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,160
This pervert touched
me while I was asleep.

536
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,800
Don't listen to her nonsense.

537
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,536
You tried to cop a
feel in broad daylight!

538
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,056
- Why are you filming? Did I say you can?
- Stay away!

539
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,296
- Be careful. Don't fight!
- Stop!

540
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,576
- Did you hear?
- Why are you taking my phone?

541
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,216
- Did I say you can film me?
- Don't go up to him.

542
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,600
We're filming so
we have evidence.

543
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,320
Don't go up to him.
He's a pervert.

544
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,640
- If you get any closer…
- They're fighting back there.

545
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
- Sir.
- Stop it!

546
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
I'll pull over in front.
Hurry and get off.

547
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,160
Don't worry, we're here. He
can't do anything to you.

548
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,120
How shameless.

549
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Get off now.

550
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Is there anything else?

551
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,000
My bag is on my seat.

552
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,240
Don't move.

553
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,080
I'm not getting off.

554
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,000
Why should I get off?

555
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,400
I didn't do anything wrong.

556
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,656
You're the one who should get
off. Come with me to the police.

557
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,280
Fine. I'm not afraid.

558
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,480
Where's my flash drive?

559
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,936
- What...
- Did you take my flash drive?

560
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,679
I didn't. Don't accuse me.

561
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,000
Then where is my flash drive?

562
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,480
- Young man, what…
- It's the same color as the floor.

563
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,040
Let's hurry and
help him find it.

564
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,920
Get him off the bus too.

565
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
A flash drive?

566
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,639
There are files on it.

567
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,199
What is going on?

568
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,159
All right, stop looking.

569
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,440
She said you sexually
harassed her.

570
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,360
You said she stole
your flash drive.

571
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,520
I didn't harass her!

572
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,639
I didn't steal it either.

573
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,896
There's surely something
wrong with you two.

574
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,840
We can't help you two.

575
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,639
Let's call the police.

576
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,600
- No, don't close the door.
- Wait, open the door.

577
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,320
I haven't gotten off yet, sir.

578
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,320
- Sir.
- Sir, don't close the door!

579
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,240
Sir.

580
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,080
- Didn't I say I'm getting off?
- Sir, let them off.

581
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,760
Stop messing around. We
have stuff to do at home.

582
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,440
- My goodness.
- I'm busy too.

583
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,680
But those two can't get off.

584
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,360
Keep driving.

585
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,120
The police station is two stops
away. Go there and talk it out.

586
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
There's CCTV anyway.
I'm not afraid of you.

587
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
Okay.

588
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm right anyway.

589
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,360
I'm not afraid.

590
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,240
You definitely took
my flash drive.

591
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,080
Youngsters are so
hard to understand.

592
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,280
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

593
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Mr. Zhang.

594
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,840
We've dispersed the people.

595
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Our people have
surrounded the area.

596
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Okay, I got it.

597
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,296
Once the bus arrives, take action
at both the front and rear doors.

598
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,400
You must be quick. Stay safe.

599
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Copy that.

600
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,360
Go after it!

601
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,560
Why didn't you stop
at the bus stop, sir?

602
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
The bus kept going.

603
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
What's happening?

604
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,840
Sir, why didn't you stop?

605
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,760
There were people on
the platform, sir.

606
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Why didn't you stop?

607
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,320
<i>- Mr. Zhang, the bridge is sealed.</i>
- Get in.

608
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
I got it. I'll follow
them from the rear.

609
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,560
Is the bomb still on the bus?

610
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,960
<i>Listen to me.</i>

611
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,520
Be careful.

612
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,680
<i>If conditions permit,</i>

613
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,200
keep in touch with me.

614
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,800
Okay, bye.

615
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,640
There are police cars
following us. What's happening?

616
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,320
You're right.

617
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,320
Stop the bus, sir.

618
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,360
The bus ahead, pull over!

619
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Pull over!

620
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Stay still!

621
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,760
- What's happening?
- Nobody moves.

622
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,880
The bus must get on the bridge.

623
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Sit down!

624
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Nobody moves!

625
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,560
This woman wants
to blow up the bus.

626
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,360
The bomb is in this plastic
bag. Everybody, stay back.

627
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,720
Blow up the bus?

628
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,360
Mr. Jiao, help!

629
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,600
- Help!
- Quick!

630
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Let go.

631
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,760
Let go of me!

632
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,640
Let go of me!

633
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,680
Let go of me!

634
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,760
Let go of me!

635
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,720
Let go of me!

636
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Attention.

637
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,240
The bus is speeding
up onto the bridge.

638
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,160
Roger that. The
bridge is set up.

639
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,360
- Let go of me!
- Sir, stop the bus!

640
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,000
- Let go of me!
- What are you thinking? Stop the bus!

641
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,160
The driver is her accomplice.

642
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,640
Sir, stop the bus!

643
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,520
The police already
know about your plan.

644
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,216
- There's still a chance if you stop now.
- We're almost on the bridge.

645
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,520
Turn yourselves in.

646
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,776
If you turn yourself in, they
might be lenient with you.

647
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,200
Mengmeng is waiting for us.

648
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,440
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, 1,500 M

649
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,680
Mengmeng is waiting for us.

650
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,016
- She's waiting on the bridge.
- Yes.

651
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,640
What happened to Wang
Mengmeng was unfortunate.

652
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,840
But that's not a reason for you to
drag a bus of people to die with you.

653
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,320
They're all innocent.

654
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
That's nonsense!

655
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,240
How do you know Wang Mengmeng?

656
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,240
- Let go!
- I know Wang Mengmeng

657
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,200
was in an accident on the
bridge five years ago.

658
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
I know.

659
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,680
Stop the bus.

660
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,920
Nonsense!

661
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,680
- It has been five years.
- Stop the bus.

662
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,360
If you can't let it go, ask
the police to reinvestigate it.

663
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,720
You don't have to do this.

664
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,760
The driver has been reprimanded.

665
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,480
But Mengmeng asked
to get off herself.

666
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,760
- Bullshit!
- She...

667
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,496
If you wanted to investigate,
you would've already done so.

668
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,160
You wouldn't have
forgotten all about it.

669
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,080
What's the use of
saying this now?

670
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,720
Yinghong.

671
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,840
You were right.

672
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
You were right to insist.

673
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,400
Hang in there.

674
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
Mengmeng is waiting
for us in front.

675
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,560
Driver Wang Xingde,

676
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,160
pull over immediately.

677
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,640
Driver Wang Xingde,

678
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,000
this is your last warning.

679
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,680
Pull over immediately!

680
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,840
Stop the bus, sir!

681
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,640
Wang Xingde, stop
the bus right now!

682
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,920
Come to your senses now.

683
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,200
Tell us any requests you have.

684
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,120
We'll do our best
to fulfill them.

685
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,320
Stop the bus now.

686
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,600
Open the door, sir!

687
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,880
Sir, open the door!

688
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,360
Let go!

689
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,080
Wang Xingde, open
the door right now!

690
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,480
- Police!
- Police!

691
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,400
- Get out!
- Open the door!

692
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
Open the door now!

693
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,120
Let go!

694
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,640
- Turn off the engine!
- Let…

695
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,400
Open the door!

696
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
Turn off the engine!

697
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,240
