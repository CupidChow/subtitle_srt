00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,880
MAY 13TH, 5 YEARS AGO

2
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,200
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

3
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,840
<i>We've arrived at
Gangwu New Village.</i>

4
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,720
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

5
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

6
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,880
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

7
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,760
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

8
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,120
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang East Road.</i>

9
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

10
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,760
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

11
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,320
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

12
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

13
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Hello?

14
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
Hello, Mom?

15
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I…

16
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,440
I was just on the bus.

17
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
I encountered a pervert.

18
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,640
Gosh! What happened?

19
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,080
Were you taken advantage of?

20
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
- What is it?
- Are you okay?

21
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,720
<i>It wasn't me, Mom. It wasn't.</i>

22
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
<i>I saw a man. He…</i>

23
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,480
He rubbed his lower
body on a girl.

24
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

25
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Why did you leave
that out at first?

26
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
You scared me.

27
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,280
I thought something
happened to you.

28
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,360
Mom.

29
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,760
Let me tell you. I…

30
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,360
I took a photo of that
pervert's face with my phone.

31
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,200
Do you think I should
call the police now?

32
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,240
When you photographed him,

33
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,200
did he see you?

34
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
I don't know.

35
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,080
But that guy kept
looking back at me.

36
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
And he walked towards me.

37
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
I was scared, so
I got off the bus.

38
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
Don't call the police.

39
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
You're all alone
in a foreign city.

40
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,080
Your dad and I aren't
there to keep you safe.

41
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Besides,

42
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,680
if you report this
to the police,

43
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,080
he would only be jailed
for a few days at most.

44
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,920
What if he retaliates? The…

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,040
<i>The consequences…</i>

46
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,960
<i>I don't even want
to think about it.</i>

47
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,120
That wouldn't happen.

48
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,560
<i>Why not?</i>

49
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,360
<i>If he remembers your face,</i>

50
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,520
<i>he could wait at the
school or bus stop.</i>

51
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,280
You wouldn't be able to hide.

52
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,600
<i>A pervert like him is
capable of anything.</i>

53
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
You saw it happen.

54
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,000
It's over.

55
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,360
Pretend it never happened.

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
Okay.

57
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
- Okay.
<i>- I've told you this before.</i>

58
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
From now on, when you go out,

59
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,920
don't wear those weird
clothes of yours.

60
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,960
Why are you bringing
that up again?

61
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,360
How are these weird?

62
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,840
<i>Look at your dresses.</i>

63
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Each one is shorter
than the other.

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,480
Your thighs are exposed.

65
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,160
<i>You're a girl.</i>

66
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,920
<i>Wearing something like
this won't do you any good.</i>

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,080
What era are we living in?

68
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,120
How can you say that?

69
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,520
<i>Don't give me that nonsense.</i>

70
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm saying this
for your own good.

71
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,960
Because of your way of thinking,

72
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,000
people always think
it's the girl's fault!

73
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,480
HORRIFIC SCENE ON BUS ON
RIVER-CROSSING BRIDGE,

74
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
TEEN GIRL'S FOOLISH
ACTIONS LEAD TO DEATH

75
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,520
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY WANG
MENGMENG LEAPT OFF THE BUS?

76
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,440
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE
GIRL IN THE ACCIDENT?

77
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,680
CHINESE LANGUAGE MAJOR STUDENT
WANG MENGMENG LEAPED OFF A BUS

78
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,920
WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE GIRL

79
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
WHO JUMPED OUT OF THE
BUS ON THE BRIDGE?

80
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,336
SHE COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OFF
BECAUSE SHE MISSED HER STOP

81
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,880
WHO KNOWS IF YOU'RE
TELLING THE TRUTH?

82
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,440
THE PASSENGERS MUST BE
TRAUMATIZED. THE GIRL WAS A RETARD

83
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,960
WHAT AN IDIOT

84
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
I'M SPEECHLESS…

85
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,640
YOU GUYS ARE ALL WRONG!
SHE DIDN'T MISS HER STOP…

86
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,000
SHE WASN'T A PSYCHO!

87
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,720
SHE ENCOUNTERED A
PERVERT ON THE BUS!

88
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
POST REPLY

89
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,001
SHE WASN'T A PSYCHO! SHE
ENCOUNTERED A PERVERT ON THE BUS!

90
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,320
I KNEW SOMEONE WOULD COME OUT

91
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,200
AND MAKE WAVES WITH
A DIFFERENT OPINION

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,799
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE YOU SAW IT
YOURSELF. ARE YOU DELUSIONAL?

93
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,960
IS IT TRUE JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY SO?
I'LL BELIEVE YOU IF YOU SHOW US EVIDENCE

94
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
IT'S EVEN WORSE IF
THIS PERSON HAS PROOF

95
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
THE STUDENT JUMPED TO HER DEATH

96
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,360
IF THIS PERSON DIDN'T STOP
WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE BUS,

97
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,040
THEY ARE NO DIFFERENT
FROM AN ACCOMPLICE

98
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,720
HER PARENTS WOULD
PROBABLY BEAT THEM UP

99
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,960
ANYONE WHO WITNESSES SEXUAL
HARASSMENT AND IGNORES IT

100
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,480
DESERVES TO DIE

101
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,400
IF IT'S TRUE, THEN
THEY'RE SELFISH

102
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,120
I HOPE IT'S NOT ANYONE I KNOW

103
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,840
THEY HAVE SOME
NERVE TO POST HERE

104
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,760
YES, IF THEY SAW AND IGNORED IT,
THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN THE ONE TO DIE.

105
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
When I wanted to
delete my comment,

106
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,120
I found that the administrator
had already locked the post.

107
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,480
I know I should
have said something.

108
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,640
I was too selfish and cowardly.

109
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,520
But their comments
were so harsh.

110
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,480
I was really scared.

111
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,800
I was just trying
to protect myself.

112
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
Show us the photo first.

113
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,320
Okay.

114
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
This is it.

115
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
I have changed my
phone many times.

116
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,960
This is the only
picture I never deleted.

117
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,520
Do you have a backup
copy of this photo?

118
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Like on a cloud or something?

119
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,120
Yes.

120
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,240
It's on the cloud.

121
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,600
If you need it,

122
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,360
I can give you my
account ID and password.

123
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,480
Remember.

124
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,160
Don't delete these photos
from your phone or the cloud.

125
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Don't tell anyone either.

126
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,960
These are very important
pieces of proof.

127
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,400
OUTPATIENT AND
INPATIENT DEPARTMENTS

128
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Jiang Feng.

129
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
- Li Shiqing, right?
- Yes.

130
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Go and help Xiao
Heyun pack his things.

131
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,400
We're going to
the station later.

132
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Come here.

133
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,520
Why did you act on your own?

134
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,680
I said, why did you
act on your own?

135
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,920
We don't have much time.

136
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,920
Do you know how worried
everyone is about you?

137
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,520
I just don't want Mr. Zhang's
death to be in vain.

138
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,480
I need to get to
the bottom of this.

139
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
This is the last thing
I can do for him.

140
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Let's go.

141
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,880
Go back and report to Ms. Du.

142
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,760
Did you see the
photo I sent you?

143
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,600
Yes.

144
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,400
What's wrong?

145
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm okay.

146
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,520
On the way back here,

147
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
I was thinking.

148
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,280
If I were Wang Mengmeng

149
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,640
and in a state of extreme fear,

150
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,600
would I have the
courage to fight back?

151
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,040
Tell me.

152
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,000
What if there are more girls

153
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,520
who experienced the same

154
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,760
but were afraid to speak up?

155
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,760
Don't worry.

156
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
This scumbag will be
punished for sure.

157
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,160
That's right.

158
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,640
Did you memorize the
address and password?

159
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,120
I did. Let me see it again.

160
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,320
You should memorize it too.

161
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
And do you also remember

162
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,400
Mr. Zhang's number

163
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
and the text you sent him?

164
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,760
I remember.

165
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Good.

166
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,880
When you wake up
in the next loop,

167
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,880
send a message to Mr. Zhang first
thing, then follow our previous plan.

168
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,840
Go to Mr. Jiao first.

169
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,560
- Then get Lu Di to help you...
- Hold on.

170
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,040
With Lu Di,

171
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,000
we wasted too much time on him

172
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,720
in one of our previous loops.

173
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,840
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

174
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,640
I think we need to minimize the
amount of time spent guiding him.

175
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Yes.

176
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
Let's say that Tao Yinghong
still can't be subdued.

177
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,440
- You...
- Get Wang Xingde.

178
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,960
Tell him the truth about
Wang Mengmeng's death.

179
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
There isn't anything wrong
with these procedures.

180
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,360
It's all about time.

181
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,680
- We need to buy as much time as possible.
- Yes.

182
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Yes.

183
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,960
Then there shouldn't
be a problem.

184
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,920
Look.

185
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,280
You can actually do all
these things on your own.

186
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,200
If…

187
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,480
If this is as far as I go,

188
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,360
then promise me.

189
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,280
You still have to get
out of the time loop.

190
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,560
I'm just saying.

191
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,280
What if that's a possibility?

192
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,960
I'm just talking nonsense.

193
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,560
Xiao Heyun, you…

194
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,880
I'm just too nervous.

195
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,640
I'm afraid of losing you.

196
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
Tell me.

197
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
What if there is no next time?

198
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
As in…

199
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
If…

200
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,560
When we wake up the next day,

201
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,400
we don't remember anything.

202
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,360
What should we do?

203
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,800
I'll remember you for sure.

204
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,480
Even if you forget about me,

205
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,040
I'll look for you.

206
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,600
I'll knock on your door.

207
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,040
I'll say to you,

208
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,080
"Hello, my name is Xiao Heyun.

209
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,400
Will you be my girlfriend?"

210
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,840
Yes.

211
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Xiao Heyun.

212
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,680
Xiao Heyun.

213
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,040
<i>Actually, after the
time stopped moving up,</i>

214
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,680
<i>I could feel</i>

215
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,080
<i>that my health has
been deteriorating.</i>

216
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,560
If the time loop
isn't infinite for me…

217
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,856
MR. ZHANG, THERE'S A BOMB ON THE BUS
WITH THE LICENSE PLATE JIA A77651

218
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,560
THAT JUST LEFT THE
GANGWU NEW VILLAGE STOP.

219
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,016
THE BOMB IS IN A PRESSURE COOKER
AT THE PICTURED WOMAN'S FEET

220
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,360
Mr. Zhang, I sent you a text.

221
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,840
Make sure to look carefully.

222
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,560
I'll be waiting for a reply.

223
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,880
PLEASE REMAIN CALM WHILE
YOU READ THIS MESSAGE.

224
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,120
I'M HELPING…

225
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,440
POLICE

226
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,400
Yu Lei, let's split up.

227
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,840
Take men to seal off the bridge.

228
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,480
Seal off the river
too, just in case.

229
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,920
Don't let ships near the bridge.

230
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
- I'll go after the bus.
- Okay.

231
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Sir.

232
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
THE WOMAN IN GRAY HAS
A BOMB AT HER FEET

233
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,400
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO RESTRAIN HER

234
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,680
Really?

235
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,280
Help me.

236
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
The road is closed.
You may pass.

237
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,560
POLICE

238
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,480
All vehicles, turn off your
sirens and lights immediately.

239
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:34,640
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

240
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,760
WE ARE ARRIVING AT
YANJIANG EAST ROAD!

241
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

242
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,240
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

243
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,680
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

244
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,560
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

245
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
What's going on?

246
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,080
Are you okay?

247
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,560
<i>We have cleared the bridge.</i>

248
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
We'll force the bus
to stop on the bridge.

249
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
From this point on,

250
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
keep me on the line.

251
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Mr. Zhang.

252
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,280
Wang Mengmeng's file is here.

253
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,800
UNKNOWN NUMBER

254
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,560
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

255
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,280
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>

256
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,840
THE WOMAN IN GRAY HAS
A BOMB AT HER FEET

257
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,120
I NEED YOUR HELP
TO MOVE THE BOMB

258
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,240
You're Lu,

259
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,760
Cat Apostle, Asthma Conqueror,
The One Chosen by Light, Di.

260
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,600
It doesn't matter how I know.

261
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,800
But you're the chosen one now.

262
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Help me.

263
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,160
POLICE

264
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,360
The target vehicle is
approaching the bridge.

265
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,160
Copy that. The bridge
is already sealed off.

266
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,360
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, 1,500 M

267
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,560
- Sir, I need to get off!
- Don't stop!

268
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,840
What's going on?

269
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,360
<i>Knife! Come and help! A knife!</i>

270
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,840
<i>- Why does she have a knife?
- She's going to blow up the bus! Help me!</i>

271
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,280
- Help me!
- Get her!

272
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,536
- Knife!
- Why does she have it?

273
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,880
She's going to blow up the bus!

274
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
Help me!

275
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,240
She's going to blow up
the bus! Get the knife!

276
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,480
- A knife?
- A knife!

277
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,400
Knife!

278
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,640
No!

279
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,960
No!

280
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,200
Let go!

281
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,520
Let…

282
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,920
Why is she acting on her own?

283
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,760
Let go of me!

284
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,920
Let go of me!

285
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,400
Jiang Feng.

286
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,400
Stop the bus! Stop it now!

287
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
Keep up.

288
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
Let go of me!

289
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,720
Let go of me!

290
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,920
Let go of me!

291
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,080
Wang Xingde.

292
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,720
Before any damage has been done,

293
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
you can still stop the
bus and turn yourself in.

294
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,760
Stop the bus, sir!

295
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,640
Stop the bus!

296
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Wang Xingde!

297
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,960
Pull over!

298
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,920
This is your last warning!

299
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,920
- Pull over at once!
- Stop the bus!

300
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,120
Stop the bus!

301
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,800
- Sir, stop the bus.
- Stop the bus, sir!

302
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,200
Wang Xingde!

303
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,600
State any requests you have!

304
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,960
We will try to fulfill them!

305
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,200
Turn the engine off!

306
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,400
Turn it off!

307
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,120
- The door won't open!
- Turn the engine off!

308
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
Turn the engine off!

309
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,760
Move it!

310
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,880
The door won't open!

311
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,160
Let go!

312
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
I know about Mengmeng, sir!

313
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,200
I know about Mengmeng!

314
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
Wang Xingde!

315
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,840
- Freeze!
- Don't be rash.

316
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,320
Any problem can be
solved by negotiation.

317
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,000
Don't do anything rash, okay?

318
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,800
Sir, look at this photo.

319
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Look.

320
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,080
Mengmeng did encounter
a pervert back then.

321
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,200
That's why she got off the bus.

322
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,160
She didn't deserve it.

323
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,640
She had no choice but
to get off the bus.

324
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
This photo is the evidence.

325
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,400
She was innocent.

326
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,200
How do you know Mengmeng?

327
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,680
I have the same
counselor that she did.

328
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
We found the person
who took the photo.

329
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,640
She can be our witness.

330
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,440
All you have to do
is let everyone out.

331
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,480
I can hand the photo
over to the police.

332
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,280
We'll get justice
for Mengmeng, okay?

333
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,360
Wang Xingde.

334
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm Zhang Cheng from the CID.

335
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
You have my word.

336
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,240
We'll reopen the case
on your daughter.

337
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,640
We'll clear your
daughter's name.

338
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Do you understand?

339
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,200
What you're doing

340
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,000
can't hurt that scoundrel.

341
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,760
This man is still out there.

342
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,480
Why should you kill yourselves?

343
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,040
We have evidence now.

344
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,080
We can reveal the
truth to everyone.

345
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,880
Don't let the truth be buried.

346
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,160
It has been so long.

347
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,200
No one will believe it.

348
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,080
We believe it.

349
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,640
You must trust the police too.

350
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,840
We'll clear your
daughter's name.

351
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Mr. Wang.

352
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,200
Sir.

353
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,000
You have to live.

354
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,320
You have to see the
person who hurt Mengmeng

355
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,960
pay for what he did.

356
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,040
Give it to me.

357
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,240
- Quickly!
- Out of the way!

358
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Hurry!

359
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,480
Are you hurt?

360
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,520
Go on.

361
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,280
Thank you.

362
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Let's go over there.

363
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,360
No! I forgot to record it!

364
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,360
My dears!

365
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,000
- I just had a near-death experience!
- Put your phone away.

366
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Tell me.

367
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,680
If we wake up tomorrow morning

368
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,040
and we're back at...

369
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
You two.

370
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Are you okay?

371
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,280
We're okay.

372
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,120
What about you? Are you hurt?

373
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
I'm not hurt.

374
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,560
But I have a few questions.

375
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,760
I need your cooperation, okay?

376
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,160
Okay.

377
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,200
Look at you two.

378
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,600
One knew every detail
about the bombing plan.

379
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Moreover,

380
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,280
you knew my number.

381
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,120
And the other one

382
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,000
knew every detail

383
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,920
about the passengers on board.

384
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Why is that?

385
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,440
Can you tell me why?

386
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,440
- Well...
- We are...

387
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,080
- I can't explain it. You go.
- Why don't you tell it? You do it.

388
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,200
Okay, that's fine.

389
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,520
Once you figure it out,

390
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
call me anytime.

391
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,880
- Okay.
- I'll think about it.

392
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Okay.

393
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,760
Thank you again.

394
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,840
You guys are really brave.

395
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,320
- It's nothing.
- You're welcome.

396
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,240
All right, go home quickly.

397
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,320
What should we do?

398
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,720
We need to think of an
explanation that makes sense.

399
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,080
If he were suspicious of us,

400
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,600
he wouldn't have let us go.

401
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
You're hungry?

402
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,800
Dinner is on me.
Let's go and eat.

403
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,200
Let's eat at Jialin's
priciest place.

404
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Come on.

405
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,320
I think the time loop is over.

406
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,040
The priciest isn't necessary.

407
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,640
We have plenty of time.

408
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
No, let's go.

409
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
LI SHIQING

410
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,320

411
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,040
GOOD NIGHT

412
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,520
Stir-fried pork liver.

413
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,760
Sichuan boiled fish.

414
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,760
Kung Pao chicken.

415
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,520
Everything is so delicious.

416
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,640
XIAO HEYUN: GOOD MORNING

417
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Today,

418
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,160
we are here to honor

419
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,920
these eight brave citizens.

420
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,840
Among them is a
university student.

421
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,920
There is also a woman
over 60 years old.

422
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,240
We have a new office worker.

423
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,960
We have a hard-working
farm worker as well.

424
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,360
Even though they come
from all walks of life,

425
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,800
in our hearts,

426
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,120
they are heroes.

427
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,040
Let's give them a
round of applause.

428
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,280
Welcome the heroes
onto the stage.

429
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

430
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,640
even though the eight of them

431
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,800
all have different ages,
experiences, and professions,

432
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,640
they have one thing in common.

433
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,280
When people's lives and
property are in danger,

434
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,000
they all come forward.

435
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,400
PROTECT THE CITY RIGHTEOUSLY

436
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,000
During this huge public safety
incident in Jialin City,

437
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,520
they discovered
the danger in time,

438
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,960
faced danger without fear,

439
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,160
and fought courageously
against the criminals.

440
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,040
That is how they protected
the nation, the greater good,

441
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,920
and the safety of people's
lives and property.

442
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,640
I hereby announce that

443
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,240

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,240
