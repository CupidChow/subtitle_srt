1
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
I'll add some water for you.

2
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,200
The tea has turned pale.

3
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
- I'll get you a fresh pot.
- No.

4
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

5
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,920
Mr. Wang is never late.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,040
I don't know what
is going on today.

7
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,000
Why don't I call him
and ask where he is?

8
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,200
Hello?

9
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,600
Where are you? What happened?

10
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,480
The reporter has waited
for almost an hour.

11
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
She is tired of waiting.

12
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,080
Mr. Wang, what is
holding you up?

13
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,640
Besides, didn't I ask someone
to inform you yesterday?

14
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
Listen, Mr. Wang.

15
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
This is a big deal for
you and the company.

16
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
You…

17
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Hello?

18
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,640
All right, ma'am.

19
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,600
Listen to me.

20
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,880
Let's set up first.

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,720
Let me say something first.

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
You've been waiting so long.

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,560
You need to bring
something back.

24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
I'll speak on his behalf.

25
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,480
Come on.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,120
Thank you.

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
I won't sit on this chair.

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll stand and talk.

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Okay.

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,160
When it comes to
turning in valuables,

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,560
I remember Mr. Wang has done it

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,320
more than just once or twice.

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,960
This time, he was the one who found
a passenger's purse on the bus.

34
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
He didn't even think about it.

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
He turned it in.

36
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,160
When the owner came to claim it,

37
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,720
none of us expected

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,360
30,000 yuan in cash inside.

39
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,320
He is normally a hard worker.

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,640
You could say that

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,280
he pours his focus into work.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
Mr. Yang, let's take a photo.

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Is that all?

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,000
Move this banner to the side.

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,640
I'll photoshop
Mr. Wang in later.

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,840
Yes, that's a good idea.

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes, look over here.

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,520
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,920
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang East Road.</i>

50
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,920
I'm sorry. Just now, I…

51
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Xiao Heyun?

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,320
Xiao Heyun?

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,400
Xiao Heyun?

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Xiao…

55
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,720
Are you okay?

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
You…

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
These past few times.

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
- Your standby...
- What did you say?

59
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
What did you want to ask?

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,520
He is an accomplice. This
has been established.

61
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm sorry. I…

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,840
I did act impulsively earlier.

63
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,880
I just…

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,400
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

65
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,880
Why are you so
worked up about him?

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,840
It feels like

67
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,000
someone you trust very much

68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,720
suddenly betrayed you.

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
I came alone to
Jialin for school.

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,920
But every time I take this bus,

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,760
I get a familiar feeling
whenever I see him.

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,960
Didn't I tell you?

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,240
I see him every time I
take the Route 45 bus.

74
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,440
I've known him for
over two years.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,480
Two years.

76
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
That just means he has been
planning this for a long time.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,720
But he doesn't seem
like a bad person.

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,120
He helped me before.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,800
You can't be sure
he is a good person

80
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
from one act of kindness.

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
But…

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,240
That's why I trusted you.

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Think about it.

84
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,080
He has taken this
route for years.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,680
That means one person was in charge of
taking the route and calculating the time.

86
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,240
The other person was in
charge of making the bomb.

87
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,360
That is a terrifying thought.

88
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
I know you're upset.

89
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,680
I can understand.

90
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
How about this?

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,640
Let's get off at the next stop

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
and think about this.

93
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,520
Come to think of it,

94
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,160
the driver was the reason several
of our missions were foiled.

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,480
We just didn't suspect him then.

96
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,120
It's all my fault.

97
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
Why should I blame you?

98
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
You didn't know
what he was like.

99
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,720
But do you remember?

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
It was that one time.

101
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
That twisted woman
kept scolding him.

102
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,400
She said

103
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,400
something about not
keeping his word.

104
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
And she suspected he
called the police.

105
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
So do you think it's possible

106
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,000
that the driver was
forced to do it?

107
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,440
And think about it.

108
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,640
If his goal is to kill
everyone on the bus,

109
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,400
then there is no way
we can get off the bus.

110
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
But

111
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,320
we forced our way off
the bus mid-route twice.

112
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,480
The choice to stop
and open the doors

113
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,480
lies entirely with the driver.

114
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
Before bus drivers
can report to work,

115
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
they all receive training

116
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,880
on how to handle emergencies.

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,120
In an unexpected situation such
as encountering a sexual predator,

118
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,800
they will normally
call the police,

119
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,240
lock the doors,

120
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,160
and hand the culprit over to
the police at the next stop.

121
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,520
Why would he make
an unscheduled stop

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,920
and let you off?

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Normally,

124
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,880
the driver shouldn't have
dropped me like that.

125
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,000
But he did open the doors.

126
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,200
That means that he wanted
me to get off the bus.

127
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,480
He must have been
trying to save me.

128
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,280
If he still has a conscience
and wants to save people,

129
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,840
he shouldn't have
let her on the bus.

130
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,360
Yes.

131
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
I guess he took pity on you.

132
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
He let you go twice.

133
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,440
But the blast still
happened in the end.

134
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,280
I just think…

135
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,680
No matter what
his hardships are,

136
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,680
he shouldn't have
solved it like this.

137
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,640
Yes, from your point of view, he
might seem like a good person.

138
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
But what about the
other passengers?

139
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,400
If you're their
family or friend,

140
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
what would you think?

141
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
Would you care
about his situation?

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,800
Shiqing.

143
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,240
We have to prevent
the explosion,

144
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,240
not make excuses for him.

145
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,080
I guess I was right.

146
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,480
This is the first time

147
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,120
we've seen what happens
when no one interferes.

148
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,160
The bus blows up on
the bridge at 1:45 p.m.

149
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,840
This was their original goal.

150
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,920
PARTY MEMBER POST

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,920
<i>What university did you say?</i>

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
Jialin Normal University.

153
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
I have a student ID.

154
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,160
Why is your school's television
station covering off-campus matters

155
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,680
instead of school affairs?

156
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,280
We're going out into the world.

157
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
Things related to
students' lives

158
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,760
are all things we cover.

159
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,560
As you know, the Route 45 bus
is the most convenient way

160
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,240
to get to the city
from our campus.

161
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,480
Besides, students know the route

162
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,600
and have said many heartwarming
things have happened

163
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,920
on the bus.

164
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,560
A lot happens

165
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,520
on the bus.

166
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,200
We're in the office,
so we don't know.

167
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,160
Here's the thing.

168
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
We did a school
survey last time.

169
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
We learned that you have
a driver named Wang Xingde

170
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,440
who did a lot of good deeds.

171
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,960
He's perfect to be
featured on our program

172
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
as a role model.

173
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,440
We hope to find
out more about him

174
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,560
from people who know him.

175
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
This is also good
publicity for your company.

176
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,680
You dropped by without notice.

177
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
I can't help you.

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,376
Although you're
from the university,

179
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
you still should
have called ahead

180
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,160
or provided references.

181
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
If we don't have basic
information about the driver,

182
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,960
we can't provide references.

183
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,160
How about this?

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,960
Let me get a simple
overview from you first.

185
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll get a referral letter
from the school later.

186
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,440
Then I'll set up an appointment
for a formal interview.

187
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Is that okay?

188
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
Sir, please.

189
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,600
No, don't call me that.

190
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
I'm not that old.

191
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,520
Buddy, please.

192
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm not trying to
make your life hard.

193
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
We have a lot of drivers.

194
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,520
If you're searching
for someone specific,

195
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,520
we don't know much
from the office.

196
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,080
Route 45, Wang Xingde.

197
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,000
- Route 45...
- Bad news, sir! Something…

198
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
What's wrong?

199
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Just a moment.

200
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,720
What is it?

201
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,080
Our bus was in an accident.

202
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,656
It exploded on the
river-crossing bridge.

203
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
It's a total wreck.

204
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,440
- When did this happen?
- Not long ago.

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,600
The police are coming here.

206
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,240
We need to go and
meet them at the door.

207
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,920
Copy the dispatch
chart for the police.

208
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,480
Come on.

209
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,560
What caused the explosion?

210
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,600
We don't know if
explosives were planted.

211
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,600
Have the fleet maintenance personnel
return immediately to cooperate.

212
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,600
Maintenance charts

213
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,160
and all footage that
spotted that bus

214
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,400
must be given to the police.

215
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,520
No, wait.

216
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,560
- Which line?
- Route 45.

217
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,960
Who was the driver?

218
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,600
We need to check
the dispatch chart.

219
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Route 45, Wang Xingde.

220
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,720
- You guys go ahead.
- Where are you going?

221
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
You guys can go ahead.

222
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,720
DRIVER SAFETY INFORMATION FILE

223
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,400
DRIVER QUALIFICATION
REGISTRATION FORM

224
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,720
Wang Xingde is not a local.

225
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
He used to drive a
truck, not a bus.

226
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,840
That's…

227
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,800
He mentioned this
in a loop once.

228
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,120
He didn't lie.

229
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,440
He quit his job, left his
hometown, came to Jialin,

230
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,280
and drove buses for four years.

231
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,760
Was that all part of the plan?

232
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,040
Look at this.

233
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,840
The reason for his
resignation says,

234
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,640
"For spouse's work transfer."

235
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,320
Do you think

236
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,040
the lady with the
bomb is his wife?

237
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
It's not impossible,

238
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
but if he has a spouse,

239
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,360
why did he live in a dormitory?

240
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
It wasn't easy to get these.

241
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,280
But the information
is too limited.

242
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,120
This isn't enough for us
to draw any conclusions.

243
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
There should be more
clues in his dormitory.

244
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,760
There might be pictures
or group photos.

245
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,880
Let's go and take a look.

246
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,680
Let me find it.

247
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,360
Ma'am.

248
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,120
Where is the bus
company's dormitory?

249
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,360
- This is it.
- Upstairs, right?

250
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Thank you.

251
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,360
STAFF DORMITORY

252
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
Any movement?

253
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,000
What should we do?

254
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,801
If it comes to it, we'll have
to call a locksmith company.

255
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,680
A locksmith company?

256
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,720
In broad daylight?

257
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
I'll just show them my ID.

258
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,360
Hello, I lost my key.

259
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,520
Can you open the lock for me?

260
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,440
Yes, it's the dormitory for
Jialin Public Transport.

261
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,760
Third floor.

262
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,240
Yes, 303.

263
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,120
Identification? I…

264
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,040
Sorry, but I don't
think I need your help.

265
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,720
Do you live here?

266
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,640
You must be my uncle's roommate.

267
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,520
Who is your uncle?

268
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Wang Xingde.

269
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,200
He asked me to get his stuff. I…

270
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,520
I lost the key.

271
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Yes.

272
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Come in then.

273
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,520
Shouldn't you tell him
that you lost the key?

274
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,680
I can't reach him on the phone.

275
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,800
I was calling the locksmith.
I'm glad you're back.

276
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,400
You can't reach him?

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,440
He's on shift today.

278
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,720
Okay, come in.

279
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Come in.

280
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,760
What did he tell you to get?

281
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Household register.

282
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,200
Yes, something happened at home.

283
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,720
That's his room.

284
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,360
- In here?
- Yes.

285
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,440
Have a seat.

286
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Have a seat.

287
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Thank you.

288
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,000
Are you his girlfriend?

289
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,280
That's good.

290
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
You look good together.

291
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,880
How long have you
lived with Mr. Wang?

292
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,520
A little over two years.

293
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,640
I've been living with him
since I joined the company.

294
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,760
We're old friends now.

295
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,760
- Sir.
- Don't call me that. "Buddy" is fine.

296
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,240
Mr. Wang is much older than me.

297
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,839
Buddy.

298
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,240
- Let me ask you something.
- Ask away.

299
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,680
Why don't you come here?

300
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Go ahead.

301
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,240
Here's the thing.

302
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,320
My boyfriend is going to
take me to meet his parents.

303
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,240
Mr. Wang is his only
relative in Jialin.

304
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,440
I'm a little nervous.

305
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
I just want to ask.

306
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,320
What is Mr. Wang
like? Is he friendly?

307
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,720
Don't be nervous, young lady.

308
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
Mr. Wang is very nice.

309
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
He is honest and
doesn't talk much.

310
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,360
He doesn't act like
a parent at all.

311
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
If you two live in
Jialin in the future,

312
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,000
you will have a
relative like Mr. Wang.

313
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,840
You can rely on each other.

314
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
What about his wife?
Have you met her?

315
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
What is she like?

316
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,880
I know what you need the
household register for.

317
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,560
Is that what this is about?

318
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Have a seat.

319
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,880
Is he getting a divorce?

320
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Young lady.

321
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm not trying to meddle in
people's family business.

322
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,320
But I have to warn you.

323
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,560
Yes?

324
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,240
Mr. Wang's wife isn't
easy to deal with.

325
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,680
I think she has mental problems.

326
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Be careful when you
see her in the future.

327
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,160
What's wrong with her?

328
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,360
Is this why they're
getting divorced?

329
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
Most likely.

330
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,440
That woman is a pain in the ass.

331
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,400
Something comes
up every few days.

332
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,320
Look.

333
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,840
Not even a saint

334
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,600
would be able to
stand it, right?

335
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,520
If not, why would
Mr. Wang stay here

336
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,640
instead of living at home?

337
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,000
Maybe his house is too far away.

338
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,520
It might be more
convenient here.

339
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,080
How is it far?

340
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,920
His home is in
Gangwu New Village.

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
It's a convenient commute.

342
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,880
It's so obvious to everyone.

343
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,920
Mr. Wang doesn't pay
her much attention.

344
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,880
If they are already
living like this,

345
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,120
they should just get divorced.

346
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,400
But that woman bombards him
with calls every few days.

347
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,400
Who can stand it?

348
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,760
- Yes.
- I knew it.

349
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,840
They would get a
divorce sooner or later.

350
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,480
However,

351
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,960
I heard from my boyfriend.

352
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,600
He said his aunt
is nice and kind.

353
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,760
He also said his aunt
and uncle are close.

354
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Nice?

355
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,280
Nice, my ass.

356
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,120
He is fooling you.

357
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,200
I got some insight
into it last month.

358
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,680
Late at night,

359
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,360
Mr. Wang's wife called
to ask him to go home.

360
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,400
She said there was a fire at
home and to help put it out.

361
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,920
A fire?

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And…

363
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,360
- Did you find it?
- Yes.

364
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Well, we're going to…

365
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,760
- Okay.
- Thank you.

366
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,280
Okay, it's no problem.

367
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,640
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

368
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,960
Young lady.

369
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,880
You should warn your boyfriend.

370
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,721
If he gets involved with his
uncle's family in the future,

371
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
he should leave you out of it.

372
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,320
Okay, thank you.

373
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
No problem.

374
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Thank you.

375
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Here.

376
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Let's replenish our energy.

377
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,120
We need to think this through.

378
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,440
Now we know the
driver's background.

379
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,840
We also know that his home
is in Gangwu New Village.

380
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,880
Combined with the
situation on the bus,

381
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,480
that lady is most
likely his wife.

382
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,920
But we don't know anything

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,240
about their motive.

384
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,040
Think carefully.

385
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,400
Didn't you notice
anything else in the room?

386
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,440
There was just the medical
report that I mentioned.

387
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
He is healthy.

388
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,480
His bank book doesn't
have much money.

389
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,160
Was there anything else?

390
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,320
Yes, there was an old phone.

391
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,320
Like, really old.

392
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,880
Did you find anything
on the phone?

393
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,520
It won't turn on.

394
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,880
Only knowing information
about his work and family

395
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,600
is far from enough.

396
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,120
POLAR PARK CONVENIENCE STORE

397
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,440
WANG XINGDE 1:45

398
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,400
SEEDLESS ORANGE

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,560
WANG XINGDE, 517 PROFILES FOUND

400
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,920
That's right.

401
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,040
You didn't finish talking
after you got off the bus.

402
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,680
How did you deduce
the 1:45 p.m. time?

403
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,960
Three data points support that.

404
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,560
The first time was when we
got off at the spot as usual.

405
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,320
We had an argument.
You went to the police.

406
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,160
I saw a police
announcement on the news.

407
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,960
The time of the
explosion was 1:45 p.m.

408
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,801
The second time was when we removed
the pot and jumped out the window.

409
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
I heard the ringtone that time.

410
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,600
I glanced at the
time. It was 1:45 p.m.

411
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,800
It's pretty much confirmed.

412
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,560
In that case,

413
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,120
at the time,

414
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,680
the driver was
repeating, "It's time."

415
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,960
But why 1:45 p.m.?

416
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,520
Do you think

417
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,360
someone put them to it?

418
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,000
Terrorists?

419
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,400
But don't you need a reason
to commit a terrorist act?

420
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,600
In that case,

421
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,560
we still need to
check their contacts.

422
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,560
We're not the police.
We can't find anything.

423
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,120
Yes.

424
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
The police can find
out what we can't.

425
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,400
Let me think.

426
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,120
This time, with
no interruptions,

427
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,640
the bus exploded on the bridge.

428
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Then…

429
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,720
There's not enough
time for the police

430
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,280
to rule out all possibilities.

431
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,560
But if we go to the police

432
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,200
and have targets
locked on these two,

433
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,000
that will cut down
the time by a lot.

434
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
- It will be solved quickly.
- Yes.

435
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
I'll make the call now.

436
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Hold on.

437
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,160
Let's first think about
how to deal with the police

438
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
and what to say.

439
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
We can't fail again.

440
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,840
SEVERELY PUNISH EVIL,
GUARD THE PEACE OF JIALIN

441
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Mr. Zhang.

442
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,200
Everyone on the bus
died on the spot.

443
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,880
Have they been identified?

444
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,400
Forensics is working on it.

445
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Jiang Feng.

446
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,280
When this type of thing happens,

447
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,840
you have to keep your cool.

448
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,840
I've also never worked on
such a big case before.

449
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,320
I got it.

450
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
First, calm yourself down.

451
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Hello.

452
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Hello.

453
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,320
- Is your name Xiao Heyun?
- Yes.

454
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,920
Hello.

455
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
Did you make the call?
What's your name?

456
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,760
I'm Li Shiqing.

457
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,680
I've been expecting you.

458
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm Zhang Cheng,
vice-captain of the CID.

459
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,960
This is my colleague,
Jiang Feng.

460
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

461
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,160
Okay, please.

462
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
This way.

463
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,200
Ms. Du, they are here.

464
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
Thank you for your
cooperation. Sit down.

465
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,080
- Bring two cups of water.
- Okay.

466
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,240
Sit here. Come.

467
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,400
Thank you so much

468
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,200
for coming to the station

469
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,640
to help us investigate
this bus explosion.

470
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,280
I hope you both can go over

471
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,080
everything you saw
and heard on the bus.

472
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,400
Leave no details out. The
more detailed, the better.

473
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Thank you.

474
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,960
We made plans to go
to the city by bus.

475
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,960
But we got off early
because of certain reasons.

476
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,000
We saw the news
about the explosion

477
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,480
and realized it was
the bus we were on.

478
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,280
We thought we could help out.

479
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
So we got in touch.

480
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,080
Why?

481
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,600
Why did you get off early?

482
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,640
It's because when we were at
the Gangwu New Village stop,

483
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,840
a mentally unstable
woman got on.

484
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,600
It was quite scary.

485
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,520
What was wrong with her?

486
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,760
She sat down and
pulled out a knife.

487
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,280
She kept mumbling to herself.

488
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,720
I don't know what she
was saying to herself.

489
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,240
I was afraid, so I
said we should get off.

490
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,880
She took out a knife?

491
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
What kind of knife?

492
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,360
It was about this long.

493
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,640
- This long.
- It was a dagger.

494
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,760
Actually, it was really scary what
that person was saying to herself.

495
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
She said,

496
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,320
"Kill them all.
Leave no one alive.

497
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,840
At 1:45 p.m., they
are all dead."

498
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,760
No, that's not going to work.

499
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,920
Being so specific

500
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,640
will make them
suspicious of our intent.

501
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,160
- It's better to be vaguer.
- We can't be vague.

502
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,560
Since we're trying to shorten
the case-solving time,

503
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,360
we need to provide clear clues.

504
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,920
We both know how alert they are.

505
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
If they get suspicious,

506
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,640
we'll have even less control.

507
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
Let's go with my idea.

508
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,200
She was talking to
herself so clearly.

509
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,040
Only you heard it?

510
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,640
What I mean is that

511
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,320
you both heard it
loud and clear.

512
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
The other passengers

513
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,120
must have heard it too.

514
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,840
How did they react?

515
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,800
I don't know if they heard it.

516
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,400
But they didn't
show any reaction.

517
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,320
The bus was pretty noisy.

518
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,080
We were the closest to her.

519
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,760
Also, we had an
eye on the knife.

520
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,800
Maybe we were the only
ones who heard it.

521
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Yes.

522
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,240
And? Go on.

523
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,120
And then we got off the bus.

524
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,640
Yes, we felt it was
quite dangerous,

525
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,960
so we got off.

526
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,760
This woman got on at
Gangwu New Village.

527
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,880
Do you remember what she wore

528
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,120
or how she looked?

529
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,360
She was wearing a gray outfit.

530
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,040
And she was skinny.

531
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,160
She also had a red plastic bag.

532
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,200
I think it held a
pressure cooker.

533
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,440
Is that her?

534
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,760
Yes, that's her.

535
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
Actually,

536
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
I ultimately decided to get off

537
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,120
because of the pressure cooker.

538
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Why?

539
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,600
Was there something about it?

540
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,160
As soon as she got on the bus,

541
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,400
I smelled something strange.

542
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,960
But I don't know how to
explain it. It was like…

543
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,520
Some kind of chemical?

544
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,560
I didn't even tell
my boyfriend this.

545
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm afraid he'll think
I'm a conspiracy theorist.

546
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,200
But there are reports
of an explosion.

547
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,520
So I think that

548
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
the pressure cooker was fishy.

549
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,920
You should look into it.

550
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Okay.

551
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,840
Aside from this woman boarding
at Gangwu New Village,

552
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,000
there was also a man.

553
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,360
Do you have any memory of that?

554
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,720
Yes.

555
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,000
Did they have any interaction

556
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
after getting on?

557
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,240
No, they didn't know each other.

558
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,320
We're just guessing

559
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,760
because they didn't
sit together, so…

560
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Yes.

561
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,840
You're so certain.

562
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,280
Then did this woman interact

563
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,240
with the other passengers?

564
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,760
Other people?

565
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,160
Are you suspecting that she
had an enemy on the bus?

566
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,920
- Or…
- Enemies are a possibility.

567
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,520
An accomplice is
another possibility.

568
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,760
We need to screen everyone.

569
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,200
Now that you mention it, I seem
to remember she got onto the bus

570
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,160
and talked to the driver.

571
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,560
- Right?
- Yes.

572
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,840
She said something
really strange.

573
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Something like,
"You'll die with me."

574
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,880
Come to think of
it, she called him…

575
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,800
What was it? Wang…

576
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,560
- Wang something-de?
- Wang Xingde?

577
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,560
Yes, I think so.

578
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,800
Wang Xingde.

579
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,360
Ms. Du, the trace
evidence unit said

580
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,160
they did find what looked like a
pressure cooker's remnants onboard.

581
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,200
Have you considered this?

582
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,840
If we only give
them vague clues,

583
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,720
what will the police
do with us afterward?

584
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
What do you mean?

585
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm saying that we can't get
more information right now.

586
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,880
If we're just witnesses,

587
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,200
the police won't tell us how
the case is going, right?

588
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,520
Besides, we can't be sure

589
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,320
when they will announce
the case details.

590
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,040
What if we don't get
to the moment of truth?

591
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,720
When we enter the next loop,

592
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,200
we will be back at the start.

593
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,000
Won't we be going
in circles again?

594
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,320
I see.

595
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,640
If we stay in the station
as long as we can,

596
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,240
we'll have a chance
to get more clues.

597
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,360
That's right.

598
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,080
This is our only chance.

599
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,800
Mr. Zhang, here is the
interview transcript.

600
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,520
Are they staying at the station?

601
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,800
Is there something
wrong with them?

602
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,760
These two brats are fishing.

603
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,520
Even though the
information was good,

604
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,040
their direction was so obvious.

605
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,040
We still don't know what
their true intentions are.

606
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,520
So let's play along.

607
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,880
I'll talk to them again later.

608
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Here's what.

609
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,680
I'll handle what
we tell the public.

610
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,640
Feel out their true intentions.

611
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,040

613

BY XI JINPING

614
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,080
This is the layout
of the Route 45 bus.

615
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,600
Based on what you remember,

616
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,640
can you mark where the
passengers were seated?

617
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,320
I think so.

618
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,480
- Here.
- Okay, thank you.

619
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,239
Two men were at the
front of the car.

620
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,760
A man was standing here.

621
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,400
<i>He was in his thirties.</i>

622
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,920
<i>He was wearing a floral shirt.</i>

623
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,199
<i>Keys hung from his waist.</i>

624
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,040
<i>He was filming the whole time. He
was probably a livestream host.</i>

625
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,679
A muscular guy was sitting here.

626
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,120
<i>He was wearing gray
and had headphones on.</i>

627
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,920
An older man was sitting here.

628
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
<i>There was a burlap bag at
his feet. It was green.</i>

629
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,719
<i>It looked like
watermelons inside.</i>

630
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,639
A woman was sitting behind him.

631
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,000
<i>Short hair and
slightly overweight.</i>

632
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,280
<i>She carried a yellow woven bag</i>

633
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
<i>with medicine inside.</i>

634
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,639
Two seats behind her
was a middle-aged man.

635
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:01,280
<i>He had some balding going on.</i>

636
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,639
<i>There was a big
suitcase at his feet.</i>

637
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,159
We were sitting here.

638
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:08,160
<i>When we got off the
bus, a man got on.</i>

639
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
<i>He was dressed in black.</i>

640
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,800
And sitting over here
was the one in gray.

641
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,480
<i>The suspect, I guess.</i>

642
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,840
<i>There was a red bag at her feet.</i>

643
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Young man.

644
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
You have an amazing memory.

645
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,880
I design video games.

646
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,440
I'm used to memorizing
characters and scenes.

647
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,360
Did you major in
video game design?

648
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Yes.

649
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,200
You must have trained for
this when you were in school.

650
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
No.

651
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,400
It's a subconscious
professional habit.

652
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,280
This kind of training
is quite useful.

653
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,440
I remember the academy
provided similar training

654
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,600
for the Criminal
Investigation specialty.

655
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Right, Ye Qian?

656
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
That's right.

657
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,200
If you go to any place

658
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,360
just once,

659
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,800
does it get imprinted
into your mind?

660
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,160
Something like that.

661
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
You walked from the
station's entrance

662
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,160
to here.

663
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,560
Can you draw the
station's entire layout

664
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,840
from memory?

665
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,520
I'll try.

666
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,600
Here.

667
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,920
Show me your skills.

00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,760
This is what we have so far.

679
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,240
We have photos of
every passenger

680
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,640
that we believe was on the
bus before the explosion.

681
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,320
It's a shame. They
are all blurry.

682
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,440
And it's either of
their backs or sides.

683
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,200
From what you remember,

684
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,680
do you think

685
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,680
you can identify them for us?

686
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Okay.

687
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Hello?

688
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
What's wrong?

689
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,440
She must be shocked from
seeing the victims' photos.

690
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,440
She has been blaming herself

691
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,360
for knowing something was wrong

692
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,680
but not doing anything.

693
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,640
Why don't you take a break
in the reception room?

694
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,760
There's a sofa there.

695
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
We can continue later.

696
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I'm fine.

697
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,520
It's okay, I'll take a look.

698
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,840
Mr. Zhang.

699
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,240
The suspect has been identified.

700
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,200
Tao Yinghong, 56.
Originally from Jiaodao.

701
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,760
She lived in Gangwu New Village.

702
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,120
She worked at a chemical plant.

703
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Okay.

704
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,480
Okay, I got it.

705
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Mr. Zhang.

706
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,040
Tao Yinghong and Wang Xingde
were husband and wife.

707
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,040
JIALIN CRIME POLICE

708
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,960
What's wrong with the girl?

709
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,840
Judging from her reaction,

710
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,360
it looks like survivor syndrome.

711
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,880
The information provided by
these two is quite accurate.

712
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,480
But some of their reactions
do seem suspicious.

713
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,240
We're in the
investigation phase.

714
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,600
These two have to stay at the
station. Watch them at all times.

715
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,120
Mr. Zhang,

716
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
you're in control.

717
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,960
How is it on Jiang Feng's end?

718
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,280
I've informed him about
the husband and wife.

719
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,920
We need to focus on the
source of the explosives.

720
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,960
Ms. Du, I found it.

721
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,120
Before Wang Xingde
came to Jialin,

722
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,760
he headed the transport team
at the Jiaodao Erqi Factory.

723
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,120
He is experienced in
driving heavy vehicles.

724
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,800
And there is no record
of any accidents.

725
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,160
He was always a model worker.

726
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,640
Tao Yinghong worked in Jialin
Chemical Plant's QC Department.

727
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,240
Before joining the
chemical plant,

728
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,336
she was a Chemistry teacher
at Jiaodao First High School.

729
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,456
She had a lot of theoretical
and practical experience.

730
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,600
She has published textbooks.

731
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,736
According to the employees,
after joining the company,

732
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,880
Wang Xingde applied many times to
drive the Route 45 bus service.

733
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
After getting the job,

734
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,320
he turned down all
company transfers.

735
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,200
He also turned down a
promotion to management.

736
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,240
He was determined to drive
Route 45 until he retired.

737
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,480
After Tao Yinghong went
to Jialin Chemical Plant,

738
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,080
she passed training and exams for
specialized chemical products.

739
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,600
She was assigned to QC.

740
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,096
She was responsible for the
sampling, inspection, and analysis

741
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,840
of chemical products
and raw materials

742
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,640
and the disposal of
defective products.

743
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
She was a model
employee every year.

744
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,160
I heard from her colleagues that

745
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,720
she asked to work
overtime every day.

746
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,240
She was often the
last one to leave.

747
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,160
Wang Xingde normally lived at the
bus company's staff dormitory.

748
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
It's not far from here.

749
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,680
Xiaoyuan is on his
way with a team.

750
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,400
In the QC department,

751
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,440
Tao Yinghong had direct
access to chemicals.

752
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,400
And the way the chemical
plant processes defects

753
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,040
differs from that
in other industries.

754
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,720
They can't be
directly destroyed.

755
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,160
In the process,

756
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,440
any loss of material
is perfectly normal.

757
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>So I think it's possible that Tao
Yinghong took advantage of her job</i>

758
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,320
<i>to obtain the raw
materials to make a bomb.</i>

759
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,560
Okay, I got it.

760
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,040
Tao Yinghong had a background
and skills in chemistry.

761
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,640
She also had access
to raw materials.

762
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,880
It's very likely that
she made her own bomb.

763
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,680
One scouted the route and
the other made the bomb.

764
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,040
From the looks of it,

765
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,680
it's highly likely
that they had a plan

766
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,000
and premeditated this crime.

767
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,520
Yezi.

768
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,520
Distribute all the
information we have so far.

769
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
I got it.

770
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,720
Also, notify the Jiaodao police.

771
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Request for their cooperation.

772
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,760
Tell them to start
conducting interviews

773
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,840
to find out about Tao Yinghong's and
Wang Xingde's work and personal lives.

774
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,080
I got it.

775
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,120
A homemade bomb.

776
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,480
1:45 p.m.

777
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,560
Why choose this time?

778
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
Come on, you two.

779
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,440
Get some rest here.

780
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,880
We don't need anything for now.

781
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
Well,

782
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,680
is there anything else
we can help you with?

783
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,920
Take a break first.

784
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Thank you.

785
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,840
Come to me if you need anything.

786
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,520
When I heard the ringtone,

787
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,760
I couldn't control myself.

788
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,600
I've been conditioned
to expect a blast.

789
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,720
It's okay.

790
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,200
It's all my fault.

791
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,640
Now that we're here, we won't
get any information at all.

792
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,880
It's not your fault.

793
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,720
We can't just help the
police solve cases.

794
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,120
We still have to find a way
to prevent the explosion.

795
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,680
I don't want to be a liability.

796
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
We still have a chance.

797
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
This way.

798
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,240
It's the one at the end.

799
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,600
Unlock it.

800
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,840
