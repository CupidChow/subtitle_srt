00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,400
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,600
HONGQIANG CABLE FACTORY
TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,520
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,520
<i>Next stop, Jiaming
Community Hospital.</i>

6
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Miss.

7
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,360
Do you ride the
Route 45 bus often?

8
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,280
Has anyone ever taken
advantage of you on the bus?

9
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Take advantage of me?

10
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,080
Was there a man who
wanted to touch you?

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,496
- Take advantage, violate, and harass you?
- What are you doing?

12
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,776
- What's wrong with you?
- Was there? Miss, please tell me.

13
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
- Sir!
- Let go of me! Was there?

14
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,520
That person is sick!

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,040
- Stop it or I'll call the police!
- Miss!

16
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
I'm not sick.

17
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
Hello? I'm calling the police.

18
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,880
HONGQIANG CABLE FACTORY
TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
How many times is this?

20
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,880
If I remember correctly, this
is the third time, right?

21
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,080
Please make sure we don't
get any more complaints

22
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,280
that make us send officers.

23
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,160
Can we not do this again?

24
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
I understand how you feel.

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,240
But your investigation

26
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,080
has already caused significant disruption
to Route 45 bus drivers and passengers.

27
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
Can you be more careful?

28
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,080
Who am I disturbing?

29
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
How did I disturb them?

30
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,040
If you didn't, would I be here?

31
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,560
Please trust the police.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,480
Stop!

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
- Officer.
- What are you doing?

34
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,400
Please calm down.

35
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Listen to me.

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,280
Look at her.

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
Please try to understand.

38
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm here.

39
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
I won't let her
cause trouble. Relax.

40
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Mr. Wang.

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,240
I can understand how you feel.

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,040
I have kids too.

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,200
But the case is closed.

44
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,360
What are you aiming
for by keeping this up?

45
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
Take my advice.

46
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,400
Don't do it again.

47
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,120
Go home and talk to her.

48
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,720
There won't be the next time.

49
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm sorry for the trouble.

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Okay.

51
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
You guys go ahead.

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Thank you.

53
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Thank you.

54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,640
Let's go.

55
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
Mr. Wang.

56
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,040
Take her home.
Don't stand there.

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
They couldn't find any evidence.

58
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,400
They won't let us search either.

59
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,040
Ambulance!

60
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,440
Where's the ambulance?

61
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,400
His wound has been treated.

62
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,160
It's not that serious.

63
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,360
He just lost a lot of blood.

64
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,360
He needs to stay.

65
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Xiaolu.

66
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,200
- Take them to the inpatient ward.
- Okay.

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,800
Come with me.

68
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Thank you.

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
Hold on.

70
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,960
Are you Xiao Heyun?

71
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
I need to talk to you right now.

72
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200
How did you know there
was a bomb on the bus?

73
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,560
Tell me.

74
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
Officer.

75
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,280
He lost a lot of blood.

76
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,520
He needs to rest.

77
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,320
You can ask him later.

78
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
I won't take much of his time.

79
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,600
- I just have two questions.
- This is a hospital.

80
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
Ms. Du is on the phone.

81
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,280
Xiaolu, take them to the ward.

82
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Okay.

83
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,520
Come on, follow me.

84
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Ms. Du.

85
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,760
The one who called the police
is very important to us.

86
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Got it.

87
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,760
Keep me updated on
Mr. Zhang's situation.

88
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,360
I'll stay at the hospital.

89
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Ms. Du.

90
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,120
Those two just won't talk.

91
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,320
They refuse to cooperate.

92
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,320
Leave them be for a while.

93
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
We'll interrogate them
after we know more.

94
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,080
RESUSCITATION BAY (SECTOR A)

95
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,039
RESUSCITATION BAY (SECTOR A)

96
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,159
RESUSCITATION BAY (SECTOR A)

97
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
How did this happen?

98
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Actually, we were so close.

99
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,480
The next time,

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,640
we need to buy more
time no matter what.

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,640
That way, no one gets hurt.

102
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,200
There may not be the next time.

103
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,320
Let's say saving
all the passengers

104
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,320
is the key to breaking
out of the time loop.

105
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,320
Well, we already did that.

106
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,000
This is the last time.

107
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,640
But I can't shake the feeling
that we haven't resolved anything.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,960
I feel like something
more happened

109
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,080
after Wang Mengmeng's death.

110
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,160
Look this up for me.

111
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,400
"May 13th, 2014.

112
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,280
River-crossing
bridge car accident.

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,240
Route 45."

114
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,520
Look at this.

115
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,600
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL?

116
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,000
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BORN

117
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
SHE'S NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD

118
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,560
SCUM OF SOCIETY

119
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
DIE!

120
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,720
DOES SHE THINK THE
WORLD OWES HER?

121
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,720
NICE DEATH!

122
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,360
SHE MUST'VE BEEN SPOILED ROTTEN

123
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,200
If Wang Mengmeng's parents

124
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,200
see these comments,

125
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,840
what will they think?

126
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,400
Maybe

127
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,080
for them,

128
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,160
surviving isn't true salvation.

129
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
We probably haven't gotten
to the heart of all this yet.

130
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,880
TUESDAY, JIALIN
RIVER-CROSSING BRIDGE

131
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,600
TUESDAY, JIALIN
RIVER-CROSSING BRIDGE

132
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,840
After what happened
to Wang Mengmeng,

133
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,800
Wang Xingde and Tao
Yinghong were dissatisfied

134
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
with the
investigation's outcome.

135
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,120
They also asked the police to investigate
why Wang Mengmeng got off the bus.

136
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,960
Is the involved bus
driver here yet?

137
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,960
He should be here soon.

138
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,360
I'll receive him at the door.

139
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Mr. Qin.

140
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,800
- Ms. Du.
- Thank you for coming, Mr. Qin.

141
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,720
- Did you bring everything?
- Yes, I did.

142
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,960
These are the statements,
accident reports,

143
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,760
and all the related documents.

144
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,480
This case wasn't
that complicated.

145
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
There was nothing suspicious.

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,760
It was just a traffic accident.

147
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Chain of evidence intact.

148
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,880
The cause was clear.

149
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,880
We determined that

150
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,016
the bus driver who let her
out had primary liability.

151
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,600
The dump truck had
secondary liability.

152
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,800
Were there any problems
with compensation?

153
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,040
There were none.

154
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,520
The bus company paid
the compensation.

155
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,760
The victim's family
didn't file a lawsuit.

156
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,080
There was no financial dispute.

157
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Ms. Du.

158
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,040
He is the one from the case.

159
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,000
Mr. Zhu, the driver
of the Route 45 bus.

160
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,640
Mr. Zhu, this is Ms. Du.

161
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,960
Hello, Mr. Zhu.

162
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Have a seat.

163
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,360
Come, sit down.

164
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,920
- Sit down, Mr. Qin.
- Okay.

165
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
Have a seat, Mr. Zhu.

166
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,240
Don't be nervous, Mr. Zhu.

167
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,560
We just want to learn more
from you about the situation.

168
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,680
Just tell us the truth.

169
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,040
We were watching this video.

170
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,880
Wang Mengmeng was in a hurry
when she got off the bus.

171
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,920
And she had arguments
and tussles with you.

172
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
So what happened?

173
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,560
It has already been five years.

174
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,200
I've been asked all
the questions before.

175
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
You are Mr. Qin

176
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,480
from back then, right?

177
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,480
Yes, it's me.

178
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,520
Then you know better
than anyone else.

179
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
You should talk to them.

180
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,520
I answered all the
questions back then.

181
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
- All I can do now is...
- Mr. Zhu.

182
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,640
You've heard about the bombing.

183
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,360
This is a serious case.

184
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
Please cooperate.

185
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
At the time, that young lady

186
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
insisted on getting off.

187
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,280
I really didn't expect this

188
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,600
to happen.

189
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Otherwise,

190
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,960
I wouldn't have let
her off the bus.

191
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,640
But under the circumstances,

192
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,760
I had no choice but
to drop her off.

193
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm sure you've all seen
the security footage.

194
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,320
At the time,

195
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,880
she was already
pulling on my arm.

196
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,480
What if the bus was
steered off course?

197
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
What would happen?

198
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
The consequences
would be even worse.

199
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm a driver.

200
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,920
I have to ensure the safety of
the dozens of passengers on board.

201
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,440
If she had acted up

202
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,920
anywhere else,

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,120
I could have pulled
over for her.

204
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
On the river-crossing bridge,

205
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,200
there is no way.

206
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,200
Didn't you think of asking
the passengers to stop her?

207
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,480
No one on the bus helped.

208
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,520
After the accident, did Wang
Mengmeng's parents contact you?

209
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,920
Did they ask you why
Wang Mengmeng got off?

210
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,320
Nothing in the world

211
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,200
could make me brave enough
to talk to them face-to-face.

212
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,000
I know that even if I were
to kneel and kowtow to them,

213
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,360
they wouldn't accept it either.

214
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,160
Especially that lady. She…

215
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,160
Yes, I know.

216
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,920
I breached the protocol.

217
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,400
I know that I lost my
job because of this.

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,480
I've admitted it myself.

219
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,800
How much do you know
about the real reason

220
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,960
that Wang Mengmeng got off?

221
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,120
Or did she say anything to you?

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,640
That young girl just
missed her stop.

223
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,040
I've seen this

224
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,640
more than a few times before.

225
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,880
She kept babbling on and on.

226
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,480
What she said didn't
make any sense.

227
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,320
I didn't know what she wanted.

228
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,320
She just kept wanting me
to stop and let her out.

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,360
I was focused on the road.

230
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,200
I didn't know what to do.

231
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,680
It's the river-crossing bridge!

232
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,400
You can't stop there!

233
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,520
But you still stopped.

234
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
Yes, I know I did stop!

235
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,760
But what could I do?

236
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,640
Five years have already passed!

237
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Why won't you let it go?

238
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,040
Didn't you call me here
today to interrogate me?

239
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,920
- No.
- Fine. Take me and execute me!

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,256
- My life for hers!
- No, Mr. Zhu.

241
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,560
- Mr. Zhu.
- Here.

242
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,880
That's not our intention.

243
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,160
Please have a seat.

244
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,480
Mr. Zhu, calm down.

245
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,080
Don't get so worked up.

246
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,600
That's not our intention.

247
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
We told you to come

248
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,840
just to ask you to
think back carefully.

249
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Did you upset her parents

250
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
to make them resent you?

251
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Resent?

252
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,760
Who doesn't harbor resentment?

253
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,720
I have resentment too.

254
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,720
Okay, Mr. Zhu.

255
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,720
Don't get worked up.

256
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Let's take a break.

257
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Here, Xiaoliu.

258
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,400
Take Mr. Zhu to get
some tea and rest.

259
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,840
- Come.
- Mr. Zhu.

260
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,800
Here. Take a break.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,760
- Mrs. Zhang.
- Where is Zhang Cheng?

262
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm asking you. Where is he?

263
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,160
We took a closer look at the
security cameras on the bus.

264
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
We also talked to the
passengers on the bus.

265
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,600
No one knows why Wang
Mengmeng got off the bus.

266
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,720
We only found out that

267
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,280
she seriously interfered
with the driver's driving.

268
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,960
And aside from her frantic
hitting of the bus door,

269
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,880
there was no proof that she
was in any physical danger.

270
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,440
But if you look
at the transcript,

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,760
Tao Yinghong was
insistent on this point.

272
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,640
She felt that Wang Mengmeng must
have insisted on getting off the bus

273
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,839
because she felt
threatened on the bus.

274
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,760
Yes.

275
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,239
That's what she
was obsessed about.

276
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
Let's watch the
bus footage again.

277
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,720
Who was she calling?

278
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,880
Wang Xingde.

279
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,760
She called.

280
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,319
But nobody answered.

281
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
<i>Sir!</i>

282
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,839
<i>Sir, I need to get off!</i>

283
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,800
<i>Sir!</i>

284
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,400
<i>Sir, I need to get off!</i>

285
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,960
<i>We can't stop here.</i>

286
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,000
<i>Pull over up ahead, please.</i>

287
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
<i>We're on the bridge. I
definitely can't stop.</i>

288
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
<i>Help me!</i>

289
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,920
<i>- Help me!
- What are you doing?</i>

290
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
<i>Go away!</i>

291
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
<i>I want to get off!</i>

292
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,320
<i>It's too dangerous!</i>

293
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,480
<i>What are you doing?</i>

294
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,680
<i>Stop the car!</i>

295
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,840
<i>Don't touch it!</i>

296
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,000
<i>Don't touch the wheel!</i>

297
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
<i>- Stop the bus!
- Don't touch it!</i>

298
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,160
<i>I'll pull over!</i>

299
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,280
<i>Don't touch it.</i>

300
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,480
<i>Get off from the back. Get off.</i>

301
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,920
Stop.

302
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,840
Look.

303
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,176
The driver had opened the door.
She could have gotten off.

304
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,640
But why did she look back?

305
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,800
Who was she looking at?

306
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
There were so many passengers.

307
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,440
As for who she was looking at,

308
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,680
we're not sure.

309
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,920
But why did she
insist on getting off?

310
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,480
We've speculated on that.

311
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,400
The accident occurred on a
stretch of the Route 45 bus course

312
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,200
where disputes
happen frequently.

313
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,160
Yanjiang East Road is the
last stop before the bridge.

314
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,120
If you miss this stop,

315
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,040
you have to cross the
bridge and come back.

316
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,216
This process takes up a
good part of the hour.

317
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,520
But people often miss the stop

318
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
and ask to be
dropped off midway.

319
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,600
We assumed that was the
case with Wang Mengmeng.

320
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,160
So the accident wasn't
complicated at all.

321
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,080
There is also ample evidence.

322
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
All three parties agreed

323
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,840
to the liability determination
by the Traffic Police.

324
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,840
They all signed the findings.

325
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,480
The driver took responsibility.

326
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,520
And the damages were paid.

327
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,760
Yes.

328
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,600
What about Wang Xingde
and Tao Yinghong?

329
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,000
When the liability
determination was made,

330
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,720
how did they feel?

331
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,960
At first, they couldn't
accept it at all.

332
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,560
They investigated on their
own for over a month.

333
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,600
They took the Route
45 bus every day.

334
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,520
On the bus,

335
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,840
when they saw girls around
Wang Mengmeng's age,

336
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,000
they went up to them
and interrogated them.

337
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,800
They asked them if they had been
in any suspicious situations.

338
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,200
450,000 YUAN COMPENSATION

339
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,320
I see that the
liability determination

340
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,760
was signed only by Wang Xingde.

341
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,200
Was Tao Yinghong there?

342
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,360
Did she know about this?

343
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,320
She was there and aware of it.

344
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
After the incident,

345
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,560
it was Tao Yinghong who traveled
from her hometown and got here first.

346
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,000
So the communications and
forensics at an early stage

347
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,400
were dealt directly with her.

348
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
But during the investigation,

349
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,320
her emotions were
severely out of control.

350
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,120
This has affected our
investigation process.

351
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,080
So we tried to
avoid her later on.

352
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
We liaised with
Wang Xingde instead.

353
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,040
When Wang Xingde signed it,

354
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
Tao Yinghong was
present and informed.

355
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Afterward, did the two of them

356
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,040
have any objections
to this determination?

357
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,840
No.

358
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,480
Yezi.

359
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,800
Any news from Jiaodao?

360
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,720
Yes.

361
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,360
We contacted Tao Yinghong's colleagues
at Jiaodao First High School.

362
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,920
They said Tao Yinghong wasn't
in a good mental state.

363
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,640
After what happened
to Wang Mengmeng,

364
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,240
Tao Yinghong changed a lot
and became very irritable.

365
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,920
She even hit a student.

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,920
Not long after that,
she left the school.

367
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,240
But I think she was
persuaded to quit.

368
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,840
The parents of the student
who was hit threw a fit.

369
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,240
Since then, she hasn't
contacted her colleagues.

370
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,480
She blocked all their numbers.

371
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,120
Then she moved to Jialin.

372
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,800
And Wang Xingde?

373
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,640
We contacted some apprentices
from Wang Xingde's transport team.

374
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,840
They said that Wang Xingde
became very sad and depressed.

375
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,360
He aged overnight.

376
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,920
But he never talked about
it in front of other people.

377
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,560
Did anyone mention their
marital relationship?

378
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,680
His apprentice said that

379
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,640
Wang Xingde always
listens to Tao Yinghong.

380
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,320
Moving to Jialin was probably
Tao Yinghong's decision.

381
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
At first, Wang Xingde
was against it.

382
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
But Tao Yinghong was
determined to move.

383
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
Wang Xingde had no choice

384
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
but to come along.

385
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,680
How did you know

386
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,560
that there was a
bomb on the bus?

387
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,120
How did you know

388
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,240
Mr. Zhang's number?

389
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Mr. Zhang told us himself.

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,520
When did he tell you?

391
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,240
Did you know each other?

392
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,160
I guess we kind of
know each other.

393
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,360
But I can't explain
it in a few words.

394
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,280
So…

395
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,120
Mr. Zhang…

396
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,600
Mr. Zhang is dead.

397
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,080
You have to truthfully tell me

398
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,600
everything you know.

399
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,440
- Jiang Feng, let's talk outside.
- Enough.

400
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,440
Answer me.

401
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,360
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

402
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,760
<i>You've wasted an
entire afternoon.</i>

403
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,640
<i>Don't you have
anything to tell us?</i>

404
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,560
<i>What about your daughter?</i>

405
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,640
Do you not have anything
to say about that?

406
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,600
What was the purpose
of this explosion?

407
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Do you have any accomplices
other than Tao Yinghong?

408
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,360
Did you arrange any
other bomb sites?

409
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,360
How is Tao Yinghong?

410
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,440
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

411
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,480
If it weren't for the two
police officers on the bus,

412
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,040
our family

413
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,120
would already be together.

414
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,720
She mentioned two officers. Are
they the ones who called the police?

415
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,696
You said there were two
police officers on the bus.

416
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,040
Were they those
two young people?

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,400
I want to know.

418
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
You can keep following me.

419
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,720
But when I asked you

420
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
to find out the truth
behind Mengmeng's death,

421
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,280
why didn't you do it thoroughly?

422
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,920
Tao Yinghong.

423
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,080
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FILE

424
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,200
What you see here is the file on Wang
Mengmeng's case from five years ago.

425
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,920
As long as you cooperate,

426
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,960
we will get to the
bottom of this.

427
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,240
I've said what I had to say.

428
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,440
It was my idea.

429
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,160
I made the bomb myself.

430
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,000
I brought it onto
the Route 45 bus.

431
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,200
It has nothing to
do with Wang Xingde.

432
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,200
If you think there
must be something

433
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,000
because we're married,

434
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,400
then he was forced to do it.

435
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,200
Because I wanted
him to die with me.

436
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Tao Yinghong.

437
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,040
There's hatred in your
heart. I can understand.

438
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,680
You can understand?

439
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,160
You can understand?

440
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,080
Even I don't understand.

441
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Tao Yinghong.

442
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
Tao Yinghong!

443
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Stay here. I'll get a doctor.

444
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,720
Ms. Du.

445
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,640
Wang Xingde.

446
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,680
Your daughter's case.

447
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,960
We've already started
reinvestigating.

448
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,360
Thank you.

449
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,440
How is Tao Yinghong?

450
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,760
I can understand.

451
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,680
As parents,

452
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,840
you couldn't protect your child

453
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,520
when she was in the most danger.

454
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,960
Besides,

455
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,720
the last person that Mengmeng
called for help was you.

456
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,200
If I had picked it up,

457
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,680
wouldn't that have been nice?

458
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,240
If I could,

459
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,160
I would rather give my life

460
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,840
for Mengmeng's life.

461
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,280
What do those people know?

462
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,120
What right do they
have to go online

463
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,240
and make up stories about
a complete stranger?

464
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,160
They said such awful things.

465
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,400
Mengmeng was only 20 years old.

466
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,440
She never hurt anyone.

467
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
Back then,

468
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,840
if there was even a single
clue or a glimmer of hope,

469
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,440
we wouldn't be here.

470
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,000
Five years ago,

471
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,280
I forced Tao Yinghong

472
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,200
to move from Jiaodao to Jialin.

473
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,840
I am the one

474
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,880
who planned the whole bombing.

475
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
I forced Tao Yinghong

476
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,200
to make the bomb.

477
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,560
But we can't help it.

478
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,920
That was our child.

479
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
We had to make it right for her.

480
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,200
We couldn't let her die in vain.

481
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,480
Let me ask you.

482
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,760
Was it wrong of us to do that?

483
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,200
But that doesn't
justify your crime.

484
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,400
Did you consider this?

485
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,440
The passengers on the
bus have families too.

486
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,080
They also have
children and parents.

487
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,920
You're taking out
all your hatred

488
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
on innocent people

489
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,400
and destroying their families.

490
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
Is this behavior of yours

491
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
what Mengmeng would want to see?

492
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm sorry for the trouble.

493
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm sorry.

494
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,360
MAY 13TH, 5 YEARS AGO

495
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Mr. Wang, after Mengmeng
went to college,

496
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,856
there's no one to change
your gloves for you.

497
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,160
You know nothing.

498
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,440
Mengmeng told me.

499
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,680
She will buy me a new pair
when she is back for summer.

500
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,040
- Get to work.
- Okay.

501
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,760
Sir, I'll get you a new
pair when we get back.

502
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,880
Let's get a good
one. A leather pair!

503
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,120
You punk.

504
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,560
MENGMENG

505
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,520
MENGMENG

506
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,480
1:42 P.M., MAY
13TH, 2014, TUESDAY

507
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,040
MENGMENG

508
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Mr. Wang.

509
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,080
The boss is looking for you.

510
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
You should go.

511
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,200
MENGMENG

512
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,760
1:44 P.M., MAY
13TH, 2014, TUESDAY

513
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,440
Mr. Yin, Miss
Wang's dad is here.

514
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,720
Hello, Mr. Wang.

515
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,120
This is Mr. Qin
from the precinct.

516
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,320
This is Mr. Yang
from the bus company.

517
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Mr. Wang.

518
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Mr. Wang.

519
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,960
Regarding Wang
Mengmeng's accident,

520
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,560
we are all very sorry.

521
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,840
My condolences.

522
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,080
This is a determination
of liability

523
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,920
and an agreement on
compensation for damages.

524
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Traffic authorities took
this accident very seriously.

525
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,000
They thoroughly
investigated the cause.

526
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,880
The driver will also be
held legally responsible.

527
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,760
As for the compensation
and bereavement damages,

528
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,400
the bus company will pay for it.

529
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
We will pay.

530
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,400
As for the other details,

531
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,680
it's all in the file,
so please take a look.

532
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,440
If you have no objections,

533
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
please sign it.

534
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,600
I don't agree.

535
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,160
I don't need compensation.

536
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,440
But I need the truth.

537
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,801
I want to know why Wang Mengmeng
suddenly got off the bus.

538
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,080
I want to know what
happened to her on the bus

539
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,880
before she got off.

540
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,760
Once you find out the truth,

541
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,040
we'll sign the documents.

542
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
- Hey!
- Mr. Wang!

543
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
Mr. Wang!

544
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,159
- Mr. Wang.
- Mr. Wang.

545
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,239
Mr. Wang.

546
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,639
I heard that woman has
been standing here all day.

547
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,800
Isn't she silly?

548
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,000
She just keeps
waiting at the door.

549
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Who is she looking for now?

550
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,840
Nobody would dare to see her.

551
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,560
The boss would never see her.

552
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,679
Of course they won't see her.

553
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
This woman.

554
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
What a pain in the ass.

555
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,920
Isn't there someone
on the Route 45 line

556
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,560
who molests young girls?

557
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,800
I guess so.

558
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,280
I've heard that before.

559
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,880
But if the passengers
don't speak up,

560
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,480
the driver won't care.

561
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,080
The driver has to drive. He can't
see what happens in the back.

562
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,320
If you ask me,

563
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,560
people like that are messed up.

564
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
He even goes after young girls.

565
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,640
If he gets caught, he
should be locked up.

566
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,160
MEN'S RESTROOM

567
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,360
UNIVERSITY TOWN STOP

568
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,080
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

569
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,720
<i>We've arrived at
University Town.</i>

570
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,440
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

571
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,000
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

572
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,040
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

573
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,960
Is anyone getting off here?

574
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,400
If not, we're leaving now.

575
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,560
Sir.

576
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,120
Sir, open the door!

577
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,640
Sir!

578
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,920
Sir!

579
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,320
Open the door!

580
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,520
Why did you chase after it?

581
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,760
Are you hurt?

582
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,520
UNIVERSITY TOWN STOP

583
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:31,400
UNIVERSITY TOWN STOP

584
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,440
What is the point
of coming here?

585
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,480
We're almost there.

586
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
I miss her.

587
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,080
Why don't we sign the documents?

588
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,320
They've pulled up all the
CCTV footage in the hallway.

589
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,920
Nobody entered the men's room

590
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,280
ten minutes before and after
you were in the restroom.

591
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,200
And we've been staking
out Route 45 for so long.

592
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,320
They won't even let
us on the bus now.

593
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Yinghong.

594
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,040
Listen to me.

595
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Yinghong.

596
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,120
Look at me.

597
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,240
Look at me.

598
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,560
Let's take Mengmeng home.

599
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,240
Mengmeng must want to go home.

600
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Moreover,

601
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,120
your graduating students
are waiting for you.

602
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,600
These students will
eventually become memories.

603
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,280
Mengmeng is gone.

604
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,680
From now on,

605
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,080
we will have to rely on each one
of these memories to live on.

606
