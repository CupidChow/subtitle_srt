1
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,760
At 1:42 p.m. today,

2
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,720
a Route 45 bus

3
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,760
collided with a tank
trunk at the intersection

4
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,480
of Yanjiang East Road and Qiushi
Road, causing an explosion.

5
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Originally, the cause
of the explosion

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,720
was assumed to be the
explosion of the gas tank

7
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,480
when the bus and
tank truck collided.

8
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,440
But the analysis department just
discovered explosive residue

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,800
on the bus.

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,440
We highly suspect

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,320
that this was a
man-made explosion.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,440
That's why we're urgently
forming a task force.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,960
I'll be the team leader.

14
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,720
Ms. Du will be in charge
of the specific tasks.

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,840
To avoid causing
panic in society,

16
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,880
until we catch the culprit,

17
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
we won't tell the
public for now.

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,440
We must contact the
relevant departments

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,960
to enhance security.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Is it confirmed that the security
camera on the bus was destroyed?

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,040
The tech department already
did the best they can.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
They couldn't recover it.

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,520
Also, according to the bus
company's maintenance checklist,

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,080
when the Route 45 bus
left the terminal,

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,240
everything was normal.

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,400
How is the investigation
on the deceased passengers?

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,520
We've confirmed all
their identities.

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,480
We've established two directions
on how to proceed with this case.

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
One,

30
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,960
find out about the social relations
of all the dead passengers

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,440
to see if this could be a possible
case of someone seeking revenge.

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,880
The other direction

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,520
is aside from the
passengers who died,

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,680
we have to find
all the passengers

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,880
who got off at all the stops
starting from when the Route 45 bus

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,040
left the terminal.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,576
We'll investigate them one by one
and look for anything suspicious.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
Okay.

39
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,360
Grasp every single clue.

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,880
Investigate thoroughly and solve
the case as soon as possible.

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,440
<i>Hello. Please come in.</i>

42
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
I'm home.

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,320
Lucky.

44
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,120
Did you miss me?

45
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Let me see.

46
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,160
How are you, Lucky?

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,839
Are you feeling better today?

48
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,520
Make yourselves at home.

49
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,960
Hold it for me.

50
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
- Lucky.
- Don't you have asthma?

51
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Why do you have cats?

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,600
I love raising cats.

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
I've loved raising cats
ever since I was a kid.

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
But my mom wouldn't
let me have one.

55
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,096
When I was little, every
time I raised one in secret,

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
she would secretly
throw them out.

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,760
I cried a lot because of
this when I was a kid.

58
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Until I grew up and started
working to earn money,

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,960
I rented this place

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
and adopted them.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,040
I come to keep them company
after work every day.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,240
I finish feeding them first

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,680
and then I go home.

64
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,520
My parents still don't
know about this place.

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,840
How…

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,240
There's a lint
roller over there.

67
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,480
Before I go home every day...

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,760
How did you know I have asthma?

69
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,760
No.

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,720
What's going on?

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,840
Can you tell me?

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,440
Maybe we should just tell him. What
if he really came into the loop?

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,840
Loop?

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
What loop?

75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,560
Go ahead.

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
It's like this.

77
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
We stopped you at the bus today

78
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,200
and wanted to take your bag.

79
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,920
It's indeed not because
we lost a backpack.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,680
We just wanted to check
what's in your bag.

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,496
You might not believe this,

82
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,720
but we've already
checked you twice before.

83
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,040
The first time, you two fought.

84
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,400
The car exploded before we
could even open your bag.

85
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
And then the second time,

86
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
you had an asthma attack.

87
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,760
When we sent you off the bus,

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
the bus also exploded.

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
That's why for the third time, we
decided to pull you off the bus.

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,080
The way you were protecting
your bag was so suspicious,

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,560
so we thought there might be a
bomb or something in your bag.

92
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
Here's the thing.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
We don't know why we went
into a time loop either.

94
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,400
In the time loop, we discovered
that the bus would explode.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
The bomber is on the bus.

96
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
We need to check
them one by one.

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,640
You're the first
one we checked out.

98
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Yes.

99
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
But it's not even August yet.

100
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,600
How could there be a time loop?

101
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,040
August?

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,920
What's with it?

103
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,640
INCIDENT, PEOPLE, SPACE

104
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,840
ORBITING THE EARTH ENDLESSLY

105
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,080
August is the peak
of time loops.

106
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,880
But it's only May now.

107
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,680
Do time loops happen in August?

108
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,920
No. In anime, time loops
usually happen in the summer,

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,200
like in <i>Summer Wars</i>,

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,000
<i>The Girl Who Leapt Through
Time,</i> and <i>Your Name</i>.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
No, but why August?

112
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Eight.

113
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,200
If you turn it
sideways, it's infinity.

114
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,520
That's right.

115
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,840
So you believe us?

116
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,880
He doesn't just believe
it. He's excited too.

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,760
An infinite loop is
actually not that bad.

118
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,040
You're part of the real world.

119
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
You're not part of some
supernatural group.

120
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,680
The most important thing is…

121
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,159
You're both pretty good-looking.

122
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,880
What is "supernatural group"?

123
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
It's an anime game term.

124
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,159
Do you know about this too?

125
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,600
He makes games.

126
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,720
Do you make games?

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,840
I've always wanted
to make games.

128
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,720
- Here.
- Thank you.

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Have a drink.

130
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,720
Thank you for trusting me.

131
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,296
After drinking this sparkling
water, we'll be time loop buddies!

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,520
Okay.

133
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,600
No.

134
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,400
You might not even end
up in the time loop.

135
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,040
I'll definitely
enter the time loop.

136
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,000
Opportunities to save the world
are for those who are prepared.

137
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
Clearly, I'm prepared.

138
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,880
We're not saving the world.

139
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,040
We're saving the bus.

140
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
So what if it's a bus? There
were a lot of people on the bus.

141
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Don't listen to him.

142
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,920
You're right. If
the map was bigger,

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
we would have more freedom.

144
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,320
In that case, we would have
more weapons and skills.

145
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
We can study and
work during the day.

146
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
We can even date.

147
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,520
Then we'll fight at night,

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
just like in <i>Persona 5</i>.

149
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,680
What is <i>Persona 5</i>?

150
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,440
- A game.
- Say it properly.

151
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,720
<i>Persona 5</i> is the best
game in the world.

152
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
<i>The Legend of Zelda</i> is the best.

153
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,720
- Have you ever played games before?
- Wait. Hold on.

154
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,320
This isn't the time
to talk about games.

155
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,280
We should think about
what to do next.

156
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,520
Look.

157
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
He believes us now.

158
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,760
And we can eliminate
him as a suspect.

159
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Shouldn't we think about

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,080
who we should check
out next then?

161
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
I have a question.

162
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
I didn't get on the bus today.

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
I don't know who is on the bus.

164
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,600
Let's draw them for him.

165
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you want to draw or should I?

166
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,520
This is the entrance of the bus.

167
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,280
When you come in, there's
a muscular man on the left.

168
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,680
And there's a livestream host
wearing a floral shirt on this side.

169
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,720
<i>Neither of them has any luggage.</i>

170
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
And this guy has a
strong sense of justice.

171
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,160
This guy has positive energy,

172
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,440
so we can eliminate those two.

173
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,040
There's an old man sitting here.

174
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,160
<i>We don't know what's in his bag.</i>

175
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,720
There's a hole in his bag.

176
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,440
I think they were watermelons.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
There's a middle-aged
woman sitting here.

178
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,480
There's a red bag at her feet.

179
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
We don't know what it is.

180
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,040
There's an old
lady sitting here.

181
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
<i>Her bag is full of medicine.</i>

182
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,160
There's a middle-aged
man sitting here.

183
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,520
<i>He brought a suitcase.</i>

184
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,680
Hold on.

185
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
A suitcase?

186
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
No.

187
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,280
That's not right.

188
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,160
From this place, whether it's to
the airport or the train station,

189
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
there are direct buses.

190
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,800
There's no need to
take the Route 45 bus.

191
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
You would have to make
the transfer midway.

192
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,400
Could his suitcase…

193
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,600
Why are you so familiar
with the route?

194
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,720
Of course I am. I'm from Jialin.

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,560
But even though
he has a suitcase,

196
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,480
he doesn't have to be going to a
train station or the airport, right?

197
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Excuse me.

198
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,640
Hello, Mom.

199
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm off work. I'll be home soon.

200
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,160
Why are you waiting
for me? You eat first.

201
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,600
Why do you have to wait for me?

202
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,400
Okay, I got it. I'll
be home right away.

203
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Bye.

204
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

205
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,000
My mom is rushing me.

206
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
- I haven't fed them yet. I should hurry.
- Okay.

207
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,920
I have a question.

208
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
In all the loops when I died,

209
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,960
what happened to my cats?

210
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,200
When I wake up tomorrow,

211
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,760
I'll either be
living my normal life

212
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,680
or I'll be in the time loop.

213
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,520
But if I still die
in the next loop…

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
Forget it. I'd better go home.

215
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
Otherwise, my mom will scream.

216
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,720
TO THE DESOLATE WORLD

217
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,320
GATEWAY TO HAPPY PLANET

218
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
What's wrong?

219
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,040
This is so strange.

220
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,440
They are usually not like that.

221
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,320
They usually ignore me. Why
are they so clingy today?

222
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,600
Do you think

223
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,160
they might know that I won't
be in this world tomorrow?

224
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,520
Doesn't that prove you'll
enter the time loop?

225
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Yes.

226
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,560
Well, I'm going home.

227
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Where are you going?

228
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,840
If you really don't
have anywhere to go,

229
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,720
you can spend a night
at my secret base.

230
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
The passcode is 666666.

231
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,520
Thank you.

232
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,880
But it doesn't
matter where we go.

233
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,600
Even if I don't enter the time
loop, I can still help you.

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
As long as you summon me,

235
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
I'll believe you.

236
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,880
Okay.

237
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
Then I'll tell you

238
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,280
that I know you have
a cat in your bag

239
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
and I know about
this secret base.

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,560
There are a lot of cats here.

241
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Will you believe me?

242
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Yes.

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
Right.

244
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,800
Actually, you can
call out my name.

245
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,160
I'll believe you right away.

246
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,520
What's your name then?

247
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Lu,

248
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,600
Cat Apostle,

249
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,000
Asthma Conqueror,

250
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,400
The One Chosen by the Light,

251
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Di.

252
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,920
Remember that.

253
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
Bye.

254
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,760
Who would remember
such a long name?

255
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,000
Don't you think
it's kind of cute?

256
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
Is this cute?

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,240
Anyhow, he's probably the
only person in the world

258
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,120
who will believe us.

259
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
I have a booking.

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,720
Can I see your ID?

262
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,120
I'll need to see
both of your IDs.

263
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Okay.

264
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,640
TIGER SWORD E-SPORTS HOTEL

265
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,760
This is an Internet café.

266
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
I know.

267
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,760
Okay, thank you.

268
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,920
Here is your ID
card and room key.

269
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,200
Okay, thank you.

270
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,856
Why don't you grab two
bottles of sparkling water?

271
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,680
- I'll get instant noodles.
- Instant noodles?

272
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm hungry.

273
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,840
Pulling an all-nighter at an Internet café
isn't complete without instant noodles.

274
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,280
This is my first
time hearing that.

275
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Press that.

276
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,720
- Lu Di, you're finally back.
- Mom.

277
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,880
Gosh.

278
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,520
Here, give me your bag.

279
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Thank you.

280
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,280
I told you to eat first.
Don't wait for me.

281
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,800
How can we not
wait for you? Gosh.

282
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,080
How can we eat without you?

283
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Dad.

284
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,440
Stop right there.

285
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
What's this?

286
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,320
Did you secretly go and
play with cats again?

287
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,160
That's enough. Wash your
hands and eat first.

288
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,880
- I'll go…
- No. Stop.

289
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,776
- Mom, let me wash my hands and eat first.
- No.

290
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Wait. Stop.

291
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,720
It's fur. There's fur on
you. You're a grown-up now.

292
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,240
Why do you always make me worry?

293
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,280
Stop right there! Don't go!

294
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,400
Look at you.

295
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,000
Tell me, have you been playing
with cats in secret again?

296
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
I asked you a question.

297
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Have you?

298
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,920
Yes, I went to play with cats.

299
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,560
But aren't I just fine now? I
didn't have an asthma attack.

300
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,760
My condition has
already stabilized.

301
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,360
Cats don't affect me at all.

302
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,400
I've always listened
to the doctor.

303
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,816
I always took my medication and
didn't do any strenuous sports.

304
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,560
I never played basketball
or went swimming.

305
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,280
I don't have any friends
even until now, Mom.

306
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,776
I listen to you when I go out
every day. I always wear a mask.

307
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,240
Do you know what
people think of me?

308
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,840
They all think I'm weird.

309
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,720
You keep me cooped
up at home every day.

310
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,400
But I don't care
about any of that.

311
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,080
My only wish is to have a cat.

312
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,600
What do I have to do for
you to let me get a cat?

313
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,120
Dad, Mom.

314
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,880
If something serious
happens to me one day

315
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,600
and I just manage to survive,

316
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,920
would you let me have a cat?

317
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
We don't let you have a cat

318
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,120
so that you can live.

319
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,440
Hey, stop!

320
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,720
Open the door.

321
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
Open the door!

322
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Do you hear me?

323
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,000
Lu Di.

324
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,560
Are you okay?

325
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,920
Lu Di, what's wrong?

326
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,280
Lower your voice.

327
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,960
Lu Di, open the door.
Let me help you.

328
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,480
Be quiet.

329
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,720
Lu Di, are you okay?

330
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,600
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP, JIALIN

331
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:28,600

333
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,560
Find these people.

334
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,920
- Yes.
- Okay.

335
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,840
Okay.

336
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,840
JIALIN CRIME POLICE

337

UNKNOWN CALLER

338
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Hello.

339
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,440
<i>Hello, is this Lu Di?</i>

340
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Yes.

341
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm from the municipal CID.

342
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
I want to ask you something.

343
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,000
Around 1:35 p.m. today,

344
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
at the Yanjiang
East Road bus stop,

345
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,000
did you have an argument
with a man and woman

346
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,960
when you were about to
get on a Route 45 bus?

347
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Yes.

348
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,560
<i>This bus ended up in a serious
traffic accident afterward.</i>

349
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,680
<i>Do you know about that?</i>

350
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,440
I know.

351
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,760
<i>Where are you now?</i>

352
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,440
<i>Can you come to
the police station?</i>

353
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
<i>Or do you want us to
send a car to get you?</i>

354
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>We need your cooperation
for further investigation.</i>

355
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,560
Right now?

356
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,760
<i>Yes, now.</i>

357
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Okay.

358
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,280
Lu Di, what happened
to you just now?

359
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,320
It sounded like you weren't
feeling well just now.

360
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,720
Is it because of the cat fur?

361
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,120
No, I'm going out.

362
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,120
Where are you
going at this hour?

363
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,760
To the police station.

364
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,680
To the police station?

365
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,040
You…

366
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,280
Why are you going to the
police station? What happened?

367
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,440
The police want to ask
me for some information.

368
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,360
I almost got on a Route
45 bus this afternoon.

369
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,080
Is it the bus that exploded
at the intersection?

370
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,720
Yes.

371
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,880
My goodness.

372
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,840
Why didn't you come home to tell
us about something so serious?

373
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,600
You never tell your
family anything.

374
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
Gosh.

375
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Then…

376
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,920
Why do the police
want to see you?

377
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,160
They just want to know
about the situation.

378
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,000
- Then your dad and I will go with you.
- No.

379
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,120
- No, we have to go with you.
- All right.

380
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,280
You shouldn't go.

381
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,400
I'll go with him.

382
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,296
- No...
- He's just helping with the investigation.

383
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,240
We'll be back soon.

384
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,680
No one has to go.
I can go alone.

385
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,800
Lu Di.

386
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
I'll drive you.

387
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,000
Think about what you've
done recently in the car.

388
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,960
Why are the police
looking for you?

389
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,920
Let me get my headphones then.

390
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
- Okay, that's enough.
- Do you think…

391
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Come on.

392
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,280
- No.
- That's enough.

393
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,320
<i>Dad, Mom.</i>

394
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,000
<i>I almost got on the bus
that exploded today.</i>

395
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,840
<i>I was so close to getting on it.</i>

396
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,120
<i>I'm thinking</i>

397
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,840
<i>if the grim reaper had
caught me this time,</i>

398
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,480
<i>how would you remember me?</i>

399
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,760
<i>An asthma patient who's
disobedient and dresses strangely,</i>

400
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
<i>someone who has no friends,</i>

401
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,520
<i>always complains to you,</i>

402
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,520
<i>and is a social outcast.</i>

403
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,040
<i>I actually feel richer
and more fulfilled inside</i>

404
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,480
<i>than your colleagues' children.</i>

405
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
<i>I found my purpose in
life a long time ago.</i>

406
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,880
<i>I'll devote my heart to
protecting my dimension.</i>

407
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,160
<i>My only regret</i>

408
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,160
<i>is that perhaps no one
will award me with a medal</i>

409
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
<i>that I can hang on
the living room wall</i>

410
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080

411
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,840

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
<i>you'll know my secret.</i>

417

<i>Don't be disappointed in me.</i>

418
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
<i>You should think
of it like this.</i>

419
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,560
<i>I tried to have
the life I wanted.</i>

420
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,720
<i>I was happy.</i>

421
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,560
<i>Thank you for always
protecting me.</i>

422
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,960
<i>I just want to say I
love you guys so much.</i>

423
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,960
<i>I'm very happy and content.</i>

424
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,120

431

<i>They are so cool.</i>

432
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,280
<i>Maybe in a parallel universe,</i>

433
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,200
<i>I fought alongside them</i>

434
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
<i>and saved a whole bus of people.</i>

435
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,680

"At 1:42 p.m. today…"

452
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,400
I saw that too.

453
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,880
Wang Xingde…

454
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,920
HE IS A GOOD DRIVER

455
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,360
I've known the
driver for so long.

456
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,840
I only found out his name now.

457
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,680
POLICE NOTICE

458
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,360
"An outstanding driver with no
accident history for four years.

passenger left on the bus.

There was 30,000 yuan worth

462
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,800
I often rode his bus.

463
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,960
He is a really nice guy.

464
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,760
He even helped me before.

465
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,160
We still have the time loop.

466
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
We have a chance
to save the driver

467
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,680
and everyone on the bus.

468
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Yes.

469
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,600
We still have a chance.

470
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
We can do it.

<i>"We should consider

<i>"Life is a mirror. If you
frown at it, it frowns back."</i>

474
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,216

<i>- It's a loss if you're unhappy today.</i>

475
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
<i>Why shouldn't you be happy?
You must be happy, right?</i>

482
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,360
<i>See you there.</i>

483
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,280
<i>Yes!</i>

484
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,080
THIS BASTARD ALWAYS SAYS "YES"

485
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
No.

486
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,240
How can netizens
say that about him?

487
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
Look at this.

488
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,160
<i>It's healthy too.</i>

489
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,800
<i>A healthy commute

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
<i>Yes!</i>

499
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,480
WHAT'S WITH THE OLD GUY IN THE
BACK? HIS EXPRESSION LOOKS SCARY.

500
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,840
Do you think

501
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,360
there's really a problem
with that old man?

502
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,480
Judging from how he was,

503
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
he doesn't look like a guy
who would blow up a bus.

504
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,960
Think about what we
thought of Lu Di.

505
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,320
He was wearing a mask and a hat.

506
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,640
He obviously looked dangerous.

507
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,000
But it turns out he's a geek.

508
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,360
That's why you can't
judge a book by its cover.

509
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,920
- Is it the police?
- I think so too.

510
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
I remember this number.

511
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,640
Should I answer it?

512
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,120
Hello.

513
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,440
<i>Hello, are you Li Shiqing?</i>

514
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,600
Yes, it's me.

515
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,600
<i>I'm from the municipal CID.</i>

516
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,040
<i>May I ask if you got off</i>

517
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,200
<i>at the Yanjiang East
Road stop this afternoon</i>

518
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,000
<i>and had an altercation with
a passenger named Lu Di?</i>

519
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,200
Yes.

520
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,480
But it was a misunderstanding.

521
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,160
We explained everything to him.

522
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,640
<i>We want to know more
about the situation.</i>

523
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,680
<i>Are you with Xiao Heyun now?</i>

524
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,560
We are together.

525
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,440
<i>We'd like you to come
to the police station.</i>

526
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,200
<i>We're conducting
interviews with passengers</i>

527
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,520
<i>who took the Route 45
bus this afternoon.</i>

528
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,640
<i>We hope you can cooperate.</i>

529
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,720
Okay, we'll be right there.

530
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
<i>Okay.</i>

531
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,760
It's so late, but they
still want to question us.

532
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,200
They must have found out
there's a bomb on the bus.

533
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,000
Otherwise, they wouldn't
be in such a hurry.

534
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,800
They don't suspect
us again, do they?

535
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,480
Probably not.

536
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,360
If they do, they wouldn't have called.
They would've just come straight to us.

537
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
That's true.

538
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,080
What are you looking for?

539
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm checking if there
are any news updates.

540
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,320
JIALIN PAYS EXTRA ATTENTION
TO DRIVERS' HEALTH

541
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,600
It's still the same
news from the afternoon.

542
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,360
It says the bus crashed
into the tank truck.

543
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,280
No one has said
anything about the bomb.

544
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,640
All these other media outlets
are just making things up.

545
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,040
None of it is true.

546
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,200
If we have to deal
with the police,

547
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,520
we can't say we know
about the bomb yet.

548
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,520
We have to tell the truth indirectly.
Otherwise, they'll suspect us again.

549
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
It's okay.

550
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,120
Didn't you say we should look at
things by thinking into the future?

551
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,960
Perhaps going to the
police station this time

552
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,680
will allow us to get
more information.

553
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,320
Take this old man for example.

554
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,560
We're trying to find out
more about him, right?

555
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,000
- Don't you agree?
- Hold on.

556
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,240
The police must have found us
through the surveillance footage.

557
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,520
Probably.

558
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,720
Didn't she just say

559
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
she knows we got off at
the Yanjiang East Road stop

560
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
and that we argued with Lu Di…

561
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,200
Since they found us,

562
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,920
they'll surely find Lu Di too.

563
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,159
Even we don't know how to
deal with the police. Then he…

564
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,080
He can't maintain his composure.

565
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,440
He'll definitely tell
them about the time loop.

566
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,440
I forgot to get his number.

567
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm actually quite
grateful to them.

568
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,920
If they hadn't pushed
me off the bus,

569
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,960
I would have died
in the accident.

570
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,400
What happened after?

571
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,199
Then we got off the bus.

572
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,239
Mr. Zhang.

573
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Sit.

574
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,440
How are you doing?
Are you nervous?

575
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,719
A little.

576
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,440
Don't be nervous. Here.

577
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,440
Your dad brought this.

578
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,159
I brought my own medication.

579
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,880
If possible, go out and tell him

580
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,880
to go home first.

581
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,080
I can go home by myself.

582
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,480
Kids just don't
understand parents' love.

583
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,440
Your dad insists on waiting
to go home with you.

584
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,960
How is the interrogation going?

585
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,160
I've already asked him.

586
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,360
The passengers thought Lu
Di was carrying their bag

587
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,680
because they lost their bag
on the bus two days ago.

588
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,520
The two went to open
his bag and took a look.

589
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,720
After that, they parted ways.

590
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,480
From what he said,

591
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,880
they don't know each other.

592
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,000
They didn't exchange numbers
when they parted ways.

593
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,440
Well done, young man.

594
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
You're magnanimous.

595
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,400
Actually, I was a little
angry at the time.

596
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,680
But there's one
thing you don't know.

597
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,120
I lost my cat and they
helped me look for it.

598
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,680
That girl was so gentle
when she held my cat.

599
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,160
She clearly loves cats.

600
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,120
All misunderstandings between
cat lovers can be resolved.

601
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,440
Ask those two later.

602
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
If their stories
match, they can go.

603
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
I got it.

604
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Are those two here too?

605
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,840
Yes.

606
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,800
Sit here for a bit.

607
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Mr. Zhang.

608
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,080
Is there a problem?

609
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,520
Their relationship isn't
as simple as he says.

610
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,080
Lu Di never got on the bus.

611
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,200
He doesn't know about
the situation on the bus.

612
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,720
Focus on asking those two about
anything strange on the bus later.

613
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
I got it.

614
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Let's go.

615
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,520
