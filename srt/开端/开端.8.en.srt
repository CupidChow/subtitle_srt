1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
Here.

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
- Fill up the glasses.
- Here.

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
It's a good thing that
Qiangzi is going back home.

4
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,200
Why the long faces?

5
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
Let's drink. Come on.

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm going back to
my hometown too.

7
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,840
Now that the
construction has stopped,

8
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,320
I can't even pay my rent.

9
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,040
I really regret not studying harder.
I applied for a security job.

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Yet they didn't want me.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,200
Mr. Jiao, you're going
back to your hometown too?

12
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,319
My daughter is about
to go to high school.

13
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,040
I have to find a way to pay for
her tuition and living expenses.

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,320
Also, she doesn't know about what
happened at the construction site.

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,640
If I go back,

16
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,440
she'll surely be distracted.

17
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,360
It might even affect how
she does on her exams.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
Are you still living
in that garage?

19
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,080
It's starting to get hot.

20
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,280
There are no windows or
water. How can you live there?

21
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
It's just a place to sleep.

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm planning to do deliveries
with my nephew in Old Town.

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,680
Why don't you try
it out with me?

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,640
Deliveries?

25
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
You don't know, do you?

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,240
Young people these days

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,320
have no time to buy anything.

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,600
They have to rely on others
to bring them food and drinks.

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,320
You're right.

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,840
That's what I do
to earn money now.

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,000
I only have
elementary education.

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,200
And I'm terrible at talking.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not as smart as you.

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
You're clever.

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
I can't do it.

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
You just run errands
and find the addresses.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,320
It's fine as long as you're
willing to work hard.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
But to do this,

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,840
you'll need an electric scooter.

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
An electric scooter?

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,480
Get a used one.

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,200
Just save up 700 to 800 yuan

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,440
and buy a used one.

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,720
Mr. Jiang.

45
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,656
How much did you get for your
Good Samaritan Award last time?

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
I got 20,000.

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Mr. Jiang, you've
hit the jackpot.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
People like us

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,160
struggle to survive day-to-day.

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,016
- Utensils are two yuan.
- I don't dare to spend a penny of it.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,280
- You can check on the Internet.
- Forget it. You're ripping me off.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,816
- What are you talking about?
- Why are you charging for paper?

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,960
- We've been here so many times.
- What are you doing?

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,056
- No, she…
- Are you stupid?

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
- Qiangzi.
- Why are you fighting?

56
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
- Stop it, Qiangzi.
- Why are you arguing?

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,520
- Qiangzi.
- Come on, Qiangzi.

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,960
That's enough, Qiangzi.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,360
- All right, knock it off.
- No.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,800
- Did you pay her?
- Stop it.

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,320
- All right.
- Hey, Mr. Jiang.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,680
Everything costs money.

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,680
KNOW YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
AS A LANDLORD

64
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,080
STOP ILLEGAL
HABITATION OF GARAGES

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,320
CLAMPING DOWN ON THOSE
ILLEGALLY LIVING IN GARAGES

66
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,240
Mr. Jiao, you're finally back.

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,880
You're a hard man to find.

68
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,920
I've been looking for you for three
days, but you were nowhere to be found.

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Sir.

70
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,840
I've been busy at the
construction site.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
Okay.

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,400
Pack up and move out.

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,800
We're running out of time.

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I can get the money for
the rent in two days.

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not about the rent.

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
The residents' committee
has informed us.

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,040
All garages can no
longer be rented out.

78
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,440
Why not?

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,280
They are going to check out the
rental situation of all the garages.

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,641
If they find anyone living in
one, we'll be fined heavily.

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
How could I dare to
let you stay here?

82
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,280
Pay the rent,

83
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,720
pack your things, and leave.

84
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Sir.

85
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,280
This is all I have.

86
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,720
Give me two more days.

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
I'll move as soon
as I find a place.

88
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,200
This is only enough
for last month's rent.

89
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,096
You stayed for one extra week,
but I won't ask for that money.

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,696
Still, you have to
move out immediately.

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,440
The inspectors
will be here soon.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There's no time.

93
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,880
If I had a place to move, I
would have already done it.

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Here.

95
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Take it.

96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,960
I really can't let you live
in this garage anymore.

97
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,480
This bit of money
is not worth it.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Mr. Jiao.

99
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,640
Please understand.

100
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,640
It's hard for all of us, right?

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
GANGWU NEW VILLAGE STOP

102
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

103
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,560
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang East Road.</i>

104
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,320
Those two are weird indeed.

105
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
They didn't eat the watermelon

106
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,920
and no matter what happened
in the previous loops,

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
they acted like it was
none of their business.

108
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Do you think

109
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,159
these two could be
working together?

110
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,840
I don't think so.

111
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,120
If they were working
together, they'd sit together.

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,880
They are going to die anyway. There
is no need to avoid each other.

113
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
That's true.

114
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,440
This suitcase

115
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,480
is a bit difficult to check.

116
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,320
The plastic bag is
probably easier.

117
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,320
Why don't we start
with her this time?

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Okay.

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
I'll do it this time.

120
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Ma'am.

121
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Ma'am.

122
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,800
Do you have a
sanitary pad with you?

123
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,160
My period is here.

124
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,440
I don't have one with me.
I'd like to borrow one.

125
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,640
No.

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
No?

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,200
But I think I saw
some in your bag.

128
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,160
That's why I asked you. You…

129
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,440
I probably mistook the bag
inside for the packaging.

131
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,920
Ma'am, why did you bring a pot?

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
What's inside?

134
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,440
It looked heavy when you
brought it on the bus.

135
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm curious about what's inside.

136
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Meat.

137
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Meat.

138
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,280
Stewed meat in a
pressure cooker?

139
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
Sorry for disturbing you.

140
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Weren't you too straightforward?

141
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,400
Don't you find it strange?

142
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,920
Who carries food in a
pot when they go out?

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,560
Don't they use
insulated lunch boxes?

144
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Our family carries
meat in a pot.

145
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,120
When I was in college, my mom
used to bring us a pot of meat.

146
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,280
It's very normal.

147
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,840
If that's the case,

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,160
she can be cleared of suspicion.

149
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Did you smell it?

150
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Any smell of meat?

151
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
I think I smelled something,

152
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,040
but I can't tell
what the smell is.

153
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
It might be a spice
in the stewed meat.

154
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,080
When you grabbed her things just now,
she didn't really have any reaction.

155
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,520
Maybe it's really not her.

156
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,320
If it's not her,

157
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,800
then don't we…

158
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,120
already have a conclusion?

159
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,760
But how do we
check the suitcase?

160
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,440
When the door opens
at the next stop,

161
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,720
just throw the suitcase off.

162
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
Let's take a gamble.

163
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
What if we're wrong?

164
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,680
If we're wrong…

165
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,240
The loop this time has moved
up to Gangwu New Village stop.

166
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,120
The next loop will
still shift earlier.

167
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,080
Then we'll just stop that
lady outside the bus.

168
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,360
NEXT STOP, YANJIANG EAST ROAD

169
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,040
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

170
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,880
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

171
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,640
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

172
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

173
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,960
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

174
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,440
What's going on? Are you okay?

175
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,640
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT

176
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,000
JIAO JIAO, FIRST PLACE IN THE
MIDDLE SCHOOL MATH OLYMPIAD

177
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

178
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,320
Hurry and get off.

179
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,480
Excuse me, coming through.

180
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Run!

181
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Mr. Jiao.

182
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,000
Here's a suitcase.

183
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,880
You can use it.

184
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,920
Don't worry about it. It's old.

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,560
I'll throw it away
if you don't use it.

186
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Thank you.

187
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Are there things inside?

188
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,800
We must've forgotten to clean it out
after my wife and I went on a trip.

189
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,920
Take whatever is useful to
you. Throw the rest out.

190
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,920
Hello.

191
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,880
Are they coming to our
neighborhood in the afternoon?

192
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,440
Have they inspected
your neighborhood?

193
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,920
Did they really fine you?

194
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
They really did?

195
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
How much is the fine?

196
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,600
The rent we get every
month is so little.

197
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,760
Now that we're getting fined,
it was all for nothing.

198
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Okay.

199
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Mr. Jiao.

200
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,920
I really don't mean to
put you on the spot.

201
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,200
Every time the residents'
committee came to do inspections,

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,240
I managed to fool them.

203
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,200
But the fire department
is coming this time.

204
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,440
I'll be fined if I get caught.

205
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,800
I can't help it.

206
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,320
Do you have a place to stay?

208
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,480
I have a colleague who
lives across the river.

209
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,120
I'll ask him for help.

210
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,360
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT

211
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,200
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT

212
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
Jiaojiao.

213
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,240
Listen to me.

214
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,280
You have to study hard.

215
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,720
Don't think too much.

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,280
I'm fine here.

217
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,080
I'll work hard to earn
more money for us.

218
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,200
From now on, if you need
anything, just tell me.

219
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,320
Whether they are sanitary
pads or cleansers,

220
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,600
we can afford it.

221
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,080
<i>Will you stop
talking about that?</i>

222
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,920
<i>Dad, I really don't want
to go to school anymore.</i>

223
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,319
<i>School costs money.</i>

224
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,480
<i>I went to town and asked.</i>

225
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,720
<i>I can get a job.</i>

226
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,000
<i>Let's work together.</i>

227
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,520
<i>We'll be able to
pay off your debt.</i>

228
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,079
Okay, that's enough!

229
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,400
Pay off my debt? I already told
you to stop bringing that up.

230
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,240
Stop worrying about that.

231
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,920
You have to go to
school tomorrow.

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,599
If you don't go, I'll teach
you a lesson when I get back.

233
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,079
Hello?

234
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Hello?

235
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
<i>Hello.</i>

236
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,640
<i>The person you are trying
to reach is currently busy.</i>

237
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
<i>Please try again later.</i>

238
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,880
KNOW YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
AS A LANDLORD

239
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,560
STOP ILLEGAL
HABITATION OF GARAGES

240
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,560
Ma'am.

241
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Do you need my help?

242
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,880
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

243
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,560
Sir, can I get some change?

244
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,000
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

245
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,680
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang East Road.</i>

246
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Xiao Heyun.

247
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Xiao Heyun.

248
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,160
Wake up.

249
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,600
The time didn't move up.
They were already on the bus.

250
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Xiao Heyun.

251
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Xiao Heyun.

252
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,880
Wake up.

253
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Xiao Heyun, wake up.

254
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
Xiao Heyun, don't scare me.

255
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,520
Can you hear me?

256
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,920
- Wake up.
- What happened?

257
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,440
- Can you hear me, Xiao Heyun?
- What's going on?

258
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
- Xiao Heyun.
- What's wrong?

259
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,960
- What happened?
- Xiao Heyun.

260
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,960
Don't shake him. You can't
shake him. Don't move.

261
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Xiao Heyun.

262
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,840
His breathing is weak.

263
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,840
- Sir, stop the bus!
- Wake up.

264
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
- Someone is sick!
- Sir!

265
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
- Sir, stop the bus.
- Xiao Heyun.

266
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,920
Stop the bus. Someone is sick!

267
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,216
- Xiao Heyun, don't scare me.
- He's dying. He can't breathe.

268
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,440
Wake up, Xiao Heyun.

269
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,760
Stop yelling.

270
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,520
He's awake.

271
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,320
Let me see.

272
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Little girl,

273
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,920
does he have some
kind of illness?

274
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
It's okay.

275
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm fine.

276
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Do you call that fine?

277
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,640
You almost stopped breathing.

278
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
It was just sleep paralysis.

279
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,320
Sleep paralysis?

280
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,960
What kind of power put you into
paralysis in broad daylight?

281
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
Don't talk nonsense.

282
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,360
Little girl.

283
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,360
You have to take
him to the hospital.

284
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,800
Young people these days
are under a lot of stress.

285
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
Problems develop easily.

286
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,960
Don't let your guard down.

287
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,160
Look how scared your
girlfriend is. She's so pale.

288
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
Do you need any medicine?

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,880
No, thank you.

290
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,880
It's okay, ma'am.

291
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,480
I have all kinds
of medicine here.

292
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,160
Just tell me if
you need anything.

293
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,760
You really scared me just now.

294
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,720
I thought you wouldn't wake up.

295
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
I could hear you,

296
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,880
but I just couldn't wake up.

297
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,480
Were you stuck in standby mode?

298
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,280
Thank goodness you woke up.

299
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,040
I don't know what I'd
do if I were alone.

300
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,440
It just hit me in the face.

301
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,360
It hurts so much.

302
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,040
How long have you been awake?

303
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,120
When I woke up,

304
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,680
it was the same as last time.

305
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,400
The time didn't move up.
They were already on the bus.

306
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,840
That means

307
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,320
once the bomb is on the
bus, the time won't move up.

308
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Xiao Heyun.

309
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,240
If the time doesn't
move up anymore,

310
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,080
then has the time loop

311
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
ended too?

312
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,920
If the time loop ends,

313
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
then…

314
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,320
Then this is our last
chance to get off the bus.

315
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,920
It's also the last chance of
survival for the people on this bus.

316
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
What…

317
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
What should we do?

318
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Are we…

319
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,440
Are we really getting off?

320
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,760
Haven't we already decided?

321
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,560
Actually, I want to live too.

322
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm human. I'm
afraid of dying too.

323
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,640
Actually…

324
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,520
I wanted to get off every time.

325
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,000
I even secretly thought

326
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,080
that I could take
advantage of this time loop

327
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,480
to do something outrageous
and unrestrained.

328
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,320
For example, I don't have to worry
about spending too much money.

329
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
I can eat and drink all I want
without worrying about gaining weight.

330
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Or…

331
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,440
I can stay up all night
at an Internet café

332
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,920
without going back to my dorm.

333
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,560
But those are the only
things I can think of

334
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,000
that could make me happy.

335
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm just an ordinary person.

336
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,880
I can only imagine so much.

337
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,560
But I think…

338
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,240
If we can save the
people on this bus,

339
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,360
that's the most outrageous and
unrestrained thing I can think of.

340
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,520
Moreover, right now,

341
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,160
they are no longer
strangers to me.

342
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,080
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

343
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm not getting off.

344
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
I'm sorry.

345
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,200
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

346
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,656
- Let's try one last time.
<i>- Please exit through the rear door.</i>

347
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,520
<i>Please tap your card when
exiting. Please mind the doors.</i>

348
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,720
Sir, don't close the
door yet. Wait a moment.

349
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,760
- We dropped something.
- Thank you.

350
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,880
We have to look for it.

351
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

352
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
Young man.

353
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
Are you feeling better?

354
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,160
- I'm fine now.
- Don't forget to go to the hospital.

355
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Okay.

356
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,440
What are you looking for?

357
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,880
If it's nothing important,
don't look for it.

358
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
I lost my flash drive.

359
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,096
- Very important documents are on it.
- A flash drive?

360
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,160
You have to find it then.

361
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,560
What color is it?

362
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
It's about the same
color as the floor.

363
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,840
So it's gray.

364
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,200
A flash drive?

365
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,576
- I don't see a flash drive.
- No.

366
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
Help them find it.

367
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,760
It's not at the front.

368
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,240
I'm sorry, you…

369
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,080
What's happening?

370
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,560
- Why are you stealing?
- What are you doing?

371
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
- Go!
- Xiao Heyun!

372
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,000
Go!

373
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Xiao Heyun!

374
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,160
There's a murderer!

375
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,400
Run!

376
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,360
Open the door, sir!

377
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,080
Help her!

378
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,800
Help her!

379
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,320
Don't let her pull it!

380
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,400
Don't let her pull it!

381
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,640
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

382
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760

Shiqing.

387
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Wake up.

388
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,600
Wake up!

389
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
It's me.

390
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
It's okay now.

391
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
It's okay.

This time, we'll get
off at the next stop.

395
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,000
Let's forget about everything.

396
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
We still came back after all.

397
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Don't think about it.

398
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,840
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

Let's try one more time.

403
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,320
It's not worth it.

404
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,560
What happened?

405
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,760
Someone died.
