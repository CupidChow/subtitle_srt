00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,960
We'd like to know about
the victim, your dad.

5
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,040
Did he have other friends
and colleagues here?

6
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Ma'am.

7
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,720
Ma'am.

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Mom.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
We just want to know

10
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,040
about Ma Guoqiang's
social connections here.

11
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,080
Is there anything
you can tell us?

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
Who was the driver?

13
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,200
The driver?

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,760
The driver was Mr. Wang Xingde.

15
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,560
My Lu Di.

16
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,640
My Lu Di.

17
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,600
Sir.

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,040
- Sir, calm down. I…
- I need to find my son. I'm calm.

19
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
- Don't stop us.
- Sir, you…

20
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,616
- Calm down first.
- I have to look for my son.

21
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,520
- I'm very calm.
- Okay, calm down.

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,680
- I have to look for my son, okay?
- Xiaoliu.

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Mr. Zhang.

24
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,840
Whatever it is,
you can talk to me.

25
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,320
My son Lu Di isn't
dead. He's alive.

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,616
He has been here the whole
time. Nothing happened to him.

27
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,560
Look.

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,040
I just opened this
and took a look.

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,520
All of my son's electronic
devices are linked together.

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Look.

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,240
These coordinates show the
location of his tablet.

32
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,000
It has been moving
this whole time.

33
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,360
Look, it has still been moving
since it left Anime City.

34
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,280
Anime City?

35
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
See?

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
Where exactly are we going?

37
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
To my friend's house.

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,080
The target has stopped.

39
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,600
I'll hold that for you.

40
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,320
Xiao Heyun, you're
a damn criminal now?

41
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,136
I didn't believe it until
the police showed me a photo.

42
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,200
What the hell happened?

43
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
I can't explain this in
just a few words. I...

44
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,240
The police told me to call them
as soon as I get a hold of you.

45
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,336
- Turn yourself in right now.
- Hold on.

46
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,056
- I have something to tell you.
- What fucking else do you have to say?

47
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,160
Haven't you caused enough trouble for
me, the studio, your dad, and your mom?

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,920
I indeed stabbed someone.

49
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,960
But I had nothing to do
with the bus explosion.

50
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm here to ask you to delete all
information about me from the game.

51
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Xiao Heyun, can you
not be so selfish?

52
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,200
The studio isn't just yours.

53
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,896
Do we have to delete it
just because you say so?

54
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Can you stop acting
crazy whenever you want?

55
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,880
Can you?

56
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,960
I was wrong to fight
violence with violence.

57
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,600
I apologize. I'm sorry.

58
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,400
You guys can change it
however you want now.

59
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,840
Sorry?

60
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
You're sorry?

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,456
Back then when the game wasn't
approved due to bloody violence,

62
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,256
we told you to change it,
but you insisted not to.

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,936
You kept talking about hardcore games
getting approved overseas and stuff.

64
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,720
We're about to lose this game
because you kept delaying things.

65
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,256
If I had not gone around sucking
up to investors for money,

66
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
would you still be able to
stand here and say that?

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
Am I just a piece
of shit to you?

68
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,680
Do you see all your colleagues
in the studio as pieces of shit?

69
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,280
Why do you always think only of
yourself and never of other people?

70
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,120
You guys mean a lot to me.

71
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
That's why I don't want you
to suffer because of me.

72
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
As long as you kick me out,

73
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
you guys can still continue.

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,560
I admit it.

75
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,120
I…

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
I used to be irresponsible.

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,200
I was very selfish.

78
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
But for some things,

79
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,120
you would only understand
after you experience it.

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,080
How can I explain this to you?

81
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Xiaoluo.

82
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
- You three, go that way.
- Okay.

83
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Xiao Heyun.

84
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,720
I don't care what
happens to you today.

85
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,200
Get all of your matters settled.

86
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,320
Go to the police if
that's what's right.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,360
Don't hide if you've
really run into trouble.

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Take good care of everything.

89
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,720
Then we can still be friends.

90
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
I know.

91
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
I'll turn myself in.

92
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,000
Police.

93
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Cooperate with us.

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,880
Mr. Zhang, there's no one.

95
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,440
- Where is he?
- He left.

96
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,720
Where did he go?

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
He said he was going
to turn himself in.

98
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
Take him back to the station.

99
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Let's go.

100
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
We've never tried
this method before.

101
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
Are you sleepy?

102
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm all right.

103
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,440
Are you really going
to turn yourself in?

104
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
But…

105
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,720
I want to wait until
you fall asleep

106
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
before I turn myself in.

107
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,640
If this really is the last loop,

108
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,240
this might be my last
moment of freedom.

109
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
What are you doing?

110
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,600
I…

111
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,480
I want to keep myself awake.

112
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,320
Is your arm okay?

113
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,080
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

114
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,560
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

115
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,760
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

116
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,960
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

117
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,680
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

118
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

119
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,760
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

120
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,720
<i>Xiao Heyun!</i>

121
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
Xiao Heyun.

122
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Xiao Heyun.

123
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,880
Xiao Heyun, wake up.

124
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Xiao Heyun.

125
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,760
Wake up.

126
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

127
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang East Road.</i>

128
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
We're back again.

129
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
What's wrong?

130
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,720
Are you okay?

131
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,040
After waking up this time,

132
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
I feel so tired.

133
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,880
Did you turn yourself in?

134
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,760
After the police took us away,

135
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,160
I fell asleep in the car.

136
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,240
Do you remember the plan
we discussed on the beach?

137
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,720
We'll get everybody off the bus.

138
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,360
We'll get everyone off at
Yanjiang East Road stop.

139
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
It's our only chance.

140
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,440
But this woman is too alert.

141
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,080
If we verbally tell
them one at a time,

142
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,560
it will be a bit risky.

143
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,880
Are you typing it
down to show them?

144
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Yes.

145
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,080
We're running out of
time. Let's split up.

146
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,880
I'M A POLICE OFFICER. KEEP CALM
AFTER READING THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE.

147
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,040
THERE'S A BOMB ON THE BUS.

148
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,400
But what about the driver?

149
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,960
Once everyone is off,
what about the driver?

150
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,480
As soon as you're all off,

151
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,080
the driver and I
will get off last.

152
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
No.

153
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,560
That would be too obvious.

154
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,560
She'll just set
it off right away.

155
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,680
But this is the best way we can
think of to minimize casualties.

156
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,800
But the problem is

157
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,839
should we give up on
all the passengers

158
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,079
just for the driver?

159
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,800
But…

160
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,079
We don't have time.

161
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,880
Are we doing it or
not? It's up to you.

162
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Sir.

163
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,720
We have an offline
event at the next stop.

164
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,240
Would you be interested?

165
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,000
I'M A POLICE OFFICER. KEEP CALM
AFTER READING THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE.

166
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,440
It won't take long.

167
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,800
You just have to stand there.

168
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,640
After the event, we'll give you
oil, noodles, and stuff like that.

169
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,040
Okay.

170
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,880
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

171
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,376
Hello, ma'am. We're college
students who are entrepreneurs.

172
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,840
-Sir, we have an offline event
-We have an event. Please look.

173
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,120
At the next stop.

174
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,440
- Take a look.
- There's a charity event. Take a look.

175
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
Look at this.

176
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,640
If you attend, you'll
get some small prizes.

177
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,360
It's a charity event.

178
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,680
It's at Yanjiang East Road
stop. It won't take long.

179
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,160
Okay, thank you.

180
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,480
Do you have some time?
It won't take long.

181
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,800
Hello, ma'am. We're college
students who are entrepreneurs.

182
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,120
We're holding an event at
Yanjiang East Road stop.

183
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,280
If you get off and attend,

184
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,440
we'll give you some prizes.

185
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,560
Are you willing to attend?

186
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,120
This is our photo.

187
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,360
You're on the same team, right?

188
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,120
Hey. You make short
videos, don't you?

189
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
I've been observing
you for a while.

190
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,520
Where did you hide the camera?

191
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,680
But your theme is quite strange.

192
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,336
How many times have you done
this? What platform are you on?

193
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,896
- It's our first time.
- Your first time?

194
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,320
Yes, we're…

195
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,520
I think we can collaborate.

196
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
- I make short videos too.
- Really?

197
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,600
We happen to have an
event at the next stop.

198
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,240
Do you want to come with us?

199
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,680
I can't. I'm busy.

200
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,280
- I have a fan meeting later.
- Hello.

201
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
We're college students
who are entrepreneurs.

202
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
We have an event at
Yanjiang East Road stop.

203
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,720
Please take a look.

204
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
THE WOMAN IN GRAY HAS A BOMB.

205
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,800
It won't take much of your time.

206
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,280
Will you be able to attend?

207
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,600
Sir, is this the
Yanjiang East Road stop?

208
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Don't block the way.

209
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,960
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

210
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,640
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

211
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,280
Hey, get off at the rear door.

212
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
<i>- Please mind the doors.</i>
- I know.

213
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,920
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

214
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,656
- We have an event. Come with me…
- Hey, what are you doing?

215
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,736
- What event? I'm getting on.
- No.

216
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,880
Why won't you let me get on?

217
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,000
What are you doing? Why
won't you let me on?

218
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Getting everyone off the
bus won't work at all.

219
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,800
This woman wants to die with us.

220
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,200
As long as she finds
anything suspicious,

221
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,640
she'll set it off.

222
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,520
But at least we
proved something.

223
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,361
They'll believe us if we write a
message and pretend to be the police.

224
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,240
But these passengers
are hard to control.

225
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,520
Especially Mr. One.

226
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,520
What's with his nonsense?

227
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,880
Then we'll avoid him.

228
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,600
The reason we want everyone to
get off is that she has a knife.

229
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,400
We can't handle her.

230
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Since we can convince everyone
that we're the police,

231
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,400
can't we ask everyone to help
and restrain her together?

232
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,680
What's wrong?

233
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm fine.

234
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,400
If two people can subdue her
when we get to Yanjiang East Road

235
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,400
and you grab the pot

236
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,840
and bring it off the bus…

237
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,520
I remember

238
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,920
when we confronted
her the first time,

239
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
that guy…

240
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,680
He helped us, didn't he?

241
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,160
That's right. The time
I grabbed the knife,

242
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,320
he was the only one who
wanted to subdue me.

243
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,000
Maybe he's the one
who can step up.

244
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,600
I'll go and ask him.

245
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Wait. Hold on.

246
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,120
This won't do.

247
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,080
I can't just take the pot
off the bus like that.

248
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,760
There are too many pedestrians
by Yanjiang East Road stop.

249
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,720
Even if I bring the
pot off the bus,

250
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,160
I can't evacuate
the people nearby

251
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,880
in such a short time.

252
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
If the ringtone
goes off, it will…

253
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,160
Wouldn't even more
people get hurt then?

254
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,240
How about this?

255
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,040
Let's wait until the
bus is on the bridge.

256
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,920
Then I'll snatch the pot

257
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
and throw it into the river.

258
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,920
That's probably the safest way.

259
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,440
You'll have to convince
the driver to stop

260
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,560
and grab the pot too.

261
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,240
What if you run out of time?

262
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,920
In that case, we'll
need another helper.

263
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
A helper?

264
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,800
We have one.

265
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,000
PASSENGERS, THE NEXT STOP
IS YANJIANG EAST ROAD

266
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,920
THE WOMAN IN GRAY HAS A BOMB. WE
NEED YOUR HELP TO RESTRAIN HER

267
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,280
Young man.

268
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
Does this count as
an act of bravery?

269
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,200
I'll help.

270
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,040
Okay.

271
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,720
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

272
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,920
<i>Please exit through the rear door.
Please tap your card when exiting.</i>

273
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,560
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

274
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,520
What's going on?

275
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,640
Are you okay?

276
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,880
Lu, Cat Apostle, Asthma Conqueror,
The One Chosen by the Light, Di.

277
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,320
- <i>The bus is moving. Please hold on tight.</i>
- What do you want?

278
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,320
<i>- Next stop, Yanjiang West Road</i>.
- I'm a police officer. I need your help.

279
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,520
THE WOMAN IN GRAY HAS A BOMB. WE
NEED YOUR HELP TO RESTRAIN HER

280
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,520
Who are you? What are you doing?

281
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,520
I'm a police officer.
I need your help.

282
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Do you have a police ID?

283
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,640
Do you have a cat in your bag?

284
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,456
You have asthma so you can't have cats,
but you're still raising five cats.

285
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,736
You rented a place in Anime
City behind your parents' back.

286
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
The passcode is 666666.

287
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,920
We know everything about you.

288
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,160
I am the police.

289
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,720
You're definitely
not an officer.

290
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,120
Cat Apostle,

291
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,640
Asthma Conqueror, The
One Chosen by the Light.

292
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,800
The name is right. Why
don't you believe me?

293
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
But I don't care anymore.

294
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,240
You said my name

295
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,720
and know all of my
deep, dark secrets.

296
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I'll cooperate.

297
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,520
Tell me.

298
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,840
What should we do?

299
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,600
Sir.

300
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,640
I have something to tell you.

301
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,600
There's a crazy
woman on this bus.

302
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,680
- Don't look at me. Watch the road.
- What happened?

303
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,760
I know you're shocked,

304
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,480
but it's true.

305
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,600
It's the woman by the rear door.

306
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,440
She has a bomb on her. It's in
the plastic bag at her feet.

307
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
Don't look back.
She's very dangerous.

308
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,120
She's very alert.
We'll get caught.

309
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,280
What do you want to do?

310
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,240
Don't be afraid.

311
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,600
The police will restrain
this lunatic soon.

312
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,440
When we get on the bridge,

313
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,200
they'll make their move.

314
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,160
Once you pull over
on the bridge,

315
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
they'll throw the
bomb off the bridge.

316
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
How do you know this?

317
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,560
The police have already
notified the other passengers.

318
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,920
They told me to
inform you discreetly.

319
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,440
I'm telling the truth.

320
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,040
This bomb is very powerful.

321
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
We have to throw
it in the river.

322
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,200
So please stop the
bus and open the door.

323
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,560
It's our only chance now.

324
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
We'll be on the bridge soon.

325
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,200
Please don't panic.

326
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,720
When the time comes,
just do as I say.

327
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,920
Do you understand?

328
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,480
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, 1,500 M

329
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,040
Let go of me! What
are you doing?

330
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
Let go of me!

331
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,880
- Let go of me!
- Stop fighting.

332
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,520
- What are you doing?
- Stop fighting.

333
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,440
What's happening?

334
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,600
Stop it!

335
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,960
Let go! What are you doing?

336
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880
What is going on?

337
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,080
Let go!

338
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,880
Don't panic.

339
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,200
They are police officers.

340
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,200
This woman has a knife.

341
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,600
She is homicidal.

342
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,360
- Sit down first.
- What is going on?

343
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,600
Let go of me!

344
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,520
You jerks!

345
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,680
You're all devils! Murderers!

346
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,360
Let go of me!

347
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Let…

348
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,600
Sir, it's about time.

349
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,360
Just pull over up
ahead and drop us off.

350
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,520
- Xingde!
- Just pull over, sir.

351
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,520
Wang Xingde!

352
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,840
What have you done?

353
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,160
What are you doing?

354
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,040
You're the one who
called the police.

355
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,800
You coward!

356
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,320
You're a coward!

357
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,520
You're a scaredy-cat!

358
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,120
You're not a man.

359
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,280
I didn't call the police.

360
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
We don't have time.

361
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,080
- Sir.
- I didn't call the police.

362
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Sir!

363
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,040
- Let go!
- Stop the bus. There's no time, sir.

364
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,480
Stop the bus!

365
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,680
Stop the bus, sir!

366
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,880
Didn't you promise?

367
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,120
Stop the bus!

368
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Open the door.

369
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,040
Sir.

370
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,760
Sir, open the door!

371
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,040
Sir.

372
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
Sir, open the door!

373
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,600
Sir, open the door!

374
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,880
Open the door! Didn't
we agree on this?

375
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,840
Open the door!

376
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
Open the door, sir!

377
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,120
He won't open the door.

378
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,360
There's no time.

379
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
Help me!

380
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,080
- Quick, hold her down.
- Let go of me!

381
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
Give me that.

382
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Excuse me.

383
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,360
Excuse me. Please make way.

384
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,680
Sir, there's a thief on the bus.

385
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,440
My wallet was stolen.

386
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Are you sure you
lost it on the bus?

387
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,880
Yes.

388
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,880
I tapped my bus
pass when I got on.

389
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,280
Then I put it in my wallet.

390
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,000
It was right here,
but it's gone now.

391
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,720
My exam admission
ticket is in my wallet.

392
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,640
I'm going back to
take an exam now.

393
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,960
Sir, why aren't you
opening the door?

394
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

395
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,240
This young lady's wallet
was stolen on the bus.

396
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,760
Her exam admission
ticket is inside.

397
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,480
If someone took it,

398
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,320
throw it on the ground now.

399
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,280
Then we'll let it slide.

400
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
If no one confesses,

401
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,280
I'll call the police right now.

402
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,560
There's CCTV on the
bus. You can't run away.

403
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,200
I hope you'll
understand and help us.

404
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,160
Hurry and take it out.

405
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,536
There's an exam
admission ticket in it.

406
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,896
- It's going to affect the girl.
- Why did you take her wallet? It's hers.

407
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,056
- Exactly. Who took it?
- Yes.

408
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
Take it out now.

409
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,976
- Take it out so we can leave.
- How annoying.

410
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,280
Exactly. Whoever took her
wallet, take it out now.

411
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,160
There are so many
people waiting.

412
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,080
How about this?

413
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,600
Everyone, look out the window.

414
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
Look away for a bit.

415
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Give the person a chance.

416
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,960
- Okay, let's cooperate. Come on.
- Okay.

417
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,000
This is the wallet, right?

418
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,760
Make way.

419
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Make way.

420
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Look.

421
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,200
Is this it?

422
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,240
- Yes.
- Take a look.

423
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
It's in here.

424
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,239
Thank you, everyone.

425
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,159
Here's a reminder.

426
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,840
Don't steal on my bus again.

427
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
I won't tolerate it.

428
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,400
Sir, we found the wallet.
Please open the door.

429
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,800
I'm in a hurry.

430
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,040
Thank you.

431
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,655
Everything is still inside.

432
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,000
Will you be in
time for the exam?

433
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Yes.

434
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,080
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

435
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,160
<i>- Next stop, Jiaming Community Hospital.</i>
- Sit in the back.

436
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,600
I'll just stand here.

437
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
It's you.

438
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,480
If there's an empty seat,
don't stand. It's not safe.

439
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,720
Do you remember me?

440
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Sir.

441
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,680
I want to thank you for helping
me find my wallet last time.

442
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,720
I have a small gift for you.

443
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,600
There's no need.

444
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,520
Hurry and take a seat.

445
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,160
I just…

446
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Thank you.

447
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
It's nothing.

448
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,680
I'm the one who
should thank you.

449
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm serious. Without the
exam admission ticket,

450
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,160
I would've been
doomed for this term.

451
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Miss.

452
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,400
Are you studying at
Jialin Normal University?

453
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,680
Yes.

454
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,520
My daughter goes there too.

455
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,640
Your daughter goes there too?

456
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,000
Which graduation
class is she in?

457
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
What major?

458
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,160
She's working now.

459
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,720
What a coincidence.

460
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,840
Go back to your seat.

461
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,680
Do you want to get off?

462
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,800
I never thought it would be you.

463
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
Why?

464
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,480
Why in the world
are you doing this?

465
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,720
I'm asking you. Why?

466
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,440
What are you asking?
Stop talking to him.

467
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Shut up.

468
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,760
Which one is the real you?

469
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,760
You aren't this kind of person.

470
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,120
Are you in some kind of trouble?

471
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,680
Were you coerced?

472
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,240
That woman made you
do it, didn't she?

473
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,480
Why are you committing
evil with her?

474
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,240
- I just want to know.
- Who are you?

475
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Wang Xingde.

476
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,000
Who is she?

477
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,520
What is she saying to you?

478
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,440
What have you done?

479
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,520
What have you done?

480
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,560
Wang Xingde.

481
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,400
Answer me!

482
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,840
- What is happening?
- Sir.

483
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,440
I trusted you.

484
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,040
I even tried to save you.

485
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,360
But now you're trying
to kill us all.

486
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,560
Why? Say something.

487
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,040
Who are you?

488
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,120
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

489
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,840
<i>We've arrived at
Gangwu New Village.</i>

490
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,120
<i>Please exit through the rear door.
Please tap your card when exiting.</i>

491
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,920
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

492
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,240
Sir, can I get some change?

493
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,720
Sir. Change, please.

494
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
Thank you.

495
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,640
Sir, those who aren't here
can wait for the next one.

496
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,280
Can we go now?

497
