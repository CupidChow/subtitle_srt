JIALIN PUBLIC
TRANSPORT GROUP LTD.

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
WANG XINGDE

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Yes.

5
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
Please sign here.

6
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,360
Leave your thumbprint.

7
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
Everything is done now.

8
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
It's obvious what happened.

9
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,120
We have to do what
needs to be done, right?

10
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,000
All right. All the necessary
procedures are done.

11
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,840
There won't be
any more disputes.

12
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,160
- Yes.
- That's good for both sides.

13
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Yes.

14
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,720
Mr. Wang, do you have
any other requests?

15
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,040
You can tell me directly.

16
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,320
We can discuss it.

17
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Isn't that right?

18
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,160
12TH GRADE, CLASS 8

19
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,560
Who did it?

20
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,240
Who? What happened?

21
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,120
- What happened?
- I don't know either.

22
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Take it out.

23
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,160
Take it out.

24
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Ms. Tao.

25
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,760
I posted an on-screen comment
to retort against them.

26
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,760
Where is it?

27
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,840
I really posted it.

28
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,600
There are too many comments.

29
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
It's covered up.

30
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,480
SHE MUST'VE LEFT
HER BRAIN AT HOME

31
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,440
ENOUGH ABOUT THIS

32
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,640
NOW THAT SHE'S DEAD, SHE HAS
A CHANCE TO FIX HER BRAIN

33
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,280
I wanted to buy fish,
but they weren't fresh.

34
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,480
Let's make do with what we have.

35
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,080
The school called.

36
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,680
The head of the school and the
teachers are concerned about you.

37
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,280
They told you to take a break.

38
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
Turn off the ringtone.

39
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,360
Stay still.

40
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Can you sit down?

41
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,840
Can we talk?

42
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,480
You haven't answered me yet.

43
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,200
On the day of our
daughter's accident,

44
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,040
she called you twice.

45
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
You didn't pick up.

46
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
Why?

47
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,800
Why didn't you answer?

48
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,760
Let me ask you.

49
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,520
Did your daughter
call you often?

50
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
No.

51
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Because she knows you're
always on the road,

52
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,840
so it might be dangerous.

53
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
Did she call me often?

54
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
No.

55
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Because I'm a good teacher.

56
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,520
I never bring my phone to class.

57
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,400
But that day,

58
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,680
at 1:42 p.m.

59
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,800
and 1:44 p.m.,

60
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,040
right before she
got off the bus,

61
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,760
she called you twice.

62
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,880
But you didn't pick up.

63
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,840
I want to know why.

64
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,720
Look at me.

65
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,560
Answer me.

66
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,000
Why didn't you answer either of
your daughter's calls for help?

67
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,480
It was a call for help!

68
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,840
Look at me.

69
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,760
Look at me!

70
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,400
What a great dad.

71
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Your daughter
asked you for help,

72
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,280
but you just ignored her.

73
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,920
You didn't care about her life.

74
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,520
You're an accomplice.

75
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,480
1:44 p.m.

76
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,400
I have a really bad memory now.

77
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm afraid I'll forget.

78
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,960
I'm afraid you'll forget too.

79
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Do you know

80
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
why she called you?

81
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,480
Do you know why she called you?

82
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,560
She must have run into trouble

83
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,040
on the bus.

84
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,760
It must have been something
she couldn't solve.

85
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,080
She got scared.

86
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,320
But you didn't answer.

87
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,080
You could have saved her.

88
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,680
You could have saved
your own daughter,

89
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,280
but you didn't
answer your phone.

90
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,360
We're both murderers!

91
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,880
Tell me what in
the world happened.

92
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,200
Tell me what in
the world happened.

93
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,800
They all know,

94
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,800
- but they don't want to tell me.
- Yinghong.

95
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,840
They are all hiding it from me.

96
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,960
Yinghong.

97
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,760
Let's go to Jialin.

98
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,600
Okay.

99
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
I'll pack my things now.

100
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,600
How many times have I told you?

101
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,080
You can't park in the fire lane.

102
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,240
Yes, Mr. Yang.

103
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Are you a job applicant?

104
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Here. Have a seat.

105
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,680
Come.

106
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,680
Let me have a look.

107
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Sir.

108
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Have we met before?

109
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
Or did you come to our public
transport company before?

110
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I don't think so.

111
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Have some water.

112
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm sure I've seen
you somewhere.

113
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,160
Mr. Yang, I'll get back to work.

114
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,120
Don't forget what I told you.

115
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,320
Mr. Wang.

116
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
I've had a look at your résumé.

117
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,840
Did you work in the transport unit
for a state enterprise in Jiaodao?

118
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,920
Let me ask you one more thing.

119
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,840
You're already at this age.

120
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,840
Why do you want
to work in Jialin?

121
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I moved here with my
wife due to her transfer.

122
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,720
I see.

123
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,880
But Mr. Wang,

124
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,560
your pay here in Jialin

125
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,600
won't be as good as
your old company.

126
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
You need to consider
that carefully.

127
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,120
How about this?

128
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,040
There is a new tourist
route to Binhai in Jialin.

129
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,160
Are you interested?

130
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
I want to have Route 45.

131
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,360
Route 45?

132
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,440
It seems you know
Jialin quite well.

133
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,400
I heard it's not an easy route.

134
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
That's true.

135
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,880
It's indeed not easy.

136
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,680
We usually put experienced
drivers on that route.

137
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
It's a longer route

138
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,000
and a lot of trouble happens.

139
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,080
What?

140
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,800
Are you sure you want
to do Route No. 45?

141
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,600
I've been a driver
for so many years.

142
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,960
I've never had an accident
or any violations.

143
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
How could they not recognize me?

144
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,960
Mengmeng has only been
gone for 174 days.

145
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,600
How could they
forget everything?

146
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,960
Those people…

147
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,560
are all garbage.

148
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Eat up.

149
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,920
There's still a
lot of work to do.

150
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,560
Are you okay?

151
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,680
You came back after all.

152
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,720
Look at this. Do you
still want to continue?

153
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,160
Are you really okay?

154
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm fine.

155
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,200
Do you know how
the fire started?

156
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,720
I succeeded.

157
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
I dreamed of Mengmeng.

158
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
She told us…

159
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,840
to live a good life.

160
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,240
- Tomorrow is Tomb-Sweeping Day.
- You can live a good life.

161
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,839
Let's go see her.

162
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
You can live on.

163
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,280
You're a good driver.

164
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,520
You find joy in helping others.

165
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,680
You're a good Samaritan.
People trust you.

166
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
You can start over and choose
the way you want to live.

167
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,520
I'm fine with that.

168
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,440
We can get divorced anytime.

169
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,920
I can set you free
whenever you want.

170
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
Let's go and see Mengmeng, okay?

171
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,000
It has been five years.
Why can't you let it go?

172
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,400
Have you let go?

173
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,000
Can you let it go?

174
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,120
You have two choices.

175
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,600
Either we stay together

176
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,240
or you hurry and leave Jialin.

177
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,080
Choose.

178
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,240
Go.

179
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,280
Hurry back to your dormitory.

180
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,560
I'll be fine.

181
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,920
Go.

182
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,120
Go.

183
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Go.

184
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,560
Goodbye, Mr. Nice Guy of Jialin.

185
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Go.

186
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
Ms. Du.

187
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,880
We're almost done gathering
evidence from Gangwu New Village.

188
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,640
We even found online
transaction records of chemicals

189
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,520
in Tao Yinghong's computer.

190
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,760
We've sent the order to the
tech team for verification.

191
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,640
They lurked for four years

192
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,600
to make a bomb

193
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,520
just for this fiasco today.

194
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Ms. Du.

195
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,336
We've checked the
records from Jiaodao.

196
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,536
Wang Xingde, his wife, and
the two youngsters on the bus

197
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,000
never crossed paths before.

198
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,560
Do you think there
will be another loop?

199
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
I don't know.

200
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,680
But I keep having this feeling
that it's not over yet.

201
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,760
It's not supposed
to end like this.

202
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,680
The only thing we can do now

203
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,160
is to try and find
out the truth.

204
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,040
That way, no matter
what happens after,

205
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,440
if we at least know the truth,

206
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,920
we'll have the key to solving
this, giving us the upper hand.

207
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,600
But we can't leave now.
How can we investigate?

208
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,040
I was thinking

209
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
that we could ask my
guidance counselor.

210
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,656
Actually, when I found out Wang
Mengmeng went to my university,

211
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I wanted to find her.

212
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,880
But I never had the chance.

213
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,120
Her accident caused such
a big commotion back then.

214
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,720
The university teachers
should know something, right?

215
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Let's ask her.

216
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,520
Li Shiqing.

217
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Ms. Wu.

218
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,840
You brat.

219
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,320
This was a serious accident.
Why didn't you call me sooner?

220
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,600
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

221
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,560
Did you call your family?

222
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,800
I haven't had the time.

223
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,920
I'm really okay.

224
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,160
You were just riding on a bus.

225
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,600
How did you run
into such a thing?

226
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Well…

227
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Hello.

228
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,360
He's my boyfriend.

229
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,960
We were together when the
incident happened on the bus.

230
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,560
Have a seat. Don't
just stand there.

231
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,840
Are you really okay?

232
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,240
Did you confirm with the doctor?

233
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,360
I'm fine. I'm safe
and sound, aren't I?

234
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,160
Why don't you do a full checkup?

235
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
I'm really fine. Don't worry.

236
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
I'm relieved then.

237
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,560
You scared me.

238
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,560
I almost passed out when
I answered your call.

239
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,920
Why is it the
Route 45 bus again?

240
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
"Again"?

241
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,600
Did something else
happen on Route 45?

242
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,920
When I first started working
as a counselor five years ago,

243
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,520
the Route 45 bus

244
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,120
also had an accident.

245
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,320
The victim of the accident was
also a student I looked after.

246
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,560
You looked after her?

247
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Right when she got off the bus,

248
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,560
she was hit by a truck.

249
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
She died on the spot.

250
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,000
I had nightmares for
a month back then.

251
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,000
I kept dreaming
about that afternoon

252
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,480
when the police called
me to identify her body.

253
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
Thank goodness.

254
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,840
Nothing happened
to you this time.

255
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Ms. Wu.

256
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,880
Was the student
you just mentioned…

257
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
named Wang Mengmeng?

258
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,800
Record the statements
of the other passengers.

259
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,840
I'll take care of
those two youngsters.

260
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,720
- No. In your condition...
- Don't worry.

261
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,320
I won't cross the line.

262
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
I know what to do.

263
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,400
What did you say?

264
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,680
That's right.

265
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,920
The driver of the bus today
is Wang Mengmeng's dad.

266
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,160
How is that possible?

267
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,280
Mengmeng got into an
accident on a Route 45 bus.

268
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,440
Why did her dad…

269
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,000
It has already been five years.

270
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
How did you know Mengmeng?

271
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,056
She takes the Route
45 bus all the time,

272
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,280
so she knows the driver.

273
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,240
He told her himself.

274
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,200
Yes.

275
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,080
Moreover, when we
were on the bus,

276
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,360
Wang Mengmeng's parents
were very agitated.

277
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,000
It sounded like they've been
wanting to investigate something.

278
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,760
If the police hadn't
gotten there in time,

279
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,360
I can't imagine
the consequences.

280
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,280
So Ms. Wu,

281
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
can you tell us

282
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,160
exactly what happened back then?

283
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,080
Why did those two want to drag
the whole bus to death with them?

284
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,760
I actually don't
know the details.

285
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
But I know

286
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,280
that Mengmeng's parents never
asked the university for anything.

287
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,600
The police closed the case
soon after the accident.

288
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
They signed a settlement
agreement too.

289
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,600
After that,

290
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,880
I stopped following
their situation.

291
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
What about the
situation on the bus?

292
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,240
Were there any other students?

293
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,720
Did they see anything?

294
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,960
Or…

295
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,360
There must've been a lot of
chatter about it at university.

296
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,920
That's enough.

297
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,280
Stay out of it.

298
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,720
I think this is something I
should be telling the police.

299
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,800
STAY TRUE TO YOUR
ORIGINAL ASPIRATIONS

300
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,520
REMEMBER YOUR MISSION

301
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Ms. Du.

302
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,960
Ms. Du.

303
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,416
We've reported the results of the
interrogations to Director Xia.

304
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,576
Xiaoyuan is currently visiting
the witnesses on the bus

305
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
for their statements.

306
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,880
What about the two youngsters
who called the police?

307
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,656
Jiang Feng has been watching
them at the hospital.

308
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,760
I'll call him.

309
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,816
There must be a
problem with those two.

310
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,880
Come back.

311
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,920
I know.

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,280
After losing Mr. Zhang,

313
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,200
we're all holding in
a lot of emotions.

314
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,200
But we have to stay calm
at a time like this.

315
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,360
Don't jump to conclusions.

316
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Got it?

317
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,920
I got it.

318
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I got it.

319
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Go.

320
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
After the accident
happened that year,

321
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,760
there were a lot of posts
about Wang Mengmeng's incident

322
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,240
on the university forum.

323
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,320
But later on, the
administrator locked them all.

324
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,681
The university wouldn't allow
any more discussion on this.

325
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,760
Ms. Wu, so…

326
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,440
What kind of girl
was Wang Mengmeng?

327
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,440
Mengmeng was a very good kid.

328
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
She was a bit of an introvert.

329
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,120
She didn't like
interacting with others,

330
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,680
so she didn't have many friends.

331
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,320
But she definitely wasn't the
type to unreasonably cause trouble

332
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,480
and demand to get off in
the middle of the road.

333
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
That's what Wang
Xingde said too.

334
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Ms. Wu.

335
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,960
Can we still see those posts
on the university forum?

336
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,960
The posts have been locked.

337
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,760
I don't have the
authority either.

338
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,376
You might have to find the administrator
of the university network center.

339
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,440
Ms. Wu, I hope you can cooperate
with our investigation.

340
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,640
I think I need to ask
my boss for permission.

341
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,040
We can't wait for the approval.

342
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,320
I'll take responsibility for
whatever happens. Let's go.

343
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,880
Let's go to the university now.

344
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,520
I'm coming too.

345
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Mr. Jiang.

346
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
I know you still
have doubts about us.

347
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,960
But can you trust
us just this once?

348
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,880
Just…

349
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,240
Just trust us once,
like Mr. Zhang did.

350
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,920
There are officers
on duty outside.

351
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,040
Contact us if anything happens.

352
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,520
INPATIENT DEPARTMENT

353
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,056
HOW COULD THERE BE SUCH AN
IDIOT AT OUR UNIVERSITY?

354
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,616
THE BUS WILL PROBABLY
BE HAUNTED BY HER SPIRIT

355
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,040
WAS SHE HALLUCINATING
DUE TO DRUGS?

356
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,840
Why are they all poking
fun at her death?

357
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,360
Wang Mengmeng was the victim.

358
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,200
Why did they curse
her like that?

359
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,800
It's anonymous after all.

360
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,960
They feel they don't have to take
responsibility for their words.

361
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,040
Let me take a look
at the third comment.

362
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Okay.

363
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,920
Yes, this one.

364
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Put it in speaker mode.

365
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,640
XIAO HEYUN

366
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,600
<i>Shiqing, take a look
at the 45th comment.</i>

367
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
Go to the 45th comment.

368
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,760
SHE WASN'T A PSYCHO! SHE
ENCOUNTERED A PERVERT ON THE BUS!

369
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,720
Yes.

370
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,320
"She wasn't a psycho.

371
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,960
She encountered a
pervert on the bus."

372
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,800
This person sounds so certain.

373
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
It's probably not a guess.

374
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,880
This was posted three days
after Wang Mengmeng's accident.

375
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,600
The thread was locked that day,

376
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,560
so not many people
would've seen it.

377
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,320
Let me see the
comments after that.

378
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,656
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE YOU SAW IT
YOURSELF. ARE YOU DELUSIONAL?

379
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,056
IS IT TRUE JUST
BECAUSE YOU SAY SO?

380
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,576
I'LL BELIEVE YOU IF
YOU SHOW US EVIDENCE

381
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,856
YOU'RE SO GOOD AT
WRITING STORIES

382
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,016
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYONE
FROM OUR SCHOOL IN THE VIDEO

383
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,136
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE CALLED THE
POLICE IF THERE WAS A PERVERT?

384
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,440
DEVILS DON'T HAVE A CONSCIENCE

385
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,776
THAT'S LIKE KILLING
HER INDIRECTLY

386
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,560
THOSE WHO TURN A BLIND
EYE DESERVE TO DIE TOO

387
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,720
Seeing all these comments,

388
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,640
even if this person knows something,
they wouldn't dare to come forward.

389
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,400
Hold on.

390
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,000
This person's IP address

391
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,960
is the same as a
lot of the users.

392
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,960
I think it was posted
from the dormitories too.

393
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,680
Can we find out which
building it was?

394
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,000
Can you look into it for us?

395
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,200
Okay, hold on.

396
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
I got it.

397
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,640
It's Building 3, Room 324.

398
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,760
Ms. Wu.

399
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,800
Can you help us check all the
users at this IP address back then?

400
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,120
It was such a long time ago.

401
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,280
The school keeps updating
the student records.

402
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,960
In such a short time,

403
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
I can only try my best
to find them for you.

404
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,160
We can help you find them.

405
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
Ms. Wu.

406
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
This is urgent.

407
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
This case has created
a huge social impact.

408
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,280
We lost an officer
because of this.

409
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,840
I have to find out
the entire story.

410
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,576
Wang Mengmeng's motive
for getting off the bus

411
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,200
is what caused this tragedy.

412
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,680
Ms. Wu.

413
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,160
I hope you can
understand our job.

414
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,080
Li Shiqing, I'll send a car

415
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,520
to take you to the station to
assist with the investigation.

416
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll take care of
the rest by myself.

417
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,600
Mr. Jiang.

418
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,960
You're a police officer.

419
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,720
If the insider feels pressured

420
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,560
when you talk to them,

421
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,840
they may choose to remain
silent or run away again.

422
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,040
But I'm a student.

423
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,000
If I talk to them,

424
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,480
they won't feel any pressure.

425
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,920
So…

426
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,400
You need someone like me
to interview them for you.

427
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,120
Hello, Jiang Feng.

428
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,520
What's going on?

429
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,400
The people at the
hospital said you left.

430
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,656
<i>Aren't you bringing the two who
called the police back here?</i>

431
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
<i>Where are you now?</i>

432
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,360
I have a new lead

433
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,640
that I need to look into.

434
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,720
What new lead?

435
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,160
I'll report to
Ms. Du right away.

436
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,720
It's about a witness on
the Route 45 bus back then.

437
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,560
Why didn't you report
such an important thing?

438
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,440
Where are you? We'll
send backups right away.

439
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,400
I don't need help yet.

440
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,440
I'll return to the station
as soon as I find them.

441
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,000
JIALIN NORMAL UNIVERSITY
CAMPUS TELEVISION STATION

442
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,440
Building 3, Room 324
is a girls' dormitory.

443
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,280
All the information
from that year is here.

444
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,280
Let's split this up.

445
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,800
- Okay.
- Here.

446
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,040
324…

447
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,720
Here it is.

448
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,880
324.

449
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,176
GONG RUOXI, LIU YAO, JIANG JIANG,
ZOU YANRAN, LIU TINGHONG, JIA YINYIN

450
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,600
Liu Yao.

451
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,160
Liu Yao, something
terrible happened.

452
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,480
What's wrong? Slow
down. Don't fall.

453
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,440
Look.

454
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,720
A Route 45 bus exploded.

455
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,840
Let me tell you.

456
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,000
I used to take this
bus all the time.

457
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,280
I'm kind of scared now
that I think about it.

458
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Liu Yao.

459
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,160
Liu Yao, what's wrong?

460
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,880
I'm fine.

461
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,880
It's time for you
to go. Hurry home.

462
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Okay.

463
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,800
Don't stay too late.

464
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,560
- I'll go after I crunch these numbers.
- Okay, I'll get going then.

465
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,280
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

466
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,216
BOMB ON BUS EXPLODES, AN OFFICER
KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY

467
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,496
THE POLICE RECEIVED A REPORT,
SAYING A BOMB WAS ON THE BUS

468
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,080
JIALIN POLICE IMMEDIATELY SET
UP A ROADBLOCK TO STOP THE BUS

469
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
THANK YOU, HERO

470
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,680
SLOW PHOTO STUDIO

471
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,640
Sorry, we're closed.

472
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Liu Yao.

473
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,800
Ms. Wu.

474
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,840
Can we talk?

475
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,360
On May 16th, 5 years ago,

476
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,760
you left a comment on
our university forum.

477
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,520
It was around 3 a.m.

478
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Take a look.

479
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,800
Do you remember?

480
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,199
We want to know

481
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,239
why you wrote this reply.

482
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,600
Do you know something?

483
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't know what
you're talking about.

484
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
I didn't post this.

485
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,600
The port of our school forum
connects to every dorm.

486
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,120
I asked your roommate.

487
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,960
That night, you were the only
one still surfing the Internet.

488
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,600
You asked my roommate?

489
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,600
What do you want?

490
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,639
Liu Yao, don't be nervous.

491
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,520
We really just want to know

492
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,320
what made you write this?

493
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,000
Did you see or hear something?

494
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,840
No. I don't know.

495
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
I just made it up.

496
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,280
Ms. Liu.

497
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,000
Please cooperate.

498
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,800
This is related to a bus
explosion that happened today.

499
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
Who are you?

500
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,000
- You called the police?
- Please cooperate with our investigation.

501
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,560
I'll say it again.

502
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,200
This is related to a bus
explosion that happened today.

503
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,560
Explosion?

504
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,320
What do you mean?

505
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,200
What do I have to do
with the explosion today?

506
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Liu Yao.

507
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,320
I was on that bus today.

508
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,280
The culprits behind the explosion
are Wang Mengmeng's parents.

509
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,360
They're taking revenge on society
for Wang Mengmeng's death.

510
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,960
Someone died in the explosion.

511
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,280
Do you know how serious this is?

512
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,400
Please don't hide
the truth anymore.

513
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,560
Liu Yao.

514
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,520
As for what happened back then,

515
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,240
if you know anything else,

516
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,280
please be honest.

517
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,800
I promise you.

518
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,760
No one will blame you.

519
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,760
It's easy for you to say.

520
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
Does your promise mean anything?

521
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,240
Why should I believe you?

522
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,760
I'm your teacher.

523
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,560
Of course I have to protect you.

524
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,440
Yes, at school,

525
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,080
you can indeed protect me.

526
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,040
But what about
outside the school?

527
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
If such promises actually help,

528
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,800
then why did Wang Mengmeng
still get criticized back then?

529
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,600
If I remember correctly,

530
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,560
her mom is a teacher, right?

531
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,400
You also saw

532
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,680
what all those people
said in those posts.

533
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,320
None of them care whether
you'll be retaliated against.

534
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,080
They only hold you to
the standards of a saint.

535
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,240
So if my information is leaked,

536
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,640
I'll be the one to get blamed.

537
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,360
None of you can help me.

538
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,280
Liu Yao.

539
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,080
I'm a police officer
from the municipal CID.

540
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,560
My name is Jiang Feng.

541
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,680
I promise you

542
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,080
that the police will never reveal
your information to anyone.

543
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,400
Don't be nervous.

544
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,320
We're not here to criticize you.

545
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,360
Liu Yao.

546
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,000
Deep inside,

547
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,680
you want to tell the
truth, don't you?

548
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,800
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
written that reply, right?

549
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,320
All these years,

550
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,880
I'm sure it must've been
hard for you as well.

551
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,600
So tell us.

552
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,880
Let's resolve this together.

553
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,920
Back then,

554
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
why did you write that comment?

555
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Five years ago,

556
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,760
when Wang Mengmeng died,

557
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,160
were you on the bus too?

558
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,680
If I tell you,

559
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,400
can you promise me

560
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
that I'll definitely be safe?

561
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
I swear on my profession.

562
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,040
I was so scared.

563
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,320
I didn't hide
anything on purpose.

564
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,360
I was actually going
to call the police.

565
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
But…

566
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,000
I was afraid he
would get back at me.

567
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Who is he?

568
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,560
It was a middle-aged
man with glasses.

569
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,720
He indecently assaulted
Wang Mengmeng.

570
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,440
So you saw it?

571
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,080
Not only did I see it, I…

572
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,880
I even took a picture.

573
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,840
You have a picture?

574
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,520
I took it by accident.

575
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,480
- He even discovered me.
- Do you still have that photo?

576
