1
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,640
POLICE

2
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,960
The police could find us at any moment.

3
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,480
Let's sort this out ourselves first.

4
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
OVERHEAD WALKWAY, INTERSECTION

5
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,200
BRIDGE APPROACH RAMP

6
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,800
A total of ten loops have occurred.

7
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,680
This is your tenth time.

8
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,960
My fifth time.

9
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,960
We woke up at 1:36 p.m.

10
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,680
At the time of the explosion,

11
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,280
I saw it was 1:42 p.m. on my watch.

12
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
The explosion was at the intersection.

13
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,920
The cause of the explosion
was a car accident.

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
A tank truck exploded.

15
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,120
The ninth time, we woke up at 1:37 p.m.

16
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,120
The time of the explosion…

17
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,320
We're not sure.

18
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
The location was
the river-crossing bridge.

19
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,840
The blast was caused
by a man-made explosive.

20
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,600
The eighth time…

21
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,880
The eighth time, I tried
to break the window with the hammer

22
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,920
and was taken out.

23
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
The time when I woke up?

24
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
I can't remember.

25
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,560
I also don't know
the time of the explosion.

26
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,800
The location was still the intersection.

27
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,360
The cause of the explosion
was still a car accident.

28
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,240
The seventh time I woke up,
it was 1:39 p.m.

29
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
The time of the explosion…

30
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,040
Again, I didn't notice.

31
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720
The location was still the intersection.

32
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,240
The cause was still a car accident.

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,280
The sixth time I woke up…

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,840
The sixth explosion was at 1:42 p.m.

35
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,840
1:42 p.m.

36
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,520
EXPLOSION

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,640
In that case,

38
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,160
the sixth and tenth explosions
happened at the same time.

39
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,160
That's likely when the accident happened

40
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,360
at the intersection.

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And look at this pattern.

42
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,760
Every time, we wake up one minute earlier.

43
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,360
In that case,
the eighth time was probably…

44
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,720
1:38 p.m.

45
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
The sixth time was 1:40 p.m.

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,880
If the time corresponds to the route…

47
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,240
Every time I wake up,

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
the view I see outside

49
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,400
is different.

50
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,240
And the fifth time.

51
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,280
The fifth time was the first time
I encountered a car accident.

52
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
It was also at the intersection.

53
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,520
That time, I pretended to be sick.

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
So the driver slowed down

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,040
and encountered a red light.

56
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
The intersection.

57
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,120
The explosion also happened at 1:42 p.m.

58
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,480
If that's the case,

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,280
you should have woken up at 1:41 p.m.

60
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,480
Now that you mention it,

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,080
we do keep waking up earlier.

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,760
But what does an earlier time mean?

63
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,160
Jiang Feng.

64
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Go through the east gate.

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,400
Observe and keep in touch at all times.

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,920
The first time,

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,400
when I left school,

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,400
I boarded the bus
at the University Town stop.

69
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,960
University Town.

70
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,640
I got on at Gaoxin District.

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
It's the stop before yours.

72
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
When did you wake up?

73
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,720
It's fine. The time of the explosion…

74
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,760
What about the location of the explosion?

75
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Probably on the bridge.

76
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
On the bridge.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,920
Actually, I'm not sure because…

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,400
It happened so fast.

79
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,160
I was half asleep.

80
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,840
I only remember the ringtone.

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,760
It's just that…

82
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,480
I had just opened my eyes.

83
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
Before I had a chance to respond, it…

84
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,840
Why did you throw it away?

85
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
You can't be hiding anything from me now.

86
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
What you said…

87
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
I'm not hiding anything.

88
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,040
I'm telling the truth.

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,000
I woke up because I heard that ringtone.

90
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,680
I opened my eyes and before I knew it,

91
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,960
it exploded.

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
I've told you everything I know.

93
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,160
Have you never trusted me?

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,640
I don't want to be so passive.

95
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,920
Do not let your guard down.

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
This is a complex field.

97
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,520
Keep your eyes peeled.

98
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,320
So what should we do?

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,120
Shouldn't we think about

100
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,400
why I'm in a time loop

101
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,720
and why you're in it too?

102
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
The information we have right now

103
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,840
doesn't answer that.

104
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,880
But we have to find a way
out of the loop, right?

105
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,600
The first time we got off together,

106
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,240
I lived while you died.

107
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,000
We didn't break free.

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
We're both alive this time.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,560
Do you think…

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm a game designer.

111
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,840
Based on conventional game rules,

112
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,240
the player has to stop the explosion

113
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,920
and save everyone on the bus.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
That's the only way to clear the game

115
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,920
and break out of the loop.

116
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,920
So you make games.

117
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
No wonder.

118
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,080
By the way, I still don't know your name.

119
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,679
Xiao Heyun.

120
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,880
"Heyun" means "crane and clouds."

121
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,400
-My name--
-Li Shiqing.

122
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,679
You mentioned it to the police.

123
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,720
Actually, during my sixth loop,

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,960
the police questioned me.

125
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
They are so sharp.

126
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,760
That's why I've been worried.

127
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
If we end up in the police station,

128
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,560
will they let us go that easily?

129
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,880
It's because they are so sharp

130
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,520
that we have to tell the truth.

131
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,680
Don't complicate things.

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Is there no explanation

133
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
that could explain the call

134
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
and be able to convince them?

135
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,320
Think about it.

136
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,240
If we break the cycle this time,

137
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,840
the police will find out
the truth about this bomb.

138
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
We didn't plant it anyway.

139
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,960
We will be found innocent.

140
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Come with me.

141
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Wait.

142
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,160
Why do you want to lie to the police
in the first place?

143
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,720
I'm not trying to lie to the police.

144
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,040
During my sixth loop…

145
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,160
Li Shiqing and Xiao Heyun, right?

146
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm Jiang Feng from CID.

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,560
Around 1:38 p.m. today,

148
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,840
did you call the police saying

149
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,680
that there was a bomb on the Route 45 bus?

150
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes.

151
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,920
We've been trying to reach you
ever since the call.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But your phones have been off, right?

153
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
We need to clarify some things with you.

154
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,160
Can you come to the station with us?

155
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Let's go.

156
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
Come on, this way.

157
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,520
Can't we take the same car?

158
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Separate cars.

159
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,760
Get in.

160
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,560
Yu Lei.

161
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
I've sent you the best route.

162
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,880
Return to the station.

163
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,880
Okay.

164
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,480

167
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
Do you know this road well?

168
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,680
Not really.

169
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,600
I live and work in Gaoxin District.

170
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,960
I rarely go downtown.

171
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,400
It's a weekday.

172
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,080
Don't you have to go to work?

173
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,160
I was supposed to go
to Digital Plaza for a meeting.

174
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,560
What time?

175
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
2:30 p.m.

176
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,960
It's already past 3 p.m.

177
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm already late anyway.

178
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,920
Yes, it's okay.

179
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
Your phone has been turned off.

180
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,320
People probably can't reach you.

181
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,680
Right.

182
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
Do you want to make a call?

183
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,920
Explain it to them.

184
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,480
No, it's okay.

185
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,320
Really?

186
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,520
It's okay.

187
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,320
When we get back to the station,

188
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
it will take some time
to understand the situation.

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
You'd better take care of this.

190
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Okay.

191
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,760
LIU PENG

192
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,400
Answer it.

193
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Put it in speaker mode.

194
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,360
<i>What the fuck does this mean?</i>

195
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,080
<i>You have been unreachable.</i>

196
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,280
<i>The investors have been waiting here
for almost an hour.</i>

197
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,280
<i>I've been apologizing like an idiot.</i>

198
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,680
<i>I just haven't gotten on my knees.</i>

199
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,280
<i>Do you still want to make your game?</i>

200
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm busy right now. I have to go.

201
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,720
This person is so rude.

202
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,760
Yes, that's why I turned my phone off.

203
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,600
That girl named Li Shiqing.

204
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
Was she going to the meeting?

205
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,400
No, we just met on that bus.

206
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,240
You just met?

207
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,440
Yes.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,440
SERVE THE PEOPLE, MAO ZEDONG

209
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,960
JIALIN POLICE

210
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
CAPABLE AND SINCERE,
RIGHTEOUS AND JUST

211
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,520
LOYAL AND DEDICATED,
PRAGMATIC AND INNOVATIVE

212
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,280
Hand over your belongings
and electronic devices.

213
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,440
Place your belongings here.

214
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,080
This way.

215
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,920
CASE INVESTIGATION AREA

216
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,960
Sit down.

217
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,920
Have a seat.

218
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,320
Ms. Du.

219
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,000
Ms. Du.

220
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
How are things at the scene?

221
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,960
The scene was completely destroyed.

222
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
We're still doing search and recovery.

223
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,840
There isn't much.

224
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,600
But for now,

225
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,840
the vehicle's CCTV footage
will be hard to retrieve.

226
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,480
So right now,
these two are our only leads.

227
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,880
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

228
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,240
Both of them have clean records.

229
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,280
I asked the patrol division
to look into it.

230
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
What was the situation
when you found these two?

231
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,520
When Li Shiqing
was answering my questions in the car,

232
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
something felt fishy.

233
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,200
Xiao Heyun was very nervous
the whole time.

234
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,800
He said he had just met her on the bus.

235
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
But looking at the CCTV footage

236
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,400
or their behavior
when we picked them up at the park

237
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,440
and along the way here,

238
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,440
they didn't just meet.

239
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,960
It's not just that.

240
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,440
They seem like a couple.

241
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,960
They even wanted to ride together.

242
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,400
Ms. Du, Mr. Zhang.

243
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,840
This balled-up paper

244
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,480
was found in the trash can.

245
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
Let me have a look.

246
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,160
At 1:38 p.m. today,

247
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,880
the police received a call from you

248
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
stating that there was a bomb
on the Route 45 bus.

249
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,760
Did you make this call
of your own free will?

250
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,640
Yes.

251
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,040
How did you know there was a bomb?

252
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,920
Did you notice any suspicious items?

253
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,600
Then…

254
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,200
Did you hear a suspicious conversation?

255
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,320
Or…

256
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,080
Did you smell something suspicious?

257
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Nothing.

258
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,480
But you knew there was a bomb on the bus.

259
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,960
Li Shiqing.

260
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Whether it's a yes or no,

261
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,880
you have to say it out loud.

262
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,280
Do you understand?

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,560
After finding out about the explosive,

264
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,800
you chose to immediately get off
and call the police.

265
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Why didn't you inform the driver
when the bus stopped

266
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,400
and evacuate the passengers with him?

267
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,720
Li Shiqing.

268
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,080
Do you recognize this map?

269
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,400
Why were your phones off
after calling the police?

270
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,600
Because we needed time.

271
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,360
That's not what you said in the car.

272
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,040
Because we needed time,

273
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,720
we didn't want to be disturbed.

274
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,520
Those aren't really contradictions.

275
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,680
Why did you need time?

276
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,760
We needed time to sort out the clues.

277
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,480
The whole thing is so complicated. I--

278
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
What thing?

279
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,920
How do I describe it?

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,920
It's just…

281
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,120
It's like a supernatural phenomenon.

282
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,320
Do you read novels?

283
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,560
It's like an infinite loop.

284
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,840
Tell me. Why did you draw this map?

285
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,240
What do these times and numbers mean?

286
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,560
At 1:42 p.m. today,

287
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,000
about three minutes
after you two got off the bus,

288
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,520
the Route 45 bus that you were on

289
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,800
collided with a tank truck
at an intersection.

290
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,760
No passengers survived.

291
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,000
Why is the time and location
of the accident

292
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,720
noted here?

293
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,640
Is it a coincidence?

294
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,960
What does this accident
have to do with you?

295
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,200
Mr. Jiang,

296
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,400
I swear I had nothing to do with it.

297
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,520
Let me state this first.

298
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,640
My mind is very clear right now.

299
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,640
And I know what I'm talking about.

300
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,440
But perhaps what I'm about to say

301
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,920
might not be something
a person of sound mind would say.

302
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,240
And I don't think there's any way
to verify the authenticity.

303
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,880
But please believe that
I'm telling you the truth.

304
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,800
It's real.

305
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,520
It's up to us to believe you or not.

306
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,960
What you need to do now is cooperate

307
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
and tell the truth.

308
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,200
-Do I need to repeat myself?
-No, it's okay.

309
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,040
I'll start then.

310
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
We are

311
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
in a time loop.

312
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,960
-What do you mean?
-We relive this day over and over again.

313
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,960
Li Shiqing has done it
about ten times so far.

314
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,880
Five times for me.

315
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,800
We've experienced the explosions before.

316
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,600
But we come back to life
after the explosion.

317
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,880
We're back on the bus.

318
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,440
We thought the cause of the explosion

319
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
was a car accident, like this time.

320
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,480
But we found that the blast still happens
even if we avoid the crash.

321
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,080
That's why we determined
that there was a bomb on the bus.

322
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Xiao Heyun.

323
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,320
So many people died.

324
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,160
We don't have time for this.

325
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm not wasting your time.

326
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,720
We're really in a time loop!

327
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,040
Those are human lives!

328
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,920
Dozens of lives were lost.

329
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,480
Think it over.

330
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Who is this guy?

331
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,120
A game designer.

332
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,560
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

333
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,920
Ms. Du, what should we do now?

334
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,480
Yezi, prepare for a drug test.

335
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,520
Ms. Du.

336
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,400
What should we do now?

337
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,720
Mr. Zhang still spoils you too much.

338
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,320
He kept telling me about the time loop.

339
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,920
Ms. Du, how can I stay calm?

340
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,120
Li Shiqing.

341
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,280
I listened to your 911 call
over and over again.

342
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,600
I can tell by your tone
that you were desperate.

343
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,520
You hoped the police
could defuse the bomb in time.

344
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,920
You also hoped
that the explosion wouldn't happen.

345
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
I can sense that

346
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,360
you have a lot on your mind.

347
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,360
Tell me.

348
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,760
What worries you?

349
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,080
When we found you at Qingshui Park,

350
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,800
I saw it.

351
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,240
You were very nervous.

352
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,600
Why?

353
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,320
Mr. Zhang, can I ask you something?

354
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,600
Of course.

355
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Go ahead.

356
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,120
After you received my call,

357
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,320
did you take it seriously?

358
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,560
Were the officers sent right away?

359
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,080
After receiving the call,

360
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,320
we sent the officers right away.

361
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,280
But there wasn't enough time.

362
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,720
How do you know my last name is Zhang?

363
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,920
When we saw you at Qingshui Park,

364
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,760
only Jiang Feng showed you his badge.

365
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,560
All this time,

366
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,840
I haven't introduced myself to you.

367
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,800
How did you know my last name is Zhang?

368
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,280
Sit down!

369
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,000
Can I go out for some air or something?

370
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,320
It's really stuffy.

371
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,320
Sure.

372
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
But you have to be honest.

373
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,520
I am telling the truth. I…

374
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,400
Why don't you consider this time loop idea

375
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,960
and look at my map?

376
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,600
The time when I woke up.

377
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,240
-The time of the blast--
-The loop again?

378
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,280
If I did it,

379
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,480
why would I call the police?

380
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,960
That doesn't make any sense.

381
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,960
Okay.

382
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,040
Then tell me.

383
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,000
How did you know there was a bomb?

384
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,840
-We're in a--
-Don't talk to me about loops.

385
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,520
Li Shiqing.

386
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,440
Can you tell me

387
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,080
how you know that my last name is Zhang?

388
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,880
You told me yourself.

389
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,680
When did I tell you?

390
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
One time at the hospital.

391
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
Don't get up.

392
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,000
Are you Li Shiqing?

393
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
I'm the vice-captain of the CID.

394
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
My name is Zhang Cheng.

395
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,840
That time, a motorcycle hit me.

396
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,960
I had a minor concussion.

397
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I threw up at the time.

398
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
You even offered me water.

399
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,120
<i>You wanted to open the bottle
with your right hand.</i>

400
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,920
-Here. Have some water.
<i>-But you had trouble.</i>

401
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,520
The hospital?

402
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,240
Which hospital?

403
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
When?

404
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,320
I don't recall seeing you.

405
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
You wouldn't remember.

406
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,760
Because we met in a time loop.

407
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,520
What did you say?

408
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,520
A time loop?

409
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,880
QUESTION: A TIME LOOP?

410
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,040
I still have to tell.

411
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,920
When I was in the hospital,

412
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,720
I already told you the truth.

413
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,320
But you didn't believe me.

414
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,440
Maybe I didn't think it through then.

415
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
After Xiao Heyun entered the loop,

416
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,640
I finally understood.

417
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,320
We dodged the crash.

418
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
That's when I learned there was a bomb.

419
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,840
Forget it. You still won't believe me.

420
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,080
It's up to us to believe you or not.

421
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,840
We'll investigate further.

422
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,040
For you,

423
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,760
trusting the police

424
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,520
and answering honestly

425
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,960
is your only option.

426
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,480
I'll start from the beginning.

427
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,560
NEXT TIME, DON'T BE RASH.

428
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,520
I TOLD XIAO HEYUN
NOT TO BE RASH NEXT TIME.

429
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,520
BEFORE I FINISHED SPEAKING,
THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED AGAIN.

430
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,680
Anything else?

431
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,320
What number is next?

432
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,720
The ninth time.

433
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,200
Okay, begin.

434
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,640
When I woke up this time,

435
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,560
we finally reached a consensus.

436
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,480
Since the bus was bound to crash
at the intersection,

437
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,640
we just had to make sure that

438
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,760
the bus crossed
before or after the red light.

439
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,880
We did avoid the crash this time.

440
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,760
But we didn't see it coming.

441
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,800
When the bus got onto the bridge,

442
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,120
it still exploded.

443
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,840
In other words, the car crash
is a variable, a happening.

444
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,720
The bus blowing up?

445
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,720
That's the inevitable.

446
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,560
That's why we chose
to call the police right away.

447
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,800
Does that make sense now?

448
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,200
Actually, the problem now is that

449
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,040
this time, the bus exploded
after a car crash in the intersection,

450
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,000
not on the bridge.

451
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,920
If the bomb was on the bus,

452
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
can you find traces of explosives?

453
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
Can that prove that I'm telling the truth?

454
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,200
What do you mean "if there is a bomb"?

455
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,320
You said so many things
with such certainty just now.

456
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,720
Now you're saying "if"?

457
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,120
I'm saying "if"

458
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,560
because I'm not 100% sure

459
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
that the bomb was on the bus.

460
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,040
It could be on the bridge
or coming from somewhere else.

461
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Of course,

462
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,280
the most likely scenario is that
it was on the bus.

463
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Did you check the roof,
the undercarriage, and the interior?

464
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,240
Wait. What's wrong?

465
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,440
I haven't said a word about time loops.

466
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Xiao Heyun.

467
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
Did someone threaten you both?

468
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,000
It's okay. You can talk to me.

469
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,960
What is it that you can't say?

470
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,080
There isn't anything I can't say.

471
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm telling…

472
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,000
Okay, think about it.

473
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,360
We have plenty of time.

474
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,080
When you've made up your mind,
we'll continue talking.

475
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,640
THE TRANSCRIPT
IS A TRUE COPY OF MY STATEMENT

476
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
What do I need to think about? I…

477
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm telling the truth!

478
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,000
Why don't you believe me?

479
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,880
That means that the first, second,

480
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
and ninth time,

481
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
the bus just exploded.

482
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
Right?

483
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,440
You fell asleep the first two times.

484
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,560
Then a cell phone rang.

485
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,080
So you believe

486
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,200
it was a bomb that went off

487
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,240
instead of

488
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,160
a car accident.

489
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,520
Correct?

490
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,480
Yes, because every time there was
an explosion, I heard that ringtone.

491
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,360
Then how can you be so sure

492
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,240
that the ringtone came from a phone?

493
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,960
Actually, I'm not sure.

494
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,800
But that's the sound
of an old mobile ringtone.

495
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,600
You…

496
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,280
Do you remember how the ringtone goes?

497
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,880
Could it be that

498
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,160
the ringtone is a sort of countdown device
on the bomb?

499
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,000
Or maybe the ringtone
has nothing to do with the bomb.

500
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,280
Someone's phone just happened to ring.

501
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,200
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

502
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,440
Ms. Du, the drug test is ready.

503
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,960
Let's get them tested.

504
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay.

505
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,480
A time loop?

506
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,680
How could he spout such nonsense

507
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
and more than once?

508
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,080
Mr. Zhang.

509
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,480
What's with that face?

510
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,040
You don't believe it, right?

511
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Then tell me.

512
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,160
What's their motive for lying?

513
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,880
If they had nothing to do with the blast,

514
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,760
there was no need for them
to choose such a detailed lie.

515
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
If they had something to do
with the blast,

516
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,760
I don't think either of them
would have called the police

517
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,720
to put on a show for us.

518
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
How did the inquiries go?

519
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,280
Based on what we know so far,

520
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,680
they have simple social lives.

521
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
No vices.

522
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,480
What about relationships?

523
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,800
Nothing.

524
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,840
Officers visited their classmates
and colleagues.

525
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,240
They are both single.

526
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
And before this,

527
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,760
their lives never overlapped.

528
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,120
Nor did they have financial
or romantic disputes.

529
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,320
There is no motive.

530
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,280
They don't fit the MO.

531
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,360
But they got off at the stop
before the explosion.

532
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
And they drew out a whole diagram.

533
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,280
According to the diagram,

534
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,840
this was a well-planned operation.

535
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,320
The young woman looks so weak.

536
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,840
In reality,
her mental defenses are strong.

537
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Here's what.

538
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,000
Switch subjects with Jiang Feng.

539
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Okay.

540
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,400
Xiao Heyun, here.

541
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,520
Have a cup of coffee to perk you up.

542
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,520
Do you know what is the sentence
after "Leniency to those who confess"?

543
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,440
Can you tell me if there was a bomb
on the bus or not?

544
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Remember.

545
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,960
"Severity to those who resist."

546
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,920
Game architect.

547
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,280
You're usually very busy with work, right?

548
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,880
You have been here for hours.

549
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,199
Are you bored?

550
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,679
Let me tell you.

551
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,480
If you don't cooperate

552
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,800
and explain everything,

553
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,880
I won't let you leave.

554
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,280
Wait. We don't have to talk so much.

555
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,239
Just tell me.

556
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,520
Was the bomb on the bus or not?

557
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,719
If there was a bomb
and you got off ahead of time,

558
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,200
you two would be the prime suspects.

559
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,760
What did Li Shiqing say?

560
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,000
She knows more than I do.

561
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,320
Go ask her.

562
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
What did she say?

563
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,760
Young man.

564
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,520
We've been giving you chances.

565
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,480
Things that you tell us on your own

566
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,360
are of a different nature

567
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,120
from things that we find out ourselves.

568
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,960
Do you know what I mean?

569
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,640
That girl is being very cooperative.

570
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,600
<i>We never saw the bomb.</i>

571
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,600
What if the police ask us
where the bomb was?

572
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,240
-What do we say?
-Tell the truth.

573
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,920
That we've been experiencing a time loop?

574
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,240
They will never believe that.

575
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>They are so sharp.</i>

576
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,480
That's why I've been worried.

577
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,320
If we end up in the police station,

578
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,240
will they let us go that easily?

579
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,280
Is there no explanation

580
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,640
that could explain the call

581
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,920
and be able to convince them?

582
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,120
I don't know what she said.

583
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,000
But every word I said is true.

584
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,840
I have nothing to hide.

585
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
Nothing will change
even if you ask me 100 times.

586
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,920
Why are you wasting your time on me?

587
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,920
Then we both need to be ready.

588
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,560
Asking the same questions 100 times
has happened before.

589
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,520
I've made myself clear.

590
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,520
That diagram resulted
from compiling details from our loops.

591
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
It includes our waking time

592
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,760
and the time and location of explosions.

593
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,400
You can take another look.

594
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,840
And?

595
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,760
Well, I…

596
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,120
I've told you so many times.

597
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,480
There's no need to ask anymore.

598
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,760
Don't you have security cameras?

599
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,920
You can go back and check the CCTV.

600
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
I've already said what I had to say.

601
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,040
I can't help it if you don't believe me.

602
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,200
Do you mean that

603
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,080
she instructed you

604
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,560
to come up with this story?

605
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,760
That's not what I meant.

606
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,760
I compiled it myself.

607
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,320
You compiled it yourself?

608
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,280
You mean that

609
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,840
she wants to deceive the police.

610
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,080
<i>And then you helped her come up
with a time loop as an excuse.</i>

611
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,720
<i>You two are using this story
to deceive the police.</i>

612
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,120
Can I interpret it that way?

613
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Li Shiqing.

614
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,760
I suggest you come clean.

615
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,760
Xiao Heyun has identified you.

616
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
He identified me?

617
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,520
What did he identify me for?

618
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
He says he doesn't know anything
about the incident.

619
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,280
And judging from the CCTV footage,

620
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,720
you pulled him off the bus.

621
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,080
He said he drew this
based on your descriptions.

622
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,840
He only knew the terrain

623
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,600
but not the details.

624
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,080
You told him what happened.

625
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
No way.

626
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,320
We experienced everything together.

627
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,120
Li Shiqing.

628
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,760
If you still won't tell us
the whole story,

629
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,240
we'll accept Xiao Heyun's identification
of you as the main culprit.

630
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,680
This will count against you
during your sentencing.

631
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,040
So I hope you can be honest with me.

632
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,600
Who is behind this incident?

633
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
To what end?

634
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,200
I wish I knew.

635
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,360
Ms. Du.

636
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,400
The test results show no issues.

637
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,120
Hello?

638
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,360
I got it.

639
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,040
Xiao Heyun drew this, right?

640
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
I want to hear it from you.

641
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,200
What kind of role did Xiao Heyun play

642
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,040
in this traffic accident?

643
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,520
Xiao Heyun said

644
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,280
that this was a traffic accident?

645
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,160
<i>Circumstances have changed.
Pause interrogation.</i>

646
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,720
Mr. Jiang, you're lying, right?

647
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,960
I'm sure you already know.

648
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,360
This isn't a simple car accident.

649
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,280
JIALIN POLICE

650
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,280
Ms. Du.

651
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,960
The explosive residue
was detected at the scene.

652
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,920
It was on the bus.

653
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
There was a bomb.

654
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,080
It's a different story now.

655
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,000
Someone from the city is coming.

656
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,120
We can't report on some time loop.

657
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,480
So what now?

658
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,600
Process them for detention.

659
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,000
Xiao Heyun and Li Shiqing

660
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,440
are the prime suspects.

661
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,680
Xiao Heyun is emotionally unstable.

662
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,120
He has a weak mind.

663
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,200
Let's start with him first.

664
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,840
Xiao Heyun.

665
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,240
I'm the deputy director
of Jialin Police Station.

666
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,800
You're now a prime suspect
in the Route 45 bus bombing.

667
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,960
You'll be detained according to the law.

668
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,840
Wait.

669
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
I have no motive or means.

670
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,480
How can you detain me without proof?

671
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,040
We have confirmation.

672
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,920
There were explosives on board.

673
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,320
<i>The bus is moving. Please hold on tight.</i>

674
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,840
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>

675
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,760
