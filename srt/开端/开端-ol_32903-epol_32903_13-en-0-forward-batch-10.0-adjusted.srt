00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,400
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,600
HONGQIANG CABLE FACTORY
TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,520
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,520
<i>Next stop, Jiaming
Community Hospital.</i>

6
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Miss.

7
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,360
Do you ride the
Route 45 bus often?

8
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Has anyone ever taken
advantage of you on the bus?

9
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Take advantage of me?

10
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,080
Was there a man who
wanted to touch you?

11
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,496
- Take advantage, violate, and harass you?
- What are you doing?

12
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,776
- What's wrong with you?
- Was there? Miss, please tell me.

13
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,360
- Sir!
- Let go of me! Was there?

14
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,520
That person is sick!

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,040
- Stop it or I'll call the police!
- Miss!

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm not sick.

17
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,600
Hello? I'm calling the police.

18
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,880
HONGQIANG CABLE FACTORY
TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,120
How many times is this?

20
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,880
If I remember correctly, this
is the third time, right?

21
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
Please make sure we don't
get any more complaints

22
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,280
that make us send officers.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Can we not do this again?

24
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,320
I understand how you feel.

25
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,240
But your investigation

26
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,080
has already caused significant disruption
to Route 45 bus drivers and passengers.

27
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,680
Can you be more careful?

28
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,080
Who am I disturbing?

29
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,200
How did I disturb them?

30
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,040
If you didn't, would I be here?

31
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
Please trust the police.

32
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,480
Stop!

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
- Officer.
- What are you doing?

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,400
Please calm down.

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Listen to me.

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,280
Look at her.

37
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Please try to understand.

38
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm here.

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,880
I won't let her
cause trouble. Relax.

40
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Mr. Wang.

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,240
I can understand how you feel.

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
I have kids too.

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
But the case is closed.

44
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,360
What are you aiming
for by keeping this up?

45
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,880
Take my advice.

46
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400
Don't do it again.

47
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,120
Go home and talk to her.

48
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,720
There won't be the next time.

49
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm sorry for the trouble.

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Okay.

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,120
You guys go ahead.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Thank you.

53
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Thank you.

54
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,640
Let's go.

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Mr. Wang.

56
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,040
Take her home.
Don't stand there.

57
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,200
They couldn't find any evidence.

58
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,400
They won't let us search either.

59
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,040
Ambulance!

60
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,440
Where's the ambulance?

61
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,400
His wound has been treated.

62
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,160
It's not that serious.

63
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
He just lost a lot of blood.

64
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,360
He needs to stay.

65
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Xiaolu.

66
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,200
- Take them to the inpatient ward.
- Okay.

67
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
Come with me.

68
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Thank you.

69
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Hold on.

70
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Are you Xiao Heyun?

71
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,840
I need to talk to you right now.

72
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,200
How did you know there
was a bomb on the bus?

73
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,560
Tell me.

74
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,880
Officer.

75
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,280
He lost a lot of blood.

76
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,520
He needs to rest.

77
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,320
You can ask him later.

78
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
I won't take much of his time.

79
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,600
- I just have two questions.
- This is a hospital.

80
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
Ms. Du is on the phone.

81
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,280
Xiaolu, take them to the ward.

82
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Okay.

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,520
Come on, follow me.

84
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Ms. Du.

85
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,760
The one who called the police
is very important to us.

86
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Got it.

87
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,760
Keep me updated on
Mr. Zhang's situation.

88
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,360
I'll stay at the hospital.

89
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Ms. Du.

90
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,120
Those two just won't talk.

91
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,320
They refuse to cooperate.

92
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,320
Leave them be for a while.

93
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
We'll interrogate them
after we know more.

94
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,080
RESUSCITATION BAY (SECTOR A)

95
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,039
RESUSCITATION BAY (SECTOR A)

96
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,159
RESUSCITATION BAY (SECTOR A)

97
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
How did this happen?

98
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
Actually, we were so close.

99
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,480
The next time,

100
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,640
we need to buy more
time no matter what.

101
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,640
That way, no one gets hurt.

102
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,200
There may not be the next time.

103
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,320
Let's say saving
all the passengers

104
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,320
is the key to breaking
out of the time loop.

105
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,320
Well, we already did that.

106
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
This is the last time.

107
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,640
But I can't shake the feeling
that we haven't resolved anything.

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,960
I feel like something
more happened

109
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,080
after Wang Mengmeng's death.

110
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,160
Look this up for me.

111
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,400
"May 13th, 2014.

112
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
River-crossing
bridge car accident.

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
Route 45."

114
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Look at this.

115
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,600
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL?

116
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,000
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BORN

117
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
SHE'S NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD

118
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
SCUM OF SOCIETY

119
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,960
DIE!

120
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,720
DOES SHE THINK THE
WORLD OWES HER?

121
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,720
NICE DEATH!

122
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,360
SHE MUST'VE BEEN SPOILED ROTTEN

123
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,200
If Wang Mengmeng's parents

124
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,200
see these comments,

125
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,840
what will they think?

126
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
Maybe

127
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,080
for them,

128
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,160
surviving isn't true salvation.

129
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
We probably haven't gotten
to the heart of all this yet.

130
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,880
TUESDAY, JIALIN
RIVER-CROSSING BRIDGE

131
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,600
TUESDAY, JIALIN
RIVER-CROSSING BRIDGE

132
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,840
After what happened
to Wang Mengmeng,

133
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,800
Wang Xingde and Tao
Yinghong were dissatisfied

134
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,280
with the
investigation's outcome.

135
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,120
They also asked the police to investigate
why Wang Mengmeng got off the bus.

136
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,960
Is the involved bus
driver here yet?

137
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,960
He should be here soon.

138
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,360
I'll receive him at the door.

139
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Mr. Qin.

140
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,800
- Ms. Du.
- Thank you for coming, Mr. Qin.

141
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
- Did you bring everything?
- Yes, I did.

142
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,960
These are the statements,
accident reports,

143
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,760
and all the related documents.

144
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,480
This case wasn't
that complicated.

145
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,920
There was nothing suspicious.

146
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
It was just a traffic accident.

147
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Chain of evidence intact.

148
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
The cause was clear.

149
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,880
We determined that

150
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,016
the bus driver who let her
out had primary liability.

151
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,600
The dump truck had
secondary liability.

152
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,800
Were there any problems
with compensation?

153
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,040
There were none.

154
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,520
The bus company paid
the compensation.

155
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,760
The victim's family
didn't file a lawsuit.

156
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,080
There was no financial dispute.

157
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
Ms. Du.

158
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,040
He is the one from the case.

159
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,000
Mr. Zhu, the driver
of the Route 45 bus.

160
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,640
Mr. Zhu, this is Ms. Du.

161
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,960
Hello, Mr. Zhu.

162
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Have a seat.

163
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,360
Come, sit down.

164
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,920
- Sit down, Mr. Qin.
- Okay.

165
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
Have a seat, Mr. Zhu.

166
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,240
Don't be nervous, Mr. Zhu.

167
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,560
We just want to learn more
from you about the situation.

168
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,680
Just tell us the truth.

169
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,040
We were watching this video.

170
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,880
Wang Mengmeng was in a hurry
when she got off the bus.

171
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,920
And she had arguments
and tussles with you.

172
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
So what happened?

173
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,560
It has already been five years.

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
I've been asked all
the questions before.

175
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,680
You are Mr. Qin

176
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,480
from back then, right?

177
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,480
Yes, it's me.

178
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,520
Then you know better
than anyone else.

179
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
You should talk to them.

180
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,520
I answered all the
questions back then.

181
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
- All I can do now is...
- Mr. Zhu.

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,640
You've heard about the bombing.

183
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,360
This is a serious case.

184
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,520
Please cooperate.

185
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,800
At the time, that young lady

186
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
insisted on getting off.

187
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,280
I really didn't expect this

188
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
to happen.

189
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Otherwise,

190
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
I wouldn't have let
her off the bus.

191
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,640
But under the circumstances,

192
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,760
I had no choice but
to drop her off.

193
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm sure you've all seen
the security footage.

194
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,320
At the time,

195
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,880
she was already
pulling on my arm.

196
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,480
What if the bus was
steered off course?

197
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
What would happen?

198
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
The consequences
would be even worse.

199
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,520
I'm a driver.

200
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,920
I have to ensure the safety of
the dozens of passengers on board.

201
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,440
If she had acted up

202
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,920
anywhere else,

203
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,120
I could have pulled
over for her.

204
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
On the river-crossing bridge,

205
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,200
there is no way.

206
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,200
Didn't you think of asking
the passengers to stop her?

207
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,480
No one on the bus helped.

208
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,520
After the accident, did Wang
Mengmeng's parents contact you?

209
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,920
Did they ask you why
Wang Mengmeng got off?

210
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,320
Nothing in the world

211
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,200
could make me brave enough
to talk to them face-to-face.

212
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,000
I know that even if I were
to kneel and kowtow to them,

213
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,360
they wouldn't accept it either.

214
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,160
Especially that lady. She…

215
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,160
Yes, I know.

216
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,920
I breached the protocol.

217
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,400
I know that I lost my
job because of this.

218
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,480
I've admitted it myself.

219
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,800
How much do you know
about the real reason

220
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,960
that Wang Mengmeng got off?

221
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,120
Or did she say anything to you?

222
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,640
That young girl just
missed her stop.

223
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,040
I've seen this

224
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
more than a few times before.

225
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,880
She kept babbling on and on.

226
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,480
What she said didn't
make any sense.

227
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,320
I didn't know what she wanted.

228
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,320
She just kept wanting me
to stop and let her out.

229
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,360
I was focused on the road.

230
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,200
I didn't know what to do.

231
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,680
It's the river-crossing bridge!

232
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,400
You can't stop there!

233
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,520
But you still stopped.

234
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,040
Yes, I know I did stop!

235
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,760
But what could I do?

236
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Five years have already passed!

237
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Why won't you let it go?

238
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,040
Didn't you call me here
today to interrogate me?

239
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,920
- No.
- Fine. Take me and execute me!

240
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,256
- My life for hers!
- No, Mr. Zhu.

241
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,560
- Mr. Zhu.
- Here.

242
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
That's not our intention.

243
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Please have a seat.

244
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,480
Mr. Zhu, calm down.

245
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,080
Don't get so worked up.

246
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,600
That's not our intention.

247
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
We told you to come

248
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,840
just to ask you to
think back carefully.

249
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Did you upset her parents

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
to make them resent you?

251
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Resent?

252
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,760
Who doesn't harbor resentment?

253
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,720
I have resentment too.

254
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,720
Okay, Mr. Zhu.

255
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,720
Don't get worked up.

256
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Let's take a break.

257
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,480
Here, Xiaoliu.

258
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,400
Take Mr. Zhu to get
some tea and rest.

259
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,840
- Come.
- Mr. Zhu.

260
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,800
Here. Take a break.

261
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,760
- Mrs. Zhang.
- Where is Zhang Cheng?

262
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,600
I'm asking you. Where is he?

263
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,160
We took a closer look at the
security cameras on the bus.

264
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
We also talked to the
passengers on the bus.

265
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,600
No one knows why Wang
Mengmeng got off the bus.

266
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,720
We only found out that

267
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,280
she seriously interfered
with the driver's driving.

268
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,960
And aside from her frantic
hitting of the bus door,

269
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,880
there was no proof that she
was in any physical danger.

270
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,440
But if you look
at the transcript,

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
Tao Yinghong was
insistent on this point.

272
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,640
She felt that Wang Mengmeng must
have insisted on getting off the bus

273
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,839
because she felt
threatened on the bus.

274
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,760
Yes.

275
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,239
That's what she
was obsessed about.

276
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's watch the
bus footage again.

277
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,720
Who was she calling?

278
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,880
Wang Xingde.

279
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,760
She called.

280
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,319
But nobody answered.

281
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
<i>Sir!</i>

282
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,839
<i>Sir, I need to get off!</i>

283
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,800
<i>Sir!</i>

284
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
<i>Sir, I need to get off!</i>

285
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,960
<i>We can't stop here.</i>

286
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,000
<i>Pull over up ahead, please.</i>

287
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
<i>We're on the bridge. I
definitely can't stop.</i>

288
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,200
<i>Help me!</i>

289
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,920
<i>- Help me!
- What are you doing?</i>

290
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
<i>Go away!</i>

291
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
<i>I want to get off!</i>

292
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,320
<i>It's too dangerous!</i>

293
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,480
<i>What are you doing?</i>

294
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,680
<i>Stop the car!</i>

295
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,840
<i>Don't touch it!</i>

296
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>Don't touch the wheel!</i>

297
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
<i>- Stop the bus!
- Don't touch it!</i>

298
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,160
<i>I'll pull over!</i>

299
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,280
<i>Don't touch it.</i>

300
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,480
<i>Get off from the back. Get off.</i>

301
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,920
Stop.

302
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,840
Look.

303
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,176
The driver had opened the door.
She could have gotten off.

304
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,640
But why did she look back?

305
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,800
Who was she looking at?

306
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
There were so many passengers.

307
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,440
As for who she was looking at,

308
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,680
we're not sure.

309
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,920
But why did she
insist on getting off?

310
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
We've speculated on that.

311
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,400
The accident occurred on a
stretch of the Route 45 bus course

312
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,200
where disputes
happen frequently.

313
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,160
Yanjiang East Road is the
last stop before the bridge.

314
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,120
If you miss this stop,

315
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,040
you have to cross the
bridge and come back.

316
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,216
This process takes up a
good part of the hour.

317
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,520
But people often miss the stop

318
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,360
and ask to be
dropped off midway.

319
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,600
We assumed that was the
case with Wang Mengmeng.

320
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,160
So the accident wasn't
complicated at all.

321
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,080
There is also ample evidence.

322
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
All three parties agreed

323
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,840
to the liability determination
by the Traffic Police.

324
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,840
They all signed the findings.

325
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,480
The driver took responsibility.

326
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,520
And the damages were paid.

327
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,760
Yes.

328
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,600
What about Wang Xingde
and Tao Yinghong?

329
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,000
When the liability
determination was made,

330
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,720
how did they feel?

331
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,960
At first, they couldn't
accept it at all.

332
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,560
They investigated on their
own for over a month.

333
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,600
They took the Route
45 bus every day.

334
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,520
On the bus,

335
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,840
when they saw girls around
Wang Mengmeng's age,

336
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,000
they went up to them
and interrogated them.

337
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,800
They asked them if they had been
in any suspicious situations.

338
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,200
450,000 YUAN COMPENSATION

339
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,320
I see that the
liability determination

340
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,760
was signed only by Wang Xingde.

341
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,200
Was Tao Yinghong there?

342
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,360
Did she know about this?

343
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,320
She was there and aware of it.

344
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
After the incident,

345
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,560
it was Tao Yinghong who traveled
from her hometown and got here first.

346
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,000
So the communications and
forensics at an early stage

347
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,400
were dealt directly with her.

348
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
But during the investigation,

349
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,320
her emotions were
severely out of control.

350
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,120
This has affected our
investigation process.

351
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,080
So we tried to
avoid her later on.

352
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,640
We liaised with
Wang Xingde instead.

353
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,040
When Wang Xingde signed it,

354
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
Tao Yinghong was
present and informed.

355
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Afterward, did the two of them

356
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,040
have any objections
to this determination?

357
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,840
No.

358
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,480
Yezi.

359
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,800
Any news from Jiaodao?

360
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,720
Yes.

361
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,360
We contacted Tao Yinghong's colleagues
at Jiaodao First High School.

362
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,920
They said Tao Yinghong wasn't
in a good mental state.

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,640
After what happened
to Wang Mengmeng,

364
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,240
Tao Yinghong changed a lot
and became very irritable.

365
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,920
She even hit a student.

366
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,920
Not long after that,
she left the school.

367
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,240
But I think she was
persuaded to quit.

368
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,840
The parents of the student
who was hit threw a fit.

369
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,240
Since then, she hasn't
contacted her colleagues.

370
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,480
She blocked all their numbers.

371
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,120
Then she moved to Jialin.

372
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,800
And Wang Xingde?

373
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,640
We contacted some apprentices
from Wang Xingde's transport team.

374
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,840
They said that Wang Xingde
became very sad and depressed.

375
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,360
He aged overnight.

376
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,920
But he never talked about
it in front of other people.

377
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,560
Did anyone mention their
marital relationship?

378
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,680
His apprentice said that

379
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,640
Wang Xingde always
listens to Tao Yinghong.

380
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,320
Moving to Jialin was probably
Tao Yinghong's decision.

381
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
At first, Wang Xingde
was against it.

382
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
But Tao Yinghong was
determined to move.

383
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,440
Wang Xingde had no choice

384
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
but to come along.

385
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,680
How did you know

386
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,560
that there was a
bomb on the bus?

387
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,120
How did you know

388
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,240
Mr. Zhang's number?

389
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,920
Mr. Zhang told us himself.

390
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,520
When did he tell you?

391
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,240
Did you know each other?

392
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,160
I guess we kind of
know each other.

393
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,360
But I can't explain
it in a few words.

394
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,280
So…

395
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,120
Mr. Zhang…

396
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,600
Mr. Zhang is dead.

397
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,080
You have to truthfully tell me

398
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,600
everything you know.

399
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,440
- Jiang Feng, let's talk outside.
- Enough.

400
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,440
Answer me.

401
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,360
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

402
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,760
<i>You've wasted an
entire afternoon.</i>

403
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,640
<i>Don't you have
anything to tell us?</i>

404
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,560
<i>What about your daughter?</i>

405
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,640
Do you not have anything
to say about that?

406
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,600
What was the purpose
of this explosion?

407
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,000
Do you have any accomplices
other than Tao Yinghong?

408
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,360
Did you arrange any
other bomb sites?

409
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,360
How is Tao Yinghong?

410
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,440
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

411
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,480
If it weren't for the two
police officers on the bus,

412
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,040
our family

413
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,120
would already be together.

414
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,720
She mentioned two officers. Are
they the ones who called the police?

415
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,696
You said there were two
police officers on the bus.

416
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,040
Were they those
two young people?

417
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,400
I want to know.

418
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
You can keep following me.

419
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,720
But when I asked you

420
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
to find out the truth
behind Mengmeng's death,

421
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,280
why didn't you do it thoroughly?

422
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,920
Tao Yinghong.

423
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,080
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FILE

424
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,200
What you see here is the file on Wang
Mengmeng's case from five years ago.

425
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,920
As long as you cooperate,

426
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,960
we will get to the
bottom of this.

427
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,240
I've said what I had to say.

428
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,440
It was my idea.

429
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,160
I made the bomb myself.

430
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,000
I brought it onto
the Route 45 bus.

431
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,200
It has nothing to
do with Wang Xingde.

432
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,200
If you think there
must be something

433
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,000
because we're married,

434
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,400
then he was forced to do it.

435
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,200
Because I wanted
him to die with me.

436
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Tao Yinghong.

437
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,040
There's hatred in your
heart. I can understand.

438
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,680
You can understand?

439
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
You can understand?

440
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,080
Even I don't understand.

441
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Tao Yinghong.

442
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Tao Yinghong!

443
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,440
Stay here. I'll get a doctor.

444
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,720
Ms. Du.

445
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,640
Wang Xingde.

446
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,680
Your daughter's case.

447
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,960
We've already started
reinvestigating.

448
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
Thank you.

449
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,440
How is Tao Yinghong?

450
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,760
I can understand.

451
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,680
As parents,

452
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,840
you couldn't protect your child

453
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,520
when she was in the most danger.

454
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
Besides,

455
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,720
the last person that Mengmeng
called for help was you.

456
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,200
If I had picked it up,

457
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,680
wouldn't that have been nice?

458
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,240
If I could,

459
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,160
I would rather give my life

460
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,840
for Mengmeng's life.

461
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,280
What do those people know?

462
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,120
What right do they
have to go online

463
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,240
and make up stories about
a complete stranger?

464
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,160
They said such awful things.

465
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,400
Mengmeng was only 20 years old.

466
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,440
She never hurt anyone.

467
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,600
Back then,

468
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,840
if there was even a single
clue or a glimmer of hope,

469
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,440
we wouldn't be here.

470
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,000
Five years ago,

471
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,280
I forced Tao Yinghong

472
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,200
to move from Jiaodao to Jialin.

473
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,840
I am the one

474
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,880
who planned the whole bombing.

475
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
I forced Tao Yinghong

476
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,200
to make the bomb.

477
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,560
But we can't help it.

478
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,920
That was our child.

479
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,720
We had to make it right for her.

480
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,200
We couldn't let her die in vain.

481
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,480
Let me ask you.

482
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,760
Was it wrong of us to do that?

483
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,200
But that doesn't
justify your crime.

484
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,400
Did you consider this?

485
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,440
The passengers on the
bus have families too.

486
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,080
They also have
children and parents.

487
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,920
You're taking out
all your hatred

488
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,800
on innocent people

489
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,400
and destroying their families.

490
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
Is this behavior of yours

491
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,440
what Mengmeng would want to see?

492
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,840
I'm sorry for the trouble.

493
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm sorry.

494
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,360
MAY 13TH, 5 YEARS AGO

495
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
Mr. Wang, after Mengmeng
went to college,

496
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,856
there's no one to change
your gloves for you.

497
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,160
You know nothing.

498
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
Mengmeng told me.

499
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,680
She will buy me a new pair
when she is back for summer.

500
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,040
- Get to work.
- Okay.

501
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,760
Sir, I'll get you a new
pair when we get back.

502
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,880
Let's get a good
one. A leather pair!

503
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,120
You punk.

504
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,560
MENGMENG

505
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,520
MENGMENG

506
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,480
1:42 P.M., MAY
13TH, 2014, TUESDAY

507
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,040
MENGMENG

508
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
Mr. Wang.

509
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
The boss is looking for you.

510
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
You should go.

511
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,200
MENGMENG

512
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,760
1:44 P.M., MAY
13TH, 2014, TUESDAY

513
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,440
Mr. Yin, Miss
Wang's dad is here.

514
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,720
Hello, Mr. Wang.

515
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,120
This is Mr. Qin
from the precinct.

516
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,320
This is Mr. Yang
from the bus company.

517
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Mr. Wang.

518
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Mr. Wang.

519
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,960
Regarding Wang
Mengmeng's accident,

520
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,560
we are all very sorry.

521
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
My condolences.

522
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,080
This is a determination
of liability

523
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,920
and an agreement on
compensation for damages.

524
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,360
Traffic authorities took
this accident very seriously.

525
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,000
They thoroughly
investigated the cause.

526
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,880
The driver will also be
held legally responsible.

527
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,760
As for the compensation
and bereavement damages,

528
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,400
the bus company will pay for it.

529
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
We will pay.

530
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,400
As for the other details,

531
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,680
it's all in the file,
so please take a look.

532
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,440
If you have no objections,

533
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,480
please sign it.

534
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,600
I don't agree.

535
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,160
I don't need compensation.

536
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,440
But I need the truth.

537
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,801
I want to know why Wang Mengmeng
suddenly got off the bus.

538
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,080
I want to know what
happened to her on the bus

539
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,880
before she got off.

540
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,760
Once you find out the truth,

541
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,040
we'll sign the documents.

542
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
- Hey!
- Mr. Wang!

543
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,840
Mr. Wang!

544
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,159
- Mr. Wang.
- Mr. Wang.

545
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,239
Mr. Wang.

546
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,639
I heard that woman has
been standing here all day.

547
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,800
Isn't she silly?

548
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,000
She just keeps
waiting at the door.

549
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,000
Who is she looking for now?

550
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,840
Nobody would dare to see her.

551
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,560
The boss would never see her.

552
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,679
Of course they won't see her.

553
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,800
This woman.

554
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,120
What a pain in the ass.

555
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,920
Isn't there someone
on the Route 45 line

556
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,560
who molests young girls?

557
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,800
I guess so.

558
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,280
I've heard that before.

559
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,880
But if the passengers
don't speak up,

560
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,480
the driver won't care.

561
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,080
The driver has to drive. He can't
see what happens in the back.

562
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,320
If you ask me,

563
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,560
people like that are messed up.

564
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
He even goes after young girls.

565
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,640
If he gets caught, he
should be locked up.

566
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,160
MEN'S RESTROOM

567
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,360
UNIVERSITY TOWN STOP

568
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,080
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

569
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,720
<i>We've arrived at
University Town.</i>

570
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,440
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

571
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,000
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

572
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,040
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

573
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,960
Is anyone getting off here?

574
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,400
If not, we're leaving now.

575
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,560
Sir.

576
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,120
Sir, open the door!

577
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,640
Sir!

578
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,920
Sir!

579
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,320
Open the door!

580
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,520
Why did you chase after it?

581
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,760
Are you hurt?

582
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,520
UNIVERSITY TOWN STOP

583
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:41,400
UNIVERSITY TOWN STOP

584
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,440
What is the point
of coming here?

585
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,480
We're almost there.

586
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,400
I miss her.

587
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,080
Why don't we sign the documents?

588
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,320
They've pulled up all the
CCTV footage in the hallway.

589
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,920
Nobody entered the men's room

590
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,280
ten minutes before and after
you were in the restroom.

591
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,200
And we've been staking
out Route 45 for so long.

592
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,320
They won't even let
us on the bus now.

593
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Yinghong.

594
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
Listen to me.

595
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Yinghong.

596
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,120
Look at me.

597
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
Look at me.

598
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,560
Let's take Mengmeng home.

599
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,240
Mengmeng must want to go home.

600
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Moreover,

601
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,120
your graduating students
are waiting for you.

602
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,600
These students will
eventually become memories.

603
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,280
Mengmeng is gone.

604
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,680
From now on,

605
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,080
we will have to rely on each one
of these memories to live on.

606
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,280
