00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,880
MAY 13TH, 5 YEARS AGO

2
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,200
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,840
<i>We've arrived at
Gangwu New Village.</i>

4
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,720
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

5
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,880
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

7
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,760
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

8
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang East Road.</i>

9
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,200
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

10
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,760
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

11
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,320
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

12
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

13
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Hello?

14
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,520
Hello, Mom?

15
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I…

16
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,440
I was just on the bus.

17
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
I encountered a pervert.

18
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Gosh! What happened?

19
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,080
Were you taken advantage of?

20
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
- What is it?
- Are you okay?

21
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
<i>It wasn't me, Mom. It wasn't.</i>

22
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,920
<i>I saw a man. He…</i>

23
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,480
He rubbed his lower
body on a girl.

24
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

25
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,920
Why did you leave
that out at first?

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,360
You scared me.

27
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,280
I thought something
happened to you.

28
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
Mom.

29
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
Let me tell you. I…

30
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,360
I took a photo of that
pervert's face with my phone.

31
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,200
Do you think I should
call the police now?

32
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,240
When you photographed him,

33
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,200
did he see you?

34
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
I don't know.

35
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,080
But that guy kept
looking back at me.

36
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,280
And he walked towards me.

37
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,160
I was scared, so
I got off the bus.

38
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,480
Don't call the police.

39
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,240
You're all alone
in a foreign city.

40
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,080
Your dad and I aren't
there to keep you safe.

41
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,040
Besides,

42
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,680
if you report this
to the police,

43
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,080
he would only be jailed
for a few days at most.

44
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,920
What if he retaliates? The…

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
<i>The consequences…</i>

46
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,960
<i>I don't even want
to think about it.</i>

47
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,120
That wouldn't happen.

48
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
<i>Why not?</i>

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,360
<i>If he remembers your face,</i>

50
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,520
<i>he could wait at the
school or bus stop.</i>

51
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,280
You wouldn't be able to hide.

52
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,600
<i>A pervert like him is
capable of anything.</i>

53
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,560
You saw it happen.

54
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,000
It's over.

55
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,360
Pretend it never happened.

56
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Okay.

57
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
- Okay.
<i>- I've told you this before.</i>

58
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
From now on, when you go out,

59
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,920
don't wear those weird
clothes of yours.

60
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,960
Why are you bringing
that up again?

61
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,360
How are these weird?

62
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,840
<i>Look at your dresses.</i>

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,760
Each one is shorter
than the other.

64
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,480
Your thighs are exposed.

65
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,160
<i>You're a girl.</i>

66
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,920
<i>Wearing something like
this won't do you any good.</i>

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
What era are we living in?

68
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,120
How can you say that?

69
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,520
<i>Don't give me that nonsense.</i>

70
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm saying this
for your own good.

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,960
Because of your way of thinking,

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,000
people always think
it's the girl's fault!

73
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,480
HORRIFIC SCENE ON BUS ON
RIVER-CROSSING BRIDGE,

74
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
TEEN GIRL'S FOOLISH
ACTIONS LEAD TO DEATH

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,520
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY WANG
MENGMENG LEAPT OFF THE BUS?

76
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,440
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE
GIRL IN THE ACCIDENT?

77
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,680
CHINESE LANGUAGE MAJOR STUDENT
WANG MENGMENG LEAPED OFF A BUS

78
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,920
WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE GIRL

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
WHO JUMPED OUT OF THE
BUS ON THE BRIDGE?

80
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,336
SHE COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OFF
BECAUSE SHE MISSED HER STOP

81
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,880
WHO KNOWS IF YOU'RE
TELLING THE TRUTH?

82
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
THE PASSENGERS MUST BE
TRAUMATIZED. THE GIRL WAS A RETARD

83
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,960
WHAT AN IDIOT

84
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I'M SPEECHLESS…

85
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,640
YOU GUYS ARE ALL WRONG!
SHE DIDN'T MISS HER STOP…

86
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,000
SHE WASN'T A PSYCHO!

87
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,720
SHE ENCOUNTERED A
PERVERT ON THE BUS!

88
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
POST REPLY

89
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,001
SHE WASN'T A PSYCHO! SHE
ENCOUNTERED A PERVERT ON THE BUS!

90
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,320
I KNEW SOMEONE WOULD COME OUT

91
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,200
AND MAKE WAVES WITH
A DIFFERENT OPINION

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,799
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE YOU SAW IT
YOURSELF. ARE YOU DELUSIONAL?

93
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,960
IS IT TRUE JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY SO?
I'LL BELIEVE YOU IF YOU SHOW US EVIDENCE

94
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
IT'S EVEN WORSE IF
THIS PERSON HAS PROOF

95
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
THE STUDENT JUMPED TO HER DEATH

96
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,360
IF THIS PERSON DIDN'T STOP
WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE BUS,

97
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
THEY ARE NO DIFFERENT
FROM AN ACCOMPLICE

98
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
HER PARENTS WOULD
PROBABLY BEAT THEM UP

99
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,960
ANYONE WHO WITNESSES SEXUAL
HARASSMENT AND IGNORES IT

100
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,480
DESERVES TO DIE

101
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,400
IF IT'S TRUE, THEN
THEY'RE SELFISH

102
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
I HOPE IT'S NOT ANYONE I KNOW

103
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,840
THEY HAVE SOME
NERVE TO POST HERE

104
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,760
YES, IF THEY SAW AND IGNORED IT,
THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN THE ONE TO DIE.

105
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,440
When I wanted to
delete my comment,

106
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,120
I found that the administrator
had already locked the post.

107
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,480
I know I should
have said something.

108
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,640
I was too selfish and cowardly.

109
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,520
But their comments
were so harsh.

110
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,480
I was really scared.

111
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,800
I was just trying
to protect myself.

112
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,600
Show us the photo first.

113
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,320
Okay.

114
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
This is it.

115
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
I have changed my
phone many times.

116
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,960
This is the only
picture I never deleted.

117
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,520
Do you have a backup
copy of this photo?

118
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Like on a cloud or something?

119
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
Yes.

120
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,240
It's on the cloud.

121
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,600
If you need it,

122
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,360
I can give you my
account ID and password.

123
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,480
Remember.

124
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,160
Don't delete these photos
from your phone or the cloud.

125
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Don't tell anyone either.

126
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
These are very important
pieces of proof.

127
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,400
OUTPATIENT AND
INPATIENT DEPARTMENTS

128
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Jiang Feng.

129
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
- Li Shiqing, right?
- Yes.

130
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Go and help Xiao
Heyun pack his things.

131
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,400
We're going to
the station later.

132
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Come here.

133
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,520
Why did you act on your own?

134
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,680
I said, why did you
act on your own?

135
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,920
We don't have much time.

136
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,920
Do you know how worried
everyone is about you?

137
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,520
I just don't want Mr. Zhang's
death to be in vain.

138
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,480
I need to get to
the bottom of this.

139
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
This is the last thing
I can do for him.

140
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Let's go.

141
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,880
Go back and report to Ms. Du.

142
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,760
Did you see the
photo I sent you?

143
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,600
Yes.

144
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,400
What's wrong?

145
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm okay.

146
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,520
On the way back here,

147
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
I was thinking.

148
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,280
If I were Wang Mengmeng

149
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,640
and in a state of extreme fear,

150
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,600
would I have the
courage to fight back?

151
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,040
Tell me.

152
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,000
What if there are more girls

153
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,520
who experienced the same

154
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,760
but were afraid to speak up?

155
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,760
Don't worry.

156
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
This scumbag will be
punished for sure.

157
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,160
That's right.

158
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,640
Did you memorize the
address and password?

159
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,120
I did. Let me see it again.

160
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
You should memorize it too.

161
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,280
And do you also remember

162
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,400
Mr. Zhang's number

163
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,800
and the text you sent him?

164
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
I remember.

165
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Good.

166
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,880
When you wake up
in the next loop,

167
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,880
send a message to Mr. Zhang first
thing, then follow our previous plan.

168
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,840
Go to Mr. Jiao first.

169
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,560
- Then get Lu Di to help you...
- Hold on.

170
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,040
With Lu Di,

171
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,000
we wasted too much time on him

172
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,720
in one of our previous loops.

173
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,840
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

174
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,640
I think we need to minimize the
amount of time spent guiding him.

175
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Yes.

176
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,320
Let's say that Tao Yinghong
still can't be subdued.

177
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
- You...
- Get Wang Xingde.

178
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,960
Tell him the truth about
Wang Mengmeng's death.

179
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
There isn't anything wrong
with these procedures.

180
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,360
It's all about time.

181
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,680
- We need to buy as much time as possible.
- Yes.

182
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Yes.

183
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,960
Then there shouldn't
be a problem.

184
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,920
Look.

185
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,280
You can actually do all
these things on your own.

186
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,200
If…

187
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,480
If this is as far as I go,

188
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,360
then promise me.

189
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,280
You still have to get
out of the time loop.

190
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,560
I'm just saying.

191
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,280
What if that's a possibility?

192
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm just talking nonsense.

193
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,560
Xiao Heyun, you…

194
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,880
I'm just too nervous.

195
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm afraid of losing you.

196
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,320
Tell me.

197
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
What if there is no next time?

198
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
As in…

199
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
If…

200
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,560
When we wake up the next day,

201
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,400
we don't remember anything.

202
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,360
What should we do?

203
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,800
I'll remember you for sure.

204
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,480
Even if you forget about me,

205
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,040
I'll look for you.

206
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,600
I'll knock on your door.

207
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,040
I'll say to you,

208
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
"Hello, my name is Xiao Heyun.

209
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Will you be my girlfriend?"

210
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,840
Yes.

211
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Xiao Heyun.

212
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,680
Xiao Heyun.

213
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,040
<i>Actually, after the
time stopped moving up,</i>

214
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,680
<i>I could feel</i>

215
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,080
<i>that my health has
been deteriorating.</i>

216
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,560
If the time loop
isn't infinite for me…

217
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,856
MR. ZHANG, THERE'S A BOMB ON THE BUS
WITH THE LICENSE PLATE JIA A77651

218
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,560
THAT JUST LEFT THE
GANGWU NEW VILLAGE STOP.

219
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,016
THE BOMB IS IN A PRESSURE COOKER
AT THE PICTURED WOMAN'S FEET

220
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,360
Mr. Zhang, I sent you a text.

221
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,840
Make sure to look carefully.

222
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,560
I'll be waiting for a reply.

223
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,880
PLEASE REMAIN CALM WHILE
YOU READ THIS MESSAGE.

224
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,120
I'M HELPING…

225
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,440
POLICE

226
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,400
Yu Lei, let's split up.

227
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,840
Take men to seal off the bridge.

228
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,480
Seal off the river
too, just in case.

229
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,920
Don't let ships near the bridge.

230
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
- I'll go after the bus.
- Okay.

231
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Sir.

232
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
THE WOMAN IN GRAY HAS
A BOMB AT HER FEET

233
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,400
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO RESTRAIN HER

234
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,680
Really?

235
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,280
Help me.

236
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
The road is closed.
You may pass.

237
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,560
POLICE

238
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,480
All vehicles, turn off your
sirens and lights immediately.

239
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:08,640
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

240
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,760
WE ARE ARRIVING AT
YANJIANG EAST ROAD!

241
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,600
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

242
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
<i>Please exit through
the rear door.</i>

243
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,680
<i>Please tap your
card when exiting.</i>

244
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,560
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

245
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,200
What's going on?

246
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,080
Are you okay?

247
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,560
<i>We have cleared the bridge.</i>

248
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
We'll force the bus
to stop on the bridge.

249
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,000
From this point on,

250
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
keep me on the line.

251
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Mr. Zhang.

252
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,280
Wang Mengmeng's file is here.

253
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,800
UNKNOWN NUMBER

254
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,560
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

255
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,280
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>

256
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,840
THE WOMAN IN GRAY HAS
A BOMB AT HER FEET

257
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,120
I NEED YOUR HELP
TO MOVE THE BOMB

258
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,240
You're Lu,

259
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,760
Cat Apostle, Asthma Conqueror,
The One Chosen by Light, Di.

260
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
It doesn't matter how I know.

261
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,800
But you're the chosen one now.

262
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Help me.

263
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,160
POLICE

264
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,360
The target vehicle is
approaching the bridge.

265
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,160
Copy that. The bridge
is already sealed off.

266
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,360
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, 1,500 M

267
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,560
- Sir, I need to get off!
- Don't stop!

268
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,840
What's going on?

269
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,360
<i>Knife! Come and help! A knife!</i>

270
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,840
<i>- Why does she have a knife?
- She's going to blow up the bus! Help me!</i>

271
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,280
- Help me!
- Get her!

272
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,536
- Knife!
- Why does she have it?

273
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,880
She's going to blow up the bus!

274
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,200
Help me!

275
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,240
She's going to blow up
the bus! Get the knife!

276
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,480
- A knife?
- A knife!

277
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,400
Knife!

278
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,640
No!

279
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
No!

280
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,200
Let go!

281
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,520
Let…

282
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,920
Why is she acting on her own?

283
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,760
Let go of me!

284
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,920
Let go of me!

285
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,400
Jiang Feng.

286
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,400
Stop the bus! Stop it now!

287
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,240
Keep up.

288
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,760
Let go of me!

289
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,720
Let go of me!

290
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,920
Let go of me!

291
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,080
Wang Xingde.

292
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,720
Before any damage has been done,

293
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,000
you can still stop the
bus and turn yourself in.

294
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,760
Stop the bus, sir!

295
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,640
Stop the bus!

296
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Wang Xingde!

297
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,960
Pull over!

298
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,920
This is your last warning!

299
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,920
- Pull over at once!
- Stop the bus!

300
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,120
Stop the bus!

301
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
- Sir, stop the bus.
- Stop the bus, sir!

302
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,200
Wang Xingde!

303
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,600
State any requests you have!

304
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,960
We will try to fulfill them!

305
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,200
Turn the engine off!

306
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,400
Turn it off!

307
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,120
- The door won't open!
- Turn the engine off!

308
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,480
Turn the engine off!

309
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,760
Move it!

310
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,880
The door won't open!

311
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,160
Let go!

312
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,000
I know about Mengmeng, sir!

313
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,200
I know about Mengmeng!

314
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Wang Xingde!

315
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,840
- Freeze!
- Don't be rash.

316
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,320
Any problem can be
solved by negotiation.

317
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,000
Don't do anything rash, okay?

318
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,800
Sir, look at this photo.

319
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Look.

320
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,080
Mengmeng did encounter
a pervert back then.

321
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,200
That's why she got off the bus.

322
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,160
She didn't deserve it.

323
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,640
She had no choice but
to get off the bus.

324
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,640
This photo is the evidence.

325
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,400
She was innocent.

326
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,200
How do you know Mengmeng?

327
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,680
I have the same
counselor that she did.

328
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
We found the person
who took the photo.

329
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,640
She can be our witness.

330
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,440
All you have to do
is let everyone out.

331
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,480
I can hand the photo
over to the police.

332
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,280
We'll get justice
for Mengmeng, okay?

333
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Wang Xingde.

334
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,960
I'm Zhang Cheng from the CID.

335
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
You have my word.

336
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,240
We'll reopen the case
on your daughter.

337
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,640
We'll clear your
daughter's name.

338
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Do you understand?

339
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,200
What you're doing

340
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,000
can't hurt that scoundrel.

341
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,760
This man is still out there.

342
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,480
Why should you kill yourselves?

343
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,040
We have evidence now.

344
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,080
We can reveal the
truth to everyone.

345
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,880
Don't let the truth be buried.

346
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,160
It has been so long.

347
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,200
No one will believe it.

348
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,080
We believe it.

349
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,640
You must trust the police too.

350
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,840
We'll clear your
daughter's name.

351
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Mr. Wang.

352
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,200
Sir.

353
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,000
You have to live.

354
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,320
You have to see the
person who hurt Mengmeng

355
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,960
pay for what he did.

356
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,040
Give it to me.

357
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,240
- Quickly!
- Out of the way!

358
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Hurry!

359
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,480
Are you hurt?

360
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,520
Go on.

361
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,280
Thank you.

362
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Let's go over there.

363
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,360
No! I forgot to record it!

364
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,360
My dears!

365
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,000
- I just had a near-death experience!
- Put your phone away.

366
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
Tell me.

367
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,680
If we wake up tomorrow morning

368
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,040
and we're back at...

369
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
You two.

370
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Are you okay?

371
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
We're okay.

372
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,120
What about you? Are you hurt?

373
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
I'm not hurt.

374
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,560
But I have a few questions.

375
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,760
I need your cooperation, okay?

376
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,160
Okay.

377
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
Look at you two.

378
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,600
One knew every detail
about the bombing plan.

379
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Moreover,

380
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,280
you knew my number.

381
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,120
And the other one

382
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
knew every detail

383
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,920
about the passengers on board.

384
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Why is that?

385
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,440
Can you tell me why?

386
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,440
- Well...
- We are...

387
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,080
- I can't explain it. You go.
- Why don't you tell it? You do it.

388
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,200
Okay, that's fine.

389
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,520
Once you figure it out,

390
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,640
call me anytime.

391
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,880
- Okay.
- I'll think about it.

392
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Okay.

393
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,760
Thank you again.

394
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,840
You guys are really brave.

395
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,320
- It's nothing.
- You're welcome.

396
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,240
All right, go home quickly.

397
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,320
What should we do?

398
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,720
We need to think of an
explanation that makes sense.

399
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,080
If he were suspicious of us,

400
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,600
he wouldn't have let us go.

401
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
You're hungry?

402
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,800
Dinner is on me.
Let's go and eat.

403
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,200
Let's eat at Jialin's
priciest place.

404
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Come on.

405
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,320
I think the time loop is over.

406
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,040
The priciest isn't necessary.

407
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,640
We have plenty of time.

408
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,320
No, let's go.

409
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,880
LI SHIQING

410
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,320

411
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,040
GOOD NIGHT

412
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,520
Stir-fried pork liver.

413
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,760
Sichuan boiled fish.

414
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,760
Kung Pao chicken.

415
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,520
Everything is so delicious.

416
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,640
XIAO HEYUN: GOOD MORNING

417
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Today,

418
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,160
we are here to honor

419
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,920
these eight brave citizens.

420
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,840
Among them is a
university student.

421
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,920
There is also a woman
over 60 years old.

422
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,240
We have a new office worker.

423
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,960
We have a hard-working
farm worker as well.

424
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,360
Even though they come
from all walks of life,

425
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,800
in our hearts,

426
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,120
they are heroes.

427
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,040
Let's give them a
round of applause.

428
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,280
Welcome the heroes
onto the stage.

429
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

430
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,640
even though the eight of them

431
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,800
all have different ages,
experiences, and professions,

432
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,640
they have one thing in common.

433
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,280
When people's lives and
property are in danger,

434
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,000
they all come forward.

435
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,400
PROTECT THE CITY RIGHTEOUSLY

436
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,000
During this huge public safety
incident in Jialin City,

437
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,520
they discovered
the danger in time,

438
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,960
faced danger without fear,

439
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,160
and fought courageously
against the criminals.

440
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,040
That is how they protected
the nation, the greater good,

441
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,920
and the safety of people's
lives and property.

442
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,640
I hereby announce that

443
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,240
