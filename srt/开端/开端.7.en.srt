1
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,520
Xiaolong isn't here?

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,160
LINSHUI SECOND PRISON

3
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,920
Do you know yet?

4
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,840
In two months,

5
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,360
I can go home.

6
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,440
How are you doing in there?

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
All right.

8
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,400
Do you have any health problems?

9
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,040
No, I'm great.

10
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,040
I was so happy that I couldn't
sleep for the past two nights.

11
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,960
I've only had one thought
for the past few years.

12
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,640
That is, I will work hard.

13
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
I'll behave properly.

14
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,640
I'll aim for a reduced sentence.

15
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,120
I'll try to get home soon

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,360
and be with you all.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,080
This day has finally come.

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,240
They shortened my
time by six months!

19
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
Isn't that great?

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
That's great.

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
I have it all figured out.

22
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
When I get home,

23
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,680
I'll tidy up our home.

24
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,880
Keep that sandy lot for me.

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm going to plant watermelons.

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
We'll lease out the
rest of the land.

27
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,400
Xiaolong isn't young anymore.

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
To be honest, he
should get married.

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,440
When I get back,

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,560
I will renovate our
old house for him.

31
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,296
- It...
- I'll add another floor.

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,960
I already sold the house.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
You sold the house?

34
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,640
Do you not live in
the village anymore?

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Are you in the city?

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
That's good too!

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll be fine.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,360
I can do odd jobs
around the city.

39
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,400
If I'm lucky,

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,560
I'll get a job that provides
food and accommodation.

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
In the future,

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,640
you shouldn't look for us.

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,800
You…

44
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,440
Xiaolong has graduated.

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,280
He is staying in
Jialin for work.

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,080
We're moving to Jialin.

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,680
All these years,

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,880
because of you,

49
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,600
others have looked down on him.

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,000
He has suffered a lot.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,240
People say that his
dad is a murderer.

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,360
In our hometown,

53
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,200
he can't make a living.

54
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,600
Who would want to marry him?

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,880
In the future,

56
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,280
you live your life.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,760
We'll live our own lives.

58
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
Don't ever contact us again.

59
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
When you get out,

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
don't…

61
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,480
Don't look for us.

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Okay.

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,440
I got it.

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,680
As long as you two are happy,

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I'll be fine.

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,640
SEVERELY PUNISH EVIL,
GUARD THE PEACE OF JIALIN

67
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,080
Here, have some water.

68
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,120
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.

69
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,080
Thank you for coming here to
cooperate with our investigation.

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,920
No, it's something I should do.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,560
It's such a serious matter.

72
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,400
We really want to be of help.

73
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,800
STAY TRUE TO YOUR ORIGINAL
ASPIRATIONS, REMEMBER THE MISSION

74
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,400
There were no
survivors on the bus.

75
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,800
We hope to learn what
happened on the bus

76
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,240
from passengers who got
off along the route.

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,360
We checked all the
CCTVs along the route.

78
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,920
You got off at the last stop
before the accident, right?

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,160
Yes, the Yanjiang
East Road stop.

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,160
We never expected it.

81
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
After we got off,

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,440
the bus exploded.

83
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,120
I remember seeing
the security footage.

84
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,480
Based on your behavior,

85
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
it seemed to be a
last-minute decision.

86
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,080
Here's the thing.

87
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,240
The other day,

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,440
my boyfriend lost a
backpack on the bus.

89
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
It was on this bus line.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,920
When we got to the
Yanjiang East Road stop,

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,240
we saw a man outside

92
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,360
who had the exact same backpack.

93
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,320
We just wanted to
get off and ask him.

94
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,760
But it turned out not to be it.

95
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
Before he even got on,

96
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,520
you had noticed his backpack?

97
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,840
He was wearing his
backpack in the front.

98
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,360
That's why it was
rather obvious.

99
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,120
Why didn't you wait
until he got on the bus?

100
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,160
I guess we were
pretty impatient.

101
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
We talked to the guy
with the backpack.

102
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,800
He said you two pushed
him off the bus.

103
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,120
And then,

104
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,920
you unzipped his
backpack to check it.

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Is that true?

106
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't get it.

107
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,280
Whether your boyfriend's
bag was stolen or robbed,

108
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
so many days have
already passed.

109
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,400
The content would be long gone.

110
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,160
Why did you still unzip the bag?

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
What were you checking?

112
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,160
Can't you be certain

113
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,920
from the exterior?

114
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
This…

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,080
This…

116
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,520
We didn't think that far ahead.

117
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
When did you two…

118
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
find out about the incident?

119
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,640
The boy had a kitten in his bag.

120
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
The cat got out.

121
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,159
We had just found the cat

122
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
when we saw the explosion.

123
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,160
Were you surprised?

124
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,360
I was quite surprised
at the time.

125
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,560
If I hadn't gotten off
earlier, I would have…

126
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes.

127
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,720
Which stop did you get on at?

128
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,640
Were you alone?

129
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
How long did you
stay on the bus?

130
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
I got on the bus
in Gaoxin District

131
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,320
and waited for my
girlfriend to board

132
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,640
at the University Town stop.

133
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,880
We stayed for over ten stops.

134
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,560
It took about an hour.

135
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
While on the bus,

136
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
aside from the
backpack you mentioned,

137
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
did you notice anyone unusual?

138
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,680
Anyone unusual?

139
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
Actually, there was.

140
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,760
There were two men who
were quite unusual.

141
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,520
One was an older man
who sat next to us.

142
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,640
<i>He was on his phone as soon as
he got on and looked sneaky.</i>

143
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,800
<i>There was a huge
case next to him.</i>

144
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,160
He touched it from time to time.

145
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,800
It was weird.

146
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,760
There was also an old
man who sat in the front.

147
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
He had a burlap bag.

148
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,840
<i>There seemed to be
watermelons in it.</i>

149
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,840
<i>But every time
someone passed by,</i>

150
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,200
he got so nervous.

151
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,720
It didn't seem normal.

152
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,920
It was this person.

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
Ma Guoqiang.

154
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,480
Why did you find him suspicious?

155
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,600
- Pull up his file.
- Got it.

156
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
Look at this.

157
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,200
- Here.
<i>- "If you smile, it returns the greeting."</i>

158
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,120
<i>As I always say,</i>

159
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,576
<i>blessings always
outnumber worries.</i>

160
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,480
<i>If you want happiness,
look for Mr. One.</i>

161
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
<i>Yes!</i>

162
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,000
Even the comments say that this
old man's expression is scary.

163
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,080
After seeing this,

164
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,800
we remembered.

165
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,240
When he was on the bus,

166
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,160
he did seem nervous.

167
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
It was pretty weird.

168
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,720
The three of them are
saying the same thing.

169
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,960
It was a misunderstanding.

170
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,400
The other two seem to
be cooperative as well.

171
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,320
They told us everything
that they saw on the bus.

172
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,040
Aren't they a little
too cooperative?

173
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,880
Theoretically, they don't
know the actual situation.

174
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,760
They couldn't have
known about the bomb.

175
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,440
But they all happen
to suspect Ma Guoqiang

176
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,560
and the burlap bag at his feet.

177
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,320
But Mr. Zhang, we asked them

178
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,120
if there was anything
suspicious onboard.

179
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,560
If you were a
civilian on the bus,

180
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,120
would you notice these details?

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,720
Would you notice a burlap
bag at a farmer's feet?

182
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,160
Is that normal?

183
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,360
Some people
deliberately cater to us

184
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,760
when cooperating
with the police.

185
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
That's understandable.

186
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,920
Ms. Du, Mr. Zhang.

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,761
This is the information on the
passenger that the witnesses mentioned.

188
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,160
Ma Guoqiang. His
hometown is Ningxia.

189
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,560
In 2006,

190
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,920
he killed someone with a
three-wheeler and fled.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
He spent four years on the run.

192
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,720
He was caught in 2010
and sentenced to 9 years.

193
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,840
He was released in early 2017.

194
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,640
He is now a farmer
in his hometown.

195
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,880
Ma Guoqiang arrived in
Jialin this morning on a bus.

196
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Since his release, he has
been growing melons back home.

197
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,280
He lives alone.

198
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,560
His son and ex-wife
also live in Jialin.

199
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,120
His mental state is unknown.

200
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,480
He might have financial issues.

201
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Is his family here?

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
Yes, we're filling them in now.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
I think it's almost done.

204
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Mr. Zhang.

205
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,920
- Check it out.
- Okay.

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,560
Do we release the
three young ones?

207
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,480
Release them.

208
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,096
- Have them keep their phones on.
- Okay.

209
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,200
Wait a minute.

210
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,240
I think Li Shiqing
can be released first.

211
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Monitor her phone.

212
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,160
Find out what she's up
to after she leaves.

213
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,560
Keep these two for now.

214
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,920
After I meet with Ma
Guoqiang's family,

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,080
I want to talk to
those two again.

216
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,000
Something still doesn't
feel right to me.

217
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
Mr. Wang was such a nice person.

218
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,160
How could this happen?

219
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,320
Yes.

220
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
The main responsibility…

221
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,080
FUCHENG AMUSEMENT
PARK BUNGEE JUMP CLUB

222
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,800
MA XIAOLONG

223
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,960
When was the last
time you saw your dad?

224
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,320
He was visiting.

225
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,216
- Did he tell you?
- Mr. Zhang, it's these two.

226
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Ma Guoqiang's ex-wife and son.

227
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
You didn't have
any contact at all?

228
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Come on.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Mr. Zhang.

230
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,040
This is Liu Caicai,
Ma Guoqiang's ex-wife.

231
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,360
This is his son, Ma Xiaolong.

232
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,120
- Hello.
- My condolences.

233
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Ma Xiaolong.

234
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,000
Can you come with me?

235
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,760
I have some things to ask you.

236
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,920
What is it, sir?

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
What is it?

238
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,680
Don't worry.

239
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,120
We just want to learn more.

240
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
It's nothing.

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,960
Mom, don't worry.

242
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,240
Don't worry.

243
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Come on.

244
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,960
I'll be right back.

245
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
It's okay, ma'am.

246
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,800
We just have a few
simple questions.

247
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,520
Please have a seat.

248
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Have a seat.

249
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Let's go.

250
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
Your university is quite far.

251
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,880
Here's the thing, ma'am.

252
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,520
I want to refresh your memory.

253
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,320
When was the last time

254
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,680
you spoke to Ma Guoqiang?

255
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
I can't remember.

256
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
What's wrong?

257
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Nothing.

258
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,560
Mr. Lu.

259
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Go ahead.

260
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,320
I want to wait here
for my boyfriend.

261
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,360
We'll leave together
when he comes out.

262
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,560
You don't know how long
you will have to wait.

263
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,480
Let's go.

264
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,840
It's okay.

265
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,040
There are no buses
at this hour anyway.

266
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,160
I'll wait to take
a taxi with him.

267
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,880
Get back to work.

268
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
Okay, you can wait here.

269
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Don't roam around.

270
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,960
Did you visit him
while he was in prison?

271
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,600
Once or twice a year.

272
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,120
Here. Have some water.

273
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,520
- Okay, thank you.
- Have a seat.

274
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,400
Your dad came to
Jialin this morning.

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,480
We didn't know he was coming.

276
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,840
We've been estranged
all these years.

277
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,560
He did call a few times and
said he wanted to visit.

278
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,440
I didn't agree.

279
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Why?

280
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,600
Was it because

281
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,880
of his hit-and-run back then?

282
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
The year it happened,

283
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,119
I was prepping for the <i>Zhongkao</i>.

284
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
He refused to turn himself in.

285
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,440
Then he hid for a few years.

286
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,720
We didn't have the
time to look for him.

287
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,600
When he was arrested,

288
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,240
I think I had just
started college.

289
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,720
After he was imprisoned,

290
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
we cut off all ties.

291
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
But my mom and I
have been paying

292
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,600
the compensatory damages.

293
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
She has always believed

294
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,920
that being alone in
the city isn't easy.

295
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,720
I refused his visits many times.

296
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,240
Did the victim go
to your school?

297
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Yes.

298
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,560
It was my classmate.

299
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,760
Have you paid off the damages?

300
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Not yet.

301
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
But I will soon.

302
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,560
It has been so many years.

303
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,480
Has the victim's family

304
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,360
ever threatened you and your mom

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,800
or ever expressed an intent
to take revenge on your dad?

306
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,320
I don't think so.

307
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,520
What does that family have
to do with today's accident?

308
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
What did you say?

309
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,880
I said…

310
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,400
What does that family have
to do with today's accident?

311
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,520
We're looking into it too.

312
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,080
By the way, how is your
mom's mental state?

313
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
May I ask for her cooperation?

314
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Yes.

315
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,040
Please ask her to come here.

316
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Okay.

317
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
From what we know,

318
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,160
your dad had financial
problems, right?

319
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
They haven't been
resolved yet, right?

320
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Yes.

321
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Mom.

322
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
My son.

323
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,840
Why did they call
you over alone?

324
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,800
What did they ask you?

325
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,920
Nothing much, Mom.

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,120
Have a seat.

327
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,840
The police just asked if
we have paid our debts,

328
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,720
if we have had any disputes,

329
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,080
or if anyone has grudges on us.

330
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
What?

331
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,960
They must know

332
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,280
about the blood on
your dad's hands.

333
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,440
Mom.

334
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,520
It's all in the past.

335
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Don't talk about it.

336
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,840
Will they tell your boss?

337
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,760
- Did you tell the police?
- Mom.

338
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,760
We weren't in touch.

339
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,960
Mom.

340
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,800
Mom.

341
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,440
Dad is gone.

342
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
What are you talking about?

343
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,360
If a bus full of
people was killed

344
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,280
because someone wanted revenge

345
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,480
on your dad,

346
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,240
then we…

347
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,880
How many lives will be on us?

348
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
How can we pay them all back?

349
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,440
We are in serious trouble now.

350
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,920
Ma'am.

351
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,880
Don't get worked
up. Have some water.

352
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I don't want it.

353
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Give it to your mom.

354
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,000
Come on.

355
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,120
Mom.

356
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,360
This has nothing to do with us.

357
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,840
Drink some water and calm down.

358
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,360
The police are
still investigating.

359
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm going to the restroom.

360
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
When I get back,

361
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,160
I'll take you to Mr. Zhang.

362
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,120
He might question you.

363
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,720
Question me about what?

364
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,360
It's okay, Mom.

365
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
It's okay.

366
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,160
Officer.

367
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm going to go to the restroom,

368
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,160
then take my mom
to see Mr. Zhang.

369
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,360
No problem.

370
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Thank you.

371
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,320
It's okay, ma'am. Don't worry.

372
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Have some water.

373
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,280
MA XIAOLONG, FULL HOUSE REALTY

374
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,680
Are you one of the families too?

375
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,480
I'm not.

376
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,720
I was on that bus.

377
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,080
I'm cooperating with the police.

378
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,320
You were on the bus?

379
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Did you see a man
carrying a big bag?

380
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,120
I remember.

381
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
It was a bag of watermelons.

382
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,760
Watermelons?

383
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,560
Yes.

384
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
His bag had a hole in it.

385
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,120
I glimpsed watermelons in it.

386
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,920
That was my dad.

387
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,240
It's all my fault.

388
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,240
It's my fault.

389
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,400
Why would you say that?

390
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
He was put away for seven years.

391
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,880
He was out of
touch with society.

392
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,760
What was I afraid of?

393
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,720
This is all my fault.

394
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,320
Well…

395
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
Your dad…

396
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,840
Did he come to Jialin

397
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,720
to see you?

398
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,640
It's my fault.

399
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,920
It's all my fault.

400
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,040
POLICE

401
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,240
- Where?
- Ma'am, please calm down.

402
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,200
Right here.

403
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,560
- Here?
- Yes.

404
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,960
- Right here!
- Ma'am.

405
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,280
Let's not get too worked up.

406
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,640
- Okay?
- Okay.

407
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,480
- Lu Di!
- Mom.

408
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,640
Who has your heart?

409
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,120
- Ma'am, calm down.
- Tell me!

410
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,776
- Calm down. Don't be mad.
- Who has your heart?

411
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,840
Why did you take my diary?

412
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,280
- Lu Di, sit down.
- Calm down.

413
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
- Sit down.
- Calm down.

414
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,920
- What happened?
- Ma'am, talk it out.

415
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,840
- Honey, look.
- What's wrong?

416
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,760
Look at what your son wrote.

417
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
I don't know who fooled him!

418
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,680
He said he's going with someone

419
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,000
to prevent some explosion!

420
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,320
- Mom!
- An explosion?

421
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,680
Mom, that diary wasn't
for you to read right now.

422
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,080
Am I supposed to read
it when you're dead?

423
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,720
It would be too late by then!

424
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Mom, do you know

425
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,640
that it is illegal for you to
invade my privacy like that?

426
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,240
What crime did I commit?

427
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,280
- I had every right to do it.
- Come outside.

428
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
Bring Li Shiqing back.

429
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,000
Put her and Xiao Heyun
into interrogation rooms.

430
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
Don't let those two meet.

431
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Got it.

432
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,600
Tell me what is going on.

433
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Hello?

434
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,760
Hello, Li Shiqing? Can you
come to the station again?

435
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,960
Is there anything else?

436
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,800
- Where are you?
- I…

437
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,800
I'm near the police station.

438
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,960
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

439
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Xiao Heyun.

440
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,680
Come with me.

441
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,600
Am I free to go?

442
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Not yet.

443
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
Then where are we going?

444
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,280
Come with me.

445
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Lu Di.

446
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,920
Look at that.

447
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,520
What's wrong with you?

448
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,520
No matter what, you shouldn't
have read his letter.

449
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,240
And you're making a scene here.

450
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,800
How is that a letter?

451
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,320
It's a suicide note!

452
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,320
Do you get it or not?

453
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,640
He was tricked into going
to some other world.

454
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,760
We might lose our child soon!

455
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,360
Then so be it, Mom.

456
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,040
Don't you care about how I feel?

457
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,880
I don't give a damn, Mom.

458
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,000
You thought you
were protecting me.

459
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,480
It was actually house arrest.

460
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,480
I'm a human being.

461
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,200
I have my own
interests and pursuits.

462
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,920
I'm not your accessory.

463
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,240
They chose me today.

464
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,440
For the first time in 23
years, I feel irreplaceable.

465
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,240
You don't get it and
I don't need you to.

466
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,200
Listen to this.

467
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,640
Did you hear what he said?

468
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,640
Who has chosen you?

469
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,600
Why did they choose you?

470
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,240
To save the world.

471
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Tell me.

472
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,840
There's more! What
is this Anime City?

473
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,480
What about that?

474
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,440
Lu Di.

475
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,960
What are you hiding from us?

476
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,200
Enough!

477
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,600
Why don't you ever stop?

478
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,680
What child doesn't have secrets?

479
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,640
He's just renting a place.

480
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,520
- Renting a place?
- Dad.

481
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,280
Did you know he was
renting a place?

482
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,720
How did you know?

483
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,960
Lu Di, you…

484
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,880
Look at you.

485
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,520
How can you be so good at lying?

486
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Enough!

487
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,320
Lie about what?

488
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,280
Who is actually doing the lying?

489
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,120
Who is actually lying?

490
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
What do you mean?

491
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
All these years,

492
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,200
have you respected him?

493
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Have we ever respected him?

494
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,240
How have I disrespected him?

495
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,720
That's enough. Let's go home.

496
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,480
- Sir, calm down.
- How could you scold me?

497
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
- All right, ma'am.
- Go.

498
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,616
- You've...
- He's an adult.

499
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,920
Can't you show him some respect?

500
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,080
- Sir, calm down.
- Okay.

501
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,296
- Okay.
- Can we talk outside, ma'am?

502
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay, enough. I'm begging you.

503
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,480
- Ask thoroughly!
- All right.

504
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,480
- Okay.
- This way, ma'am.

505
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,576
- Make sure you get it straight.
- You can go. Okay.

506
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,680
All right.

507
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm sorry, sir.

508
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
It's okay.

509
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Lu Di.

510
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,560
Back in the day,

511
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,000
I also pursued Cui Jian.

512
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,960
Your mom also pursued
Leslie Cheung and Sanmao.

513
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
We were just like you.

514
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,360
Thank you, Dad.

515
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,400
All right.

516
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,040
Cooperate with the police.

517
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,360
Your mom and I will
wait for you outside.

518
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,160
Okay.

519
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,720
Have a seat.

520
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,440
Sit down.

521
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,280
Sit down.

522
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Thank you.

523
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,800
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

524
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,800
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

525
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,400
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

526
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,840
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

527
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,480
<i>Lu Di gave us</i>

528
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,960
<i>some details about
the explosion.</i>

529
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,120
How did you and Lu Di meet?

530
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Didn't I tell you earlier?

531
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,680
About the bag on the bus today.

532
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,800
What could you have
learned from him?

533
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,000
Is that for you to ask?

534
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,600
What you need to do now is
answer every question honestly.

535
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,040
Okay.

536
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
The first time I woke up,

537
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,720
the blast hit as soon
as I opened my eyes.

538
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
The second time I woke up,

539
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,840
I thought it was a dream.

540
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
- The third time...
- Li Shiqing.

541
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,320
Actually,

542
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,600
something is wrong with my head.

543
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
I was hit by a
motorcycle the other day.

544
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,480
We really don't understand
what you're talking about.

545
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,080
But let me remind you.

546
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,880
This isn't a stage
for your performance.

547
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,000
You mentioned taking risks,

548
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
the explosion,

549
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,960
and rescuing passengers.

550
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,680
Did those two tell you those?

551
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,400
We don't have much time left.

552
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,600
Listen to me.

553
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Put together all the
information you have.

554
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,640
Give it to me. I can use it.

555
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
I'm going to save
the world for you.

556
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,040
Save the world? Sure.

557
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,360
We can also take part.

558
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,880
We'll help you save the world.

559
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,680
But you have to answer
our questions first.

560
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,160
I can't answer you right now.

561
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,560
There isn't much time left.

562
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,720
Lu Di, you don't have
to worry about that.

563
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,240
We have plenty of time.

564
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,440
We can all take turns
keeping you company.

565
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,880
Once midnight hits,
everything will reset.

566
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Hurry.

567
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,280
Trust me!

568
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Xiao Heyun.

569
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,240
- Do you know...
- That's enough.

570
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,800
I'll be honest and tell
the truth. How about that?

571
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I am…

572
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,840
in a time loop.

573
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,856
You thought the explosion today
was caused by a car crash.

574
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,520
But at night, you will
find a bomb on the bus.

575
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Right?

576
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,760
If I wasn't in a time loop,

577
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,160
how would I know that?

578
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,240
I don't have enough time.

579
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,400
I have to go soon.

580
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,840
If you have anything to tell me,

581
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,760
tell me now.

582
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,000
You should tell us the truth.

583
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,400
Xiao Heyun.

584
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,280
When did you start
planning all this?

585
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,960
It will be the 16th time soon.

586
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,880
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

587
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,400
NEXT STOP, YANJIANG EAST ROAD

588
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,120
KEEP CLEAR OF THE DOORS

589
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,920
DO NOT USE THIS AS SUPPORT

590
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,560
What happened?

591
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,920
Did you say something wrong
at the police station?

592
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,520
No.

593
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,480
Mr. Jiang said that Lu Di wrote
a suicide note for his mom.

594
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,320
He wants to join the time loop.

595
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,920
What did you say?

596
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I…

597
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,840
It doesn't matter what I said.

598
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,840
Anyway, I don't want to go to the
police and talk about loops anymore.

599
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm sick of it.

600
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,360
Me too.

601
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,560
I have a big clue.

602
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,800
That old man.

603
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,000
He has a criminal record.

604
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,400
He has a death on
his conscience.

605
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,920
As in, he has killed someone.

606
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,120
He does have a weird bag.

607
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,800
Should we look into him?

608
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,200
I'll go and check it out first.

609
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
Be careful.

610
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
He is so careful with that bag.

611
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,920
There must be something.

612
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,080
WE ARE ARRIVING AT
YANJIANG EAST ROAD!

613
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,720
Don't we also have Lu Di?

614
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Yes.

615
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

616
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,800
Care…

617
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,400
Thank you.

618
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,760
Are you okay?

619
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,120
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

620
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,720
- <i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>
- Excuse me. Let me go through.

621
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
Thank you.

622
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
He is not in the time loop.

623
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,360
Why don't we say the
secret code to him?

624
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,480
Explaining it to him now

625
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,920
would be such a waste of time.

626
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,080
Let's stick to our plan for now.

627
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,240
We'll call him if we need help.

628
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,960
That's too bad.

629
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
That's one less helper for us.

630
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,360
It's okay.

631
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,760
I've come up with a plan.

632
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,600
Do you know how to count?

633
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,880
This is clearly four stops.

634
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,160
How did you count?

635
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
I counted by hand.
It's five stops.

636
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,200
Let's see how you count by hand.

637
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,120
Look.

638
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,720
See for yourself. Isn't it…

639
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,400
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

640
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
I'm sorry.

641
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,640
What are you doing?

642
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,016
- Why did you kick my melons?
- What?

643
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,880
No fighting!

644
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,360
No fighting! What are you doing?

645
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
It was him.

646
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,600
He kicked my melons first.

647
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,880
He ruined two of them.

648
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
I didn't mean to push him.

649
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,680
I also didn't mean to.

650
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,840
You didn't mean to either?

651
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,040
The first time, fine.

652
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,800
But the second time?

653
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,560
- Exactly.
- I was watching.

654
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,680
You did it on purpose.

655
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,720
Tell us. Why did you
kick the watermelons?

656
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Were your legs itching to do so?

657
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,880
You deserve that push.

658
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
- And you. Yes, you!
- Why did you…

659
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,280
He kicked your melon,
so you pushed him?

660
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,120
You pushed so hard.
What if he got hurt?

661
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,400
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you apologizing to me?

662
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,200
You pushed him.
Say sorry to him.

663
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,720
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

664
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,840
Why should you apologize to him?

665
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,080
Don't be sorry.

666
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,600
He started it.

667
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,040
I don't mean to
criticize you, young man.

668
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,520
But look at what you
did to his melons.

669
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,120
You should apologize!

670
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,080
Do I have to tell you?

671
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
- Yes.
- My goodness!

672
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,360
It's okay.

673
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,680
I'm sorry for the trouble.

674
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,040
Yes, I'm sorry.

675
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,040
It looks like you
still have a few…

676
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Don't push it.

677
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,520
I…

678
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Go back.

679
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,640
Sir, I'm so sorry.

680
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,120
My boyfriend was
fighting with me today.

681
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,600
He's not in a good mood.

682
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,840
Is that any reason to take
it out on his watermelons?

683
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,680
Look what happened
to the watermelons.

684
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,880
It's such a waste
of good watermelons.

685
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,160
That's too bad.

686
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,040
How about this?

687
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,960
I'll compensate you
for the watermelons.

688
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,760
My melons aren't for sale.

689
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,320
I carried them a long way here.

690
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,440
They are for my son.

691
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,400
Sir.

692
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,320
Are you Ma Xiaolong's dad?

693
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
Who are you?

694
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,760
I also work at
Full House Realty.

695
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,120
I'm his colleague.

696
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,360
Is it really you?

697
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,160
He showed me a picture of you.

698
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,080
Really?

699
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Here.

700
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,480
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

701
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,080
Look, just now,

702
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,880
I really didn't
mean to push him.

703
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,640
Don't apologize.
He was the problem.

704
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,800
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

705
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,960
Do you know each other?

706
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,960
What a small world.

707
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,880
That's interesting.
What's going on?

708
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,360
What is it?

709
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,000
I haven't seen
Xiaolong in years.

710
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Fortunately,

711
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,000
he is connected with
relatives on WeChat Moments.

712
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,200
My friend told me.

713
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,000
He posted something
in the last two days.

714
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,400
He said he wanted to eat
the watermelons I grew,

715
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,760
but he couldn't come home.

716
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,320
I thought that

717
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,360
I would bring him
the watermelons.

718
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,160
Mostly,

719
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,920
I just want to see him.

720
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,080
Is it that hard for two
living people to meet?

721
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,520
You have no idea.

722
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,440
It's all my fault.

723
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,360
We just can't meet.

724
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Sir.

725
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,120
Xiaolong wants to see you too.

726
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
It's true.

727
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,000
Xiaolong always tells us.

728
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,240
He says his dad's
melons are the sweetest.

729
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,920
He even said he wanted to
visit you over the new year.

730
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
That's great.

731
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,960
Thank you so much for looking
after Xiaolong at work.

732
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,000
Ever since Xiaolong was little,

733
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,520
he said he wanted to
grow up to have a job

734
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,960
that required wearing a suit.

735
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,600
He has such a job now.

736
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,240
He also has such
a nice colleague.

737
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
I have to thank my ancestors.

738
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,040
Since you work with Xiaolong,

739
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
I'll treat you to a watermelon.

740
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,880
When Xiaolong gets them,

741
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,760
he will share them with
his colleagues anyway.

742
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,800
It's too big.

743
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,600
Even though this
watermelon is broken,

744
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,200
the flesh is clean.

745
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,320
- Here.
- Thank you.

746
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,280
- Sir.
- Me too?

747
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,640
- Yes.
- Wait, let me film this.

748
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,600
Thank you so much.

749
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,816
These are watermelons grown
in the sand in the northwest.

750
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,640
They are so sweet. You
won't find them here.

751
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,680
- I'll have one.
- Everyone gets one.

752
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,800
Thank you.

753
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
It's so sweet.

754
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,000
No wonder Xiaolong
always talks about it.

755
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,520
Miss, which stop are
you getting off at?

756
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,400
Why don't I pick one for
you to take with you?

757
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,840
No, don't pick one.

758
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,600
The ones on the floor
are already a waste.

759
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,280
Okay. Let's finish
it first, okay?

760
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,840
It's so sweet.

761
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
It's delicious.

762
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,320
This is good.

763
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,680
Here. Have another piece.

764
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,640
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, 1,500 M

765
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,680
Dad, they are eating watermelon.

766
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,400
I want watermelon too.

767
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
I…

768
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,920
How about grapes?

769
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,160
Your mom got you some grapes.

770
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,280
Have some grapes.

771
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,640
No! I want watermelon.

772
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,880
Listen to me.

773
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,840
Grapes are the same
as watermelons.

774
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,960
They both have seeds
and skin and are sweet.

775
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
Have some grapes.

776
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,560
No, buy me a watermelon.

777
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,320
Do you want some water? Here.

778
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Have some water.

779
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,120
I don't want water.
I want watermelon.

780
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,240
It's up to you.

781
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,560
Miss, there are more.

782
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,280
Let's share them all.

783
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,480
What do you think?
Isn't it sweet?

784
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,920
Sir.

785
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,080
Xiaolong said that he was sorry.

786
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,520
He shouldn't have run away.

787
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,920
He really loves you.

788
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,840
I am not a celebrity.

789
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,880
I'm just an ordinary
person like you.

790
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,760
I was so moved by what
you guys did last night.

791
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,080
It's true.

792
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,496
Blessings always
outnumber worries.

793
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,440
If you want happiness,
look for Mr. One.

794
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
As I always say,

795
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,240
"If you don't abandon me, I
will stay with you for life."

796
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,440
I was also moved

797
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,680
by what you said earlier.

798
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,760
I just feel bad
for that old man.

799
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,840
He was so upset and sad.

800
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,960
So I mentioned his son.

801
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,560
I didn't expect it to go on.

802
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,160
However,

803
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,960
if I could give him some
comfort in his last moment,

804
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,560
isn't that a good thing?

805
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
There are two left.

806
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,360
They even got on at
the same bus stop.

807
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,200
