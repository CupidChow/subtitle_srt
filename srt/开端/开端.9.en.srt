1
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,480
- Where's the fire? Hurry!
- Where's the fire?

2
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,440
It's out. It's all
out. It's okay.

3
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,080
Ma'am.

5
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
This is an old neighborhood.

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,120
We have to be more
vigilant against fires.

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Yes.

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Check the wires often.

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,880
It won't happen
again. Don't worry.

10
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm sorry for worrying you.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
- Go...
- I'm glad you're okay.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,680
Go home. You have to
work tomorrow. Thank you.

13
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,919
Let's go, then.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
- Go home.
- Let's go.

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,920
- Okay. Do your inspections.
- Okay.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
Okay, let's go.

17
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,040
Be careful. It's slippery.

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Okay.

19
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,520
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP, JIALIN

20
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,600
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP, JIALIN

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,400
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP, JIALIN

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
That's what happened.

23
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,560
In the call we received
before the explosion,

24
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,760
there was no information
about the bomb.

25
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,160
It only mentioned a
murder on the bus.

26
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,600
That means

27
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,520
the bomb wasn't in plain sight.

28
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
It's obvious.

29
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,440
This was a man-made explosion.

30
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
But now, the CCTV on the bus

31
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
has likely been destroyed.

32
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,680
We won't be able to find out

33
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,120
what happened on the bus.

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,960
But according to the
street CCTV footage,

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
it can be inferred

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,640
that these two people who got
off are highly suspicious.

37
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,760
Our top priority is
to find these two.

38
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
Rewind the video.

39
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,040
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP, JIALIN

40
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,960
Stop.

41
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
Look into this guy too.

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,840
Got it.

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
HOUSEHOLD REGISTER

44
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480

48
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,920
Ms. Du, Mr. Zhang.

49
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Look.

50
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,880
We've pretty much
identified these three.

51
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,640
This young girl is Li Shiqing.

52
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
She's 20 years old.

53
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,680
She's a junior at Jialin
Normal University.

54
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,480
She got on at the
University Town stop.

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
This young man is Xiao Heyun.

56
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
He's 25 years old.

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
He's the founder
of a game company.

58
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,600
He got on at Gaoxin District.

59
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,600
Middle-aged male, Jiao Xiangrong,
45 years old, unemployed.

60
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,960
He got on at Gangwu New Village.

61
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
Xiaoliu.

62
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,680
Take officers to Jialin Normal
University and Gaoxin District.

63
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,360
- Look into these two youngsters.
- Okay.

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
- Yu Lei.
- Yes?

65
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,200
Inform Jiang Feng,
who is at the scene.

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,360
Go to Gangwu New Village to
look into Jiao Xiangrong.

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Okay.

68
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,000
Yezi.

69
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
What about the CCTV footage from
Yanjiang East Road to Danqing Road?

70
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,760
From Danqing Road,

71
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,440
they could've gone
in three directions.

72
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,960
Two of the routes have CCTVs.

73
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,240
We've ruled those out.

74
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,600
Only Gangwu New Village remains.

75
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Gangwu New Village?

76
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,656
It's full of closely-built
"handshake buildings."

77
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,440
There are few cameras
with many blind spots.

78
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,120
We can't be in control
of the situation

79
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
in Gangwu New Village.

80
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Yes.

81
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Hello?

82
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,160
Okay, I got it.

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,600
I just got the news.

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,216
They are headed for
Gangwu New Village.

85
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,280
Patrol officers are on it.

86
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,080
Locate these two
youngsters' phones now.

87
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Keep me informed.

88
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
- Got it.
- I'll bring a team with me.

89
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,640
DEMOLISH ILLEGAL BUILDINGS

90
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Ms. Yu, right?

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm Jiang Feng from CID.

92
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
These are my colleagues.

93
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,480
Okay. Hello.

94
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,160
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Here.

96
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,080
The garage is this way.

97
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Come.

98
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,480
It's crowded here.

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Occupant turnover is high.

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,360
This is an old neighborhood

101
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
without property management,

102
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,440
so it's hard for
our work to proceed.

103
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,880
As soon as you're gone,

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
we're going to get a visit for
a fire prevention inspection.

105
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,799
I'm also busy from
morning until night.

106
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,520
Sometimes, I don't
even get water breaks.

107
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,880
Luo Jin, check that out.

108
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,799
Okay.

109
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,799
We're almost there.

110
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
Xiaoyu, you're here.

111
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,200
This is the garage that
Jiao Xiangrong lived in.

112
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,040
Do you need to go in?

113
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
- Yes.
- Just a moment.

114
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,880
Fan Yonggang!

115
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Fan Yonggang!

116
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Xiaoyu, what's up?

117
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,320
Come down.

118
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,680
Open the garage door.

119
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,160
Are they here for
the fire inspection?

120
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,280
Is it right now?

121
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,760
Come down!

122
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,880
They have questions.

123
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Yonggang.

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,520
Gangzi, are you in trouble?

125
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,720
Shut up.

126
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
Mr. Fan, let me introduce you.

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,840
These are the
officers from the CID.

128
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,240
This is Mr. Jiang.

129
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,760
Didn't you say it was
a fire inspection?

130
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Why are the police here?

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,120
Hurry and open the door.

132
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Come on.

133
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,000
What happened?

134
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Nothing.

135
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,920
I already had him vacated.

136
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,520
I even got rid of the bed.

137
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,736
- Ma'am, can I ask you some questions?
- When did he leave?

138
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,240
He left at noon and
didn't say much.

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,040
What do people say about him?

140
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,000
He's a pretty honest guy.

141
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Really?

142
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Officer.

143
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,080
What happened?

144
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
It's nothing.

145
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,920
Please identify someone for me.

146
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Look.

147
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,960
Is he Jiao Xiangrong?

148
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,680
That's right. That's Mr. Jiao.

149
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
Has something happened to him?

150
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
When he left, did he tell
you where he was going?

151
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
He didn't go into specifics.

152
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,360
He just mentioned that

153
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
he was going to
find his colleague.

154
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
Have you seen these two before?

155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
No.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,280
Take a closer look.

157
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,280
Have they ever contacted
Jiao Xianglong?

158
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,800
I've never seen them come here.

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
You really haven't?

160
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,800
I really haven't.

161
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,520
Wash your face first.

162
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,800
We need to treat
your wound first.

163
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,840
Xiao Heyun.

164
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,640
I know this is a
huge shock to you.

165
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,520
But you need to calm down.

166
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
Shiqing, I killed someone.

167
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I killed someone.

168
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,320
It's not your fault.

169
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,080
It's really not your fault.

170
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,480
When I was grabbing the pot,

171
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,040
I even thought that I
might do the same thing.

172
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,760
And you have to know that

173
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,200
she's the one
blowing up the bus.

174
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,520
From the moment she got
onto the bus with the bomb,

175
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,520
she was ready to die.

176
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,880
I would rather get blown
up than kill others.

177
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,640
I don't want to kill anyone.

178
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,560
I know this sounds
harsh right now,

179
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,480
but you really
have to get a grip.

180
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,960
The police will find
us at any moment.

181
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,480
There's no time.

182
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Get up.

183
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Mr. Zhang.

184
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,800
I'm at Building 15.

185
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,960
We can cover the four
adjacent buildings.

186
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,960
<i>Okay, don't stand out too much.</i>

187
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,080
<i>We don't know if
they're still together.</i>

188
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,840
<i>- Got it?</i>
- Yes, Mr. Zhang.

189
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Luo Jin.

190
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
Those two suspects fled
to this neighborhood.

191
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,920
You two, guard the
entrance and exit.

192
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,856
Remember, don't approach
hastily when you see them.

193
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
Keep in touch.

194
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,520
Okay. Jiang Feng,
here's a walkie-talkie.

195
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,120
Mr. Jiang, do you have
any more questions?

196
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,600
Who does Jiao Xiangrong know?

197
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,200
And what is his
source of income?

198
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,200
Mr. Jiao is a good guy.

199
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,640
He said that their
construction site was shut down

200
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
due to an accident.

201
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,760
He has been job-searching.

202
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,160
He also told me

203
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
that his colleague was heroic

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
and got a 20,000-yuan bonus.

205
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
When we had a garage fire,

206
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
everyone else ran away.

207
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
He was the only one
who rushed forward.

208
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,400
I think he was after
some award money too.

209
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
- A garage fire?
- Yes.

210
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,040
The one in Unit 8.

211
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,760
It was also a tenant.

212
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
A really weird woman.

213
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,520
I don't know what she
was doing in the garage.

214
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,960
Anyway, there was a fire.

215
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
I heard them say that

216
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
there was a blast
before the fire.

217
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
A blast?

218
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
That's right!

219
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,760
The photo you showed me earlier?

220
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,160
It was Mr. Jiao and that woman.

221
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Because of her,

222
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,760
we have these fire inspections.

223
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,200
Is this her?

224
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,320
Yes, that's her.

225
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,160
She's called…

226
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Tao Yinghong.

227
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
- Take me there now.
- Okay, this way.

228
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,400
What's going on?
It's quite alarming.

229
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,200
Ms. Du.

230
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
We've located Li Shiqing's
and Xiao Heyun's phones.

231
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
They are together.

232
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,960
Send it to Mr. Zhang.

233
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Okay.

234
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,720
Mr. Zhang, our men have secured
every entrance and exit.

235
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,720
We can reel it in.

236
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,280
We have to move quickly.

237
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,960
This neighborhood is very
complex, so be careful.

238
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

239
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Their current location.

240
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,960
They are behind that building.

241
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,320
- You two cover that intersection.
- Okay.

242
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,960
- You two, go that way.
- Okay.

243
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,880
The rest, follow me.

244
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

245
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Xiaoren.

246
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Bring someone over there.

247
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,600
- Okay. Let's go.
- Come on.

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Ms. Zhang.

249
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
You seem busy.

250
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,520
Mr. Jiang.

251
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,760
This is the garage.

252
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
It's locked.

253
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,560
I don't have the key either.

254
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,839
I wonder if they have
anyone home right now.

255
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,359
- I'll go take a look.
- Ms. Yu.

256
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,640
You don't have to go.

257
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,080
Have your office issue a notice.

258
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
No one is allowed near
this garage or her home.

259
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,120
We'll request permission
to open it up right away.

260
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,040
Ms. Yu.

261
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,880
I need to know the
basics about her family.

262
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,480
- I'll call the office.
- Okay.

263
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

264
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,040
<i>I've sent you their
latest location.</i>

265
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Hold on.

266
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,840
I'll be right there.

267
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,760
Ms. Yu.

268
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,720
Don't let anyone
near this garage.

269
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,840
Okay.

270
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Hello?

271
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,160
Hold on.

272
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,520
It's too crowded here. Let's go.

273
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,440
There are too many people.

274
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
You don't have to hide.

275
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,360
You didn't kill anyone.

276
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
You will be okay.

277
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,560
Xiao Heyun.

278
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
The target is moving quickly.

279
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,320
Get the cars! Move out!

280
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

281
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,640
The police are
here to arrest me.

282
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
Why do you have to follow me?

283
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,720
There are cameras everywhere.

284
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,840
We won't get away.

285
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm going wherever you're going.

286
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
A murder.

287
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
An explosion.

288
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,680
And then fleeing.

289
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,440
Everyone is going to think
I did the whole thing.

290
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,360
I can't explain it all away.

291
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,640
The time didn't move up.

292
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,480
The time loop is
over and so am I.

293
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,040
But in the last loop,

294
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,920
the time had stopped moving up.

295
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,760
But we still came back.

296
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,560
That's why these two points

297
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,320
have no direct correlation.

298
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,120
The time didn't move up.

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,480
That's because this is when
the bomb got on the bus.

300
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,880
That means we're right at the
starting point of this whole thing.

301
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,680
If the police find us,

302
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,000
you should tell them this.

303
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,440
You were my hostage.

304
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Do you understand?

305
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,080
We were clearly holding hands
when we got off the bus.

306
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,760
- The police won't believe it.
- The police will believe it!

307
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,520
You don't need to
be implicated. You…

308
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,240
Why do you have to push me away?

309
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,920
We face things
together, don't we?

310
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,200
Why do you have to say
such discouraging words?

311
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,760
Shouldn't we be

312
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,800
finding a place to sleep

313
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,760
and enter the next loop?

314
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,520
Once we're in the next loop, we
can make up for our mistakes.

315
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,080
It will be a clean slate.

316
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,520
The time loop isn't
important to me anymore.

317
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,080
Others can start anew because
of the time loop, but us?

318
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,760
What has happened
has already happened.

319
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,680
My memory of murder

320
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,800
won't be erased
in the next loop!

321
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
I will remember it.

322
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,200
You will also remember it.

323
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
Then at the time,

324
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,240
why did you rush
back onto the bus?

325
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,840
Didn't you already
decide to get off?

326
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,600
And you were already outside.

327
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,520
Jiao Xiangrong is
righteous and courageous?

328
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,040
He has a simple social network.

329
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,160
He has nothing to do with
these two young people.

330
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,880
He just lost his job and income.

331
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,840
He heard heroic actions
can receive cash awards.

332
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,840
So we can't rule out
that possibility.

333
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,840
By the way,

334
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,600
I found out that there was another
passenger named Tao Yinghong.

335
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,640
She got on at Gangwu
New Village too.

336
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,040
A fire started in her
garage a while ago.

337
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,240
When the fire happened,

338
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,000
residents heard what
sounded like a blast.

339
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,280
- A blast?
- Yes.

340
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,560
I have people looking into it.

341
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
The target has stopped.

342
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,840
Head north onto
Chaquan South Road.

343
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Okay.

344
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,040
SPORTS MODE ENABLED

345
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,240
I don't want her
to hurt you again.

346
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,800
I don't want my incompetence
to be the reason

347
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,720
I can't protect others.

348
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
I wanted to stop her evil deeds.

349
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,760
Now I'm a bad guy too.

350
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,520
No matter what,

351
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,000
I'll be with you.

352
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,240
The target has stopped.

353
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,640
This is the location
of the coordinates.

354
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Why have we stopped?

355
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,080
Isn't this where
Lu Di's place is?

356
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
What are you doing?

357
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,920
I'm talking to you! Why
were you in my truck?

358
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
What do we do now?

359
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,920
We don't have a phone or cash.

360
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,400
I wonder if Lu Di's place
has anything to treat wounds.

361
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
This is it.

362
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,240
The time was 3:40 p.m.

363
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Target locked.

364
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,240
View the section near
the middle of the road.

365
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Okay.

366
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,080
CHAQU SOUTH ROAD

367
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,360
CHAQU SOUTH ROAD

368
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,080
CHAQU SOUTH ROAD

369
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,520
CHAQU SOUTH ROAD

370
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,800
This was the only vehicle.

371
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,080
Although they are not visible,

372
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,600
they should be in there.

373
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
Copy the plate number
and call the driver.

374
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,080
Keep following this car.

375
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Got it.

376
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,800
JIA A52700

377
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,920
<i>Hello. Please enter.</i>

378
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,320
Are you okay? Do you need help?

379
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
No.

380
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,960
Drink some water.

381
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Hello?

382
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,200
Yes, that's me.

383
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,760
Xiao Heyun.

384
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,040
There isn't a first aid kit,

385
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,520
but I found a piggy bank.

386
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,640
I'm going to the pharmacy.

387
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't go. There
are CCTVs outside.

388
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,920
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

389
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,320
There's a pharmacy
right where we got off.

390
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,840
It will get infected.

391
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
GAUZE BANDAGE

392
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,600
<i>-Around 1:35 p.m.

00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,720
<i>-at the Yanjiang East

394
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,000
<i>A major crime occurred.</i>

<i>Two passengers aboard a Route

<i>The police are doing everything

401
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,720
- How are you paying?
<i>- Citizens are asked</i>

402
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,560
<i>to provide police with
any relevant information.</i>

403
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,080
<i>- The suspect is Xiao Heyun. Male.</i>

- I'm sorry.

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,520
<i>Li Shiqing. Female.</i>

408
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,080
<i>- 20. From Jiaodao, Jiangbei Province.
</i>- Do you sell melatonin?

409
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,480

- Over there.

410
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,160
<i>200280199809298675.</i>

411
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,080
I was concentrating on driving.

412
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,720
I didn't know when they
got onto my vehicle.

413
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,400
I had parked here

414
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,040
and was about to unload.

415
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,200
I walked around the vehicle

416
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,080
and those two jumped off.

417
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,720
They startled me.

418
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,320
The boy was tall and slim.

419
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,920
But there was blood on him.

420
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,040
I saw it.

421
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,960
The girl wasn't tall.

422
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,480
She was quite pretty.

423
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,480
Those two…

424
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,480
Yes, the bag!

425
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,160
They left a bag in my vehicle.

426
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,680
The blood was all
over my sculptures.

427
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,000
- I…
- Take a look.

428
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Was it these two?

429
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,840
Yes, that's them.
That's definitely them.

430
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,800
Are you sure they went that way?

431
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,120
Yes, after they got down,
they went towards the back.

432
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,240
- In that direction.
- Okay, thank you.

433
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,280
<i>What happened?</i>

434
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,639
<i>Someone died.</i>

435
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,800
<i>There has been a murder!</i>

436
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,960
<i>Murder!</i>

437
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,200
<i>- Call the police!
- A murder!</i>

438
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,679
<i>Call the hospital! Hurry!</i>

439
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,360
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

440
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,840
<i>Hello. Please enter.</i>

441
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,040
The police are here.

442
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,639
We need to get out of here.

443
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,600
You need to get changed too.

444
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,679
These two are very unusual.

445
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,360
Someone must have seen them.

446
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,280
They might stick out elsewhere,

447
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,280
but they look
normal enough here.

448
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
This one.

449
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,199
In their eyes,

450
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,720
I'm a terrorist now.

451
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,800
I saw it too.

452
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,960
We got rid of our phones
and avoided the cameras.

453
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,520
They can still find us.

454
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,080
It's impossible to
evade the police.

455
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,480
But if we go to
the police station,

456
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,040
we can't explain it clearly.

457
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
And with the way
things are going,

458
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,640
I'm sure we'll have a harsher
interrogation than before.

459
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,240
Ma'am, let me ask you something.

460
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,400
What is it?

461
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,920
Have you seen two people
dressed like this?

462
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Yes.

463
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,360
Look carefully.

464
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,680
Yes, it's those two.

465
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,000
When? Where?

466
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,640
Right here.

467
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,920
I was cleaning just now.

468
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,880
Those two entered
as I was coming out.

469
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,280
Are those shops
or homes in there?

470
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Both.

471
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,880
There are two
households in there.

472
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,040
There are residents inside.

473
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,680
Thank you. Let's go.

474
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,720
Xiaoyuan.

475
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,480
Take some men and check if there
are any other exits or entrances.

476
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Okay.

477
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,640
- Jiang Feng.
- Mr. Zhang.

478
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,560
Make arrangements.

479
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,880
Put someone at the door.

480
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,240
Take some men and go in with me.

481
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,440
Copy that.

482
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Let's go.

483
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,040
<i>If the information revealed by
this mysterious individual is true,</i>

484
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
<i>this bomber on the bus</i>

485
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,200
<i>is a game designer in real life.</i>

486
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,040
<i>Then we're all set.</i>

487
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,400
<i>We can follow the clues.</i>

488
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,640
You four, go down.

489
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
- Okay.
- Got it.

490
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,920
<i>Through the game
review just now,</i>

491
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,240
<i>we can see that</i>

492
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,600
<i>it must have been
created by this bomber.</i>

493
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,160
<i>Allegedly,</i>

494
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,400
<i>there is a rumor.</i>

495
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,120
<i>At the beginning of its design,</i>

496
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,360
<i>his game was filled</i>

497
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,200
<i>with elements of
violence and blood.</i>

498
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,880
<i>That's why it never
passed the inspection.</i>

499
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,640
<i>Later on,</i>

500
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,640
<i>from stills of the game</i>

501
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,680
<i>provided by the game company,</i>

502
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,560
<i>we can still see</i>

503
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,760
<i>a lot of violence and
blood in the game.</i>

504
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,360
- Don't listen to those people.
<i>- I believe this game's creator</i>

505
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,840
- There's no point in watching these.
<i>- Has blurred the line</i>

506
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,200
<i>- between real life and virtual life.</i>
- It'll only make things harder for you.

507
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,480
<i>When he concocted the bombing,</i>

508
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,280
<i>he thought he was
still in the game.</i>

509
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,840
The people on the Internet

510
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,560
judge others based on
their own cognitive scopes

511
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,840
and moral standards.

512
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,560
They only believe what they see.

513
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,280
Very few truly put themselves
in someone else's shoes.

514
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,720
Not to mention our
current situation

515
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,360
is pretty hard to understand.

516
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,640
Forget it.

517
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,280
Anyway,

518
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,040
we now know who the killer is.

519
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,640
That's our biggest gain.

520
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,200
It's safe here.

521
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,560
Wait for me in standby mode.

522
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,040
What about you?
Where are you going?
