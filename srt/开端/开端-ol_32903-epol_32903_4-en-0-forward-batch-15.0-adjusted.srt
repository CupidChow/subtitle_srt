1
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,560
- Are you nervous?
- No!

2
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Keep it down.

3
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Okay.

4
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,040
It's your first time
out in the field.

5
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Be observant.

6
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Look at how others do it.

7
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,320
I got it.

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,280
Don't act furtively
either. Just be normal.

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,680
Keep your eyes open.

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Yes.

11
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,216
Give me one of your
Chinese crullers.

12
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,080
What are you looking
at? Let's go.

13
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,160
Stop!

14
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Are you okay?

15
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Your hand.

16
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Come on.

17
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,000
<i>The bus is moving.
Please hold on tight.</i>

18
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,720
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>

19
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,440
1:35 P.M., MAY 9TH, THURSDAY

20
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Are you okay?

21
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,641
- Your concerns were right.
- Are we really doing nothing?

22
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
I'm sorry, I…

23
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

24
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
I wasn't right either.

25
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,200
It's true that I didn't
trust you before.

26
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
I even suspected you.

27
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Then just let it pass.

28
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Let's not talk about it.

29
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,680
Are you okay? You were
sweating a lot just now.

30
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,160
I was locked up in that
dark room for too long.

31
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,040
I couldn't take it
anymore, so I fell asleep.

32
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
I fell asleep too.

33
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
So that means…

34
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,960
we go back into the time
loop once we fall asleep?

35
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,600
I think so too.

36
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,920
I got a very important
piece of information.

37
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,920
The police have confirmed that
there was a bomb on the bus.

38
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,320
Mr. Zhang reminded
me of something too.

39
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
He asked me if I knew
there was a bomb,

40
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,160
why didn't I tell the
driver and the passengers

41
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,440
and have them get off the bus?

42
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
We were in such a hurry that
we didn't think of this.

43
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,960
We've already tried it before.

44
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,280
We said an accident would
happen, but no one believed us.

45
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,520
An accident and a bomb on the bus
will evoke different reactions.

46
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,440
Sir, stop the bus!

47
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,720
There's a bomb on the bus!

48
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,560
Someone set it off.

49
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,800
That person is on the bus.

50
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,720
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

51
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,920
Are you looking for the bomb?

52
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,480
Watch what you say from now on.

53
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I got it. I know.

54
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,160
We don't know how
it's detonated,

55
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,560
so we have to find…

56
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,680
it first.

57
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,040
If he planted it on
the bus in advance,

58
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
then there's nothing we can do.

59
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,760
But let's say he brought it

60
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,640
on the bus.

61
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,600
Something so powerful
must be in a bag.

62
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,040
So we can rule out
the two at the front.

63
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,320
They don't even have bags.

64
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,040
In the previous loops, these two

65
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
always had their
eyes on their bags.

66
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,160
This lady…

67
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,440
I think we can
rule out the lady.

68
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,440
Her bag was full of
medication. Do you remember?

69
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
That person…

70
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
There is a red bag at her feet.

71
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
What about the guy
in the last row?

72
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,960
Was there someone
in the last row?

73
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

74
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,440
It was a guy with a hat and a
mask. He was really strange.

75
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,640
He was dressed all in black.

76
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,440
Right. There was one.

77
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,600
When I saw him, I
thought it was strange.

78
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,760
Why was he covered up so
tightly in this hot weather?

79
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Right?

80
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,720
Where did he go?

81
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,440
"Next stop, Yanjiang East Road."

82
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,200
He hasn't gotten on the bus yet.

83
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,120
The time moved up again.

84
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,440
Does that mean we can simply
get off at the next stop?

85
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Yes.

86
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
What's wrong?

87
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,200
I want to find that ringtone.

88
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Whenever the bus
explodes on the bridge,

89
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
the ringtone goes off.

90
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,960
If it really has to do with…

91
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
that thing,

92
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,440
that person will
definitely react to it

93
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,920
when he hears it.

94
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
That makes sense.

95
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,840
<i>We've arrived at
Yanjiang East Road.</i>

96
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,840
<i>Please exit through the rear door.
Please tap your card when exiting.</i>

97
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,056
<i>- Please mind the doors.</i>
- It could've just been someone's phone.

98
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Let's get off first.

99
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,920
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

100
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
What's going on?

101
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
I want to make a report.

102
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,920
There's a bomb on
the Route 45 bus.

103
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
The license plate is Jia A77651.

104
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,160
The bus just left
Yanjiang East Road.

105
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,176
It is about to cross the
river-crossing bridge now.

106
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,800
The bomber is on the bus.
He is among the passengers.

107
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,016
My name is Li Shiqing. You
can contact me on this number.

108
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
Please believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

109
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
There's no time to waste.
You have to act now.

110
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,560
POLICE

111
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I got it.

112
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,560
Understood.

113
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP

114
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,240
- Xiao Heyun.
- Don't say my name.

115
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
What are you doing?

116
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,240
Keep a distance from me.

117
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Act natural.

118
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,600
- Why?
- So…

119
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,120
I'll find a place
with fewer people.

120
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,480
Just follow me.

121
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,960
There aren't many people or
surveillance cameras here.

122
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Hold on.

123
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
Why do you keep
avoiding the cameras?

124
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
Why did you call
the police again?

125
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,720
Of course I have
to call the police.

126
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,240
If there's nothing we can do,

127
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,520
then shouldn't we inform
the police to act quickly?

128
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,200
I don't want to go back
to the police station.

129
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,536
It doesn't matter even
if you don't want to.

130
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,496
It's only a matter of time
before we get called in.

131
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,400
We got off at a bus
stop normally this time.

132
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,840
If you don't call the police,

133
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,560
they won't suspect us at all.

134
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm not blaming you.

135
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
We got off at a
bus stop this time.

136
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,000
This has never happened before.

137
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,640
This changes the
situation entirely.

138
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,520
We have plenty of time to
figure the situation out.

139
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,176
Then we can decide how
we're going to do this.

140
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,856
If you call the police
right after we get off,

141
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,000
we'll get questioned and
won't be able to do anything.

142
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,080
Besides, have you
thought about this?

143
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,200
What if getting off
the bus normally

144
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,880
is a way out of the time loop?

145
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,480
What if this is the last loop?

146
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,880
The last loop?

147
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,640
If this is the last loop,

148
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,280
isn't this the last chance for
those people on the bus to live?

149
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,880
That's all the more
reason to call the police.

150
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,440
But we already called
the police before.

151
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,720
The police can't make
it in such a short time.

152
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,120
The last time I called the
police, I was inexperienced,

153
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
so it wasted too much time.

154
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,080
But it's different this time.

155
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,480
The police have
more time to act.

156
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,160
Also, we got more information.

157
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,680
What information?

158
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,440
We don't know where the bomb is.

159
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,920
We don't know who's
controlling it.

160
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,480
What do we tell the police?

161
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,336
Do we say it's because
of the time loop again?

162
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,600
If we can't even explain things clearly,
how can we assist with the investigation?

163
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Yes.

164
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,720
You're right. I didn't
think it through.

165
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
But I didn't think
much at the time.

166
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,760
I just want to save them.

167
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,320
When I was in the hospital,

168
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,800
I witnessed
resuscitation attempts.

169
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
It was so tragic.

170
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,040
You just witnessed it.

171
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,281
I've been through resuscitation.
I know how painful it is.

172
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,280
But you can't save people
simply with a kind heart.

173
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,079
We have to think.

174
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,240
Besides, who are
we to save anyone?

175
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,599
In many of the loops,

176
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,240
we were corpses ourselves.

177
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,600
If the people on the
bus are destined to die,

178
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,080
perhaps this chance to escape

179
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,120
is God helping us.

180
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,120
We have to cherish
the opportunity.

181
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,560
We are not murderers.

182
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,520
There's no need to feel guilty

183
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,920
because of these people
on the bus, right?

184
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
Kindness is not a cheap virtue.

185
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
It has to match your ability.

186
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Otherwise, it just
causes more trouble.

187
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,240
I…

188
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,360
It's nothing personal. It's…

189
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,640
You can see the
bridge from there.

190
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,880
Maybe the police can make it.

191
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm sorry.

192
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
I was too harsh just now.

193
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,080
I just wanted to say

194
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,000
that we should discuss
things together.

195
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
You hid so well just now.

196
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Didn't you already
decide to run away?

197
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,200
I didn't think that much.

198
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
I just feel like

199
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,361
if we both go to the police
station, we'll be too passive.

200
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,040
This is what I was thinking.

201
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
Since we were able to get
off at a bus stop normally,

202
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,240
let's get through
this whole day first

203
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,440
and collect more clues.

204
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,280
Doesn't the time loop
move up every time?

205
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,080
Let's just wait until it's early enough
for the police to stop the explosion.

206
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,240
Then we'll call the police.

207
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
This way, we can cooperate
with the police effectively

208
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,840
and avoid dying
over and over again.

209
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,320
Moreover, we won't be locked up.

210
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,560
If the time loop
does keep moving up,

211
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,480
I'll still get on the bus
at the University Town stop.

212
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,160
But what about you?

213
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,560
Will you still get on?

214
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,560
My gosh.

215
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
Don't worry. You don't have
to go to the police station.

216
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,960
I trust the police.

217
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,160
They'll be in time to
stop the explosion.

218
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,040
POLICE

219
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,960
Mr. Zhang.

220
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,400
As per the arranged plan,

221
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,840
we have full control of
both ends of the bridge.

222
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,760
Where is Jiang Feng?

223
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,640
Mr. Jiang has taken some
of the traffic police

224
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
to the intercept point.

225
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,320
POLICE

226
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,240
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

227
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
What's happening?

228
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,000
Sir, open the door.

229
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,640
Everyone,

230
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,120
there's an accident up ahead.

231
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,280
The bus can't get through.

232
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,280
You can get off
and leave on foot.

233
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,200
What's happening?

234
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,760
Is there a backup on the bridge?

235
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,080
How long will it take?

236
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,280
I have something to do.

237
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,720
It will take at least an hour.

238
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
That's too long.

239
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
I have something to do at home.

240
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,880
Sir, please open the door.

241
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
- We're getting off.
- Everyone, get off, but leave your stuff.

242
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,560
- Stay still!
- Stay still!

243
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,640
Stay still!

244
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Jiang Feng.

245
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,840
Do you read me?

246
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,880
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE, 1,500 M

247
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,280
Jiang Feng.

248
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,520
Do you read me?

249
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
You should go.

250
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,880
I'll explain everything
to the police.

251
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,280
I won't mention you.

252
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,120
What are you going
to tell the police?

253
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,520
I've been interrogated
twice. I know what to say.

254
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,440
Anyway, I won't mention you.

255
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,320
You hid pretty well just now.

256
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,240
I don't think
they'll suspect you.

257
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,200
You're right.

258
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,200
There's indeed no point
to implicate both of us.

259
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,000
Besides, this was my own
problem in the first place.

260
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,960
Whatever the result is,
I should bear it alone.

261
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
Yes, I'm Li Shiqing.

262
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,360
I'm at Little West Lake Park.

263
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,240
Okay, I'll wait for
you at the entrance.

264
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
Can't you discuss things
before you do something?

265
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,760
I already called the
police. What else can I do?

266
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,040
The police will be here soon.

267
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,720
Don't rush to go out. Hide
in the park for a while.

268
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,440
If this really is the last loop,

269
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,640
I'll take responsibility
for what I've done myself.

270
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,320
This has nothing to do with whether
this is the last time or not.

271
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,080
It's even better if
it's not the last time.

272
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,336
From now on, you can just get
off at the next stop normally

273
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,880
and live your regular life.

274
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,040
How can I have a
regular life again?

275
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,440
Every day, when I open my eyes, I'll
see you sending yourself to death.

276
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,200
Do I just ignore that
and go to my meeting?

277
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,800
At least you won't
die in the explosion.

278
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,600
It's better than the
passengers who get blown up.

279
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,760
The passengers
don't know anything.

280
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,800
Death just happens in a moment.

281
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,440
They can't even feel the pain.

282
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
But what about us?

283
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
We have to face fear.

284
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,080
Is it wrong to be
afraid of death?

285
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,256
Isn't it human nature to
seek benefits and evade harm?

286
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,240
Just because I can't be
as kind as you, does that…

287
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,360
Does that make me evil?

288
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,600
Wait. Give me your number.

289
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,800
In case anything happens.

290
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,280
I'll be fine.

291
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,680
- Give me your number.
- 13959288109.

292
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,880
We're the municipal police.

293
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Are you Li Shiqing?

294
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,200
Get in the car.

295
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
Hello. How are things?

296
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,680
Is there no chance
of saving him at all?

297
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Okay, I got it.

298
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,080
LIU PENG

299
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,640
LIU PENG

300
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Hello.

301
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,720
<i>Where are you?</i>

302
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,400
You're there, right?

303
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,920
Why don't you talk to them?

304
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
<i>I asked you where you are.</i>

305
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,560
I haven't crossed
the bridge yet.

306
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
There was an accident
on the bridge.

307
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,040
<i>Can't you hail a taxi
and take a detour?</i>

308
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,320
I can't get a taxi now.

309
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,760
<i>Xiao Heyun, their
top boss is here.</i>

310
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
<i>They are very sincere.</i>

311
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,400
<i>Hurry and think of
a way to get here.</i>

312
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,480
<i>I can explain to
them why you're late.</i>

313
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,280
<i>But you designed this game.</i>

314
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,120
<i>You have to be here no
matter what. Hurry up.</i>

315
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
I…

316
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,640
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- What happened?

317
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,320
- I think there was an explosion.
- Did it explode?

318
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,400
- Someone died.
- A lot of people died.

319
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
- My goodness.
- On the bridge…

320
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,720
You saw it too, right?

321
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,840
The terrorists set off the bomb
in the middle of the bridge.

322
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,720
Are you kidding me?

323
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,560
How could there be
terrorists in China?

324
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,320
- I have something urgent to do.
- Right?

325
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm late now.

326
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,200
The call she made was
the police report.

327
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,560
The timing matches.

328
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,040
Who is the guy that
got off with her?

329
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,080
We're still pulling up CCTV footage to
look for people she interacted with.

330
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,600
- Verify this man's identity.
- I got it.

331
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,200
Xiao Heyun, where are you?
I'm at the big staircase.

332
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,840
- Hello?
- I…

333
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Hello?

334
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Hello?

335
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Hello? Xiao Heyun?

336
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Xiao Heyun!

337
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,800
Xiao Heyun, I know
what you're thinking.

338
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,520
You've been hesitating
for a month.

339
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,360
It's just deleting
the violent settings.

340
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,280
I just don't get it.

341
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,480
What's so bad about a game
being a little violent?

342
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,080
How many times have I told you?

343
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,400
With violent settings,
it won't sell.

344
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,976
If it doesn't sell and
no one invests in it,

345
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,360
we really can't do this game
anymore. Do you understand?

346
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,080
Hide!

347
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,920
Good for you! Just keep hiding!

348
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,520
If this is the last loop,

349
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,120
isn't this the last chance for
those people on the bus to live?

350
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,440
DIGITAL PLAZA

351
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,360
When I was in the hospital,

352
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,840
I witnessed
resuscitation attempts.

353
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
It was so tragic.

354
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,760
If the time loop
continues to move up,

355
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,400
I will get on the bus at
the University Town stop.

356
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,280
But what about you?

357
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,520
Will you still get on?

358
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,000
JIALIN RIVER-CROSSING
BRIDGE BUS EXPLOSION

359
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,480
LATEST EXPLOSION INCIDENT

360
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,520
LATEST EXPLOSION NEWS

361
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,280
ON MAY 9TH AT 1:45
P.M., A BUS EXPLODED

362
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,600
A BUS IN JIALIN EXPLODED, A BLACK
BOX RECORDS THE TERRIFYING MOMENT

363
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,480
A ROUTE 45 BUS EXPLODES
ON A BRIDGE IN JIALIN

364
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,160
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES
IS STILL UNKNOWN.

365
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,400
THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS
STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.

366
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,496
THE DRIVER USED A
LIGHTER TO HAVE A SMOKE,

367
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,640
BUT IT ACCIDENTALLY EXPLODED

368
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,320
JIANG FENG, BRAVELY SACRIFICED

369
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,120
- About Jiang Feng...
- Is she the one who called the police?

370
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,960
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

371
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
Here's the information.

372
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,040
We interrogated her
for almost two hours.

373
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,040
All she talked about
was a time loop.

374
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,520
Did you know her before?

375
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,320
No. I don't remember her.

376
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,360
What did she say?

377
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
A time loop?

378
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,400
She's stuck in a
time loop on the bus?

379
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,320
It sounds crazy,

380
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,840
but she insists on her story.

381
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,000
Moreover, she's not alone.

382
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,920
She seems to be very concerned

383
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,000
about whether the
police dispatched.

384
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,120
That's what's suspicious.

385
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,400
She is very concerned,
especially about you.

386
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
She said that she saw
you and Jiang Feng

387
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,880
in a previous loop,

388
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,640
but not this time.

389
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,440
That's why I asked
if you knew her.

390
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,720
Also, there's something
else that's strange.

391
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,400
Our task force was just formed.

392
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,840
How does she know about
you and Jiang Feng?

393
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,920
Mr. Zhang.

394
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,840
I HAVE READ THE ABOVE TRANSCRIPT

395
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,560
AND IT IS A TRUE
COPY OF MY STATEMENT.

396
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Li Shiqing.

397
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,360
I read your statement.

398
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,480
I got the gist

399
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,440
of the time loop you mentioned.

400
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,840
In your statement,

401
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
I see that you said this twice.

402
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,800
"Why don't I see
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Jiang?"

403
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,800
Is that right?

404
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,440
How did you know they would
take part in this operation?

405
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,480
Because every time the police took
action, you both would be there.

406
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,800
But I didn't see you this time.

407
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,000
I thought something
happened to you.

408
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,480
We indeed

409
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,080
lost an officer.

410
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,560
Is it Mr. Jiang?

411
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm sorry.

412
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
I'm sorry.

413
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,240
Why do you say that?

414
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,520
I called the police.

415
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,080
That's why Mr. Jiang died.

416
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
You were right to
call the police.

417
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,600
It's because you
called the police

418
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,960
that we were able to plan ahead

419
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,680
and stop the bus on the
river-crossing bridge.

420
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Li Shiqing.

421
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,176
Calling the police right
away in an emergency

422
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
is the duty of every citizen.

423
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,280
Cooperating with the police

424
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
after the accident

425
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,080
and telling the truth

426
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,560
is also the duty
of every caller.

427
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Do you understand?

428
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,080
I told the truth.

429
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,280
But no matter what I say,
whether I tell the truth or not,

430
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,400
you guys won't believe me.

431
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm really at my wits' end.

432
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,200
I don't know what to do.

433
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,080
Li Shiqing.

434
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,880
I have a few more
questions for you.

435
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,880
After you called the police,

436
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,400
you turned off your
phone right away.

437
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,080
Why?

438
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,880
I wanted you guys to
dispatch immediately

439
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,520
and not waste time
questioning me on the phone.

440
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,720
It's because there
really wasn't any time.

441
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,680
After you turned off your phone,

442
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,600
as you were leaving
the bus stop,

443
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,240
you were mumbling.

444
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,720
Were you talking to yourself?

445
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Or…

446
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,600
Were you talking
to someone else?

447
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
Do you not remember?

448
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,680
Do you know this boy?

449
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,880
YANJIANG EAST ROAD STOP, JIALIN

450
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,080
UNKNOWN NUMBER

451
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,960
Track this number and verify
the caller's identity.

452
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,800
Answer it. I'll
put it on speaker.

453
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,200
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

454
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,920
<i>Li Shiqing.</i>

455
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
Who is it?

456
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
<i>It's Xiao Heyun.</i>

457
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,080
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

458
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,520
Are you still there?

459
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,200
We've broken up.
Don't call me again.

460
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Go to sleep.

461
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,440
You'll be fine

462
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,600
after some sleep.

463
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,760
