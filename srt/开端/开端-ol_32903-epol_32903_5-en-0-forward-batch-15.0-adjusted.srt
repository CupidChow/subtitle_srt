1
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,680
Hello?

2
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
Li Shiqing?

3
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040
Are you still there?

4
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
We've broken up. Don't call me again.

5
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Go to sleep.

6
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,400
You'll be fine

7
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
after some sleep.

8
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,400
Ms. Du, Mr. Zhang.

9
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,120
When we arrested Li Shiqing,

10
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,440
this man was there too.

11
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,600
He was the one at Yanjiang East Road stop.

12
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,080
LITTLE WEST LAKE PARK, NORTHWEST GATE

13
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Ms. Du, Mr. Zhang.

14
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,440
It's confirmed.

15
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,920
The number belongs to Xiao Heyun.

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
That's the guy in the video.

17
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,480
Ye Qian, tidy up the place.

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,760
Xiaoliu, let's go
to the interrogation room.

19
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,720
Hello, is there a drugstore nearby?

20
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,680
I don't know. Look it up yourself.

21
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
Mr. Zhang, his phone is off.

22
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,320
Head to where the signal vanished.

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Have the provider locate him again.

24
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay.

25
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Sir.

26
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,760
Are there any drugstores nearby?

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Drugstores?

28
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,080
It's just around the corner.

29
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,760
Okay, thank you.

30
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
You guys, take the back door.

31
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,400
-Okay.
-Come on.

32
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,760
LIAN FU TANG DRUGSTORE

33
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,279
Hello. I want a bottle of sleeping pills.

34
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,280
Do you have a prescription?

35
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,280
What prescription?

36
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,640
Sleeping pills have to be prescribed
by a hospital.

37
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
Every place will require a prescription.

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,280
Right, I have melatonin.

39
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,200
It can also help you sleep.

40
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,280
This.

41
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
Does this work?

42
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,320
Buy it first.

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,920
Go home and try it. Avoid the light.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
It will work in half an hour.

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,960
Okay. How much is it?

46
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
It's 49 yuan.

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
The QR code is over there.

48
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,240
The QR code is here.

49
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,840
He arrived around 3 p.m.

50
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
Then he spent the whole afternoon here.

51
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,360
He was sitting right here.

52
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,160
You came as soon as he left.

53
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,120
He had asked me
where he could find a drugstore.

54
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
I was playing a game at the time.

55
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,200
-I--
-Mr. Zhang, his phone is back on.

56
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
He's about 700 m west.

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
TARGET'S LOCATION

58
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,800
-Come on.
-Okay.

59
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,680
Sir.

60
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,520
Do you have liquor
with a high alcohol content?

61
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,520
Yes.

62
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
LIAN FU TANG DRUGSTORE

63
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,640
-It's 35 yuan.
-Okay.

64
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,520
Officer, the kid was being so sneaky.

65
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,920
He just seemed suspicious to me.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
He didn't want to pay.

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
I kept my eyes on him.

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,240
I saw him go to the supermarket
across the street.

69
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,200
-Thank you.
-No problem.

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,600
"You'll be fine after some sleep."

71
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,240
I guess he wanted to comfort me.

72
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,320
Because for us,

73
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
after a good night's sleep,

74
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,920
we wake up to a brand-new start.

75
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,480
But it is my fault this time.

76
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I never thought that

77
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,120
calling the police
would lead to Mr. Jiang's accident.

78
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,160
In fact, I'm glad he's here.

79
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,040
It is such a horrible situation.

80
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,400
<i>If I were alone,</i>

81
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,520
<i>I really would go crazy.</i>

82
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,440
INTERROGATION ROOM 2

83
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Prepare a drug test.

84
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,440
Okay.

85
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,240
Unbelievable. He drank the whole bottle.

86
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,040
You got melatonin and alcohol.

87
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,000
Are you trying to kill yourself?

88
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,400
Don't touch me.

89
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,280
I don't want to go back
to the police station.

90
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
I don't want to return to that dark room.

91
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,480
There isn't even a window.

92
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,120
I don't want to go back there.

93
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,080
What did you say?

94
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,480
You don't want to go back to the station?

95
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,440
Have you been there before?

96
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Mr. Zhang.

97
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,960
Why did you send the police?

98
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,120
You're not in the time loop!

99
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,960
Why did you send the police?

100
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,920
Police lives matter too.

101
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,680
How could you believe
in Li Shiqing's nonsense?

102
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,960
You guys are unbelievable.

103
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,120
Take him back.

104
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
-Are you nervous?
-No!

105
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,840
Keep it down.

106
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Okay.

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,520
It's your first time out in the field.

108
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,440
Be observant.

109
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,200
Look at how others do it.

110
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,880
I got it.

111
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,240
<i>Don't act furtively either.
Just be normal.</i>

112
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,880
<i>Xiao Heyun.</i>

113
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,600
<i>Xiao Heyun.</i>

114
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,960
Xiao Heyun.

115
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,120
Thank goodness.

116
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,840
So sleeping can really
take us back into the loop.

117
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
Are you still mad at me?

118
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
No.

119
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,560
Iâ€¦

120
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm mad at myself.

121
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,280
Mr. Jiang is dead.

122
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,680
I know.

123
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,960
I really shouldn't call the police.

124
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,520
This is a dangerous situation,
even for the police.

125
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,840
It's too risky.

126
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,160
It's all my fault.

127
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,480
But if we don't take the risk,

128
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,000
there's no way to stop the explosion.

129
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,360
You were at the police station.

130
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,960
Was it depressing?

131
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Sorry, I shouldn't have left you alone.

132
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,880
The next time we call the police,

133
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,240
you must warn the police
not to spook the culprit.

134
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,960
This criminal is very alert.

135
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
I don't want to call them.

136
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,680
You're right.

137
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,320
We don't have any concrete information
at the moment.

138
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
We can't sacrifice
any more police officers.

139
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
I'll investigate on my own.

140
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
Investigate on your own?

141
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,720
Haven't you already done that before?

142
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Observe first.

143
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,360
And look for clues.

144
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,640
Right now,

145
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,040
we have to find out
what is in their bags first.

146
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,800
We need to know where "it" is.

147
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,840
Fine, we'll look into it ourselves.

148
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
Don't mind me.

149
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,920
Just get off the bus later.

150
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm not getting off.

151
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,480
We're partners.

152
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,480
We're in this together.

153
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
<i>We've arrived at Yanjiang East Road.</i>

154
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
<i>Please exit through the rear door.</i>

155
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,240
<i>Please tap your card when exiting.</i>

156
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,600
<i>Please mind the doors.</i>

157
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,920
What's going on?

158
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,600
Are you okay?

159
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,480
<i>The bus is moving. Please hold on tight.</i>

160
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,160
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>

161
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,280
Check on him.

162
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
Do you understand?

163
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Okay.

164
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,280
Why aren't you saying anything?

165
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,800
If you don't talk, it's over between us.

166
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,920
Iâ€¦

167
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,880
don't want it to be.

168
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,320
If you don't, why do you keep angering me?

169
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,280
You get angry so easily.

170
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,920
Forget it. Let's go back.

171
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,520
Why are you so annoying?

172
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,120
I hate you.

173
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,680
Annoying!

174
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,560
-But Iâ€¦ I'm annoying.
-You're so annoying.

175
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,600
I got it.

176
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,840
Excuse me.

177
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,320
Heâ€¦

178
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,120
What is going on?

179
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,080
Stop fighting!

180
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,040
What's in your bag?

181
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,400
What is it to you?

182
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,680
-Let us see! Just a peek!
-Stop fighting!

183
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,040
Did you hear the source of the ringtone?

184
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,560
Wait.

185
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,360
You wasted too much time in the beginning.

186
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,600
I sat there for so long.

187
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,080
Why didn't you do anything?

188
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,960
I was waiting for that intersection.

189
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
The driver might slow down

190
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,319
and hit the red light if we make a scene.

191
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,560
And thenâ€¦

192
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm not good at arguments.

193
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,200
I don't know how to start.

194
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,760
You don't know how to argue?

195
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,280
You were perfectly fine at it at the park.

196
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,480
I was being reasonable.

197
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
No.

198
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,119
There's nothing to argue about though.

199
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,680
What should we do?

200
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,040
What should we do? Let's check again.

201
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,760
There must be something wrong with him.

202
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,920
This time, find a better argument.

203
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,480
Let's just drop the act.

204
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,960
Hold him down with brute force.

205
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,160
Brute force? Can you do it?

206
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,080
I was caught off guard just now.

207
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,280
He scratched me.

208
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,680
What kind of guy scratches others?

209
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
Just watch. I'll hold him down this time.

210
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,480
All right.

211
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,400
Then let's try again.

212
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,240
Just go with the flow.

213
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,120
<i>We've arrived at Yanjiang East Road.</i>

214
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
<i>Please exit through the rear door.</i>

215
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,880
What's going on?

216
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
Are you okay?

217
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,000
He's taking pictures at a time like this?

218
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,600
It can't be him, right?

219
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,400
What if he is sending information
to an accomplice?

220
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,680
I think I know how I should act.

221
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,840
What will you do?

222
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
You said you didn't want to.

223
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,640
You punk!

224
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,920
Are you filming my girlfriend?

225
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,880
Did I say you could?

226
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
-Did I say you could? Did you film her?
-No, I didn't!

227
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,240
No? What are you hiding? You look guilty!

228
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,160
-You aimed it at her.
-Don't be ridiculous!

229
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,640
What are you doing? Don't you run!

230
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,840
Just leave it.

231
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,040
Leave it? He's a douche!

232
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
We can't just leave it. He's a scoundrel!

233
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,840
-Youâ€¦
-No.

234
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,960
If you recorded his girlfriend, delete it.

235
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,560
You can't record without permission.

236
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
-A little help here?
-I didn't!

237
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
-Let go!
-Cut the crap! You're always filming!

238
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,800
Who do you mean? Do you know him?

239
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,160
I have principles when filming.

240
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,440
-I filmâ€¦
-He's a jerk! Give me a hand!

241
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,440
Stop fighting!

242
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
-What's going on?
-Help out, you guys!

243
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Noâ€¦

244
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,200
Sir, don't rush.

245
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
Let's wait a bit longer.

246
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,080
Why don't you just give him your phone?

247
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,960
STOP AT THE RED LIGHT, CCTV IN OPERATION

248
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,840
What's the matter with him?

249
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,040
What's going on?

250
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,720
-Noâ€¦
-What's going on?

251
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,760
What's wrong?

252
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,680
Do you have asthma?

253
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,680
Do you have asthma medicine?

254
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
I don't have asthma medicine.

255
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
-You said you have all types of medicines.
-Iâ€¦

256
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,880
When did I say that?

257
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,840
-Iâ€¦
-What should we do? Gosh.

258
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,240
He won't make it.

259
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,520
Sir!

260
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,960
Sir!

261
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,000
Someone is dying.

262
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,520
Right! Most people with asthma
carry medicines.

263
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,880
Check to see if he has one.

264
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,600
-Look for it.
-Do you have any medicine?

265
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,160
Search for it.

266
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,240
-Sir, please stop the bus!
-Let go.

267
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm searching for medicine!

268
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,080
Someone is unwell! He's dying!

269
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

270
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,040
-He's sitting.
-Quick!

271
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Help him up.

272
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
-Can we?
-Yes.

273
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,600
-Hurry up.
-I got it.

274
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,520
-Now.
-I got it.

275
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,560
Call for an ambulance!

276
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,760
Call for an ambulance!

277
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,560
I'll do it.

278
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,280
Did he put his hand in that bag?

279
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,200
And thenâ€¦

280
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
I think so too.

281
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,320
Do you think he really had an episode?

282
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,280
If he was pretending,

283
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,400
would it have been that convincing?

284
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,240
He was unwell and still so strong.

285
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
You're just weak.

286
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,720
But anyway,

287
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,000
it's unusual that
he is so protective of his bag.

288
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,280
He was having an episode.

289
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,680
Why wouldn't he open his bag
to get his medicine?

290
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,000
We have to find out

291
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
what the heck is in his bag.

292
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,200
Why don't we stop him from getting on?

293
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,920
<i>We've arrived at Yanjiang East Road.</i>

294
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
<i>Please exit through the rear door.</i>

295
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,080
<i>Please tap your card when exiting.</i>

296
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,320
<i>-Please mind the doors.</i>
-Exit from the back.

297
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I know.

298
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,920
Miss, don't block the doors.

299
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm checking to see which stop this is.

300
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
I think I missed my stop.

301
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,600
Excuse me. Let me go through.

302
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm sorry. Hold on a second.

303
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,120
Are you getting on or off?

304
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,400
Don't play on your phone.

305
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
If he can't get in, we can't leave.

306
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,040
I'm almost done.

307
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,320
I don't have a signal.

308
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,240
Hurry up.

309
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm in a hurry.

310
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,200
I'll be quick.

311
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,760
What's going on?

312
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,040
Excuse me, let me take a look.

313
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,040
Hurry up.

314
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,240
Why are you here?

315
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,000
-Who are you? What?
-This is my stop. Sorry.

316
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,320
-What's going on?
-Quick, come!

317
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,280
-I'm coming!
-Hurry!

318
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,320
Don't let him move.

319
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,360
What is happening?

320
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,520
Do they know each other?

321
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,520
-Who are you guys?
-Stay still.

322
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,920
-Hurry! I'm slipping!
-Who are you?

323
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,600
What are you doing? Let go of me!

324
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,280
Hurry up.

325
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,080
-Are you crazy?
-I'm sorry!

326
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,080
Kitty!

327
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,320
It's okay.

328
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,560
I think it's in shock.

329
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,320
It's a bit scared of people now.

330
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm sorry.

331
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,560
My friend lost his backpack
on the bus last week.

332
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,000
It looks exactly like yours, soâ€¦

333
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,720
I'm sorry. Weâ€¦

334
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
I just bought this bag.

335
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Yes.

336
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,280
-It's not his.
-We're notâ€¦ This isn't it.

337
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,400
I'm so sorry.

338
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,640
If that's all, we are going to go.

339
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,720
It took three loops to check one person.

340
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,840
It wasn't even him.

341
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,520
We're so inefficient.

342
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,320
It's also his fault.

343
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,240
He's so protective of a cat.

344
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,560
Pets aren't allowed on the bus.

345
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,240
Hold on.

346
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,880
He got off.

347
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,240
We pulled him off the bus!

348
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,680
Do you think he will enter the time loop?

349
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,320
I pulled you off the bus.

350
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,840
After that, you were in the time loop.

351
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,160
Well, we pulled him off this time.

352
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,560
In that case,
he will be in the time loop too, right?

353
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,280
Yes, we have to hurry and find him.

354
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,520
Why are you so happy?

355
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,040
We have a new teammate.

356
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,320
Of course I'm happy.

357
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,840
Look.

358
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,800
He's not weak at all.

359
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,600
He's so protective of the cat.

360
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,880
That means he's caring.

361
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,600
He'll be easy to get along with.

362
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
He has asthma.

363
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,360
He had an episode because he panicked.

364
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,480
Under normal circumstances,

365
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,920
he would definitely be fine.

366
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,400
And you saw it too, right?

367
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,440
He's fiery and strong.

368
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,920
He'll definitely be able to help us.

369
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,400
Who attacks by scratching?

370
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,040
It doesn't matter how he does it.

371
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,440
There's strength in numbers.

372
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,440
And what if he really is part
of the time loop?

373
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,680
If he's not prepared,

374
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,840
he will open his eyes

375
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,800
panicked and scared.

376
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,560
We'll waste another two or three rounds.

377
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,600
Thenâ€¦

378
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,960
Won't that drop our efficiency even more?

379
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Stop walking.

380
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
We have to find him.

381
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,000
Calm down first.

382
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,400
Let me get this straight.

383
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,400
Where will you find him?

384
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
What will you tell him when you find him?

385
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,360
Tell him he's in a time loop?
Will he believe that?

386
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,640
Besides, he didn't get on the bus.

387
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,840
It doesn't fit the criteria.

388
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,760
He stepped onto the stairs.

389
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,160
Did he get in?

390
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,520
Did the door close?

391
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,840
Did the bus move?

392
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,920
He wasn't chosen.

393
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,040
What if he is?

394
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,760
Okay, I'll help you play it out.

395
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,120
Come on, this way.

396
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,120
Sit.

397
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,720
Let's say synchronized wake-up times
are the key to entering the time loop.

398
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,760
We also wake up earlier and earlier.

399
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
So when will he wake up?

400
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,040
On the platform?

401
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,840
Or on his way to the platform?

402
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,360
That'sâ€¦

403
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,120
Even if we don't wake up at the same time,

404
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,960
he gets on the bus, naps, and wakes up.

405
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,480
His time in action is too short.

406
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,000
Time will quickly run out for him.

407
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,200
We can just give it a try

408
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,120
to find out how he will wake up.

409
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,360
And I think that
even if he doesn't get into the time loop,

410
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,720
it won't hurt to tell him.

411
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,160
He'll forget about it in the end.

412
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,120
Didn't you say we have to be well-prepared
and prepare for the worst?

413
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,040
I'm just worried about his asthma.

414
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,240
After going through a few loops,

415
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,720
I feel noticeably stronger.

416
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,440
Look how I handled him.

417
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,760
It was a piece of cake, right?

418
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,880
<i>-Hello, this is Jialin News.</i>
-The Cat Savior saves another cat.

419
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,200
<i>-We interrupt with breaking news.</i>
-It's the Cat Apostle.

420
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,960
<i>-A major accident occurred.</i>
-Okay, Apostle.

421
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,600
<i>It happened around 1 p.m. today</i>

422
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
<i>at the intersection
of Yanjiang East Rd. and Qiushi Rd.</i>

423
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,120
<i>in Yanjiang District.</i>

424
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,640
<i>A Route 45 bus collided with a tank truck,</i>

425
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,880
<i>causing an explosion.</i>

426
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,440
<i>There were many casualties.</i>

427
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,960
<i>After the incident,</i>

428
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,160
<i>authorities are taking this
very seriously.</i>

429
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,680
<i>The police, fire, and emergencyâ€¦</i>

430
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,720
There aren't many people here.

431
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,920
The Internet is fast too.

432
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,440
Have a seat. Scan the QR code to order.

433
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,360
Okay, thank you.

434
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,840
Have a seat.

435
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,040
There aren't many people here
and the food isn't bad.

436
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,440
I scouted out this place
in the previous loop.

437
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,720
It feels like the last time I ate
was a lifetime ago.

438
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,240
But strangely, I'm not hungry at all.

439
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,560
I've thought about that.

440
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,440
All physical changes
aren't brought back into the loop.

441
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,160
For example, wounds

442
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,280
and the body's energy consumption.

443
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
No wonder.

444
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,920
I wondered why I wasn't hungry.

445
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,120
I only had fruit for lunch.

446
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,360
And one more thing.

447
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,240
It doesn't matter how much you spend.

448
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,600
The money will be back in the next loop.

449
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,280
But that doesn't help at all.

450
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,560
Anything we buy
doesn't enter the next loop with us.

451
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,040
Don't buy anything.

452
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,040
Buy services and experiences.

453
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,560
An experience can be preserved.

454
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,120
An experience?

455
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,320
Like what?

456
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,240
The simplest and the best.

457
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Eating!

458
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,320
You can eat all you want.

459
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,680
You don't have to eat only fruit.

460
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,200
Right.

461
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,080
Yes, Iâ€¦

462
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,000
After I finish it, I won't gain weight.

463
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,640
Put your phones down. Stop filming.

464
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,960
Stop it.

465
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,880
Stop filming.

466
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
Excuse me, let me take a look.

467
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,760
-Why are you here?
-What?

468
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,160
If that's all, we are going to go.

469
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,480
What's wrong?

470
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,720
I suddenly feel a little guilty.

471
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,280
I'm faced with such a serious situation.

472
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,640
I can't believe I'm indulging in food.

473
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,200
There's a good saying.

474
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,520
"Bread is the staff of life."

475
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,040
You need to eat to save the world.

476
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,120
That makes sense.

477
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,840
GOSH! I TAKE THE 45 EVERY DAY!
I'M GLAD I WAS OFF TODAY.

478
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,560
This news is the same as before.

479
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,360
There's nothing new.

480
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,720
I wonder when the police
will find the explosive.

481
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,960
Let's say they find it.

482
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,200
They won't report on it right away.

483
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Who is it?

484
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,200
My colleague wants me to go to a meeting.

485
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,000
Actually, you can go.

486
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,600
Look at us this time.

487
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,560
We got off the bus at a normal stop.

488
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,760
We didn't call the police.

489
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,200
We still have plenty of time.

490
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,680
I didn't want to go anyway.

491
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,120
The top priority right now
is solving this problem.

492
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,480
We can't be separated again.

493
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,920
At night,

494
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,840
why don't I take you to an Internet cafÃ©?

495
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,120
Let's stay up all night.

496
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,760
Stay out all night?

497
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,520
We've always been forced into the loops.

498
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,120
Have you considered this?

499
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,680
If we don't sleep

500
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,320
or take turns sleeping,

501
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,680
will we be able
to delay restarting the loop?

502
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,520
This is a serious matter.

503
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,000
The police will be working
against the clock to solve this.

504
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,440
The news will keep reporting on it.

505
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,000
If we can just hold out
until they find the culprit,

506
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
then on the next cycle,

507
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,000
we can report this information
to the police immediately.

508
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,199
Are you saying
we should still call the police?

509
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,239
I'm scared of that interrogation room.

510
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
But when the time is right,

511
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,719
we'll have to call them.

512
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,440
But what if we automatically restart
at midnight?

513
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,920
The last time you were
in the police station,

514
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,560
did you hear anything
about the passengers?

515
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,440
If we ever go to the police station again,

516
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,639
it can't be for nothing.

517
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,159
We have to get something useful.

518
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,560
Now that I think about it,
the way we get intel

519
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,520
isn't as good as the police.

520
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
Now you say that?

521
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,400
You need to look at the problem
from a developing perspective.

522
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,560
After all,
the intel we can get is limited.

523
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,040
Look, just investigating the people,

524
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,680
the explosives, and the detonation method

525
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,400
will waste so many cycles.

526
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,760
The cost is too high.

527
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,400
If we can get some information
from the police,

528
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,720
such as a list of victims,

529
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,240
we can find clues based on the list.

530
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
How are we supposed to find clues
from a list?

531
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,280
Look, if there is a wanted criminal
or a psychopath

532
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,760
among the passengers,

533
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,080
wouldn't they be prime suspects?

534
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,760
Then we can prioritize the search.

535
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,600
So then,

536
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,240
while we're at it, let's sort this out.

537
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,560
If getting off at a normal stop
doesn't break the time loop,

538
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,120
then the way to break the loop should beâ€¦

539
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,920
Stopping the bus from crashing?

540
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,080
I have one more question.

541
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,640
Do you have a standby mode?

542
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,120
"Standby mode"?

543
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,040
What do you mean?

544
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,040
How do I explain this?

545
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,040
When you went
to the police station by yourself,

546
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,440
I called you, right?

547
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,120
Afterward, I took a ton of melatonin
and drank alcohol.

548
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,920
I wanted to sleep
and get into the time loop.

549
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,720
But it didn't work.

550
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,560
I had a strange and long dream.

551
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,560
I had a dream too.

552
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Remember when we were
interrogated together?

553
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,560
I guess I fell asleep first.

554
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,200
Then I had a dream.

555
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,480
But it was a good dream.

556
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,200
That means we all have to be asleep

557
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,960
to get into the time loop together.

558
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,520
Otherwise, another person will enter

559
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,240
the standby mode that I mentioned.

560
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,600
Standby mode.

561
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,160
If that's the caseâ€¦

562
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,880
If we run into any problems
we can't solve in the future,

563
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,840
we can enter standby mode

564
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,360
and wait for the other person
to enter the time loop together.

565
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,200
What about the poster?

566
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
Did we not make Mr. One's poster?

567
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
It's ready, sir.

568
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,080
The print shop will deliver it later.

569
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,160
Let's post a preview first.

570
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,480
Look. Don't worry about this.

571
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,880
Just remember one thing.

572
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,000
The last close-up has to be of my face.

573
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,040
Don't zoom out like you did last time.

574
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,280
I can get very emotional.

575
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,720
Okay, I got it.

576
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,640
I'll go get some mood shots.

577
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,080
Go over the lines again.

578
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,200
You're here early.

579
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,200
How are you going to set up your camera?

580
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,240
We need to plan this.

581
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,520
Don't worry.

582
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
Wait until Mr. One's poster gets here.

583
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,720
What happened to Mr. One

584
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,960
was too sudden.

585
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,360
He is quite similar in real life

586
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,280
to the persona
that the company set up for him.

587
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
He talked so much.

588
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,360
And he was so pesky.

589
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,400
But he was so positive.

590
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,320
Everyone was annoyed with him.

591
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,520
But he wasn't annoyed with anyone.

592
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,520
Hello, guys.

593
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,520
For today's livestream, we are outdoors.

594
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,080
Everyone knows that

595
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,760
this afternoon in Jialin,

596
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,800
at this intersection right behind me,

597
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,080
something very tragic happened.

598
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,720
-There was a bus.
-Hi.

599
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,440
-It crashed into a tank truck.
-Good evening.

600
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,320
<i>It caused a lot of casualties.</i>

601
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,680
<i>I was talking to Mr. One the other day.</i>

602
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,360
<i>I said, "Let's have the battle
to see who the top dog is."</i>

603
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,480
<i>He just chuckled and didn't say anything.</i>

604
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,720
<i>I didn't expect this.</i>

605
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,240
<i>Now I'll never see you again.</i>

606
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,840
<i>Mr. One.</i>

607
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>I just want to tell you this.</i>

608
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
<i>You'll always be our number one.</i>

609
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,640
<i>Let's carry on with Mr. One's happiness.</i>

610
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,320
<i>Today, many of Mr. One's fans and friends</i>

611
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,440
<i>will hold a memorial event for him here.</i>

612
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,840
<i>Let's send Mr. One off one last time.</i>

613
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
<i>Let's say to him,</i>

614
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,560
<i>"Mr. One,</i>

615
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,240
<i>rest in peace."</i>

616
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,440
<i>Rest in peace, buddy.</i>

617
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
Why don't we go check it out later?

618
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,040
Maybe we can get information
on the other passengers.

619
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,880
Okay.

620
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,880
GOODBYE, MR. ONE

621
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,760
HAPPY MR. ONE

622
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,040
FIND HAPPINESS WITH MR. ONE

623
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,960
GOODBYE, MR. ONE

624
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
<i>When going out,</i>

625
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,800
<i>public transportation
is a pretty good option.</i>

626
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
<i>I'm heading to meet some fans.</i>

627
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,000
<i>I chose to take the bus.</i>

628
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,320
<i>Right? What's wrong with that?</i>

629
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,640
<i>Look at this bus.</i>

630
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,080
<i>It's uncrowded and clean, isn't it?</i>

631
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,320
<i>Most importantly,
you get a view out the window.</i>

632
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,560
<i>Look how beautiful the view is.</i>

633
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,160
<i>Right?</i>

634
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,680
<i>Most importantly, it's eco-friendly.</i>

635
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,480
-You stopped me from getting on.
<i>-Right? And healthy.</i>

636
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,920
Were you searching my bag?

637
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,600
No, it was a misunderstanding.

638
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,760
Do you know something
about the bus explosion?

639
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,640
How would we know? How can you say that?

640
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,320
Then you came to save me, right?

641
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,320
That'sâ€¦

642
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,040
What do you mean?

643
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,160
Don't go anywhere. I'm calling the police.

644
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,320
-Don't.
-Youâ€¦

645
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,080
No.

646
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,920
It really was a misunderstanding.

647
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,280
This thing

648
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,920
is hard for us to explain.

649
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,240
Come with me then.

650
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,520
