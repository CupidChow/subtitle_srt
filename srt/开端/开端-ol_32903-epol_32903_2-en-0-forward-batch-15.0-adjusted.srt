1
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,480
You, come with me.

2
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,800
It's not my stop. Why should I?

3
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,680
Get off!

4
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,560
Why did you drag him off?

5
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,920
He's a pervert!

6
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Why are you smiling?

7
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go to the police station.

8
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,400
We don't have to go anymore.

9
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
We don't?

10
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,440
Aren't I a pervert?

11
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,200
Let's check the footage.

12
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,600
We have to get to
the bottom of this.

13
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,960
I know you're not a pervert.

14
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,640
I don't know how to explain it.

15
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Anyway…

16
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,880
Thank you.

18
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,480
Are you out of your mind?

19
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
Crazy.

20
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,160
Sir, Digital Plaza, please.

21
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
The one in the Old Town?

22
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,680
- Yes.
- Okay.

23
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,720
Sir, can you open the window?

24
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,816
- Aren't you hot?
- I turned on the air conditioner.

25
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,000
I need some air.

26
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Okay.

27
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,976
LIU PENG: WHERE ARE YOU? HURRY!

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
I'M ALMOST THERE.

29
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
HURRY. WE'RE ALL
WAITING FOR YOU.

30
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,680
I'M ON THE WAY.
I'LL BE THERE SOON.

31
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,320
STOP RUSHING ME. I
JUST GOT INTO A TAXI.

32
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
There are two more people here!

33
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
Come on, we need help here!

34
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Hey.

35
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Can you hear me? Hey.

36
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,760
EMERGENCY

37
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,320
That dream was
way too realistic.

38
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,080
Excuse me, is this…

39
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,120
Is this our first time meeting…

40
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm…

41
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,440
Never mind.

42
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Did you…

43
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,720
Did you come in too?

44
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,960
Where?

45
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,000
The time loop.

46
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,440
You're in the time
loop too, aren't you?

47
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,200
Didn't you just think
you had seen me before?

48
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Last time, we were here.

49
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,160
When I woke up,

50
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,920
you gave me a tissue.
Do you remember?

51
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,360
- You…
- I'm sorry. I…

52
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
This is my stop.

53
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,280
Think about it.

54
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,560
Be careful.

55
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,159
Pervert!

56
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
Someone is groping me!

57
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,120
Do you think it was a dream?

58
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,400
But it wasn't a
dream. It was real.

59
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,960
It really happened to us.

60
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
It's true.

61
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,000
Sir, I need to get off.

62
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,880
I can't stop until we
get to the next stop.

63
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,000
There aren't many cars
or people up in front.

64
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Just stop for me.

65
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,480
Hey, did you miss your stop?

66
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,361
He can't stop for you here.
Just get off at the next stop.

67
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,216
It will only take a bit of
time to go one stop back.

68
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
The next stop is past the
bridge. I have no time.

69
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,576
- Sir, just pull over for a bit.
- I've tried this before.

70
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
It's no use.

71
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,480
Do you remember I said…

72
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,480
Stop talking to me.

73
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
-I said you were a pervert
-Sir, open the door.

74
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,216
- And dragged you off. Do you remember?
- Sir.

75
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,376
- Don't shake the door.
- Can you open

76
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,320
- the door?
- Can you calm down and listen to me?

77
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,360
It's a red light anyway.

78
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,920
Can't you open the door?

79
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,976
- Don't get hurt.
- What's going on?

80
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,776
- You're wasting your efforts.
- Look. It's a red light.

81
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,256
You've stopped anyway.
Just open the door.

82
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,736
- What are you doing?
- Don't grab the steering wheel.

83
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,200
What are you doing?

84
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
What's going on?

85
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,736
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
You grabbed the steering wheel!

86
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,280
Are you trying to get us killed?

87
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,760
You're in trouble
now, aren't you?

88
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
You're good, man.

89
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,016
- Did you learn wrestling?
- No, I'm just a bungee jump instructor.

90
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,160
Bungee jump instructor?

91
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,200
- Grab him tight.
- What are you doing now?

92
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
Let go of me.

93
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
- Why did you grab the wheel?
- I want to get off.

94
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,336
Why do you need to grab
the wheel to get off?

95
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,656
- Something is wrong with the bus.
- I think there's something wrong with you.

96
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,440
Let me go! It's
going to explode!

97
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
You're going to explode?

98
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,960
Okay, show me.

99
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,120
Show me.

100
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,480
You should believe
me now, right?

101
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm not lying.

102
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,960
We're really in a time loop.

103
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,680
You were pinned down
over there just now.

104
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,040
We're really in a time loop.

105
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,080
We're continuously on this bus…

106
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
What are you doing?

107
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Stop being rash.

108
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,200
EMERGENCY DOOR CONTROL VALVE

109
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,080
Young man.

110
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,240
Are you carsick?

111
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,320
No.

112
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,656
- No.
- I have some medicine here.

113
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,560
It's okay. Thank you.

114
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,560
It's just too stuffy.

115
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,160
Tell me if you're
not feeling well.

116
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,760
What's that sound?

117
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,880
What's happening?

118
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,640
- What is that sound?
- What are you doing?

119
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,960
What are you doing?

120
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
- Hey!
- Hey!

121
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
- Hey!
- Hey!

122
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,200
- He's going to break the glass!
- What are you doing?

123
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,960
What are you doing?

124
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,320
What are you doing?

125
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,640
- Let go of me.
- What are you going out for?

126
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,080
Give me the hammer.

127
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,240
Let go of me.

128
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
Are you crazy? Calm down.

129
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,640
Sir, stop the bus!

130
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,320
Someone wants to jump off!

131
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
I want to get off.

132
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,520
Sir, please stop the car.

133
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,480
Let everybody off.

134
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,080
- It's too dangerous.
- That's right.

135
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,216
The bus can't stop until it's
at a bus stop. That's the rule.

136
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,296
The window is already broken.
Who cares about the rules?

137
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,936
- Why are you so professional?
- You're one to talk.

138
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,440
You're the one who
broke the window.

139
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,160
That emergency hammer
is for emergencies.

140
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,320
This is an emergency.

141
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,640
What's the emergency?

142
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,720
Sir, we've stopped anyway.

143
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,160
Just let me off.

144
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,521
How can he stop? Can't you see
if this is an intersection?

145
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,320
Why can't I get off
even in this situation?

146
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,040
I don't know. I've
tried many times before.

147
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,560
I don't know how I got
into this time loop either.

148
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,600
But I've been through it
more times than you have.

149
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,920
What are you two talking about?

150
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,840
Tell him that love isn't
everything in life.

151
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,656
- Nothing is more important than life.
- And…

152
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,480
It's no use even if we get off.

153
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,360
Also, it's too late.

154
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,400
So do we just wait and die?

155
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,520
Yes.

156
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,760
We can only wait and die.

157
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
But can you not be
so rash next time?

158
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
Let me finish talking.

159
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
EXPLOSIVE

160
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,360
Have you calmed down?

161
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,560
Actually, you can tell yourself

162
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,200
that the pain is
just psychological.

163
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
It can't hurt you.

164
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
It's not real.

165
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,440
Believe it or not,

166
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,480
I've never been this impulsive.

167
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,720
I believe you.

168
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,240
What's with this loop?

169
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,040
Have we been hypnotized
or something?

170
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
I wish we were hypnotized.

171
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,400
I don't know how we encountered
such a strange thing either.

172
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,320
That time I dragged
you out of the car,

173
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,920
I was trying to save you.

174
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,440
I never thought I'd pull
you into the time loop too.

175
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,200
So you mean

176
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,000
I went into the time loop

177
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,480
because you dragged
me off the bus?

178
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
Yes.

179
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,960
You've been through it twice.

180
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,480
But I've already gone through
this many times before you.

181
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,880
I've been trying everything
to get out of the time loop.

182
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,080
I tried everything to
get off the bus too,

183
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,640
but I couldn't succeed at all.

184
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Until the time

185
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,960
I falsely accused you
of being a pervert.

186
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,840
So it's no use
even if we get off.

187
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,080
Will we still come back?

188
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,800
That's what it looks like.

189
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,040
I don't know what will
happen next either.

190
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,800
This is what I think.

191
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,920
We've been thinking we need
to get off all this time.

192
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,320
We thought we could solve
this by getting off the bus.

193
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,040
But just now, we saw that

194
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,960
it's too hard to
forcefully get off.

195
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
Besides, it's useless
even if we do.

196
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,760
We have proved that, right?

197
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,840
If we think of it
the other way around,

198
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,040
does that mean we
don't have to get off?

199
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Look.

200
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
Every time we get
to that intersection

201
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,320
and pass the red light,

202
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,160
a delivery bike forces
its way in from this side.

203
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,400
And in order to avoid it,

204
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,640
we turn this way

205
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,760
and crash into that
tank truck over there.

206
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
Then when the two cars
collide, an explosion occurs.

207
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
So I'm thinking

208
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
if we can prevent
the car accident,

209
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,400
maybe we can prevent
an explosion.

210
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
That makes sense.

211
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Sir.

212
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,839
My heart hurts.

213
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,920
I don't feel well.

214
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,760
Is it serious?

215
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,280
I haven't been able to
breathe since just now.

216
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,280
And…

217
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,079
- Why don't you pull over?
- Please drive faster.

218
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,400
- Driving faster is fine too.
- Why don't you stop?

219
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
You talk.

220
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,680
Actually, I'll be
fine if you pull over

221
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,840
and let me catch my breath.

222
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,720
Can you hang in there?

223
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,640
I can't take it anymore, sir.

224
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,040
What's happening?

225
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
You should help her sit first.

226
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,560
Have some water first.

227
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,200
Do you have water in your bag?

228
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,720
Do you want me to get off with
you and call an ambulance?

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,280
I forgot she has her medicine.

230
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
Who has medicine?

231
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,040
I have medicine here.

232
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't worry, miss.

233
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't panic.

234
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Move aside.

235
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
Miss, don't be afraid.

236
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,160
I have some medicine
here. Don't be nervous.

237
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
That's the wrong bag.

238
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm going to record a video.

239
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,520
You're right.

240
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
What medicine is this, ma'am?

241
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,080
- A heart reliever.
- A heart reliever…

242
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,680
That's right. It's a
quick-acting heart reliever.

243
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,560
You'll be fine
after taking this.

244
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,280
Here you go.

245
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,520
Take a few pills.

246
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,840
You don't have to swallow it.

247
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,200
Just keep it in your mouth.

248
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,000
Let me tell you.

249
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Chest pain isn't
a trivial matter.

250
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
Be careful.

251
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,000
Young man, why are
you sitting there?

252
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,880
Come here. You have
to look after her.

253
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,880
Sit here and take care of her.

254
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm telling you. A heart
problem is serious.

255
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,600
You have to pay attention to it.

256
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,320
When you get off, you must
take her to the hospital.

257
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
- Okay, thank you.
- Get it checked out.

258
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,600
Thank you, ma'am.

259
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,840
You were a great help.

260
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,640
I recorded it all, ma'am.

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,080
I was nervous, so I forgot.

262
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
How could you forget that?

263
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,960
What do we do now?

264
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,400
Since that old lady came, we
have hit another red light.

265
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,040
It's the same as last time now.

266
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,320
If we just warn the driver
to watch out for the cars,

267
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,680
we can prevent the accident.

268
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,720
<i>I told you I'm not sick.</i>

269
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,480
<i>I'm completely healthy.</i>

270
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,920
Couldn't you have reminded me?

271
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,560
What do you mean I
didn't remind you?

272
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,600
You know how long it takes
to fill this tank up.

273
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,200
You were free all
afternoon yesterday.

274
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
It's not like I
made the schedule.

275
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,000
Are you blaming me now?

276
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,080
NO OPEN FLAMES, EXPLOSIVE

277
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,560
Turn your phone off.

278
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
I'm annoyed.

279
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Sir, don't rush.

280
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,160
There are a lot of cars here.

281
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,400
It's a bit dangerous.

282
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,960
Are you teaching the
driver how to drive?

283
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,000
His driving skills are great.

284
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
Besides,

285
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,760
the bus goes on this route
every day, 365 days a year.

286
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,760
The driver knows every
ditch and bumps clearly.

287
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,560
- The driver is skilled.
- Is it that one?

288
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,736
- We're not there yet.
- Sir.

289
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,560
How long have you
been driving the bus?

290
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Four years.

291
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,160
Has it only been four years?

292
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,536
It doesn't look like it. I thought
you were an experienced driver.

293
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
I used to drive trucks.

294
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,720
Did you hear that? He
used to drive trucks.

295
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,120
Can you stop talking?

296
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,840
- Why are you everywhere?
- Look how nervous she is.

297
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,600
If you don't have a
heart attack, who will?

298
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,600
You can't live in
anxiety all the time.

299
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,560
You need to live
with an open mind.

300
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,800
Whether you're happy or
sad, the day will go by.

301
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,760
You have to be happy.

302
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
What will be, will be.

303
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
People need to be forthright.

304
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,760
<i>The order you are delivering will
exceed the time limit in one minute.</i>

305
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,560
You can't stand here. Go back.

306
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,280
Don't worry about the driver.

307
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
Worry about her.

308
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,280
She has chest pains.

309
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,040
That's you. I'm talking
about your chest.

310
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,760
Will you turn it off or not?

311
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,520
When I'm driving,

312
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,560
you're allowed to
play on your phone.

313
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,840
Yet I can't play on my phone
now that you're driving?

314
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,560
Just a moment, sir.

315
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,760
Wait a few more seconds.

316
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,200
Please.

317
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,480
Sir, the bike!

318
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Do you want to die?

319
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,760
Do you want to die?

320
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,200
Nice one. You can
predict the future.

321
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,600
What happened?

322
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,360
That was so dangerous.

323
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,360
NEXT STOP, YANJIANG WEST ROAD

324
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,120
My gosh, are you serious?

325
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
You're even making me nervous.

326
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,160
Sit down and rest.

327
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,720
I'll sit down too.

328
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,920
We should be okay here, right?

329
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,280
The bus is going so slowly.

330
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,720
There aren't many cars either.

331
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
We didn't get off and
there was no accident.

332
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,480
There was no explosion either.

333
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,000
Is the time loop broken?

334
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,280
I think so too.

335
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Then…

336
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,920
We're almost across the bridge.

337
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,600
Thank goodness for you.

338
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,720
I definitely couldn't
have done it alone.

339
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,160
What's wrong?

340
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,000
This music…

341
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,680
I remember now.

342
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,480
I remember everything.

343
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,520
That ringtone…

344
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,160
I only heard it the
first and second time.

345
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,280
After that,

346
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
every time I tried to get
out, I disturbed the driver.

347
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,760
Then the accident happened.

348
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
I never heard it again.

349
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Hold on.

350
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,680
Does the explosion also happen
when the ringtone goes off?

351
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
Ringtone…

352
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
Ringtone…

353
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,600
Explosion…

354
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,000
There's…

355
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,680
There's a bomb on the bus.

356
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,480
We have to get off.

357
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,680
How do we do that?

358
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,360
I've only succeeded
that one time before.

359
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
That time?

360
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Pervert!

361
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,280
Someone is groping me!

362
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,640
Yes, hand him over
to the police!

363
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,880
If I was free, I
would go with you.

364
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,040
Don't be scared!

365
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,520
Hello, this is
the Jialin police.

366
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,880
I want to report a bomb
on the Route 45 bus.

367
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,040
<i>It is about to cross the
river-crossing bridge now.</i>

368
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,920
What's the license plate?

369
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
<i>The license plate?</i>

370
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,200
- Jia…
- Jia A77651.

371
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,920
Jia A77651.

372
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
You need to stop
the bus quickly.

373
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
<i>There are passengers aboard.</i>

374
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,000
Are you on the bus right now?

375
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,896
I just got off, but there
are still passengers on it.

376
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,080
The bomb is still on the bus.

377
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
Can you tell us the details?

378
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,280
How many people are on the bus?

379
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,200
There are about seven or eight of
them. But I don't remember exactly.

380
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,736
You have to stop the
bus. There's no time.

381
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,120
Please give me your name
and contact information.

382
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,520
I'm Li Shiqing. You can
contact me on this number.

383
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,440
<i>Which characters?</i>

384
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,560
"Shi" as in "poem,"
"Qing" as in "feelings."

385
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,240
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

386
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
I'm at Qing Shui Xiang.

387
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,120
I'm in the area just
before the bridge.

388
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,880
<i>Do you know where the
bomb is on the bus?</i>

389
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I don't know.

390
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,600
Stop asking. We're
running out of time.

391
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,840
Turn your phone off.

392
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,920
Keep contacting the caller.

393
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,000
POLICE

394
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
Do you think they'll make it?

395
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
I don't know.

396
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,680
There's nothing else we can do.

397
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,840
Is this your first time
calling the police?

398
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,960
Yes.

399
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
JIALIN POLICE

400
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,376
Have you contacted the explosives
unit and the traffic squad?

401
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,320
Yes, we're making arrangements
as fast as we can.

402
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,120
Did you call the officers
nearby for backup?

403
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,360
Jiang Feng is on his way.

404
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,080
Did you get in
touch with the girl?

405
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,480
We've been trying to reach her,
but her phone is turned off.

406
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,600
Keep calling her.

407
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,160
Mr. Zhang.

408
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,760
Could it be a prank call?

409
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
This is a serious incident.
Why is her phone off?

410
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,920
The operator said the caller
may have been threatened.

411
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,096
She heard a man forcing her
to hang up over the phone.

412
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,080
Her phone has been
turned off since then.

413
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,080
It hasn't exploded yet.

414
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,840
Does that mean the
police took care of it?

415
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,720
It can't be that fast.

416
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,040
It has only been a few minutes.

417
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,160
It's turned off.

418
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Right.

419
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,040
That time at the hospital,

420
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,440
the police came to question me.

421
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,800
They said it
exploded at 1:42 p.m.

422
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,520
Since I used the same reason
to affect the speed of the bus,

423
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,160
then this time, the bus will
also explode at 1:42 p.m.

424
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
No.

425
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,616
When I called the police, I said
there was a bomb on the bus.

426
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
But…

427
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
If we affected the speed,

428
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,280
the car wouldn't explode
because of the bomb.

429
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,440
It will only explode when it collides
with the tank truck at the intersection.

430
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,160
As long as there's an explosion,

431
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,720
the police will eventually find
out there's a bomb on the bus.

432
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,880
Unless the bomb
is on the bridge.

433
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,160
I thought you weren't at the
scene when you got off last time.

434
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,080
- Why were you at the hospital too?
- I didn't get far. I was right there.

435
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,440
The explosion startled
a motorcyclist.

436
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,920
The motorcycle knocked me down.

437
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,600
The explosion could
even be felt from here?

438
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,520
Everyone, get ready.
Prepare for rescue.

439
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
<i>Please give me your name
and contact information.</i>

440
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,040
<i>I'm Li Shiqing. You can
contact me on this number.</i>

441
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,720
<i>Which characters?</i>

442
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
<i>"Shi" as in "poem,"
"Qing" as in "feelings."</i>

443
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,280
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

444
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,280
<i>I'm at Qing Shui Xiang.</i>

445
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,400
<i>I'm in the area just
before the bridge.</i>

446
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,120
<i>Do you know where the
bomb is on the bus?</i>

447
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,040
<i>I don't know.</i>

448
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,960
<i>- Stop asking. We're running out of time.
- Turn off your phone.</i>

449
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,960
Have you checked the
cameras at the intersection?

450
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,280
Yes, from the footage,
the explosion was indeed

451
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,120
due to the collision of
the bus and the tank truck.

452
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,760
But if there really
is a bomb on the bus,

453
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,160
that would be a
huge coincidence.

454
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,280
Check the surveillance cameras
around Qing Shui Xiang.

455
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,800
Make sure you check
them carefully.

456
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
Cong Rong.

457
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,760
It's a call from Zhang
Cheng of the CID.

458
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,480
Hello.

459
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,600
<i>I'm Vice-Captain Zhang
Cheng from the CID.</i>

460
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,960
How's the scene of the accident?

461
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,960
Mr. Zhang.

462
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,520
There is severe
damage at the scene,

463
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,280
especially on the tank truck, which
was the source of the explosion.

464
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,440
Listen.

465
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,360
The report we got said that

466
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,600
there's a bomb on the bus.

467
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,840
<i>You have to be careful</i>

468
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,120
<i>to prevent a second explosion.</i>

469
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,696
Find out if there's an explosive
on the bus as soon as possible.

470
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
<i>I got it.</i>

471
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,096
After we've ruled out the
possibility of a second explosion,

472
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,840
we'll check the explosive
on the bus immediately.

473
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay.

474
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,320
Let's keep in touch.

475
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,560
Okay, don't worry.

476
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,720
<i>Hello, this is
the Jialin police.</i>

477
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,880
<i>I want to report a bomb
on the Route 45 bus.</i>

478
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
<i>It is about to cross the
river-crossing bridge now.</i>

479
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,640
Did the explosion
happen in every loop?

480
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,760
How did you get
into the time loop?

481
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Actually, the first few times,

482
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,800
it ended before I even
realized what was going on.

483
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,520
Later on, I tried to tell everyone that
disaster was going to hit this bus,

484
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,480
but no one believed me.

485
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,880
Even the driver wouldn't
let me off midway.

486
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,280
That time I was with you
was the only time I got off.

487
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,280
Then I was sent to the hospital.

488
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,680
The police kept
asking me questions.

489
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
I was too tired,

490
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,440
so I fell asleep in a daze.

491
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,360
And then…

492
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,640
You know the rest.

493
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,160
Why did the police go to you?

494
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,880
Because the police saw
footage of us getting off.

495
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,720
Then this…

496
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,696
We reported it to
the police anyway.

497
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,800
It's only a matter of time
before we're interrogated.

498
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,880
Is your phone still off?

499
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,320
Maybe I should keep
it off for now.

500
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,680
We have to look into this first.

501
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Let's go this way.

502
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ROOM

503
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,360
- Mr. Zhang.
- Sit.

504
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,960
Look, the caller was indeed on
Qing Shui Xiang at the time.

505
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
THURSDAY, QING
SHUI XIANG, JIALIN

506
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,199
1:38 p.m.

507
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,719
That was the time we
got the first call.

508
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,639
Why did they get off here?

509
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,879
This isn't a bus stop, is it?

510
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,800
No.

511
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,400
The last stop was
Yanjiang East Road.

512
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,080
The next stop is
Yanjiang West Road.

513
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
The next stop is after
the river-crossing bridge.

514
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,880
Mr. Zhang, look at this.

515
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,040

517
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
1:42 p.m.

518
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,040
That's the exact time
of the explosion.

519
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,576
Did they confirm the explosion
happened before leaving the bridge?

520
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,120
Maybe they wanted to see if the
police could stop the explosion.

521
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,360
Ms. Du, her identity
has been confirmed.

522
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,240
- Did you call her?
- Her phone is off.

523
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,760
Jiang Feng.

524
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,776
Go to the tech department
and find out what's going on.

525
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Yes.

526
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,600
"Xiao Heyun."

528
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,520
When I was in the hospital,

529
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,600
I saw these birds.

530
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,520
What's wrong with the birds?

531
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,880
I feel like

532
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,320
they are flying around us.

533
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,360
Do you think maybe…

534
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
we're actually already dead?

535
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,440
I've heard this before.

536
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,960
If a person wrongfully dies,

537
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,880
then his soul will be trapped in
the place where he died forever.

538
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,160
Then the events of the day he died
will keep repeating themselves.

539
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,800
Just like what's
happening to us now.

540
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,920
We are trapped on the bus

541
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,960
and we keep dying
again and again.

542
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,240
But it's not quite
the same for us.

543
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,200
Think about it.

544
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,360
We can experience things
that didn't happen before.

545
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,560
Besides, have you
heard of this saying?

546
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,120
"Once a vengeful soul
finds a substitute,

547
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,520
it can get out of
the time loop."

548
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,680
You already found one.

549
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,120
I didn't.

550
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
No.

551
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,840
I didn't want you
to be my substitute.

552
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,640
- No, that's not what I…
- I dragged you off

553
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,040
because I thought I should get
as many people off as I can.

554
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,920
I really wanted to save you.

555
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,880
I'm sorry. I didn't
expect this to happen.

556
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,376
Wait, throughout all the times
you were in the time loop,

557
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,080
did you only drag
me off the bus?

558
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Why me?

559
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,320
It's probably because…

560
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,600
throughout all my attempts,

561
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,080
you were the only one who wanted to
help me by looking from my perspective.

562
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,400
I guess good deeds
don't go unnoticed.

563
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,440
Actually, there's one thing
I've been worried about.

564
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,280
We never actually saw the bomb.

565
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,240
What if the police ask
us where the bomb was?

566
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,120
- What do we say?
- Tell the truth.

567
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,480
That we've been
experiencing a time loop?

568
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,640
They will never believe that.

569
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,960
How else can we explain it?

570
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Anyway, we didn't
set off the bomb.

571
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,360
We don't have a motive either.

572
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,840
If the police don't believe us,

573
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,200
they'll just think
we're talking nonsense.

574
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,600
If it gets any worse,

575
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,280
they will treat us like
suspects for a while.

576
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,720
Police investigations
require evidence.

577
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,080
They will have to let us
go if there's no evidence.

578
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,880
If we make up our own story

579
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,520
and they find a flaw,

580
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,360
it will only make them
more suspicious of us.

581
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
What's the point?

582
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Ms. Du.

583
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,016
We checked the CCTVs along the route
and tracked them down at Qingshui Park.

584
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,640
The park is a bit complicated.

585
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
The CCTVs are scattered.
Moreover, it's summer.

586
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,456
The vegetation is lush
so there are blind spots.

587
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,600
- Get the tracking vehicle over there.
- Okay.

588
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,240
- Jiang Feng.
- Mr. Zhang.

589
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,000
Gather a team to come
to the park with me.

590
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,640
- Yes.
- Ye Qian.

591
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,880
Go to the security department

592
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,920
and keep an eye on the
cameras at every park gate.

593
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Keep me updated.

594
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,440
- Share this footage with me.
- I got it.

595
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,600
Ms. Du, I'll head over
there with my team first.

596
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,880
Okay.

597
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,160
