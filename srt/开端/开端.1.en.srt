1
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,280
<i>I want to report a bomb
on the Route 45 bus.</i>

2
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,440
<i>It is about to cross the
river-crossing bridge now.</i>

3
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,440
ROUTE 45 TO XUEYE SOUTH ROAD

4
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,720
<i>The license plate</i>

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
<i>is Jia A77651.</i>

6
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,680
<i>You need to stop
the bus quickly.</i>

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,240
<i>There are passengers aboard.</i>

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,976
<i>I just got off, but there
are still passengers on it.</i>

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
<i>The bomb is still on the bus.</i>

10
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,480
<i>There are about seven
or eight people.</i>

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,160
<i>But I don't remember exactly.</i>

12
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,920
<i>You have to stop the
bus. There's no time.</i>

13
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
<i>I'm Li Shiqing. You can
contact me on this number.</i>

14
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,040
Dad, I want a bus like that.

15
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,520
Why do you need a bus?

16
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,920
Look at how nice
your vehicle is.

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,480
You even have lights that flash.

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,760
Don't all fire trucks and
ambulances have lights?

19
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,600
I want a bus.

20
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Buy me one.

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,960
<i>Are you thirsty? Why
don't you have some water?</i>

22
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,120
Your mom packed warm water.

23
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,320
Here you go.

24
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Sorry, I…

25
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
I…

26
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,720
I saw that you're
covered in sweat.

27
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,120
Do you want to wipe it off?

28
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
I didn't mean to.

29
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,560
I wanted to get this tissue.

30
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,840
The flash drive was stuck.

31
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,000
I pulled it out
and my arm slipped.

32
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I…

33
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
Tissue.

34
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Tissue, right.

35
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
This…

36
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,680
You…

37
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
Pervert!

38
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
Someone is groping me!

39
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,680
Look at where his hand is!

40
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,640
- What is happening?
- What are you doing?

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
Sir!

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,280
He touched me
while I was asleep!

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
Scoundrel!

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,840
Young man,

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,640
you look so civilized.

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,320
How could you do such a thing?

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,320
No, ma'am! I didn't do anything!

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,320
Drive to the police
station, sir!

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,560
Go. There are cameras anyway.

50
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
I didn't do anything.
I'm not afraid.

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Look, he's willing to go.

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,360
Let's make a U-turn
up ahead, sir.

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
Stop driving!

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
Miss, no need to turn around.

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
There's one across the river.

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,160
I recorded everything.

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,136
- It's on the Internet. He can't run away.
- Yes.

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm going to expose him!

59
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
- Why are you filming?
- You molester.

60
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,680
Hey, girl.

61
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,160
One thing at a time.

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
The bus can't stop randomly.

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Besides, we have a
bus full of people.

64
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
We can't all go to
the police station.

65
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,200
No, we can't.

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm in a hurry.

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,040
Then can you pull
over and let me out?

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,720
I can get off by myself, right?

69
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,200
- Please let me off.
- Miss.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
What do you want?

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Listen. Calm down.
Don't be scared.

72
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,360
When the bus is in service,

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
it cannot make arbitrary stops.

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,960
You can call the police first.

75
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,600
Have them wait at the next stop.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
Where is the next stop?

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,960
Yanjiang West Road.

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
It's just across the bridge.

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,200
He's not going anywhere.

80
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,800
We can't cross the bridge.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,680
No, I have to get off right now.

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,880
I want to get off right now.

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,776
- Please stop, sir.
- You're running after accusing me?

84
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,120
- Do you feel guilty?
- Please.

85
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Why don't we just let them off?

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,040
- Sir.
- Yes.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,720
Don't let it affect
your driving.

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
- Safety first.
- Sir!

89
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,960
Stop the bus.

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
Let her off.

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,360
Can anyone get off
and testify for me?

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I have something to do.

93
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,720
Tell the police to contact me.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I recorded everything.

95
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,480
You, come with me!

96
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,800
It's not my stop. Why should I?

97
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
Get off!

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,440
Why did you drag him off?

99
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,760
He's a pervert!

100
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,720
Why are you smiling?

101
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,480
Let's go to the police station.

102
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
We don't have to go anymore.

103
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,920
We don't?

104
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,680
Aren't I a pervert?

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,520
Let's check the footage.

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,880
We have to get to
the bottom of this.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
I know you're not a pervert.

108
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,880
I don't know how to explain it.

109
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Anyway…

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
Thank you.

112
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,880
Are you out of your mind?

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
MOM

114
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,520
Everyone, get ready.
Prepare for rescue.

115
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Dr. Mo?

116
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Bed 3 is awake.

117
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,840
How are you feeling?

118
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,360
My head really hurts.

119
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,880
I feel like throwing
up when I move.

120
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,760
You have a minor concussion.

121
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,920
You'll stay under
observation. Rest now.

122
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Doctor.

123
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,080
Am I just concussed?

124
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,680
Could there be something
else wrong with me?

125
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,680
Other than dizziness,

126
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,120
do you feel anything else?

127
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,400
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

128
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,320
I'm so confused right now.

129
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,280
- I see.
- I…

130
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
Stay for observation.

131
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,360
If you don't feel well,

132
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,680
call a nurse anytime, anywhere.

133
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,440
<i>Attention in the ER.</i>

134
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,600
<i>The second group of
casualties is arriving.</i>

135
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,920
<i>Prepare for treatment.</i>

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
Transfer Bed 3 and Bed
5 to the general ward.

137
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Okay.

138
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,280
INTENSIVE CARE

139
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,936
BP 60 over 40, pulse
shallow and fast.

140
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,400
Distant heart sounds.
High priority.

141
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
Central, the fourth
group is on their way.

142
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,120
Send as much help as you can.

143
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,160
Page Dr. Huang and Dr. Liu!

144
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,720
Have them return as
soon as they can.

145
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,720
JIALIN FIRE DEPARTMENT

146
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
This is the worst car accident

147
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
that Jialin City has
seen in ten years.

148
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,000
Based on the scene survey
and the clues we have so far,

149
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
our initial assessment

150
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,800
is that this accident was caused

151
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,560
by a delivery vehicle
cutting into traffic.

152
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,880
We are still trying to
identify the passengers.

153
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,080
I've asked Ye Qian to check
the CCTV along the route

154
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,400
to confirm the cause
of the accident.

155
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,240
Mr. Zhang, we checked all
the CCTVs along the route.

156
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
The last stop before this
was Yanjiang East Road.

157
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,680
There were nine
passengers on board.

158
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Ten including the driver.

159
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,880
But now,

160
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,480
only eight bodies
have been found.

161
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,600
What do you mean?

162
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,880
Two people are missing?

163
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,080
I told them to look into it.

164
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Check carefully.

165
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,120
THURSDAY, QING
SHUI XIANG, JIALIN

166
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Zhan, play that again.

167
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
JIALIN POLICE

168
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
Mr. Zhang, Ye Qian just
sent this from the station.

169
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,040
Footage along the route
of the Route 45 bus.

170
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
Look.

171
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,640
They got off just
before the blast.

172
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,840
And this wasn't even a stop.

173
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,560
THURSDAY, QING
SHUI XIANG, JIALIN

174
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,160
Something is fishy.

175
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Fishy?

176
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,520
Do you have proof?

177
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,400
Evidence is important in a case.

178
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,600
Have you found them yet?

179
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,920
- Find them first.
- Okay.

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,240
I'm on it.

181
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,320
<i>Based on the current
test results,</i>

182
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,600
Li Shiqing has a brain injury.

183
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,720
But there's no blood
clot in her skull.

184
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,120
It should be a minor concussion.

185
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,600
But it's nothing serious.

186
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,960
She's just suffering symptoms

187
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,760
such as disorientation,
dizziness,

188
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,960
nausea, and the like.

189
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,640
Can she be interviewed?

190
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,560
Sure, but don't take too long.

191
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
The worst thing to do

192
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,960
for concussion patients
is overthinking.

193
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Got it. Thank you.

194
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,040
- You're welcome.
- Come on.

195
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,720
Li Shiqing.

196
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,360
There are two officers
here to see you.

197
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
Li Shiqing, right?

198
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm Jiang Feng from the
Criminal Investigation Division.

199
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,560
This is my colleague.

200
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,280
We're here today to
ask you some questions.

201
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,160
She's not stable yet.

202
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
Try to be quick.

203
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,200
Li Shiqing, female,
20 years old.

204
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,000
A junior at Jialin
Normal University, right?

205
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Yes.

206
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,880
At 1:42 p.m. today,

207
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,320
at the intersection at
the river-crossing bridge,

208
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,160
a Route 45 bus collided
with a tank truck,

209
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,800
causing a violent explosion.

210
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
Don't be nervous.

211
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,080
We checked the CCTVs
along the bus route.

212
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,160
Before the explosion,

213
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,600
the bus made an illegal stop.

214
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,160
You got off with
another passenger.

215
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,000
Did I describe the
situation correctly?

216
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Li Shiqing?

217
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I…

218
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,680
I was on a bus.

219
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,000
But as for what you said,

220
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,600
I'm not sure.

221
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,040
You're not sure?

222
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
How about this?

223
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,480
Let us refresh your memory.

224
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,880
Where were you going today?

225
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,440
I think I was going
to buy a book.

226
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,560
Where?

227
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,320
It's at Joint
Publishing downtown.

228
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
The Route 45 bus
goes there directly.

229
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,800
Then why did you get
off the bus early?

230
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,400
Did you see anything
suspicious on the bus?

231
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
Did anyone get into a
fight with the driver?

232
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
Did you hear
anything suspicious?

233
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Did you see anyone suspicious?

234
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,760
I think I fell asleep.

235
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,200
- You fell asleep?
- But you suddenly woke up and got off?

236
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,240
And you didn't get
off at an actual stop.

237
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
I…

238
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
I really can't
remember anything.

239
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,960
Hello? What is it?

240
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,400
Did you find anything?

241
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,760
Li Shiqing has no
criminal record.

242
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
There's no clear motive either.

243
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,640
Her social background
is very simple.

244
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,280
She's just an ordinary
college student.

245
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,320
Aren't you focusing too much

246
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
<i>on a tiny clue?</i>

247
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,640
You saw the CCTV
footage along the route.

248
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,200
Before Li Shiqing was let off,

249
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
the bus was running normally.

250
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,320
<i>But after they got off the bus,</i>

251
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,280
<i>the bus noticeably sped up.</i>

252
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,400
Especially after the
traffic light at the scene,

253
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,360
the bus accelerated
almost immediately.

254
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,480
It doesn't make sense.

255
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,720
The bus made an illegal stop

256
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,120
and was behind schedule.

257
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,960
It's understandable that
they would speed up.

258
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
No.

259
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,000
It's not connected
to the drop-off.

260
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Something is fishy about her.

261
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,720
<i>Nothing she says adds up.</i>

262
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,040
How is the investigation going?

263
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,760
I think I remember something.

264
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
I guess I wasn't feeling well.

265
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,400
That's why the driver
dropped me off.

266
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,760
What was wrong?

267
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,680
It must have been my heart.

268
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Heart?

269
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Do you have a history
of heart disease?

270
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,320
No.

271
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,000
Do we have the cause
of the accident?

272
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,120
<i>We'll have to wait
for the results.</i>

273
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
What Mr. Zhang wants

274
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,680
is for us not to act rashly

275
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,880
without orders from above.

276
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,080
I remember.

277
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,480
I was next to the driver.

278
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,920
I wanted to get off.

279
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,880
There was one person.

280
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,600
They asked me

281
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,600
if we should call an ambulance.

282
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,640
Call an ambulance for you?

283
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,440
Do you remember who it was?

284
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,960
I don't think I knew them.

285
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,640
You remembered that someone
called an ambulance for you.

286
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,600
Do you remember their gender
and physical characteristics?

287
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,600
Sir, she's covered in sweat.

288
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
It's pretty bad.

289
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,160
Do you want me to
get off with you

290
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
and call an ambulance?

291
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
Why don't you let
us off up ahead?

292
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,120
It was a boy.

293
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,680
I think he was going to
call an ambulance for me.

294
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,680
He told the driver to stop.

295
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
He was going to get off
with me and wait for help.

296
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,960
So you got off

297
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,560
and waited for the ambulance.

298
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,120
How did you hurt your head?

299
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,240
Pervert!

300
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,640
Someone is groping me!

301
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,640
I remember now.

302
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,840
I encountered a pervert.

303
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,200
I was going to drag
him to the station.

304
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,480
A pervert?

305
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,400
Yes.

306
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,440
You said you encountered
a pervert, right?

307
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,800
Li Shiqing.

308
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
I must remind you again.

309
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
I don't care if you have amnesia

310
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
or are pretending.

311
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,240
You could be the last witness.

312
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,600
There's a lot at stake.

313
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,240
I hope you can
cooperate with us.

314
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Mr. Zhang.

315
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Mr. Zhang.

316
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,080
Don't get up.

317
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,600
Are you Li Shiqing?

318
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,280
I'm the vice-captain of the CID.

319
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
My name is Zhang Cheng.

320
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,600
Don't be nervous. Let's talk.

321
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Go on.

322
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,720
Li Shiqing.

323
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,400
You said you got off the
bus with the pervert.

324
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,480
Where is the pervert?

325
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,160
I don't know.

326
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,920
I really don't know.

327
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,320
I don't remember.

328
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Are you sure you want to change your
statement to encountering a pervert?

329
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Li Shiqing.

330
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,880
There are serious ramifications

331
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
if you hide anything.

332
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm not hiding anything.

333
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm telling you the truth.

334
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,440
My mind is a mess at the moment.

335
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
But I've told you
everything I can think of.

336
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm not lying.

337
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Li Shiqing.

338
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,440
Let me remind you.

339
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,880
You did get off
the bus with a boy.

340
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,600
But you didn't wait
for an ambulance

341
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,120
or go to a police station.

342
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Miss.

343
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Take it easy.

344
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,520
I'll show you a video.

345
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,560
It might help you
remember something.

346
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,640
Here. Take a look.

347
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,760
THURSDAY, QING
SHUI XIANG, JIALIN

348
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,720
<i>Pervert!</i>

349
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,240
<i>- Sir!
- Are you out of your mind?</i>

350
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,200
I got him killed.

351
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,840
What did you say?

352
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
I…

353
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Get a bottle of water.

354
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,080
Here. Have some water.

355
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Thank you.

356
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Miss.

357
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,880
Do you remember something?

358
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,560
I remember everything.

359
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,880
What do you remember?

360
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,680
All of it.

361
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,480
The entire thing.

362
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Great.

363
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Tell us.

364
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,160
I don't know how to tell you.

365
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
What do you mean?

366
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,440
Do you feel

367
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,520
that some things are difficult

368
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
to explain?

369
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
You two go out first.

370
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,400
Mr. Zhang.

371
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Miss.

372
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,280
I've been a detective
for over 20 years.

373
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,720
I've seen it all.

374
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
This might be
complicated for you.

375
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
I can also see that

376
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
you feel a bit helpless.

377
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,120
But you must trust the police.

378
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,280
Don't hold back.

379
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,440
I was in a dream within a dream.

380
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Hold on.

381
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,720
May I record this?

382
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,000
Here is what happened.

383
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Ms. Wu.

384
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Li Shiqing.

385
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,960
No class in the afternoon?

386
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm going to buy a few books.

387
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,120
Go.

388
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Be safe.

389
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
Bye.

390
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,000
<i>I got on at the University
Town stop by the north gate.</i>

391
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,600
<i>It was the Route 45 bus.</i>

392
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,080
<i>I often take that bus.</i>

393
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,160
<i>So I'm familiar
with the drivers.</i>

394
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,040
Sir.

395
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,600
<i>When I got on the bus,</i>

396
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,000
<i>I saw a lot of
people on the bus.</i>

397
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,440
<i>There weren't many empty seats.</i>

398
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,400
<i>I headed toward the back.</i>

399
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>Please hold on while
the bus is moving.</i>

400
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,840
<i>Next stop, Jiaming
Community Hospital.</i>

401
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,240
I easily get sleepy
when I'm on the bus.

402
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,800
So after a while, I fell asleep.

403
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,520
I don't know how long I slept.

404
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,960
I was out of it.

405
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,440
I think I woke up to the
sound of a phone ringing.

406
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,680
It was

407
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,960
the type of ringtone
from old cell phones.

408
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,320
<i>But strangely, the
sound was so grating.</i>

409
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,360
<i>I opened my eyes.</i>

410
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,800
<i>And I felt like</i>

411
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,520
<i>there was a blinding
light shining at me.</i>

412
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,320
And then all of a sudden,

413
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,480
my face was burning
and tingling.

414
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
And then?

415
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,360
And then…

416
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,400
And then I felt like I
couldn't see anything.

417
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,880
I felt like I was floating.

418
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,000
I felt so light.

419
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,480
And then…

420
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,440
And then it was the second time.

421
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,280
The second time, I
realized when I woke up

422
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,360
that I was still on the bus.

423
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,080
At first, I thought
it was a dream.

424
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,320
<i>But I had a really bad headache.</i>

425
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,480
<i>I thought maybe I
accidentally hit my head</i>

426
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,520
<i>when I was asleep.</i>

427
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,880
<i>So I took out my phone to check.</i>

428
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,760
<i>But I didn't have any
wounds on my head.</i>

429
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
There was no redness or marks.

430
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,640
And then…

431
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,760
I looked out the window.

432
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,680
I felt that the sun
was so blinding.

433
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,360
<i>That's when I realized</i>

434
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,200
<i>I seem to have slept
for a long time.</i>

435
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,000
<i>The bus didn't have
many passengers left.</i>

436
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,920
<i>The boy next to
me was still here.</i>

437
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,200
<i>He was sleeping too.</i>

438
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,200
But then, the ringtone
started again.

439
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Something didn't feel right.

440
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,920
If this really was a dream,

441
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,320
why was even the
ringtone the same?

442
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
It felt very strange to me.

443
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,000
At that moment,

444
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,640
that intense light
appeared again.

445
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,960
But this time,

446
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,800
it was more real than before.

447
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,400
It was clearer.

448
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,960
I could feel it clearly.

449
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,640
It was an explosion.

450
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,560
The bus I was on had exploded.

451
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,040
MESSAGE FROM YE QIAN

452
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,760
THE BOY WHO GOT OFF
WITH HER IS XIAO HEYUN

453
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,320
CURRENTLY IN JIALIN
THIRD HOSPITAL

454
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,280
After two consecutive times,

455
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,320
I guessed

456
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,520
that something strange
was happening to me.

457
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
- So the third time I woke up...
- Li Shiqing.

458
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Take this seriously.

459
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,120
Can't you tell us properly?

460
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,960
We've been here all afternoon.

461
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Jiang Feng, go downstairs.

462
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,240
Go and see what is going on.

463
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Go.

464
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,360
Mr. Zhang.

465
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,560
Do you believe me?

466
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,800
Should I go on?

467
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,440
You've already woken
up three times.

468
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Go on.

469
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
The third time, I
was slow to wake up.

470
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
I thought about what
had just happened.

471
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,920
It was so realistic.

472
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,480
<i>The whole thing felt too creepy.</i>

473
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,200
<i>This isn't a dream.</i>

474
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,720
<i>When I realized that I was continuously
experiencing the explosion,</i>

475
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,400
<i>my first instinct was
to get off the bus.</i>

476
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,840
<i>When I woke up for
the fourth time,</i>

477
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,560
<i>I went straight for
the glass breaker.</i>

478
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,880
But I didn't expect

479
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,040
an alarm to sound
throughout the bus

480
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,920
when the tool was retrieved.

481
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,200
And then,

482
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,200
the bus exploded.

483
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,800
So by the fifth time,

484
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,960
I gave up on forcing
my way off the bus.

485
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,600
I began to think of

486
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,080
different solutions.

487
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,240
Sorry, I…

488
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,120
I…

489
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,280
I saw that you're
covered in sweat.

490
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
Do you want to wipe it off?

491
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,840
Sorry, I…

492
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,480
I didn't mean to.

493
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,160
I wanted to get a tissue.

494
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,320
Then the flash drive was…

495
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Sir, I'm having a heart attack.

496
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,920
Can you take me to the hospital?

497
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,640
- What's happening?
- Is it urgent?

498
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,120
I have to go to the
hospital right now.

499
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,760
Can you take me to
a hospital first?

500
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,720
The nearest hospital
is Third Hospital.

501
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,520
There's a health center
just across the bridge!

502
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,640
Can you hang in there?

503
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,680
Are you okay?

504
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,880
Hang in there for a bit longer.

505
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,400
All I could do was watch.

506
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,840
Watch the clock ticking.

507
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,360
I really didn't know what to do.

508
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,720
But this time,

509
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
the bus was already
at the intersection.

510
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,160
I was looking at everyone.

511
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,360
I was hoping one of
them could help me.

512
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
But no one did.

513
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,240
They all agreed to
cross the bridge.

514
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,720
Except for the boy.

515
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,240
The boy I pulled off the bus.

516
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,000
Sir, she's covered in sweat.

517
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,320
Do you want me to get off with
you and call an ambulance?

518
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,880
It's pretty bad.

519
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,320
It will be bad if
there's traffic.

520
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,080
I have some medicine.

521
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Don't be afraid.

522
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,680
I have all kinds
of medicine here.

523
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,760
Young man, move aside.

524
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,400
What medicine is this?

525
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,816
It's a quick-acting
heart reliever.

526
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,920
Yes, this works.

527
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,040
- This works.
- It's for me and my husband.

528
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,320
These are all our medications.

529
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,240
Don't worry. You will be fine.

530
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,920
<i>I took some medicine.</i>

531
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,600
<i>All I could do was wait.</i>

532
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,520
So I didn't get off
that time either.

533
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,080
But it was also that time

534
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,040
that I saw

535
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,280
the whole process of the
bus hitting the tank truck.

536
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,679
Tell me about it.

537
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
Maybe it was

538
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,080
the driver in a hurry to
drop me off at the next stop.

539
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,199
So when we started moving,

540
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,600
he drove really fast.

541
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,280
At that moment,

542
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,960
there was a delivery vehicle.

543
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,960
It came from the right.

544
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,120
It rushed out very quickly.

545
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Give me a second.

546
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,320
I'll be right back.

547
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,120
Where is her phone?

548
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,320
I have no idea.

549
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
What's wrong?

550
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,760
When you two were
talking to her,

551
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,960
did you tell her any
details about the accident?

552
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,680
No.

553
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,360
Only that a bus and a
tank truck collided.

554
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,360
Nothing else?

555
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
No.

556
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,920
Go check right now

557
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
whether she could
have seen or heard

558
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,400
a report on this accident

559
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,520
before she was
moved to this room.

560
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,600
- Okay.
- Go.

561
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,480
I know.

562
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,400
You will doubt what I said.

563
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,040
Actually, I don't
believe it either.

564
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,720
This is ridiculous.

565
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,000
But I'm not lying.

566
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
I'm telling the truth.

567
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I just had such a
strange encounter.

568
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,960
That was the fifth
time you woke up.

569
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Was there more?

570
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,120
There was also a sixth time.

571
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,440
<i>The sixth time I woke up</i>

572
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,120
<i>I really didn't know what to do.</i>

573
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,840
<i>I also didn't know</i>

574
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,600
<i>if I would wake up again.</i>

575
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,640
Sorry, I…

576
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,760
I…

577
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,000
I saw that you're
covered in sweat.

578
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,840
Do you want to wipe it off?

579
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,920
Pervert.

580
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,560
I didn't mean to. I just…

581
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,640
I wanted to get this tissue.

582
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,480
The flash drive was stuck.

583
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,160
I pulled it out
and my arm slipped.

584
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,800
- I didn't...
- Pervert!

585
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,600
Someone is groping me!

586
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,400
I knew the boy wasn't a pervert.

587
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,280
He just accidentally touched me.

588
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,400
But I was at my wits' end.

589
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,520
I had to frame him.

590
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,240
I wanted to go to the
police station with me.

591
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,920
But unfortunately,

592
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,200
there was a police
station across the bridge.

593
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,200
I had to change plans.

594
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,920
I shouted, "I have to
get off right now!"

595
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,880
Before bus drivers
can report to work,

596
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,080
they all receive training

597
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,360
on how to handle emergencies.

598
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,680
In an unexpected situation such
as encountering a sexual predator,

599
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,440
they will normally
call the police,

600
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,760
lock the doors,

601
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,560
and hand the culprit over to
the police at the next stop.

602
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,200
Why would he make
an unscheduled stop

603
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,840
and let you off?

604
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,080
I don't know.

605
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,280
<i>But I really did
drag him off the bus.</i>

606
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,240
Why did you drag him off?

607
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,440
He's a pervert!

608
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,960
I dragged him off
the bus and then…

609
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,640
And then I didn't
hang around for long.

610
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,760
I just left.

611
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,480
He took a taxi.

612
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
I thought I could save his life

613
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,480
by getting him off the bus.

614
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,960
But it didn't occur to me.

615
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
It backfired on him instead.

616
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,120
Based on what you have said,

617
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,920
you have been on a
time loop on the bus.

618
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,000
A time loop?

619
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Yes.

620
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,720
It's a time loop.

621
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,440
Yes, I have been in a
continuous time loop.

622
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,960
Have you had these
symptoms before?

623
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,120
Or…

624
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,440
Did they start today?

625
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,520
No.

626
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,840
I…

627
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,320
At first, I thought
I was crazy too.

628
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
But…

629
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,880
I asked the doctor.

630
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,720
She said my brain is fine.

631
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,880
I woke up in the morning as
usual and then went to class.

632
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,480
Then I had a meal.

633
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,000
Then I got on the bus.

634
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,720
It started on the bus.

635
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Or…

636
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,840
maybe I should get another exam.

637
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,000
JIANG FENG

638
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
Talk.

639
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,840
<i>Mr. Zhang.</i>

640
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,400
<i>The passenger in the taxi</i>

641
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,200
<i>probably won't make it.</i>

642
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
Okay.

643
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,720
We'll be back.

644
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,280
Get some rest.

645
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,200
If you remember anything
else, feel free to call us.

646
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,760
I told you the truth.

647
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,320
I've told you everything.

648
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,320
Get a female officer.

649
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,840
- Okay.
- Watch her closely.

650
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,120
Call me if you need anything.

651
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Okay.

652
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,640
That dream was
way too realistic.

653
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,200
