1
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
POLICE

2
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,960
The police could find us at any moment.

3
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
Let's sort this out ourselves first.

4
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,520
OVERHEAD WALKWAY, INTERSECTION

5
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,200
BRIDGE APPROACH RAMP

6
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
A total of ten loops have occurred.

7
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,680
This is your tenth time.

8
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,960
My fifth time.

9
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,960
We woke up at 1:36 p.m.

10
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
At the time of the explosion,

11
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,280
I saw it was 1:42 p.m. on my watch.

12
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
The explosion was at the intersection.

13
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,920
The cause of the explosion
was a car accident.

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,280
A tank truck exploded.

15
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,120
The ninth time, we woke up at 1:37 p.m.

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
The time of the explosion…

17
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
We're not sure.

18
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
The location was
the river-crossing bridge.

19
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,840
The blast was caused
by a man-made explosive.

20
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
The eighth time…

21
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,880
The eighth time, I tried
to break the window with the hammer

22
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,920
and was taken out.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
The time when I woke up?

24
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,240
I can't remember.

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,560
I also don't know
the time of the explosion.

26
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,800
The location was still the intersection.

27
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,360
The cause of the explosion
was still a car accident.

28
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,240
The seventh time I woke up,
it was 1:39 p.m.

29
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,480
The time of the explosion…

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,040
Again, I didn't notice.

31
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
The location was still the intersection.

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,240
The cause was still a car accident.

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,280
The sixth time I woke up…

34
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,840
The sixth explosion was at 1:42 p.m.

35
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
1:42 p.m.

36
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,520
EXPLOSION

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,640
In that case,

38
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,160
the sixth and tenth explosions
happened at the same time.

39
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,160
That's likely when the accident happened

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,360
at the intersection.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And look at this pattern.

42
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,760
Every time, we wake up one minute earlier.

43
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,360
In that case,
the eighth time was probably…

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
1:38 p.m.

45
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
The sixth time was 1:40 p.m.

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,880
If the time corresponds to the route…

47
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,240
Every time I wake up,

48
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,400
the view I see outside

49
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,400
is different.

50
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
And the fifth time.

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
The fifth time was the first time
I encountered a car accident.

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
It was also at the intersection.

53
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
That time, I pretended to be sick.

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
So the driver slowed down

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,040
and encountered a red light.

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
The intersection.

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,120
The explosion also happened at 1:42 p.m.

58
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
If that's the case,

59
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
you should have woken up at 1:41 p.m.

60
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,480
Now that you mention it,

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
we do keep waking up earlier.

62
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,760
But what does an earlier time mean?

63
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,160
Jiang Feng.

64
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Go through the east gate.

65
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,400
Observe and keep in touch at all times.

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,920
The first time,

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
when I left school,

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,400
I boarded the bus
at the University Town stop.

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,960
University Town.

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,640
I got on at Gaoxin District.

71
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,840
It's the stop before yours.

72
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,960
When did you wake up?

73
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,720
It's fine. The time of the explosion…

74
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,760
What about the location of the explosion?

75
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,120
Probably on the bridge.

76
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
On the bridge.

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,920
Actually, I'm not sure because…

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,400
It happened so fast.

79
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,160
I was half asleep.

80
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
I only remember the ringtone.

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,760
It's just that…

82
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,480
I had just opened my eyes.

83
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,720
Before I had a chance to respond, it…

84
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
Why did you throw it away?

85
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,040
You can't be hiding anything from me now.

86
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,280
What you said…

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm not hiding anything.

88
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm telling the truth.

89
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,000
I woke up because I heard that ringtone.

90
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,680
I opened my eyes and before I knew it,

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,960
it exploded.

92
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,000
I've told you everything I know.

93
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Have you never trusted me?

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,640
I don't want to be so passive.

95
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,920
Do not let your guard down.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
This is a complex field.

97
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,520
Keep your eyes peeled.

98
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,320
So what should we do?

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,120
Shouldn't we think about

100
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,400
why I'm in a time loop

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,720
and why you're in it too?

102
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,520
The information we have right now

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,840
doesn't answer that.

104
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,880
But we have to find a way
out of the loop, right?

105
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,600
The first time we got off together,

106
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,240
I lived while you died.

107
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,000
We didn't break free.

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,440
We're both alive this time.

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,560
Do you think…

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm a game designer.

111
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,840
Based on conventional game rules,

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,240
the player has to stop the explosion

113
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,920
and save everyone on the bus.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
That's the only way to clear the game

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,920
and break out of the loop.

116
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,920
So you make games.

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
No wonder.

118
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
By the way, I still don't know your name.

119
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,679
Xiao Heyun.

120
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,880
"Heyun" means "crane and clouds."

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,400
-My name--
-Li Shiqing.

122
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,679
You mentioned it to the police.

123
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,720
Actually, during my sixth loop,

124
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
the police questioned me.

125
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,480
They are so sharp.

126
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
That's why I've been worried.

127
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,640
If we end up in the police station,

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
will they let us go that easily?

129
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,880
It's because they are so sharp

130
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
that we have to tell the truth.

131
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,680
Don't complicate things.

132
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,360
Is there no explanation

133
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
that could explain the call

134
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
and be able to convince them?

135
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,320
Think about it.

136
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,240
If we break the cycle this time,

137
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,840
the police will find out
the truth about this bomb.

138
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
We didn't plant it anyway.

139
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,960
We will be found innocent.

140
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Come with me.

141
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Wait.

142
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,160
Why do you want to lie to the police
in the first place?

143
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,720
I'm not trying to lie to the police.

144
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,040
During my sixth loop…

145
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,160
Li Shiqing and Xiao Heyun, right?

146
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,760
I'm Jiang Feng from CID.

147
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,560
Around 1:38 p.m. today,

148
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,840
did you call the police saying

149
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
that there was a bomb on the Route 45 bus?

150
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
Yes.

151
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
We've been trying to reach you
ever since the call.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But your phones have been off, right?

153
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,160
We need to clarify some things with you.

154
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,160
Can you come to the station with us?

155
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Let's go.

156
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,000
Come on, this way.

157
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
Can't we take the same car?

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Separate cars.

159
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
Get in.

160
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,560
Yu Lei.

161
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
I've sent you the best route.

162
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,880
Return to the station.

163
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,880
Okay.

164
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,480

167
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,560
Do you know this road well?

168
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
Not really.

169
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,600
I live and work in Gaoxin District.

170
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,960
I rarely go downtown.

171
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,400
It's a weekday.

172
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,080
Don't you have to go to work?

173
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,160
I was supposed to go
to Digital Plaza for a meeting.

174
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,560
What time?

175
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
2:30 p.m.

176
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,960
It's already past 3 p.m.

177
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,680
I'm already late anyway.

178
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,920
Yes, it's okay.

179
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,240
Your phone has been turned off.

180
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,320
People probably can't reach you.

181
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,680
Right.

182
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
Do you want to make a call?

183
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
Explain it to them.

184
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
No, it's okay.

185
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
Really?

186
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,520
It's okay.

187
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,320
When we get back to the station,

188
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
it will take some time
to understand the situation.

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,560
You'd better take care of this.

190
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Okay.

191
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
LIU PENG

192
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,400
Answer it.

193
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Put it in speaker mode.

194
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,360
<i>What the fuck does this mean?</i>

195
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,080
<i>You have been unreachable.</i>

196
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,280
<i>The investors have been waiting here
for almost an hour.</i>

197
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,280
<i>I've been apologizing like an idiot.</i>

198
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,680
<i>I just haven't gotten on my knees.</i>

199
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,280
<i>Do you still want to make your game?</i>

200
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,240
I'm busy right now. I have to go.

201
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,720
This person is so rude.

202
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
Yes, that's why I turned my phone off.

203
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,600
That girl named Li Shiqing.

204
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
Was she going to the meeting?

205
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,400
No, we just met on that bus.

206
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,240
You just met?

207
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,440
Yes.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
SERVE THE PEOPLE, MAO ZEDONG

209
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,960
JIALIN POLICE

210
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,560
CAPABLE AND SINCERE,
RIGHTEOUS AND JUST

211
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,520
LOYAL AND DEDICATED,
PRAGMATIC AND INNOVATIVE

212
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,280
Hand over your belongings
and electronic devices.

213
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,440
Place your belongings here.

214
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,080
This way.

215
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,920
CASE INVESTIGATION AREA

216
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,960
Sit down.

217
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
Have a seat.

218
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,320
Ms. Du.

219
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
Ms. Du.

220
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
How are things at the scene?

221
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,960
The scene was completely destroyed.

222
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,800
We're still doing search and recovery.

223
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,840
There isn't much.

224
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,600
But for now,

225
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,840
the vehicle's CCTV footage
will be hard to retrieve.

226
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,480
So right now,
these two are our only leads.

227
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,880
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

228
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,240
Both of them have clean records.

229
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,280
I asked the patrol division
to look into it.

230
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,120
What was the situation
when you found these two?

231
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,520
When Li Shiqing
was answering my questions in the car,

232
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
something felt fishy.

233
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,200
Xiao Heyun was very nervous
the whole time.

234
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,800
He said he had just met her on the bus.

235
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,280
But looking at the CCTV footage

236
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,400
or their behavior
when we picked them up at the park

237
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,440
and along the way here,

238
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,440
they didn't just meet.

239
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
It's not just that.

240
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,440
They seem like a couple.

241
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,960
They even wanted to ride together.

242
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,400
Ms. Du, Mr. Zhang.

243
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,840
This balled-up paper

244
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,480
was found in the trash can.

245
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,760
Let me have a look.

246
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
At 1:38 p.m. today,

247
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,880
the police received a call from you

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
stating that there was a bomb
on the Route 45 bus.

249
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,760
Did you make this call
of your own free will?

250
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,640
Yes.

251
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,040
How did you know there was a bomb?

252
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,920
Did you notice any suspicious items?

253
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,600
Then…

254
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,200
Did you hear a suspicious conversation?

255
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
Or…

256
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,080
Did you smell something suspicious?

257
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Nothing.

258
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,480
But you knew there was a bomb on the bus.

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,960
Li Shiqing.

260
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Whether it's a yes or no,

261
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,880
you have to say it out loud.

262
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,280
Do you understand?

263
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,560
After finding out about the explosive,

264
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,800
you chose to immediately get off
and call the police.

265
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Why didn't you inform the driver
when the bus stopped

266
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,400
and evacuate the passengers with him?

267
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,720
Li Shiqing.

268
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,080
Do you recognize this map?

269
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,400
Why were your phones off
after calling the police?

270
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,600
Because we needed time.

271
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,360
That's not what you said in the car.

272
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,040
Because we needed time,

273
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,720
we didn't want to be disturbed.

274
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,520
Those aren't really contradictions.

275
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,680
Why did you need time?

276
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
We needed time to sort out the clues.

277
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,480
The whole thing is so complicated. I--

278
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
What thing?

279
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,920
How do I describe it?

280
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,920
It's just…

281
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,120
It's like a supernatural phenomenon.

282
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,320
Do you read novels?

283
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,560
It's like an infinite loop.

284
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,840
Tell me. Why did you draw this map?

285
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,240
What do these times and numbers mean?

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,560
At 1:42 p.m. today,

287
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,000
about three minutes
after you two got off the bus,

288
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,520
the Route 45 bus that you were on

289
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,800
collided with a tank truck
at an intersection.

290
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,760
No passengers survived.

291
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
Why is the time and location
of the accident

292
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,720
noted here?

293
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,640
Is it a coincidence?

294
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,960
What does this accident
have to do with you?

295
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,200
Mr. Jiang,

296
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,400
I swear I had nothing to do with it.

297
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,520
Let me state this first.

298
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,640
My mind is very clear right now.

299
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,640
And I know what I'm talking about.

300
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,440
But perhaps what I'm about to say

301
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,920
might not be something
a person of sound mind would say.

302
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,240
And I don't think there's any way
to verify the authenticity.

303
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,880
But please believe that
I'm telling you the truth.

304
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,800
It's real.

305
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,520
It's up to us to believe you or not.

306
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,960
What you need to do now is cooperate

307
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,240
and tell the truth.

308
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,200
-Do I need to repeat myself?
-No, it's okay.

309
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,040
I'll start then.

310
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
We are

311
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,160
in a time loop.

312
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,960
-What do you mean?
-We relive this day over and over again.

313
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,960
Li Shiqing has done it
about ten times so far.

314
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,880
Five times for me.

315
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,800
We've experienced the explosions before.

316
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,600
But we come back to life
after the explosion.

317
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,880
We're back on the bus.

318
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,440
We thought the cause of the explosion

319
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,440
was a car accident, like this time.

320
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,480
But we found that the blast still happens
even if we avoid the crash.

321
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,080
That's why we determined
that there was a bomb on the bus.

322
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Xiao Heyun.

323
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,320
So many people died.

324
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,160
We don't have time for this.

325
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,400
I'm not wasting your time.

326
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
We're really in a time loop!

327
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,040
Those are human lives!

328
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
Dozens of lives were lost.

329
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,480
Think it over.

330
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Who is this guy?

331
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,120
A game designer.

332
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,560
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

333
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,920
Ms. Du, what should we do now?

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,480
Yezi, prepare for a drug test.

335
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,520
Ms. Du.

336
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,400
What should we do now?

337
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,720
Mr. Zhang still spoils you too much.

338
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,320
He kept telling me about the time loop.

339
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,920
Ms. Du, how can I stay calm?

340
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,120
Li Shiqing.

341
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,280
I listened to your 911 call
over and over again.

342
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,600
I can tell by your tone
that you were desperate.

343
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,520
You hoped the police
could defuse the bomb in time.

344
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,920
You also hoped
that the explosion wouldn't happen.

345
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,000
I can sense that

346
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,360
you have a lot on your mind.

347
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,360
Tell me.

348
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,760
What worries you?

349
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,080
When we found you at Qingshui Park,

350
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,800
I saw it.

351
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
You were very nervous.

352
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,600
Why?

353
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,320
Mr. Zhang, can I ask you something?

354
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
Of course.

355
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Go ahead.

356
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,120
After you received my call,

357
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,320
did you take it seriously?

358
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,560
Were the officers sent right away?

359
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,080
After receiving the call,

360
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,320
we sent the officers right away.

361
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,280
But there wasn't enough time.

362
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,720
How do you know my last name is Zhang?

363
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,920
When we saw you at Qingshui Park,

364
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,760
only Jiang Feng showed you his badge.

365
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,560
All this time,

366
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,840
I haven't introduced myself to you.

367
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,800
How did you know my last name is Zhang?

368
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,280
Sit down!

369
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,000
Can I go out for some air or something?

370
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,320
It's really stuffy.

371
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,320
Sure.

372
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
But you have to be honest.

373
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,520
I am telling the truth. I…

374
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,400
Why don't you consider this time loop idea

375
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,960
and look at my map?

376
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,600
The time when I woke up.

377
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,240
-The time of the blast--
-The loop again?

378
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,280
If I did it,

379
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,480
why would I call the police?

380
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,960
That doesn't make any sense.

381
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,960
Okay.

382
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,040
Then tell me.

383
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,000
How did you know there was a bomb?

384
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,840
-We're in a--
-Don't talk to me about loops.

385
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,520
Li Shiqing.

386
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,440
Can you tell me

387
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,080
how you know that my last name is Zhang?

388
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,880
You told me yourself.

389
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,680
When did I tell you?

390
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,800
One time at the hospital.

391
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,000
Don't get up.

392
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,000
Are you Li Shiqing?

393
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,320
I'm the vice-captain of the CID.

394
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
My name is Zhang Cheng.

395
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
That time, a motorcycle hit me.

396
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,960
I had a minor concussion.

397
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
I threw up at the time.

398
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
You even offered me water.

399
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,120
<i>You wanted to open the bottle
with your right hand.</i>

400
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,920
-Here. Have some water.
<i>-But you had trouble.</i>

401
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,520
The hospital?

402
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,240
Which hospital?

403
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
When?

404
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,320
I don't recall seeing you.

405
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,240
You wouldn't remember.

406
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,760
Because we met in a time loop.

407
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,520
What did you say?

408
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,520
A time loop?

409
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,880
QUESTION: A TIME LOOP?

410
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,040
I still have to tell.

411
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,920
When I was in the hospital,

412
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,720
I already told you the truth.

413
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,320
But you didn't believe me.

414
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,440
Maybe I didn't think it through then.

415
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
After Xiao Heyun entered the loop,

416
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,640
I finally understood.

417
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,320
We dodged the crash.

418
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
That's when I learned there was a bomb.

419
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,840
Forget it. You still won't believe me.

420
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,080
It's up to us to believe you or not.

421
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,840
We'll investigate further.

422
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,040
For you,

423
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,760
trusting the police

424
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,520
and answering honestly

425
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,960
is your only option.

426
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,480
I'll start from the beginning.

427
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,560
NEXT TIME, DON'T BE RASH.

428
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,520
I TOLD XIAO HEYUN
NOT TO BE RASH NEXT TIME.

429
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,520
BEFORE I FINISHED SPEAKING,
THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED AGAIN.

430
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,680
Anything else?

431
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,320
What number is next?

432
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,720
The ninth time.

433
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,200
Okay, begin.

434
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,640
When I woke up this time,

435
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,560
we finally reached a consensus.

436
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,480
Since the bus was bound to crash
at the intersection,

437
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
we just had to make sure that

438
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,760
the bus crossed
before or after the red light.

439
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,880
We did avoid the crash this time.

440
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,760
But we didn't see it coming.

441
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,800
When the bus got onto the bridge,

442
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,120
it still exploded.

443
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,840
In other words, the car crash
is a variable, a happening.

444
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,720
The bus blowing up?

445
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,720
That's the inevitable.

446
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,560
That's why we chose
to call the police right away.

447
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,800
Does that make sense now?

448
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,200
Actually, the problem now is that

449
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,040
this time, the bus exploded
after a car crash in the intersection,

450
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,000
not on the bridge.

451
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,920
If the bomb was on the bus,

452
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
can you find traces of explosives?

453
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,640
Can that prove that I'm telling the truth?

454
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,200
What do you mean "if there is a bomb"?

455
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,320
You said so many things
with such certainty just now.

456
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,720
Now you're saying "if"?

457
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,120
I'm saying "if"

458
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
because I'm not 100% sure

459
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,240
that the bomb was on the bus.

460
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,040
It could be on the bridge
or coming from somewhere else.

461
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Of course,

462
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,280
the most likely scenario is that
it was on the bus.

463
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Did you check the roof,
the undercarriage, and the interior?

464
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,240
Wait. What's wrong?

465
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,440
I haven't said a word about time loops.

466
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Xiao Heyun.

467
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,600
Did someone threaten you both?

468
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,000
It's okay. You can talk to me.

469
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,960
What is it that you can't say?

470
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,080
There isn't anything I can't say.

471
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,120
I'm telling…

472
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay, think about it.

473
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,360
We have plenty of time.

474
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,080
When you've made up your mind,
we'll continue talking.

475
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,640
THE TRANSCRIPT
IS A TRUE COPY OF MY STATEMENT

476
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720
What do I need to think about? I…

477
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm telling the truth!

478
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,000
Why don't you believe me?

479
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,880
That means that the first, second,

480
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
and ninth time,

481
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
the bus just exploded.

482
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,200
Right?

483
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
You fell asleep the first two times.

484
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,560
Then a cell phone rang.

485
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,080
So you believe

486
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,200
it was a bomb that went off

487
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
instead of

488
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,160
a car accident.

489
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,520
Correct?

490
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,480
Yes, because every time there was
an explosion, I heard that ringtone.

491
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,360
Then how can you be so sure

492
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,240
that the ringtone came from a phone?

493
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,960
Actually, I'm not sure.

494
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,800
But that's the sound
of an old mobile ringtone.

495
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,600
You…

496
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,280
Do you remember how the ringtone goes?

497
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,880
Could it be that

498
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,160
the ringtone is a sort of countdown device
on the bomb?

499
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,000
Or maybe the ringtone
has nothing to do with the bomb.

500
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,280
Someone's phone just happened to ring.

501
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,200
MAY 9TH, 2019, THURSDAY

502
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,440
Ms. Du, the drug test is ready.

503
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,960
Let's get them tested.

504
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay.

505
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,480
A time loop?

506
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,680
How could he spout such nonsense

507
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,960
and more than once?

508
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,080
Mr. Zhang.

509
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,480
What's with that face?

510
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,040
You don't believe it, right?

511
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Then tell me.

512
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,160
What's their motive for lying?

513
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,880
If they had nothing to do with the blast,

514
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,760
there was no need for them
to choose such a detailed lie.

515
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,000
If they had something to do
with the blast,

516
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,760
I don't think either of them
would have called the police

517
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,720
to put on a show for us.

518
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
How did the inquiries go?

519
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,280
Based on what we know so far,

520
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,680
they have simple social lives.

521
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
No vices.

522
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,480
What about relationships?

523
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,800
Nothing.

524
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,840
Officers visited their classmates
and colleagues.

525
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,240
They are both single.

526
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,240
And before this,

527
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,760
their lives never overlapped.

528
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,120
Nor did they have financial
or romantic disputes.

529
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,320
There is no motive.

530
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,280
They don't fit the MO.

531
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,360
But they got off at the stop
before the explosion.

532
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,600
And they drew out a whole diagram.

533
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,280
According to the diagram,

534
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,840
this was a well-planned operation.

535
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
The young woman looks so weak.

536
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,840
In reality,
her mental defenses are strong.

537
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Here's what.

538
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,000
Switch subjects with Jiang Feng.

539
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Okay.

540
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,400
Xiao Heyun, here.

541
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,520
Have a cup of coffee to perk you up.

542
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,520
Do you know what is the sentence
after "Leniency to those who confess"?

543
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,440
Can you tell me if there was a bomb
on the bus or not?

544
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Remember.

545
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,960
"Severity to those who resist."

546
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,920
Game architect.

547
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,280
You're usually very busy with work, right?

548
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,880
You have been here for hours.

549
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,199
Are you bored?

550
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,679
Let me tell you.

551
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,480
If you don't cooperate

552
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,800
and explain everything,

553
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,880
I won't let you leave.

554
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,280
Wait. We don't have to talk so much.

555
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,239
Just tell me.

556
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,520
Was the bomb on the bus or not?

557
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,719
If there was a bomb
and you got off ahead of time,

558
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,200
you two would be the prime suspects.

559
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,760
What did Li Shiqing say?

560
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,000
She knows more than I do.

561
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,320
Go ask her.

562
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
What did she say?

563
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,760
Young man.

564
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
We've been giving you chances.

565
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,480
Things that you tell us on your own

566
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,360
are of a different nature

567
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,120
from things that we find out ourselves.

568
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,960
Do you know what I mean?

569
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,640
That girl is being very cooperative.

570
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
<i>We never saw the bomb.</i>

571
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,600
What if the police ask us
where the bomb was?

572
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,240
-What do we say?
-Tell the truth.

573
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,920
That we've been experiencing a time loop?

574
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,240
They will never believe that.

575
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
<i>They are so sharp.</i>

576
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,480
That's why I've been worried.

577
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,320
If we end up in the police station,

578
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,240
will they let us go that easily?

579
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,280
Is there no explanation

580
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,640
that could explain the call

581
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,920
and be able to convince them?

582
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,120
I don't know what she said.

583
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,000
But every word I said is true.

584
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,840
I have nothing to hide.

585
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,440
Nothing will change
even if you ask me 100 times.

586
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,920
Why are you wasting your time on me?

587
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,920
Then we both need to be ready.

588
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,560
Asking the same questions 100 times
has happened before.

589
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,520
I've made myself clear.

590
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,520
That diagram resulted
from compiling details from our loops.

591
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,000
It includes our waking time

592
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,760
and the time and location of explosions.

593
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,400
You can take another look.

594
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
And?

595
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,760
Well, I…

596
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,120
I've told you so many times.

597
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,480
There's no need to ask anymore.

598
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,760
Don't you have security cameras?

599
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,920
You can go back and check the CCTV.

600
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
I've already said what I had to say.

601
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,040
I can't help it if you don't believe me.

602
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,200
Do you mean that

603
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,080
she instructed you

604
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,560
to come up with this story?

605
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,760
That's not what I meant.

606
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,760
I compiled it myself.

607
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,320
You compiled it yourself?

608
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,280
You mean that

609
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,840
she wants to deceive the police.

610
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,080
<i>And then you helped her come up
with a time loop as an excuse.</i>

611
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,720
<i>You two are using this story
to deceive the police.</i>

612
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
Can I interpret it that way?

613
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Li Shiqing.

614
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,760
I suggest you come clean.

615
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,760
Xiao Heyun has identified you.

616
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,320
He identified me?

617
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,520
What did he identify me for?

618
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,800
He says he doesn't know anything
about the incident.

619
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,280
And judging from the CCTV footage,

620
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,720
you pulled him off the bus.

621
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,080
He said he drew this
based on your descriptions.

622
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,840
He only knew the terrain

623
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,600
but not the details.

624
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,080
You told him what happened.

625
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
No way.

626
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,320
We experienced everything together.

627
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,120
Li Shiqing.

628
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,760
If you still won't tell us
the whole story,

629
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,240
we'll accept Xiao Heyun's identification
of you as the main culprit.

630
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,680
This will count against you
during your sentencing.

631
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,040
So I hope you can be honest with me.

632
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,600
Who is behind this incident?

633
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
To what end?

634
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,200
I wish I knew.

635
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,360
Ms. Du.

636
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,400
The test results show no issues.

637
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,120
Hello?

638
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,360
I got it.

639
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,040
Xiao Heyun drew this, right?

640
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,880
I want to hear it from you.

641
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,200
What kind of role did Xiao Heyun play

642
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,040
in this traffic accident?

643
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,520
Xiao Heyun said

644
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,280
that this was a traffic accident?

645
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,160
<i>Circumstances have changed.
Pause interrogation.</i>

646
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,720
Mr. Jiang, you're lying, right?

647
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,960
I'm sure you already know.

648
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,360
This isn't a simple car accident.

649
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
JIALIN POLICE

650
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,280
Ms. Du.

651
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,960
The explosive residue
was detected at the scene.

652
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,920
It was on the bus.

653
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
There was a bomb.

654
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,080
It's a different story now.

655
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,000
Someone from the city is coming.

656
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,120
We can't report on some time loop.

657
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,480
So what now?

658
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,600
Process them for detention.

659
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,000
Xiao Heyun and Li Shiqing

660
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,440
are the prime suspects.

661
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,680
Xiao Heyun is emotionally unstable.

662
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,120
He has a weak mind.

663
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,200
Let's start with him first.

664
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,840
Xiao Heyun.

665
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm the deputy director
of Jialin Police Station.

666
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,800
You're now a prime suspect
in the Route 45 bus bombing.

667
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,960
You'll be detained according to the law.

668
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,840
Wait.

669
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,920
I have no motive or means.

670
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,480
How can you detain me without proof?

671
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,040
We have confirmation.

672
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,920
There were explosives on board.

673
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,320
<i>The bus is moving. Please hold on tight.</i>

674
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,840
<i>Next stop, Yanjiang West Road.</i>

675
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,760
