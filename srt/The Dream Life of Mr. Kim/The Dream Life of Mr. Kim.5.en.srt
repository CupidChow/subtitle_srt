00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,768
Once he's all done,

3
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,145
you take some sand
and sprinkle it on top.

4
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,939
ASAN FACTORY
SAFETY MANAGEMENT TEAM LEADER

5
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,066
Let it harden.

6
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,944
Then you just sweep it up.

7
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,655
FIRST DAY AT THE ACT ASAN FACTORY

8
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,198
And just toss it out like this.

9
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,200
-What?
-Easy, right?

10
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,452
The dog food is over there.

11
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,621
And you can just give him tap water.

12
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,665
Apparently,
it's better because of the minerals.

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,418
-But--
-Poop starts to smell when it piles up.

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,878
So dump it out fast.

15
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,338
Why should I--

16
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,424
After 6 p.m.,
the security guard will take over.

17
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,926
But during work hours,

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,595
remember that this is our job.

19
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,096
Hang on a minute.

20
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,516
Why would the Safety and Health Manager
have to do something like this?

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,476
If you step in poop, you could slip.

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,396
And slipping is dangerous.
It's a safety concern.

23
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,357
If you don't pick up after him,
it'll smell.

24
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,819
The smell attracts bugs.
And that's a health concern.

25
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,238
These are your duties. Your duties.

26
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,032
Okay, got it.

27
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,743
That pretty much covers the handover.

28
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,703
-Sorry?
-Do you smoke?

29
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,705
All you've shown me
is how to unclog a toilet

30
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,291
and how to clean up dog poop.

31
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,250
Is that it?

32
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,335
Come with me.

33
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,795
This way.

34
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,181
Listen carefully.

35
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,391
I'll only explain once.

36
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,023
May 20th, Tuesday.

37
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,524
SAFETY CHECKLIST

38
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,027
Put a circle here, here, and here.

39
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,947
Throw in a triangle or two
from time to time.

40
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,284
Then switch back to circles.

41
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,163
And at the end of the month,
you take a picture of all of these

42
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,456
and make a PDF.

43
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,625
-A PDF.
-Then send it to headquarters.

44
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,834
-Okay.
-But

45
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,253
no one really reads it.

46
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,342
One more thing. A delivery truck
needs to leave here at noon.

47
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,426
Okay.

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,513
Check if they loaded up the truck properly
so nothing falls off.

49
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,139
I'm sure they will.

50
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,101
Still, give the securing strap
a little shake like this.

51
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,228
And if it's loaded perfectly,

52
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,523
simply sign whatever
the logistics guy gives you.

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,777
And before the shift starts,
we do safety exercises.

54
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,614
You'll need to demonstrate
the exercises in front of people.

55
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,826
-Me?
-Yes, you.

56
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,705
It's tough for introverts.
It wasn't easy for me, either.

57
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,541
I think we've covered everything.

58
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,751
So, do you smoke or not?

59
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,464
But come on.
More than a hundred people work here.

60
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,633
Don't we need proper safety management?

61
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,345
Do you have a license?
For industrial safety?

62
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,097
-No.
-Exactly.

63
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,890
You and I are the same.

64
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,851
You can't manage what you don't know.

65
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,564
If you're not going for a smoke,
I'll just go say bye to the dog,

66
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,233
lay low somewhere, and clock out.

67
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,317
Take it easy.

68
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,737
Shoot. I almost forgot.

69
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,905
Here.

70
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,909
Give us a call
if you're planning a company dinner.

71
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:03,952
ACT CHICKEN

72
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,538
No other place around here
can handle a 120-serving order.

73
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,749
I'll throw in a lot of freebies, okay?

74
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,294
And if you're interested,
you can even ask about opening a branch.

75
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,088
Well, I'm off for real now. Good luck.

76
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,135
Sooner or later,
reality will hit you hard.

77
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,555
Give me a call once it does.

78
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,432
Later.

79
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,227
Hello, there.
I opened a fried chicken place.

80
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,689
Here. I'll give you plenty of freebies.

81
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,024
Come by sometime.

82
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:43,825
Attention, all employees.
Thank you for your hard work this morning.

83
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,537
Lunchtime is until one o'clock.

84
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,000
We hope you all enjoy your lunch.

85
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,544
CAUTION: DOOR NOT IN OPERATION
DO NOT OPEN

86
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,428
Lunchtime!

87
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,249
Are they running like that
just to eat a little sooner?

88
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,210
So uncivilized. Just barbaric.

89
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,045
-Excuse me.
-Jeez.

90
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,548
You're the new team leader
of the Safety Management Team, right?

91
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,507
Yes.

92
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,593
Follow me now.

93
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,428
The truck. Right.

94
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,016
It seems to be loaded properly.

95
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,101
Please sign here.

96
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,562
Okay.

97
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,775
Go!

98
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,485
Aren't you going to eat?

99
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,615
Why does everyone love running so much?

100
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:13,790
ACT ASAN FACTORY

101
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,337
RICE KEEPS US GOING!
SAFETY KEEPS US WORKING!

102
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,299
ONLY WHAT YOU CAN EAT

103
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,557
Jeez, I forgot about this.

104
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,852
At lunchtime, make sure you run,

105
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,022
or there'll be nothing left
when you get here.

106
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,777
The line is…

107
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,880
Seriously?

108
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,298
Excuse me.

109
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,217
Excuse me, ma'am.

110
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,302
Yes?

111
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,637
There's no seaweed soup left.

112
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,849
We're all out.

113
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,226
Hi, Auntie.

114
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,770
Come on in.

115
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,979
Go ahead.

116
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,314
Thank you.

117
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,149
-Take care.
-You too, Auntie.

118
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,568
What? You said you were out.

119
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,945
Sorry.

120
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,155
Unbelievable.

121
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,536
Gosh.

122
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,206
All right.

123
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,801
Attention, employees.
Did you enjoy your lunch?

124
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,013
The afternoon shift will begin shortly.

125
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,018
Please return to your workstations
and prepare for your duties.

126
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,198
EPISODE 5
SERVING MY OWN BOWL

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,763
What about underwear?
Shall I send more?

128
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,806
UNDERWEAR

129
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,017
No, I have plenty.

130
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,436
What about socks?
Do you need more?

131
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,147
I have plenty of socks too.

132
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,316
I'll be home every weekend. Stop worrying.

133
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,820
There's a washing machine
and a dryer here.

134
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,196
It's not some prison cell.

135
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,408
Give me a break. Do you even know
how to use a washing machine?

136
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,245
Come on. I'm a general manager
at an IT company.

137
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,958
That has nothing to do with IT.

138
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,420
So, how is it?

139
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,172
Are the people there nice?

140
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,510
Who cares if they're nice or not?
I won't see them for long.

141
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,223
Seriously,

142
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:21,019
can you really go back to headquarters?

143
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,646
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

144
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,356
I'm only here temporarily

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,901
to get some experience
before becoming an executive.

146
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,569
That's enough nonsense. Just hang up.

147
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,446
Okay. All right.

148
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,573
I'll make you
some more side dishes next week.

149
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,576
Sorry, I was just so busy this week.

150
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,996
Make sure you eat well, okay?

151
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,873
Okay.

152
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,416

154
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,673
Why is she so nice to me?

155
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,890
How can you, of all people, do this to me?

156
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,434
What did I do so wrong?

157
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,157
Get back to work.

158
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,578
You don't have to see me out.

159
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,205
Don't. It's fine.

00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,814
I'LL CALL OFTEN
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, SU-GYEOM

164
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,002
Honey, here.

165
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,171
Something to eat in the car.

166
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,590
And I packed a few things
you like to eat at night.

167
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,801
Make sure to put the rest in the fridge

168
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,178
as soon as you get to the dorm, okay?

169
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,264
Okay. You packed so much.

170
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,099
-Go back to sleep. It's fine.
-Okay.

171
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,101
You're carrying too much.
I'll go with you.

172
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,937
Don't worry. I'm okay.

173
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,815
You don't have to see me out.

174
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,532
Go inside.

176
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:56,878
Damn it.

177
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,130
How do you do this thing?

178
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,673
Two, three.

179
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,086

00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,671

00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,386
Five, six, seven, eight.

183
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,472
One, two, three, four.

184
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,308
Five, six, seven, eight.

185
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,852
Two, two, three, four.

186
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,896
Five, six, seven, eight.

187
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,314
FOLLOW THE PROCESS
FOLLOW THE RULES

188
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,108
One, two, three, four.

189
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,361
Five, six, seven, eight.

190
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,155
Two, two, three, four.

191
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,783
Five, six, seven, eight.

192
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,494
One, two, three, four.

193
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,537
Safety slogan, ready!

194
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,289
Safety slogan, start!

195
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,001
Helmet, check!
Uniform, check! Safety shoes, check!

196
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,587
-Good, good! Safety!
-Safety, safety, safety!

197
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,465
Less doubt…

198
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,676
-More determination!
-More determination!

199
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,216
SAFETY MANAGEMENT TEAM

200
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,343
RECEPTION, PAYMENT

201
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,639
February 30th? Really?

202
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,599
SAFETY CHECKLIST

203
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,059
Jeez, how half-assed can they get?

204
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,478
SAFETY CHECKLIST
ACT, 2024

205
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,857
Goodness.

206
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,694
What am I even doing here?

207
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,410
Should I seriously consider
joining Sang-cheol's company?

208
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,998
Damn it.

209
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,798
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

210
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,428
Finally, a reply after two full days.

211
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,930
I'LL KEEP IN TOUCH
STAY HEALTHY

212
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,056
Okay, good luck.

213
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,519
Baek Jeong-tae,
I respect your stupid decision.

214
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:03,022
But you're the one who said we must take
responsibility for our choices.

215
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,690
Let's see how well you can handle

216
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,401
the ACT Sales Team
floundering without Kim Nak-su!

217
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,863
No, that's not… Gosh, hang on a second.

218
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,533
Mr. Kim. I mean, Mr. Song. It's Kukkiwon.

219
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,576
They're furious
because their stream is too choppy.

220
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,953
What do we do?

221
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,205
Mr. Kim was the expert
at handling stuff like that.

222
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,416
-Should I call him?
-What the hell are you all talking about?

223
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,751
Give it to me.

224
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,461
Here.

225
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,214
This is Do Jin-woo,
general manager of the ACT Sales Team.

226
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,674
The connection is slow?

227
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,553
Turn the modem off and on again.

228
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,806
It doesn't work? In that case…

229
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,642
Unplug it and plug it back in.

230
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,644
It still doesn't work?

231
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,313
-No way.
-Then unplug it and plug it back in.

232
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,443
Why don't you give it a whack?
Give it a good-- Hello?

233
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,362
One person leaves,

234
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,031
and in just three days,
a year's worth of work goes to waste!

235
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,449
You said you could handle it!

236
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,452
That's why I put you in charge
of Team 1 as well!

237
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,954
You shouldn't have said that!

238
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,539
SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

239
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,792
Whatever. Just go.

240
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,381
And you, punk!

241
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,260
How could you shuffle into
a managing director's office in slippers?

242
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,928
Am I a joke to you?

243
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,513
-I'm sorr--
-Get out!

244
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,310
Damn it!

245
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,115
Nak-su, is that you?

246
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,909
It's me, Jeong-tae.

247
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm so very sorry, but…

248
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:48,127
it looks like we'll need you
to come back.

249
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,465
Everything is falling apart
without you here.

250
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,555
Come on, man.
You're embarrassing yourself.

251
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,852
Attention, all employees.

252
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,314
Thank you for your hard work this morning.

253
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,444
-Lunchtime is until one o'clock.
-That was a good nap.

254
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,156
We hope you all enjoy your lunch.

255
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,659
I should pick up that dream
where I left off.

256
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,203
Lunchtime!

257
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,587
Goodness gracious.

258
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,255
You're late!

259
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,216
Come on! Hurry!

260
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,386
Sign here.

261
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,892
Go! I'm late!

262
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,300
STRAWBERRY YOGURT

263
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,100
It's one per person.

264
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,560
Excuse me?

265
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,020
I said it's one per person.

266
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,356
There's a lot left, though.

267
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,401
Some people eat late
once their shift is over.

268
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,153
We should save some for them.

269
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,409
You see, I didn't get any soup yesterday.

270
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,454
Sorry?

271
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,249
I said I didn't get any soup yesterday.
The seaweed soup.

272
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,211
How does not having soup yesterday

273
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,174
justify taking another yogurt today?

274
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,926
She's got a point.

275
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,596
You see…

276
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,058
I'm from the Sales Team at headquarters.

277
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,101
And?

278
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,394
What?

279
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,813
What am I supposed to do
with that information?

280
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:17,401
Did headquarters tell you
to take two yogurts?

281
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,363
What's with this attitude?

282
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,157
-You're just a kid.
-What's going on?

283
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,242
Is this guy giving you a hard time?

284
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,202
"This guy"?

285
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,412
I don't know.
He said he's from headquarters,

286
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,830
so he wants an extra yogurt.

287
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,750
-What?
-When did I say that I could have two

288
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,627
because I'm from headquar--

289
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,295
Which team are you in?

290
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,005
I'm the Safety Management team leader.

291
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,509
I demonstrated the safety exercise
this morning, remember?

292
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,968
Which team at HQ are you from?

293
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,970
-What's going on?
-This morning…

294
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,097
Why are you giving me

295
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,725
such a hard time over an extra yogurt?

296
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,768
Maybe he's constipated.

297
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,687
He probably got two
at headquarters.

298
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,022
Just let him have another one.

299
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,482
Whatever.

300
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,319
-Let him have it.
-Gosh, you people have no manners at all!

301
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:05,157
I've worked at ACT for 25 years.
That's 25 years!

302
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,785
I shouldn't be humiliated

303
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,120
for having an extra yogurt!
This is absurd.

304
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,039
-Let him have it.
-Let him.

305
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,374
-Let him!
-Give it to him!

306
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,668
-Even at HQ, he's been…
-How ridiculous.

307
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,752
I won't have it.

308
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,713
My goodness. Forget it.

309
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,937
-I was just…
-It's one per person.

310
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,356
I guess they get two
at headquarters.

311
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:50,327
Attention, all employees.
Did you enjoy your lunch?

312
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,665
The afternoon shift will begin shortly.

313
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,587
Please return to your workstations
and prepare for your duties.

314
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,641
My day of getting scolded
over an extra yogurt

315
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,769
by a girl young enough
to be my daughter is finally over.

316
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,446
Song-hee!

317
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,073
Sorry, but where did you leave
the cabinet key?

318
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,036
It's under the orchid pot by the window.

319
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,995
Thank you.

320
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,707
-Things are hectic without me, huh?
-Mr. Jung. The orchid!

321
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,417
-This one?
-Is it there?

322
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,461
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

323
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,338
He should have told us before he left.

324
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,547
Took us forever to find this!

325
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,424
Why the heck did he leave it there?

326
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,176
What's that, Mr. Do?

327
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,053
These were buy-one-get-one-free.

328
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,804
-Have some.
-Thank you!

329
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,556
-Thank you.
-Mr. Do, which one do you want?

330
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,058
I'll have whatever is left.

331
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,061
Do Jin-woo!

332
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,687
Do Jin-woo!

333
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,066
-Do Jin-woo!
-Do Jin-woo!

334
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,744
See you!

335
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,288
PROMISE TO WORK SAFELY

336
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,418
ACT ASAN FACTORY

337
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,588
Like the receding tide,
the employees leave one by one,

338
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,216
leaving just the security guard, me…

339
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,766
and this little guy.

340
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:42,898
Oh my.

341
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,985
Have a good night.

342
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,697
What's wrong?

343
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,550
I was told that after works hours…

344
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,825
We're all out.

345
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,660
-Take care.
-You too, Auntie.

346
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,287
What? You said you were out.

347
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,496
Sorry.

348
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,584
Okay, good luck.

349
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,838
Did headquarters tell you
to take two yogurts?

350
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,109
You should've just let him
have the yogurt.

351
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,577
This is wrong. This can't be happening.

352
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,165
This can't be the way things end
for General Manager Kim Nak-su,

353
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,252
the great everyman of Korea!

354
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,762
Hurry!

355
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,098
Run faster!

356
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:50,359
ONE MONTH LATER

357
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,462
You piled that on.

358
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,965
But the funny thing is…

359
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,592
Mi-ra,
why are you nibbling like that?

360
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,803
-You have to eat it like this.
-Whatever.

361
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,515
-You're eating like crazy.
-I was starving. You know, I…

362
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,816
-Think about it.
-You don't want it?

363
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,234
Let me. Here.

364
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,827
That's a wrap.

365
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,705
From now on,
if you have anything to report,

366
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,624
just tell me in person.
No need for a written report.

367
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,127
Instead of wasting time
on the font and formatting,

368
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,253
just come see me.

369
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,421
Wherever works for you.

370
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,173
-It can even be the staff lounge.
-Okay.

371
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,424
-Yes, understood.
-Yes.

372
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,843
But not in the restroom.
It's a bit awkward.

373
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,346
It's so lame, but it's funny.

374
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,682
-The best kind of lame joke.
-Keep it down.

375
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,643
I don't believe that I'm always right.

376
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,812
So, in regard to the way
our integrated team is run,

377
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,273
if you have any suggestions
or anything you'd like to discuss,

378
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,983
please feel free to speak up.

379
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,360
I'm ready to listen.
That's all. Thank you.

380
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,034
Ik-hyeon.

381
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,704
I think we should get together
for a team dinner.

382
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,080
-What do you think?
-Sounds great.

383
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,457
Great.

384
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,958
I look forward to working with you.

385
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,293
Okay.

386
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,713
I'm happy to work with you.
Looking forward to working together.

387
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,383
Mr. Song, I'd like to call today

388
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,385
"The Spring of ACT."

389
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:45,182
Are you saying that Mr. Kim is a tyrant?

390
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,935
"If you succeed,
you'll become an executive."

391
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,811
"If you fail, you'll get demoted!"

392
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,605
Stop it. Don't you believe in karma?

393
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,898
Okay.

394
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,317
I bet you're happy too, right?

395
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,611
Aren't you?

396
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:03,158
We used to waste three days a week
making presentations that only we'd see,

397
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,453
so it's nice to save that time.

398
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,248
See? He's with us.

399
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,124
He doesn't want Mr. Kim to come back.

400
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,752
Still, I feel bad for him.

401
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,337
It could happen to any of us.

402
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,714
And I worry about
how he must be adjusting.

403
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,134
Then you should take
the Asan business trip next month.

404
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,970
-You could say hi to him.
-Good idea.

405
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,181
Ready? Rock, paper, scissors.

406
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,225
No scissors! Rock, paper, scissors.

407
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,477
I said no scissors.

408
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,853
Have a safe trip.

409
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,673
GANGDONG REAL ESTATE EXAM ACADEMY

410
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,224
Gosh.

411
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,559
What's with the sigh?

412
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,565
I really can't afford
to take this exam a third time.

413
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,026
What's with the jitters?
Just pass the exam.

414
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:22,904
I can't keep chipping away
at my husband's severance pay.

415
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,240
I really can't fail this time.

416
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,075
I have to pass this time too.

417
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,036
I have to. No matter what.

418
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,496
What page are we on?

419
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,749
-Page 114.
-This…

420
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,463
The words are easy, but the meaning isn't.

421
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,672
Then just memorize it.

422
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,067
Okay.

423
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,034
All right.

424
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,374
Damn it.

425
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,625
Hot!

426
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,128
Jeez.

427
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,134
Goodness.

428
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,445
Hot!

429
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,199
Their chicken tastes great
even when it's cold.

430
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,827
Mr. Kim.

431
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,623
Hi.

432
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,749
Have you had dinner?

433
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,335
No, not yet.

434
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,130
OLD-FASHIONED FRIED CHICKEN

435
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,302
Enjoy your meal.

436
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,682
Let's ask Dal-jae
to grab a pizza on his way back.

437
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,100
Why did she even ask?

438
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,185
I'm starving here.

439
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,197
There shouldn't be any traffic.

440
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,216
Honey?

441
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,691
What took you so long?

442
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,027
Su-gyeom, you should get home earlier.

443
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,246
Ta-da!

444
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,275
-What are you doing?
-Drink it.

445
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,235
Work.

446
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,153
TO BE DESTROYED
THE CULTURE OF POINTLESS PARTIES

447
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,446
Done.

448
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,200
I'll report it to the CEO now.

449
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,535
Now?

450
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,328
We're in the middle of a party.

451
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,748
The CEO's the one who said
not to separate work from play.

452
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,959
Fine.

453
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,510
-You have to drink that.
-Again. Do it again.

454
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,095
-Why?
-Do it again.

455
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,430
Hey!

456
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,028
It's 9:00 now.
Why aren't they coming home?

457
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,907
Where are they?

458
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,172
She's not even picking up her phone.

459
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,883
Hello, honey?

460
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,635
-Hi.
-What is it?

461
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,886
What are you doing?

462
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,221
INTENSIVE COURSE DISCOUNT

463
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,598
You see, I'm…

464
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,433
I'm…

465
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,728
I'm watching a movie
with Ha-yeong right now. What is it?

466
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,396
When will it be over?

467
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,649
It just started,
so probably around eleven o'clock.

468
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,859
What's wrong?

469
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,487
No, it's nothing. Enjoy the movie.

470
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,282
Okay. Take a cab on your way here.

471
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,617
I mean, on your way home.

472
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,576
Okay.

473
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,249
She could've watched it with me.

474
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,568
DAD

475
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,238
What's up?

476
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,325
No, it's nothing.

477
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,129
The person you are trying to reach.…

478
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,465
A meeting at this hour?

479
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,841
What a liar.

480
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,929
Gosh.

481
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,563
Those are Dad's shoes.

482
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,774
They are.

483
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,698
What do we do now?

484
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,369
God, you scared me!

485
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,621
When did you get home?

486
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,415
I brought chicken. Let's eat.

487
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,251
I'm not that hungry.

488
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,212
I'm good too, Dad.

489
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,798
Really? I guess it's a little late.

490
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,051
I'll take it to Asan and eat it there.

491
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,054
No way. Let's eat together.

492
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,514
-It's okay.
-It looks good.

493
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,932
-You don't need to.
-Sit.

494
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,185
It's been a while since we had
a late-night snack. Let's eat.

495
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,772
Let's dig in.

496
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,857
Thank you for the food.

497
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,817
Thank you.

498
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,079
It's gone cold.

499
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,497
Their chicken is usually good.

500
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,132
Now that you're here, you can take
some side dishes back with you tomorrow.

501
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,802
It's fine. The cafeteria food is good.

502
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,971
You have to eat healthy.

503
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,348
It's fine. The food's good there.

504
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,391
Su-gyeom.

505
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,644
What have you been up to?
You come home so late.

506
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,982
I guess I have been.

507
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,984
What did I do today?

508
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:00,487
What do you mean?

509
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,385
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

510
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,763
Two, two, three, four.

511
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,266
Five, six, seven, eight.

512
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,310
One, two, three, four.

513
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,687
-Logistics Team!
-Five, six, seven--

514
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,980
Where are you going?

515
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:41,694
Six, seven, eight.
Two, two, three, four.

516
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,863
-Let's unload it.
-Five, six, seven.

517
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,573
Forklift's coming through!

518
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,450
Two, three, four.

519
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,411
Good! Lower it down. Lock it in!

520
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,665
One, two, three, four, five…

521
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,923
Don't you have any earplugs?

522
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,842
-What?
-Don't you have these?

523
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:07,220
You could lose your hearing,
so make sure you wear earplugs.

524
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,391
-Thank you.
-No problem.

525
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,439
Have some ice cream
and cool off, everyone.

526
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,607
Come on over.

527
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,943
Snack time!

528
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,988
I was roasting in there.

529
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,322
Thank you.

530
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,832
Thanks for the ice cream!

531
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,709
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

532
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,799
Come and get it.

533
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,926
-Thank you.
-Wow, it's so sweet.

534
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,928
Who else wants ice cream?

535
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,263
Here.

536
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,199
The outer diameter is off.
Just reduce it a little bit.

537
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,910
-Then--
-Not the extruder's temperature.

538
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,953
Make a fine adjustment to the mold.

539
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,163
-Okay.
-Good.

540
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,915
It's okay. I'll finish up here.

541
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,500
We just need to check on the pump line.

542
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,668
Okay. Go on.

543
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,014
It's time to go home.
Aren't you going home, Ms. Lee?

544
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,099
Sorry, what was that?

545
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,438
Do you have any plans for tonight?

546
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,148
Are you working overtime?

547
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,442
I wish.

548
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,235
Overtime and extra shifts are on hold.

549
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,072
Why do you ask?

550
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,950
If you're free,
would you like to have dinner?

551
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,534
Or drinks, if you'd prefer.

552
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:57,080
I feel like we haven't talked much.
I mean, ever.

553
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,539
Just the two of us?

554
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,500
Yes, why not?

555
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,543
It's my treat.

556
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,253
What do you like, Ms. Lee?

557
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,507
I noticed a place down the road from here

558
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,426
that serves pork belly
grilled in an earthenware jar.

559
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,223
If we're having pork belly,
why don't we just eat it here?

560
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,558
We've got a grill, tongs, and everything.

561
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,518
Here?

562
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,106
-I mean…
-Ju-young!

563
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,440
Could you come here?

564
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,566
Okay!

565
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,404
Come to the Safety Management
Team office at 7:00.

566
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,197
I'll have everything ready.

567
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,824
Okay then.

568
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,659
-I'll see you later.
-See you.

569
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,537
What's wrong with eating out?

570
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,663
-I almost forgot.
-What?

571
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,916
We have everything but meat.

572
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,543
Oh, the meat.

573
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,671
Can't meet without some meat.

574
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,423
Here. Pork neck for me.

575
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,383
-See you later.
-See you.

576
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,551
I'm coming!

577
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,099
STARTUP EXCESSES

578
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,019
This company's biggest issue
is that we have endless meetings,

579
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:04,063
but they rarely lead to
any productive outcomes.

580
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,108
Most of them just end at the idea stage.

581
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,861
-It was you, right?
-No.

582
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,903
Come on.

583
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,948
-Focus.
-Also,

584
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,908
the culture of frequent partying

585
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,745
has done us more harm than--

586
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,414
-JJ?
-Hey, it's JJ.

587
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,083
-JJ?
-I guess he's in Korea.

588
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,253
It lowers productivity,

589
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,131
-and the company's direction--
-Su-gyeom, I'm so sorry. One second.

590
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,299
Who's free tonight?

591
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,093
It's DJ Kloud's listening party,
and he said he can get us good seats.

592
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,553
Oh, me!

593
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,013
-Me!
-Sounds fire.

594
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,892
What about Su-gyeom?

595
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,980
Our CDO's probably
sick of parties for a while.

596
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,610
-What does that mean?
-It doesn't mean anything.

597
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:52,862
You hate parties.

598
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:56,240
That's why you're giving
this presentation, isn't it?

599
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,742
That's not what you meant.

600
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,163
This should be fun.

601
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,169
I'm really sorry. Can you continue?

602
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,670
Our Chief Destruction Officer.

603
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,840
What's your problem?

604
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,344
What are you doing?

605
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,388
What?

606
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,812
I can't do this anymore!

607
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,690
CDO
KIM SU-GYEOM

608
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,735
What's with him?

609
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,810
-So you're quitting?
-Yes!

610
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,646
This isn't the right way to resign.

611
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,189
You're the biggest problem.

612
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,150
-And you, you, you, all of you!
-Me?

613
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,651
What the heck are you doing here?

614
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,278
Aren't we going to work?

615
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,698
What exactly do you mean by "work"?
Be specific.

616
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,534
Don't order me around.
You've never been specific about anything.

617
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,786
That's because I'm the one
who sets the direction.

618
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,955
Cut the crap, you prick.

619
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,957
I'm done putting up with your nonsense.

620
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,710
I'll just keep living my life,

621
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,962
true to myself,

622
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,006
and my Korean roots.

623
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,092
Don't look down on that, punks!

624
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,219
There's greatness in it.

625
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,138
-Okay, that greatness--
-Shut up!

626
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,617
It's ready, right?

627
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,494
Shall we dig in?

628
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,798
Go on then.

629
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:19,800
Sorry?

630
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,053
Wasn't there something you wanted to say?

631
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,311
Well…

632
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,564
What's the secret to your leadership?

633
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:34,732
What?

634
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,444
I was also a team leader
at headquarters for a long time,

635
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,405
but you know how subordinates
are never on the same page.

636
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,491
They only look out for themselves.

637
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,785
You know what I mean, right?

638
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,786
I'm not so sure.

639
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,831
I've noticed that people here
really seem to look up to you.

640
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,500
You think?

641
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,710
Tell me. What's your secret?

642
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,712
Do you just shower them with praise?

643
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,131
And then discipline them
if they're out of line?

644
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,342
-Excuse me?
-I mean…

645
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:07,223
I was wondering if you have
your own management philosophy.

646
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,310
And if I do?

647
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,357
I was wondering if I could get
a quick tip from you.

648
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,359
A quick tip?

649
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,451
First of all,

650
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,622
once or twice a month,

651
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,625
I run a book club with the staff.

652
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,878
A book club…

653
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,882
Like for Dale Carnegie's
How to Win Friends and Influence People?

654
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,385
Yes.

655
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,845
And every quarter,

656
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,347
we put on a play.

657
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,766
-A play?
-Group meditation too.

658
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,561
I see. Group meditation.

659
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,360
You're lying, aren't you?

660
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,656
You think this is funny?

661
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,075
Yes, I do.

662
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,244
Jeez.

663
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,538
We don't have time for any of that crap.

664
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:16,292
We're all exhausted.
We just want to get wasted and pass out.

665
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,420
Carnegie…

666
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,631
I'm your senior, and I'm trying to learn.

667
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,841
The least you could do

668
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,719
is make an effort to answer
when I ask something.

669
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,638
-What would you use my advice for?
-What do you think?

670
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:33,100
I was going to use it once I became
an executive at headquarters.

671
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,436
You're going back to headquarters?

672
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,896
Of course.

673
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,440
Why? You don't think I can?

674
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,609
No, I don't.

675
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,077
Don't you know what kind
of position you have now?

676
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,497
Under the Serious Accidents
Punishment Act,

677
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,792
workplaces with 100 or more employees
are required to have a safety manager.

678
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,337
But it doesn't matter who it is.
They just need to fill the spot.

679
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,130
The final stop

680
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,425
for ACT's overpaid office workers
with no real skills.

681
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,844
That's where you are, Mr. Kim.

682
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,306
I'm sorry if that sounded harsh,

683
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,102
but we're the ones who take the hit
whenever they send non-experts here.

684
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,520
You see this?

685
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,064
I got injured last year
while loading cargo.

686
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,335
Then what should I do? Tell me.

687
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,839
I've been working for 25 years,
and this is the first time

688
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,466
I've spent an entire day
at work doing nothing.

689
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,051
Okay?

690
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,222
I don't want to just sit around.
I want to work.

691
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,559
So tell me what to do.
I really don't know. Please?

692
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,979
I'm not talking about picking up dog poop
or those pointless safety exercises.

693
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,480
I mean real work!

694
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,857
There is no such thing.

695
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,528
You don't need to learn anything,
and we don't need your help either.

696
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,115
Just keep a low profile

697
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,201
and leave whenever you want.
That's all you have to do.

698
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,579
Come on.

699
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,456
There is one thing.

700
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,458
Since it's summer,

701
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,836
please make sure to change
the dog's water more frequently.

702
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,296
It's summer, after all.

703
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,686
SALARY ENDS
BUT RENT DOESN'T

704
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,772
ACT CHICKEN

705
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,487
Just keep a low profile

706
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,823
and leave whenever you want.
That's all you have to do.

707
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,496
I'd forgotten.

708
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,165
This is a demotion, an exile,

709
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,919
a punishment meant
to make me quit on my own.

710
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:11,217
It's time to make a decision.

711
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,232
What's this?

712
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:31,904
What is this?

713
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,618
MARCH 14, 2007
I THINK I'M IN BIG TROUBLE

714
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,454
MARCH 23, 2007
NOTHING TO DO

715
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,830
MARCH 18, 2007
MISS MY KIDS

716
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,875
This is an exile diary.

717
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,254
I'm home.

718
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,677
What are you doing, Mom?

719
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,845
Studying.

720
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,517
Aren't you meditating?

721
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,018
This is part of my studies.

722
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,436
Okay.

723
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,481
L, D, S, P,
P, D, D, F, C, T, S, V.

724
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,484
L, D, S, P, P, D, D, F, C, T, S, V.

725
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,986
M, W, B…

726
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,112
REAL ESTATE EXAM PREP

727
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:16,991
SUSPENSION OF BUSINESS

728
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,077
M, W, B, C, L, C, P.

729
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,246
M, W, B, C, L, C, P.

730
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,832
M, W, B, C, L, C, P.

731
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,426
JUNE 17, 2008
CONTINUING THE DIARY

732
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,802
WHY SHOULD I CLEAN THE DOG POOP?

733
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,681
It's so long. My gosh!

734
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,391
…A BOSS WHO GOT THE JOB
THROUGH CONNECTIONS

735
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,615
NOVEMBER 17
HQ CALLED AGAIN

736
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,575
I FELT LIKE I COULD MATTER AGAIN

737
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:14,715
My nickname is "Amatani."

738
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,383
The Ohtani of amateur baseball.

739
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,469
Invite me sometime.

740
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,221
I don't know much about baseball.
I only play soccer.

741
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,307
I play soccer too.

742
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,558
Invite me sometime.

743
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,560
I'm the Haaland of amateur soccer.

744
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,605
Dude, I've seen you play. Haaland?

745
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,650
I took lessons and got better, man.

746
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,902
You must be athletic. Let's play sometime.

747
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,903
-Really?
-Yes.

748
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,987
That would be great.

749
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,530
MR. KIM NAK-SU

750
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,950
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

751
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,712
Mr. Kim! Hello.

752
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,047
Hello, it's me.

753
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,424
How have you been, sir?

754
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,842
Cut the crap.

755
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,679
You've been sucking up to Do Jin-woo
all morning, huh?

756
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,680
Of course not.

757
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,184
A man of principle
doesn't serve two masters, Mr. Kim.

758
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,229
Then how come
you haven't called in a month?

759
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:14,274
I've been busy preparing for the wedding.
A man's got to marry, right?

760
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,777
Okay. I need to ask you for a favor.

761
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:21,240
Of course. Anything. Go ahead.

762
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,910
A few years ago…

763
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:25,869
Yes.

764
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,878
17TH REAL ESTATE LICENSE EXAM

00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,131

1ST SESSION
TIME: 100 MINUTES

776
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,545
You may begin.

777
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,386
Did you look into it?

778
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,278
Ms. Lee, just look at him.

779
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:40,420
Attention, all employees.
Thank you for your hard work this morning.

780
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,550
Lunchtime is until one o'clock.

781
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,011
We hope you all enjoy your lunch.

782
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,557
Lunchtime!

783
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,282
All good!

784
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,784
-Give it to me!
-Sign here.

785
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,341
Hurry!

786
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,527
Did you look into it?

787
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,196
Yes, Mr. Kim.

788
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,115
I asked a colleague in HR,

789
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,534
and just like you said,
there was only one person.

790
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,329
Someone who came back
to headquarters from the factory.

791
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,999
It's Executive Director Sim Gang-hun.

792
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,251
Back in 2008,
he went through the same thing you did.

793
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,462
He was sent to the ACT
Tech Safety Management Team,

794
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,965
then came back to headquarters
and even became an executive director.

795
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,349
I practically begged and managed
to get his contact information.

796
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,934
I'll text it to you.

797
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,562
By the way,
how did you find out about this?

798
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,482
LESS DOUBT, MORE DETERMINATION

799
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,418
What?

800
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,053
What's going on?

801
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,068
Go around! No!

802
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,085
DECEMBER 16, 2008

803
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,753
After 182 days in this hell,

804
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:31,091
I'm finally returning to headquarters.

805
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,761
Don't you lose hope.

806
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,056
It's your turn now.

807
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,148
I'm not running for food.

808
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,276
And it's not to beat this girl either.

809
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,863
I'm running to prove
that this punishment was wrong.

810
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,031
So that I, Kim Nak-su,

811
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,700
can return as General Manager Kim
of ACT Group.

812
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,662
That's why I'm running.

813
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:23,852
Enjoy your meal.

814
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:30,067
And you can wash the water bowl

815
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,860
if you adore the dog that much.

816
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,450
I'm going back. No matter what.

817
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:48,794
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

818
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,087
You little… Come here!

819
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,937
Let's bring Kim Nak-su back to HQ, sir.

820
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,399
The only person
I can ask for help with this

821
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,443
is you, sir.

822
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,029
-Sung-gu!
-Mr. Kim!

823
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,614
Still, you should treat him well.

824
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,532
You might end up working for him again.

825
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,493
Your humble subordinate, Kim Nak-su,
is here to greet you.

826
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,456
You don't have anyone else
to count on in the Sales Team, anyway.

827
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,999
Shouldn't you put in more effort

828
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,460
at times like this to secure your career?

829
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,254
The Asan factory
is the HR Team's biggest battle this year.

830
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,380
Sir.

831
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,591
We need your help.

832
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:01,718
Ha-jin, I'm sorry.

833
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,595
I really messed up.

834
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,680
