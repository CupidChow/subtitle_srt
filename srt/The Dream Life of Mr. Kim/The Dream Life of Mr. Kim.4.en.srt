00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,424
HWAUNJANG INN

3
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,430
ALARM
7:00 A.M., SUNDAY, JULY 5

4
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,956
Assistant Manager Baek.

5
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,625
Mr. Baek.

6
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,961
-Get up.
-Why?

7
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,920
Come on, get up.

8
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,172
Jeez.

9
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,593
Gosh.

10
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,765
Change into these.

11
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,143
What? Oh, okay.

12
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,694
Goodness.

13
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,239
"Our company's VDSL internet speed…"

14
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,491
"Our company's VDSL…"

15
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,582
"Our company's VDSL internet speed…"

16
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,253
"…averages 46 Mbps for downloads
and 10 Mbps for uploads."

17
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,340
"ACT also has
a much lower number of service issues…"

18
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,302
"ACT also has a much lower number
of service issues…"

19
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,388
Honestly, this car is way too slow.

20
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,600
Yes, it's pretty slow.

21
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,102
How are we supposed to make any sales
with a car this slow?

22
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,604
Why don't you try that again?

23
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,273
"ACT has far fewer…"

24
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,652
"ACT has far fewer service issues
compared to other companies."

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,030
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,990
Don't I look like Leslie Cheung?

27
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,201
Gosh.

28
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,536
Sorry. I almost cursed.

29
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,791
"ACT has far fewer service issues
compared to other companies."

30
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,751
That's it! You got it!

31
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,643
-Thank you!
-Sure.

32
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,727
Thank you.

33
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,312
ACT, please come in.

34
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,522
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

35
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,111
-Hello!
-Hello!

36
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,993
Thank you. We'll send you a contract.

37
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,332
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

38
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,458
Thank you so much!

39
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,961
Naraecom, please come in.

40
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,933
Sauna? Day drinking?

41
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,560
Let's hit the sauna first.

42
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,061
-Sauna!
-I'm exhausted.

43
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,136
MISSED CALLS
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

44
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,121
Hey, can we meet?

45
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,379
You sounded depressed on the phone,
but you seem to have a huge appetite.

46
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,218
It's a mystery.

47
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,512
I seriously had no appetite at home,

48
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,722
but seeing you brought it right back.

49
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,682
How strange.

50
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,976
-So what are you going to do?
-What do you mean?

51
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,730
You can't become an executive now.
Are you going to keep working there?

52
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,316
Hey, who says I can't?

53
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,069
If you caused that much trouble,
you're done for.

54
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,655
Haven't you heard a thing I said?
I took care of it.

55
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,199
Fixing a problem you caused
is nothing to brag about.

56
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,534
You're just back to square one.

57
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,785
I can make up for it.

58
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,997
Do you really think
you'd have enough time to do that?

59
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,459
Jeong-tae

60
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,086
would never betray me.

61
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,504
He can't.

62
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,714
Your mentor who's a managing director now?

63
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,802
Good God, Nak-su.

64
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,805
Executives are always
on the company's side.

65
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,307
You're not in a gang.
It's not about loyalty and betrayal.

66
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,600
What the hell would you know?

67
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,978
You're walking around in slippers
in broad daylight.

68
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,938
You don't know anything
about major corporations.

69
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,648
Why did you call me, then?

70
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,068
I had no one else to call.

71
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,905
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

72
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,789
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Hi.

73
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,875
Sorry to interrupt you.

74
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,752
We want to tell you about
a great commercial building.

75
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,547
-Here.
-Thanks.

76
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,465
If you invest now,

77
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,135
you'll be able to collect
about six to seven million won in rent.

78
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,929
It's under construction now
at a third-generation new town.

79
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,683
We're currently offering a special
discount on our company-owned units.

80
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,310
We only have a few left.

81
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,853
We'll offer a special discount

82
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,646
below the market price.

83
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,398
Right. We'll think about it.

84
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,441
Sure.

85
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,985
Construction will finish in a few months,
so you'd better hurry.

86
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,653
-Okay.
-Thank you.

87
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,572
-Bye, then.
-I…

88
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,159
SALARY ENDS
BUT RENT DOESN'T

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,661
Hey, let me take a look.

90
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,789
Kim Nak-su. Listen to me carefully.

91
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,417
If you want to survive
your remaining 50 years,

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,127
firstly, you should get rid of

93
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,879
-pamphlets like these.
-Hey!

94
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,172
What's wrong with you?

95
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,050
Secondly,
if you're just having three beers,

96
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,928
don't spend over 1,500 won on snacks.

97
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,014
Jeez. You own a building.

98
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,559
If you're collecting 30 million won
in rent, spend some money.

99
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,019
Help keep the economy moving.

100
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,855
This is how I bought a building,
you idiot.

101
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,111
Gosh.

102
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,580
People these days
have so much money to throw around.

103
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,165
All done.

104
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,625
-Thank you. Bye.
-Thank you.

105
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,377
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

106
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,213
This is the latest model
that can connect to your phone.

107
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,965
It's… expensive.

108
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,008
It's expensive.

109
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,095
They're showing off in front of me
on purpose, right?

110
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,972
Thank you so much, guys.

111
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,224
Mom, this is way better than ours.

112
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,726
It's a higher-end model
that came out last month.

113
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,853
Ha-jin.

114
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,606
-Move over.
-Hey!

115
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,900
Ha-jin, did you ask him?

116
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,859
What?

117
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,278
Did you ask Nak-su
about Sang-cheol's business?

118
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,280
No.

119
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,326
We treated you to an expensive hotel meal.
What were you doing all this time?

120
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,744
I was busy.

121
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,038
Why would you be busy? You're not working.

122
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,206
What about you, then?

123
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,375
What do you do besides
group buying enzyme supplements?

124
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,252
I'm studying for a certificate.

125
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,004
What certificate?

126
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,632
Pet funeral director.

127
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,842
Isn't that awesome?

128
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,804
That did seem pretty promising.

129
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,431
Right?

130
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,268
I actually studied for the real estate
license exam for a while.

131
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,651
Sang-cheol! Mom!

132
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,529
Ha-jin's trying
to get a real estate license.

133
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,740
Hey, what's so funny about that?

134
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,825
-With your brains?
-My goodness.

135
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,704
You're 50, and you still haven't realized
you're not cut out for studying?

136
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,498
-Mom!
-For real. She's so funny.

137
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,877
Ha-jin,
that's a government-issued license.

138
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,336
You know that?

139
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,464
She must think
it's like a driver's license.

140
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,506
Unbelievable.

141
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,633
Give it a try. I'm sure you'll do well.

142
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,843
Oh, right!

143
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:16,306
I'm getting a fully featured SUV
in two months.

144
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,851
If you pass the exam,

145
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,645
I'll give it to you.

146
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,397
-I mean it.
-Honey.

147
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,024
What if she really does pass?

148
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,652
I mean, it's not
that I don't want to give it to you.

149
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,823
I'll give it to you completely new
and with the plastic covers still on,

150
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,533
as soon as it gets here.

151
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,785
I mean it.

152
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,828
Honey, stop it.

153
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,705
What?

154
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,541
Ha-jin got a driver's license.
I'm sure she can do this too.

155
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,294
You can do it, Ha-jin.
I'm sure you can pass.

156
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,138
EPISODE 4
HANGING BY A THREAD

157
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,872
Hey, were you busy?

158
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,666
Yes.

159
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,377
I took a pretty long nap.

160
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,336
I see.

161
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,422
What's the occasion?

162
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,841
Well…

163
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,260
Let's have dinner sometime.

164
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,263
Of course. Sounds great.

165
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,722
Do you have time next week?

166
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,891
Well…

167
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,184
How about tomorrow, then?

168
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,853
Tomorrow?

169
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,604
Is that inconvenient for you?

170
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,136
Well, I…

171
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,484
-What about Tuesday?
-Jeong-tae.

172
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,403
Why don't you come over next weekend?

173
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,488
To your house?

174
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,490
Yes. My wife said

175
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,034
she hasn't seen you in a while,
so she'd like you to come.

176
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,661
Well, that's…

177
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,705
Oh, I wouldn't want to impose.

178
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,165
It's completely fine.

179
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,001
Why don't you come over next week?

180
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,503
Next Sunday evening.

181
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,422
Nak-su, let's just eat

182
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,383
near the office on a weekday after work.

183
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,428
Please, I really want
to treat you to a proper meal.

184
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,514
Just come over
next Sunday evening, all right?

185
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,724
My goodness.

186
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,475
It's settled, right? Bye, then.

187
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,402
He's being so difficult.

188
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,574
I need to buy some time.

189
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,284
Buy time for what? What's going on?

190
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,746
-Ha-jin.
-Yes?

191
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,457
Help your husband out this one time.

192
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,084
If you need to,
hire someone to help you cook.

193
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,169
I'll help too.

194
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,756
Is something going on?

195
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,550
No, not at all.

196
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,470
I'm just inviting Jeong-tae over
to seal the deal.

197
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,597
Honey.

198
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,390
It's okay. Trust me.

199
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,808
It's fine.

200
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,692
Honey, about Sang-cheol…

201
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,652
Sang-cheol?

202
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,320
What about him?

203
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,740
Did he not say anything
when you met that YouTuber?

204
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,533
No. What do you mean?

205
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,620
Wait.

206
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,914
How do you know about that?

207
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,708
Is it wrong for me to know?

208
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,918
So what's this about?

209
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,797
Well, Sang-cheol's going to launch
his own business soon.

210
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,132
And?

211
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:42,428
It's going to be something big
related to fintech.

212
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,846
So?

213
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,432
If, by any chance,

214
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,559
you don't become an executive this year,

215
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,396
do you have any other plans?

216
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,355
You want me

217
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,816
to work under Sang-cheol
if I don't get the promotion?

218
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,569
He can give you a much better offer.

219
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,417
What are you saying about me
behind my back?

220
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,004
I didn't say anything.

221
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,880
You must have said something about me

222
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,633
that made Sang-cheol want
to ask me to work for him.

223
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,262
I was only asking for your opinion.

224
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,306
A better offer?

225
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,018
Have you been telling your sister's family

226
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,186
about my salary and everything?

227
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,606
No, Sang-cheol just looked it up himself.

228
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,192
That brat thinks money is everything.

229
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,611
He's just a clueless techie.

230
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,031
Does he think
he's working in Silicon Valley or what?

231
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,741
How dare he?

232
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,743
-Honey.
-Jeez.

233
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,828
Even though he's family,

234
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,705
you could at least think about it.

235
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,791
It's not like he's going to make you
clean the building.

236
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,878
He'll be treating you
as an experienced professional.

237
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,880
Experienced professional?

238
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,632
You think it's really me that he wants?

239
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,092
Then what?

240
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,179
It's this, okay?

241
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,057
The connections of a general manager
at a major corporation.

242
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,850
Don't be stupid.

243
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,227
If I go there, he'll just use me for that

244
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,730
and kick me out.
You really think he won't do that?

245
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,316
Even if I don't get a promotion,
I'll never work for him.

246
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,318
I've made myself clear,
so go and tell him that.

247
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,321
Why are you going around
saying useless stuff about me?

248
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,911
Fine, do whatever you want.

249
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,623
What about you, then?
Do you think you're some top-tier talent?

250
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,333
Jeez.

251
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,836
Do you think you're the only
general manager in the country?

252
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,588
-Stop it.
-If you're so great,

253
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,215
why did you get help from Sang-cheol?

254
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,885
You should've told him what you just said,
"I can do everything on my own."

255
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,095
That's different.

256
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,972
He contacted me first and offered to help.

257
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,268
Do you know why he called you?

258
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,308
…got an email from ACT's Sales Team 1,
asking me to take the video down.

259
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:02,068
Why should I take down my video?
Why should I? Why?

260
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,618
Sang-cheol.

261
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,288
You said you were close to him, right?

262
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,418
Well, he's an acquaintance.

263
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,753
Then could you

264
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:25,425
give my husband
a chance to talk to him in person?

265
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,009
You asked him to help?

266
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,386
Yes.

267
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,223
I thought you'd be
having a lot of trouble at work,

268
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,267
so I helped you out.

269
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,769
Does that hurt your pride too?

270
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,398
Hey. Kim Nak-su.

271
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,276
Jeez.

272
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,154
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

273
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,366
You don't know how to be grateful.

274
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,493
You think you got this far on your own.

275
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,787
-That's enough.
-Your personality isn't great, either.

276
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,707
You're so touchy and cranky with others.

277
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,835
You really are the worst, Nak-su.

278
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,546
You're being way too harsh.

279
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,966
It doesn't matter if it's Jeong-tae
or the president himself,

280
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,885
I'm not doing anything.

281
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,969
Honey.

282
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,182
Cook braised ribs
or handmade noodles all by yourself.

283
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,392
Do it on your own.

284
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,437
Honey, you agreed to help me just now.

285
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,063
When did I agree?

286
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,861
I've done enough.

287
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,199
I raised Su-gyeom,
and I did my duties as a daughter-in-law.

288
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,577
I helped you protect your pride.

289
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,787
-Honey.
-Our married life…

290
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,917
is entering a new chapter.

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,126
What are you saying?

292
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,127
Got that?

293
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,506
Hey, you're scaring me. Come on.

294
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,257
Honey!

295
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,653
-Mr. Kim…
-Is Mr. Kim still not here?

296
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,863
It's strange for him to be late.

297
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,701
You're here, Mr. Kim.

298
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,286
This is quite heavy.

299
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,289
What is all this, sir?

300
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,875
This is for you, Song-hee.

301
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,710
And Sung-gu.

302
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,170
-Here.
-Hang on.

303
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,214
Why are you so startled? Here, Ik-hyeon.

304
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,340
Thank you, sir.

305
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,259
Are you…

306
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,595
collecting reward points for something?

307
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,930
What do you mean?

308
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,308
It's nothing. Thank you, sir.

309
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,518
Right--

310
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,602
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

311
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,187
Are you…

312
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,857
-quitting?
-Hey.

313
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,569
Is it that strange for me
to buy you coffee?

314
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,238
-No, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

315
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,864
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

316
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,120
Why don't we go talk on the rooftop?

317
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,124
-Sure.
-After I put this down.

318
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,625
-Okay.
-Good.

319
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,878
Let's go make some sales.

320
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,761
Right now?

321
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,057
Let's think of this week
as a special sales week

322
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,436
and get out there.
It's been a while, hasn't it?

323
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,898
Sir, I have a lot of work piled up,
so I can't really go out.

324
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,775
Do…

325
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,777
Do you have that much work?

326
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,822
You told us to come up with

327
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,491
five new product ideas last time.

328
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,787
Well, you can take your time on that.

329
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,834
Sir, how about we go for a smoke?

330
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,210
I didn't bring my cigarettes.

331
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,295
I have some.

332
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,757
-Don't talk behind my back.
-Come on.

333
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,680
I'm sure you felt it,
but they're not pleased.

334
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,974
Why is everyone so harsh on me?

335
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,893
What did I do so wrong?

336
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,895
This is just like politics.

337
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,731
It's hard to get anything done
without good approval ratings.

338
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,232
I'm on your side,

339
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,110
but if you tell me to abandon my work
to go make sales,

340
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,570
that's still going to be tough.

341
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,989
So what am I supposed to do?

342
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,452
What you need right now is populism.

343
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,245
Coffee and donuts won't cut it?

344
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,622
Of course not, sir.

345
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,500
We're not soldiers waiting
for the church to hand out snacks.

346
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,591
All right.

347
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,683
Help me out, guys.

348
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,395
If you do, I'll repay you
with great performance reviews.

349
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,440
You'll be promoted to assistant manager,
then manager, and senior manager.

350
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,735
I promise to give you
great performance reviews.

351
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,028
Prepare for promotion!

352
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,196
-Yes!
-Yes!

353
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,240
Big success!

354
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,033
Promotions for everyone!

355
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:01,992
One more time!

356
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,577
Big success!

357
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,455
Promotions for everyone!

358
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,546
I'll be a manager!

359
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,973
Then Ik-hyeon will go on his own.

360
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,057
Sung-gu, you're with me.

361
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,058
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

362
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,310
Song-hee's planning our routes,
so let's hurry.

363
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,603
-Okay.
-Are there any cars left?

364
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,689
We didn't book any in advance,
so there's only one.

365
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,816
Then hurry up and reserve it.
We can't lose it.

366
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,860
I'll use my car.

367
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,403
I'll look for the car,

368
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,196
-so go get the keys.
-Okay.

369
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,573
Hey, wait!

370
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,408
You should tell me the plate number.

371
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,492
It's 7982.

372
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,994
Okay. 7982.

373
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,454
I'll go on ahead.

374
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,247
Okay. Be careful.

375
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,417
All right. 7982.

376
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,545
Where's 7982?

377
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,258
It's 7982.

378
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,093
Where is it?

379
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,352
Jeez.

380
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,356
Mr. Kim.

381
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,359
It must be an old car, judging by the key.
Did you find it?

382
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:18,861
Here it is.

383
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,529
Where?

384
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,073
This one.

385
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,787
Darn it.

386
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,288
Holy crap.

387
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,415
-My goodness.
-Does this thing even move?

388
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,709
Open the door.

389
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,960
Okay.

390
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,880
Oh my.

391
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,718
The mileage is lower
than I thought, though.

392
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,053
Just 280,000?

393
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,931
It was too big to go make outside sales,
so we hardly drove it.

394
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,850
And it's a manual.

395
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,646
Why didn't they get rid of this car?

396
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,981
-Should I drive?
-Pardon?

397
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,107
I'll do it.

398
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,461
Gosh, it's working.

399
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,674
I feel like this might be a sign.

400
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,113
Mr. Baek.

401
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,698
Hey.

402
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,907
Hello, sir.

403
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,702
Where is everyone?

404
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,830
They're working off-site.

405
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,248
All three of them?

406
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,374
Yes.

407
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,293
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

408
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,169
When do you think they'll be back?

409
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,214
Well… I'll check.

410
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,883
No, it's fine.

411
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,259
Okay.

412
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,221
-Keep working, then.
-Okay.

413
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,441
Let's see.

414
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,109
Make a list of our top renewal partners…

415
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,193
CONTRACTED COMPANIES

416
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,070
…and send it to Mr. Song.

417
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,071
B ROUTE, MR. SONG

418
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,993
Then a list of the companies
unlikely to renew…

419
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,787
A ROUTE, MR. KIM AND MR. JUNG

420
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,039
Send to Mr. Kim.

421
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,169
He's the general manager, after all.

422
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,211
SALES TEAM 1 GROUP CHAT

423
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,171
SEND FILE

424
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,631
You got Song-hee's file, right?

425
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:48,218
-Yes, I got it.
-We'll be going clockwise from Namyangju.

426
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,554
You start in Bucheon
and just cover the whole area.

427
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,555
Yes, sir.

428
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,514
Good luck.

429
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,766
I'll see you tomorrow, sir.

430
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,684
Good luck.

431
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,603
All right.

432
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,898
Gosh, I drove this car for a few years
when I was an assistant manager.

433
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,191
I haven't been in it since.

434
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,442
Really?

435
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,153
This car is as old as my son, Su-gyeom.

436
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,321
Isn't that funny?

437
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,822
Su-gyeom's in college already.

438
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,867
You look happy, sir.

439
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,579
It's been a while
since I've felt this good about work.

440
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,414
Let's go.

441
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,707
Let's go!

442
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,182
Aren't you just ignoring them?

443
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,605
It's just a cultural difference.

444
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,273
What?

445
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,122
If you drink facing each other,
that means you're equals.

446
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,499
But we think that's disrespectful
to your elders.

447
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,876
So,

448
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,256
we lower our heads or turn to the side.

449
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,757
-Like this?
-Yes.

450
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,720
Have you made up your mind, then?

451
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,645
I'll shatter it.

452
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,648
Like a bird breaking out from its shell,

453
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,568
I'll break your company's shell

454
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,362
so that you guys can fly.

455
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:37,786
CDO
KIM SU-GYEOM

456
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,430
CDO, CHIEF DESTRUCTION OFFICER
KIM SU-GYEOM

457
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,644
It took you long enough to decide.

458
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,314
I'm not easy to convince, you know.

459
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,820
Your eyebrows are the same
as when you were little.

460
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,073
What?

461
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,660
You brought this too.

462
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,287
Yes.

463
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,416
I'll look forward to your work.

464
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,896
Let's get to work.

465
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,314
HANJEON KKE

466
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,818
I don't think we can do it.
Our budget was cut by 30% this year.

467
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,320
If you use our ultra-low-cost
maintenance package,

468
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,114
you won't have to replace any equipment.

469
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,365
If you look here,

470
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,284
it's only 890,000 won a month
for a yearly contract.

471
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,495
For just an extra 150,000 won,

472
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,330
you'll be assigned
a dedicated security team.

473
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,500
So we'll be able to respond in real time

474
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,253
and instantly block
any external hacking attempts.

475
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,672
It would be rock-solid security!

476
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,683
ENERGY DRINK

477
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,229
We'll cover the full cost
of the server replacement.

478
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,232
Plus a 7% discount on the fees.

479
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,734
Hang on. Sir?

480
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,195
We're offering a special discount
as a token of gratitude

481
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,989
since you're serving our country.

482
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,657
Get out.

483
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,410
ACT makes my blood boil.

484
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,829
I promise to oversee
the maintenance myself, sir.

485
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,872
Sir, let's go.

486
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,957
You can call me late at night
or on holidays.

487
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,625
-Let's go. Come on.
-I'll come right away.

488
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,544
-We'll visit again.
-Even on Christmas Eve.

489
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,296
-Are you kidding me?
-Please just…

490
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,630
Get out of my sight!

491
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,759
-This--
-Excuse me.

492
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,429
Hello. I'm from ACT.

493
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,097
You're here for the renewal.

494
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,933
-Yes.
-Process the renewal. So…

495
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:05,893
Right.

496
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,104
-Here, have one.
-Thank you.

497
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,814
-It's done.
-All done?

498
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,025
REST AREA

499
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,200
Mr. Kim.

500
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,285
Here.

501
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,244
Gosh.

502
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,917
Nice.

503
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,547
It's my first time making
20 outside sales in a single day.

504
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,382
We haven't even done half yet.

505
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,720
It seems like Song-hee gave us
the tougher of the two routes.

506
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,096
That Song-hee…

507
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,103
We should head back now.

508
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,272
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

509
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,149
Why don't we just stay somewhere nearby?

510
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,359
Pardon?

511
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,946
I mean, we'll have to go to Seoul,
then back here again tomorrow.

512
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,032
I'm sure it would be exhausting
to go back and forth.

513
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,498
Actually, never mind.
It's not the '90s anymore.

514
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,624
Let's go.

515
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,043
I love the idea, Mr. Kim.

516
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,211
What?

517
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,004
I'll drive this time.

518
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,174
Get in, sir.

519
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,218
-Are you sure?
-You must be tired.

520
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,683
WIN REAL ESTATE EXAM ACADEMY

521
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,560
-I just told you.
-You're canceling your refund?

522
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,605
So you're enrolling again?

523
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,357
Yes.

524
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,819
But the course has already started.

525
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,154
I'll study hard and catch up.

526
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,866
All right. Wait a moment.

527
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,997
Hi, we've got a bit
of a tricky case here right now.

528
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,665
THE 2024 HALL OF FAME
FASTEST EXAM PASSERS

529
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,417
Can she join in the middle of the course?

530
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,504
I know it's not allowed,
but can't we make it work?

531
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,548
Right.

532
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,553
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

533
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,014
UNIT ENTRANCE

534
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,932
Did Ha-jin say she was coming to visit?

535
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:09,891
No.

536
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,900
Hello.

537
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,447
Put it in writing!

538
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,407
An agreement?

539
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,825
When is your car being delivered?

540
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,453
Why are you asking?

541
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,746
If I pass the exam,

542
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,624
you'd better give me that car
like you said!

543
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,209
Make a written agreement!

544
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,669
Excuse me,

545
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,254
Ha-jin…

546
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,131
Ha-jin.

547
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,884
Were you that upset about what I said?

548
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,970
You said that I could never pass the exam!

549
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,681
Of course you can't. Not with your brains.

550
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,559
All right, then.
So let's put it in writing.

551
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,186
Don't go back on your word later.

552
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,479
Ha-jin.

553
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,647
Ha-yeong, that's my eighth wedding
anniversary gift--

554
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,858
Fine! I'll write an agreement.

555
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,401
Honey!

556
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,572
But Ha-jin,

557
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,826
that car's fully featured,
so it's about 90 million won.

558
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,829
If you fail, what will you give me?

559
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,374
What?

560
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,583
I mean, think about it.

561
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,627
This is such a one-sided bet, isn't it?

562
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,671
You should put something on the line too.

563
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,134
You want me to bet something, too?

564
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,807
Never mind.

565
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,142
You don't need to bet anything.

566
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,397
You'll get my car if you pass,
and if you fail…

567
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,360
I'll never let you live it down.

568
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,321
Ha-yeong.

569
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,117
You really think I'm a joke, don't you?

570
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,911
Of course I do.

571
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,750
I know… you'll never pass.

572
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,963
You better not regret it.

573
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,714
I won't.

574
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,968
MAY 12TH, 2025
SIGNED BY PARK HA-YEONG

575
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,350
Ha-jin,

576
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,561
wait…

577
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,398
AGREEMENT

578
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,109
Mr. Kim, would you like some beer?

579
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,485
Sure.

580
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,320
All right.

581
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,491
What should we have with it?

582
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,703
Three flavors of dried squid? Nice.

583
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,502
I'm home.

584
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,004
Hey.

585
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,388
"The amount of additional tax
is the tax base multiplied by…"

586
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:59,478
"The amount of additional tax
is the tax base multiplied by…"

587
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,525
REAL ESTATE LAW
FOR THE REAL ESTATE AGENTS

588
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,321
Mom, are you studying
for the real estate license again?

589
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,280
Yes.

590
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,867
-What about Dad?
-What about him?

591
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,076
I mean,

592
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,787
I thought you'd take Dad's side.

593
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,294
That was the case until last week.
But now, I'm different.

594
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,589
I've washed your dad's underwear
for 20 years,

595
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,633
so now I deserve to do this for myself.

596
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,426
Don't you think so?

597
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,803
-Right.
-Good.

598
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,723
That thing you're doing with your friends.

599
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,058
Is it going well?

600
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,059
Me?

601
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,894
Well…

602
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,359
We can do it.

603
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,904
That was close!

604
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,906
It's okay.

605
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,658
-It's okay.
-Take your time.

606
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:56,952
You did great, Han-na.

607
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,119
Han-na, Han-na.

608
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,081
Han-na.

609
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,874
-Yes?
-I'm heading home first.

610
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,549
It went in!

611
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,176
You did it.

612
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,594
Bye.

613
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,137
He's playing now.

614
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,348
Bye!

615
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,601
It's… pretty tough.

616
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,687
It's tough, Mom.

617
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,855
Tell me about it.

618
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,732
Studying again after all these years

619
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,777
is really tough.

620
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,028
Good luck, then.

621
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,405
Okay.

622
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,948
I'll do my best.

623
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,122
So,

624
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,417
you're already living together?

625
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,543
Yes.

626
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,796
It's nice, of course.

627
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,673
I love her.

628
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,677
I care about her so much.
I want to do whatever she asks me to do,

629
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,596
and it's fun spending time with her.

630
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,055
But…

631
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,269
I keep thinking,
"Why isn't she going back to her place?"

632
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,230
Sung-gu.

633
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,231
Yes?

634
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,443
That's what marriage is.

635
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:19,993
I want to play games, clean my house,
and spend some time resting by myself,

636
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,329
but she won't go home.

637
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,580
Gosh.

638
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:29,669
But why am I even having
these thoughts in the first place?

639
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,634
That's your life now, Sung-gu.

640
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,723
Mr. Kim.

641
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,184
Should I not get married?

642
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,560
You should.

643
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,437
-Why?
-Just do it.

644
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,272
Do it.

645
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,669
Sir, are you asleep?

646
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,421
No.

647
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,133
Then can I ask you something?

648
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:18,802
Sure.

649
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,140
Will these rushed sales

650
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:29,104
really help you, Mr. Kim?

651
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:36,736
Or are you doing this
because you're hoping it will help you?

652
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,032
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

653
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,912
When you got two outs
in the bottom of the ninth,

654
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,416
you have to clear your mind.

655
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,087
You tell yourself,
"I'll get a pitch I like,"

656
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,214
and just take a full swing.

657
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,342
That's the best way to deal with it.

658
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,346
What? Is it hard to understand?

659
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,390
No, I understand.

660
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,809
But…

661
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,606
I don't think I could've made it

662
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,817
to being in the ninth inning
with two outs.

663
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,903
I guess it's different for you,

664
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,365
since you have a lot to protect.

665
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,911
Mr. Kim.

666
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:31,166
I think what I'm truly scared of
is not marriage itself,

667
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,670
but the burden of being
the head of the family.

668
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,926
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

669
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:48,892
One day, when you reach my age
and are in the same circumstances as me,

670
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,103
you might come home

671
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:56,232
only to find all the lights out,
the living room empty,

672
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,570
no dinner smell coming from the kitchen,

673
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,364
and no one there to welcome you.

674
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,745
Having to bear

675
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,332
that terrifying loneliness
at the age of 50…

676
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,711
Not everyone can do that.

677
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,089
Not me, at least.

678
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,718
Protecting my family,

679
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,305
that's really just me

680
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,600
protecting myself.

681
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,353
It's not something sacred or noble.

682
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,939
I'm just protecting myself.

683
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,360
You should record stuff like this--

684
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,821
He's asleep.

685
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,493
NEW RECORDING

686
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,996
Why would you record something like that?

687
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,331
You're ridiculous.

688
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,835
Mr. Kim, I'll see you in my dreams.

689
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,258
When did he start recording?

690
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:33,913
Good morning.

691
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,915
Good morning.

692
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,625
Gosh, this is a lot.

693
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,044
I'm sure you checked everything already.

694
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,590
Seeing this makes me realize
just how incredible you are.

695
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,592
You got all these renewals in one day.

696
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,012
Didn't you give me a list
of loyal customers on purpose?

697
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,019
You shouldn't hate Mr. Kim so much.

698
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,855
I don't hate him.

699
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:05,028
Well, they were a team of two, and…

700
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,909
someone who earns more
should take on more responsibility.

701
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,664
That's what being a team leader
is all about.

702
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,418
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

703
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,586
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

704
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,754
-Hello.
-Hello.

705
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,796
Hi.

706
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,426
Is Nak-su out of the office again?

707
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,886
Well, no.

708
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,347
He spent the night near a client

709
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,890
and started work there right away.

710
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,974
I see.

711
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,393
He's working so hard.

712
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:38,436
Yes, sir.

713
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,022
-Get back to work, then.
-Yes, sir.

714
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,440
Keep up the good work.

715
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,150
-Sir.
-Sir.

716
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,777
-Have a good day.
-Have a good day.

717
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,195
Bye.

718
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:52,450
Why are you making me
feel so uncomfortable, Nak-su?

719
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,037
So you mean the employees
of the Korea Fair Trade Commission

720
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,914
saw the photo you took with the directors

721
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,042
when Nak-su got a hole-in-one?

722
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,460
Jeez.

723
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,046
I can't believe this is happening.

724
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,803
Bad things keep happening
to Nak-su these days.

725
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,304
It's pretty concerning.

726
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,309
Here. I did as you asked.

727
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,144
Right.

728
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,689
I listed the expected effects
and allocated tasks…

729
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:23,773
SALES TEAM INTEGRATION

730
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,860
…of merging Sales Teams 1 and 2.
I also tried rearranging the team members.

731
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,952
You put your name…

732
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,078
TEAM LEADER, DO JIN-WOO

733
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,538
…as the team leader.

734
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,081
Yes.

735
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,668
Why are you so sure

736
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,005
you'll be the team leader and not Nak-su?

737
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,214
Well,

738
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,174
isn't Nak-su…

739
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,346
going to be an executive now?

740
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,017
I thought it was obvious.

741
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,651
You really…

742
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,321
don't put pressure on people.

743
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,919
KUKKIWON
WORLD TAEKWONDO HEADQUARTERS

744
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,713
It's here. The conference room.

745
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,924
KOREA'S NATIONAL MARTIAL ART, TAEKWONDO

746
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,094
They're in the middle of a meeting.

747
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,017
No need to feel
too much pressure, Mr. Kim.

748
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,061
-Right.
-This is Taejeong's turf, after all.

749
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,563
It'd be nice to win them over.
If not, no big deal.

750
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,856
Right.

751
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,820
Also, the call for bids went out already,
so we're late.

752
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,363
They're coming out.

753
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,033
You're from ACT, right?

754
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,951
-Yes, hello.
-Nice to meet you.

755
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,536
I'm General Manager Kim Nak-su.

756
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,371
I'm Jung Sung-gu.

757
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,498
-Right.
-Nice to meet you.

758
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,667
Sorry, but our meeting just ended,

759
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,961
so could we take a 15-minute break first?

760
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,630
Yes, of course. That's fine.

761
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,757
Then could we wait inside?

762
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,716
Sure.

763
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,261
Good work, sir.

764
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,806
-I'll see you later.
-Bye.

765
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,184
Sorry, this won't take long.

766
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,144
It's okay, take your time…

767
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,148
Mr. Heo.

768
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,622
Here.

769
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,752
Did you quit?

770
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,423
Are you offering a cigarette to someone
who almost died from charcoal fumes?

771
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,466
Sorry.

772
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,554
It's fine. I know you don't care
about anyone else besides yourself.

773
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,645
I heard you quit,
but I didn't know you joined Taejeong.

774
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,274
You're a senior manager there?
That's nice.

775
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,567
Not really.

776
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,528
My salary's only half
of what I earned at ACT.

777
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,447
You guys are so cruel.

778
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,868
You came here to steal our client?
Are you trying to bleed us dry?

779
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,619
We're not doing so well, either.

780
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,163
You know that yourself.

781
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,540
We're doing a dozen times worse.

782
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,667
This is the only place

783
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,088
Taejeong Telecom can get a break
from the three major telecoms.

784
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,175
Can't you let this one go?

785
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,056
As a senior manager of a small company,
I'm asking you to help us out.

786
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,642
You're from a major corporation.

787
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,437
Mr. Kim.

788
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,272
We should head inside.

789
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,694
Take care.

790
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,280
Please.

791
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,492
Is Mr. Heo doing all right?

792
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,119
I guess.

793
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,040
What are the chances
of running into him here?

794
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,709
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

795
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,254
Let's not try too hard here.

796
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,299
We'll just say
what we have to say and leave.

797
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,800
Of course.

798
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,345
I told you earlier, remember?

799
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,889
-Right.
-Okay.

800
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,099
With these strengths,

801
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,685
we hope ACT can become

802
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,730
Kukkiwon's most trusted partner.

803
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,066
That's the end of our presentation.
Thank you.

804
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,943
Thank you.

805
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,486
Can you turn on the lights?

806
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,947
-Please wait a moment.
-Sure.

807
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,406
Is this all right?

808
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,707
To be honest,

809
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,877
we just had a renewal meeting
with Taejeong Telecom,

810
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,629
which used to be our telecom provider.

811
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,588
Right.

812
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,049
We reviewed the quote
you provided us in advance.

813
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,636
To be honest, it makes more sense
to continue our contract with Taejeong.

814
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,806
We're not an online-based company,

815
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,351
and we've maintained our contract
with Taejeong for about ten years.

816
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,938
We didn't ask for a meeting
to convince you

817
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,898
to switch to our service straight away.

818
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:16,941
But…

819
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,529
remember how I asked
for a 15-minute break earlier?

820
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,030
Yes.

821
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,409
We've actually decided to live stream
all the events we host in 4K

822
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,537
starting from
the second half of this year.

823
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,831
I see.

824
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:35,376
But we were told our existing
data facilities and internet connection

825
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,878
aren't capable
of handling 4K live streaming.

826
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,674
And it would take ages
for Taejeong to provide

827
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,842
an OTT solution.

828
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,553
Right. I'm sure that would be the case.

829
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,432
So could you write up
a new quote for us right now?

830
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,558
Yes, of course.

831
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,518
I'll make a request to HQ immediately.

832
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,186
Let me just grab a few more people.

833
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,563
Please wait a moment.

834
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,814
Of course.

835
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,774
Thank you.

836
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,945
This is great, sir.

837
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,198
I never expected this.
I'll report this to Mr. Baek.

838
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,409
No, it's fine. I'll do it myself later.

839
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,368
Okay.

840
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,494
Then… Song-hee.

841
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:16,792
Song-hee, we're at Kukkiwon.
Can you write up a quote?

842
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,003
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

843
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,506
Team 1 just won
a contract with Kukkiwon.

844
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,841
He really did it?

845
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,093
Way to go, Mr. Kim.

846
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,887
And it's the Super Giga Internet Plan.

847
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:28,846
Right.

848
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,349
A full turnkey contract
including construction.

849
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,475
Hang on.

850
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,435
If it's 50 million a month,
then one year is…

851
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,561
ESTIMATE

852
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,190
We won't need to worry
about this year's KPI.

853
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,983
This will take a weight off his shoulders.

854
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,693
Right.

855
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,446
I guess having experience
really does make a difference.

856
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,781
Right.

857
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,367
This is incredible.

858
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,119
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

859
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,579
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

860
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,830
It's not a big deal.

861
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,133
Hello.

862
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,971
I hear Team 1 just landed a huge contract.

863
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,236
Try to put yourself
In my shoes

864
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,657
If you were me
Do you think you could smile?

865
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,534
You said

866
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,037
It's so fun driving a manual
after such a long time.

867
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:38,165
I think it's my first time
since I finished my military service.

868
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,210
Mr. Kim,

869
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:45,005
when I was my commander's driver,
the smooth gear shifting…

870
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,967
Let's drive quietly.

871
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,572
All right.

872
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,575
Oh, I forgot.

873
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,161
Let's see. The blood is all drained.

874
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,787
All right.

875
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,588
Here we go.

876
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,092
Braised ribs…

877
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,510
PREPARE THE SAUCE

878
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:35,681
Sauce. Eight big scoops of soy sauce.

879
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,600
Big scoop.

880
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,559
LIGHT SOY SAUCE

881
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,894
The soy sauce…

882
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,941
What is it?

883
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,571
This is light soy sauce.
You have to add dark soy sauce.

884
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,490
Are they different?

885
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,491
Yes.

886
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,575
Is that so?

887
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,745
Give it to me. I'll do it.

888
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,330
All right.

889
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,873
What?

890
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,667
You should use a spoon
to measure it, not a ladle.

891
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,296
Well, it said "big scoop."

892
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,756
-Jeez.
-So do I use a spoon?

893
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,092
Oh no. Hang on.

894
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,011
Hey, Su-gyeom.

895
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,096
Come here and taste the spinach.

896
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,016
Why are you telling him to taste it?
Try it yourself.

897
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,851
I can't tell if the seasoning is right.

898
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,230
Here. Try this.

899
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,441
How is it?

900
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,362
Is it that bad?

901
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,155
Hang on.

902
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,783
-Move over.
-Oh gosh.

903
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,993
Why are you so strong?

904
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,537
-Gosh.
-I'll do it.

905
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,955
Forget it. I'll do it.

906
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,458
I'll vacuum.

907
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,795
Hey! What's gotten into you?

908
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,797
My goodness.

909
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,050
Unbelievable.

910
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,173
PREMIUM KOREAN BEEF GIFT SET

911
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,903
There's no need for whiskey.

912
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,363
Beer is enough.

913
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,199
-Drink that with your wife.
-Here we go.

914
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,952
Thirty years?

915
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,038
-Nice.
-That's way too much.

916
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,373
We hardly ever drink anyway.

917
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,459
-Let me take that.
-My gosh.

918
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,502
Here you go.

919
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,546
-All right.
-Oh my.

920
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,215
-Thank you.
-This smells so nice.

921
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,926
Here. Have a glass, honey.

922
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,471
He never listened
when I suggested that we open it.

923
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,931
I'm finally getting a taste thanks to you.

924
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,517
You should treat her well.

925
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,979
I do. What more could I possibly do?

926
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,106
Let's try it.

927
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,150
Su-gyeom, would you like a glass too?

928
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,401
I'll pour you some.

929
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,903
Sure, try it.

930
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,904
Okay.

931
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,739
You should take it from him.

932
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,115
My goodness.

933
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,576
This whiskey is older than you.

934
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,246
You're right.

935
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,668
All right.

936
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,128
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

937
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,588
Why don't you make a toast?

938
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,299
-Me?
-Yes.

939
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,386
All right, then.

940
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,807
First off…

941
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,102
My love,

942
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,438
-my sweet deer.
-Oh gosh.

943
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,649
-My dear Ha-jin.
-Jeez.

944
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,860
You're my reason for living

945
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,154
Oh gosh. You're being so annoying.
What's with you?

946
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,408
And our Yonseo University student,

947
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,160
our pride and joy, Su-gyeom.

948
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:32,501
These two are truly
the reasons for my existence.

949
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,794
-Of course.
-Yes.

950
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:39,007
And my mentor, who has taught me
such much ever since I joined ACT,

951
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,177
our managing director, Baek Jeong-tae!

952
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,805
-Round of applause!
-Oh, I really…

953
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:47,891
Okay, that's enough.

954
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:52,813
Seriously, you've truly been
like family for the past 25 years.

955
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,733
I feel closer to you
than to my own brother.

956
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,151
You know that, right?

957
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,110
Of course I do.

958
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,530
-Right.
-You're not that close with your brother.

959
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,120
Anyway, what I wanted to say is

960
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,081
that we're a family.

961
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,460
You know, family means

962
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,004
sticking together, come rain or shine,

963
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,381
through fights or laughter.

964
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,425
We're always together.

965
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,971
That's what family is. Being together.

966
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,932
And in the spirit of that, how about

967
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:34,396
I say, "Love,"
and you all say, "Together"?

968
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,398
-Okay. Sounds good.
-Okay, then.

969
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:37,900
Love!

970
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,360
-Together!
-Together!

971
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,070
Hang on.

972
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,614
My goodness.

973
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,408
Oh my.

974
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,701
It's starting.

975
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,329
An angel from the skies.

976
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,372
You're so pretty.

977
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,333
We're so young, right?

978
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,543
-How young.
-Seriously.

979
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,253
You still look the same, Ha-jin.

980
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,049
Look! Back there,
when you were an assistant manager.

981
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,552
Please welcome Mr. Heo Tae-hwan,

982
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,429
the groom's friend and colleague.

983
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,517
I love you

984
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,727
You're the only one in my world

985
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,064
-You're so excited!
-I shout your name

986
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,459
I had such a great meal.

987
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,002
Oh, right.

988
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,921
-What is it?
-Su-gyeom.

989
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,758
-Come on. Don't do this.
-No.

990
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,761
-Stop.
-This isn't for you anyway.

991
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,263
Don't let your parents take it away.

992
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,806
-My gosh.
-Oh dear.

993
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,224
Thank you.

994
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,392
Wait.

995
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,395
I made some mushroom stir-fry

996
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,231
and some braised beef
that your wife likes.

997
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,025
It's seasoned perfectly,
so I'm sure she'll like it.

998
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,945
-Take these.
-Oh, you shouldn't have.

999
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,029
Thank you.

1000
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,739
The designated driver can come right away.

1001
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:09,575
No, could you tell them

1002
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,660
to come in about 15 minutes?

1003
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,121
I'm so full. Let's walk for a bit.

1004
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,707
Okay. Sure.

1005
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:18,625
Can you come in 15 minutes?

1006
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,420
Ha-jin, I really enjoyed dinner.
You can go back inside.

1007
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,505
Okay. Please come visit again soon.

1008
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:24,882
-I will.
-Okay.

1009
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,009
Su-gyeom, take your mother inside.

1010
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,677
-Bye.
-Bye.

1011
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,178
-Bye, then.
-I'll take that.

1012
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,805
-Bye.
-Head inside.

1013
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,682
I'll walk him to his car. Go on.

1014
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,934
-Bye.
-Bye.

1015
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,686
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1016
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:39,813
Oh my.

1017
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,710
You didn't have to do all this.

1018
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,253
It's nothing.

1019
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,340
Please visit again soon.
It was a lot of fun having you.

1020
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,175
Your wife must have worked so hard.

1021
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,055
And Su-gyeom's all grown up.
He could get married now.

1022
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,016
I'll have to do my best
to support him until then.

1023
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,644
-Jeong-tae.
-Nak-su.

1024
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,355
-Pardon?
-No, go ahead.

1025
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,982
About Kukkiwon.

1026
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,736
You know they were Taejeong's client
for over ten years, right?

1027
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:28,904
Yes.

1028
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,364
But I went there

1029
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,076
and planted ACT's flag,
and it was at a high price.

1030
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,118
Good job.

1031
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,664
But do you know who went from Taejeong?

1032
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:42,292
I couldn't believe it.
It was Heo Tae-hwan.

1033
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,628
But do you know what he said to me?

1034
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,214
He begged me not to take their client.

1035
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,382
He pleaded with me,

1036
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,677
saying Taejeong would be ruined
if they lost that client.

1037
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,930
But I didn't hesitate for a single moment.

1038
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:55,889
Why?

1039
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:01,520
Because ACT has fed me
and my family for 25 years.

1040
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:04,064
I'm a proud member of the great ACT.

1041
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:09,236
So who cares if my former colleague
dies or gets fired, right?

1042
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,654
Nak-su.

1043
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:14,199
There's still a long way to go
to repay ACT for everything--

1044
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,575
Kim Nak-su!

1045
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:28,005
The HR Team is going
to ask to see you tomorrow.

1046
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,550
-Jeong-tae.
-It's… going to be--

1047
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,718
Jeong-tae.

1048
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,055
Don't do this to me.

1049
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,268
You know better than anyone
how hard I've worked at ACT

1050
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,353
for the past 25 years.

1051
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:44,896
You can't do this to me.

1052
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,275
I couldn't attend
any of Su-gyeom's graduations

1053
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,445
because I was always busy
cleaning up your messes.

1054
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,824
I attended your son's
and daughter's graduation ceremonies.

1055
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,328
But I never got to attend my own son's.

1056
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:02,080
Jeong-tae.

1057
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,876
Have I ever once blamed you for that?

1058
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,296
I always took care of the messes you made,

1059
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,214
but I never confronted you about it.

1060
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,759
That's what I did for you.

1061
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,218
Jeong-tae.

1062
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,264
You shouldn't do this to me.

1063
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,183
I'm different from Heo Tae-hwan.

1064
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,143
I was good at my job, and I still am.

1065
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,686
I even landed a big contract.

1066
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,397
I'm still useful to the company.

1067
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:31,985
You did a good job.

1068
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:34,654
What?

1069
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,449
Jeong-tae.

1070
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,329
I can still do a good job.

1071
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,830
Nak-su.

1072
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,582
How can you do this to me?

1073
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,002
How can you,
of all people, do this to me?

1074
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,588
What did I do so wrong?

1075
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,507
Are you going to Banpo-dong?

1076
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,217
Yes, that's me.

1077
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,261
The black sedan over there.

1078
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:01,139
Okay. I'll go get the car started, then.

1079
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,313
I'm sorry.

1080
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,149
Damn it.

1081
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:33,630
Damn it.

01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,638
Damn it.

Okay.

1086
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,302
It's not working, right?

1087
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,636
We should just let it go.

1088
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,805
We should scrap it now.

1089
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,557
-Okay.
-Let's take a photo.

1090
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,359
TO BE SCRAPPED

1091
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,039
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1092
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,509
All right.

THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

1103
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,991
Why would the Safety and Health Manager
have to do something like this?

Lunchtime!

What are you doing?
I can't do this anymore.

-So you're quitting?
-Yes!

1108
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,965
You're the one who said

1109
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,384
we must take
responsibility for our choices.

01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,481
Just keep a low profile

1115
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,317
and leave whenever you want.
That's all you have to do.
