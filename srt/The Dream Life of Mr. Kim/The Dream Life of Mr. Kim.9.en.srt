00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,383
Sir, everything's fine.

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,761
Slowly, take a deep breath.

4
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,887
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,807
The subway construction
has been postponed for ages.

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,059
I heard they flipped 300-million-won units

7
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,477
for over a billion won.

8
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,355
Not sure how to say this.
I don't think I can open the shop.

9
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,440
Right. You don't need to
return the deposit.

10
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,817
Goodbye then.

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,153
Don't you dare touch
your severance pay. Just leave it be.

12
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,781
If you do something
you're not cut out for,

13
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,575
it'll only come back to bite you.

14
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,001
-Make way!
-Everyone, please move!

15
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,919
What's going on?

16
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,674
How are you feeling?

17
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,719
-Better than before.
-When is your family coming?

18
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,013
I didn't contact anyone.

19
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,473
Shouldn't you?
Can you get home by yourself?

20
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,975
Yes, I'll be fine,

21
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,312
but my heart suddenly started racing,

22
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,940
and it felt like something
was pressing down on my chest.

23
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,776
Do I have arrhythmia or something?

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,070
No, all your test results look normal.

25
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,657
Your blood work and scans
show no physical issues.

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,703
These appear to be panic symptoms.

27
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,788
Have you been under stress lately?

28
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,831
Excuse me?

29
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,333
Was it the first time?

30
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,336
Or have you experienced
similar symptoms before?

31
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,798
Have a great life, Nak-su!

32
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,634
Then why did they do that to him?

33
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:14,801
Nak-su!

34
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,018
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

35
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,805
-I'm sorry.
-You might as well be the errand boy.

36
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,682
What else would you do?

37
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,065
You should see a psychiatrist tomorrow.

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,153
-A psychiatrist?
-Should I set up an appointment for you?

39
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,365
With a psychiatrist?

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,067
God, are you joking?

41
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,986
I said I was having trouble breathing,

42
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,447
and now you're treating me like a lunatic.

43
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,783
Are you even a real doctor?

44
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,951
Please lower your voice.

45
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,703
I can't believe this.

46
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,789
Seriously, you're treating me
like I'm crazy.

47
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,207
Damn it.

48
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:54,401
Loafer.

49
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,111
-You idiot!
-Gosh!

50
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,324
Loafer.

51
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,453
How much was it again?

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,079
It was 1.05 billion won.

53
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,498
How much is the loan?

54
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,458
It's 550 million won.

55
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,793
-You moron!
-Don't. You hit me earlier.

56
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,630
Does your wife know?

57
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,798
Not yet.

58
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,302
Who makes a decision like this
without talking to their wife?

59
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,472
I wanted to give her a big surprise
once a franchise moved in.

60
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,808
That's crazy.
Why would anyone move in here?

61
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,061
I told you not to touch
the severance pay!

62
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,480
Damn it.

63
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,690
You think it's easy to profit
from commercial buildings?

64
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,234
"To crush an enemy,
have them buy commercial property."

65
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,111
There's a reason why people say that.

66
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,114
If you had a bad feeling about it,
you should've tried harder to stop me.

67
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,991
Want me to hit you "harder"?

68
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,660
So no one will move in?

69
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,370
Oh my God.

70
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,749
Just hold on. I'll look into it.

71
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,669
Don't try to solve this on your own.

72
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,837
Tell your wife ASAP.

73
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,340
No way.

74
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,635
-You have to. Or you're done for.
-No. Damn it.

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,720
-I can't.
-Jeez.

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,645
EPISODE 9
WORST ENEMY

77
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,782
What the heck?

78
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,369
Honey.

79
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,704
Hi.

80
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,498
You forgot the code?

81
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,749
No, that's not it.

82
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,168
Have you been drinking?

83
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,087
Drinking? No, I just…

84
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,382
Then what is it?
Is your memory getting worse?

85
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,092
I'm just getting old. That's all.

86
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,391
-Honey.
-Yes?

87
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,229
I landed my first contract today.

88
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,232
-You did?
-Isn't that amazing?

89
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,944
Gosh. Really?

90
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,987
That's great.

91
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,989
-Come sit down.
-Okay.

92
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,199
So,

93
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,076
I made 60,000 won.

94
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,162
Sixty thousand won?

95
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,206
It was a studio with a low deposit.

96
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,584
The company took 60 percent, and I got 40.

97
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:17,752
It's not much.

98
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,506
What do you mean, it's not much?

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,633
You worked hard for that money.

100
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,469
-Do you mean it?
-Of course.

101
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,264
Should we frame it
and hang it up on the wall?

102
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,392
Don't be so dramatic.

103
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,687
Let's order fried chicken.

104
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,730
My treat.

105
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,191
No, I'll pay.

106
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,110
So what about you?

107
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,069
What about me?

108
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,655
You said you had something
to tell me this morning.

109
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,911
It's just…

110
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,121
This is a big day.
You signed your first contract.

111
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,582
I'll tell you later.

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,792
What should we get?

113
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,254
The freshly-fried chicken.
That one's delicious.

114
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,256
That was good. Okay.

115
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,759
Here, let me.

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,096
Let's get the fried chicken,
add extra fries,

117
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,933
and cheese. We have to add cheese too.

118
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,418
Jeez, where's Building 103…

119
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,253
Excuse me, sir. Where is Building 103?

120
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,965
Go that way and take a left.

121
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,466
Okay. Thank you.

122
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,179
Hi, I'm so sorry. I'm right out front.

123
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,722
I'll be right there. Sorry.

124
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,528
Honey, can you take out
the recycling later?

125
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,280
I already sorted it,
so you just need to take it out, okay?

126
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,740
All right.

127
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,075
-I'm leaving now.
-Okay.

128
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,201
I'm off too.

129
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,768
INCOMING CALL

130
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,122
Hello?

131
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,749
This is the admin office
at Seonghyeon General Hospital.

132
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,544
Is this Mr. Kim Nak-su,
who visited the ER yesterday afternoon?

133
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,628
Yes, that's me.

134
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,755
You left without paying your bill.

135
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,966
Would you be able to come in
and pay it today?

136
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,676
Yes, of course. Gosh.

137
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,305
-Let's go.
-Okay.

138
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,058
That will be 218,000 won.
I can take your payment now.

139
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,645
-Insert your card there.
-Okay.

140
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,233
Will "emergency room"
appear on my statement?

141
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,611
Yes, as "Seonghyeon General Hospital
Emergency Center."

142
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,780
In that case,

143
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,699
I'll pay in cash.

144
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,381
SAY BANK

00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,980
the money I have to pay right away…

00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,735
UPCOMING CARD PAYMENT

150
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,029
HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS
WILL BE CHARGED…

151
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,114
"Six hundred and thirty thousand…"

152
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,242
HEALTH INSURANCE 630,600
TOTAL 299,930

153
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,456

00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,209
entire life savings

155
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,003
amounts to just 290,000 won.

156
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,217
I can't even pay
the first month's interest on the loan.

157
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,096
Man.

158
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,482
Wait.

159
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,441
STOCKS
20,035,800 WON

160
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,360
Right.

161
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,362
What about the deposit?

162
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,571
Twenty million.

163
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,117
Why would they invent a lease
for a nonexistent toast shop

164
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,078
just to give me 20 million won?

165
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,790
Maybe they needed to buy some time.

166
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,042
Time to lower my guard,

167
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,753
clear out the sales office,
and disappear.

168
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,505
I'm making a call. Quiet down.

169
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,676
-Hello?
-Hello, sir.

170
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,052
I hope you've been well.

171
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,888
I called because someone inquired
about signing a lease.

172
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,850
And they would have needed
a legal loophole too.

173
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,228
Thank you so much. We'll do our very best.

174
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,105
Not at all. I'm happy to have you.

175
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,356
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

176
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,192
-Looking forward to it.
-I am too.

177
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,861
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

178
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,532
Pleasure doing business with you.

179
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,575
Thank you.

180
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,828
Damn it. This is all I get?
He gave you 1.05 billion.

181
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,706
I'll buy you premium beef later, okay?

182
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,834
What are you talking about?
We already signed the contract.

183
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,462
Yes, I'm afraid I can't do it.
I'm very sorry.

184
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,256
You can't just back out now--

185
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,633
-He's being so annoying.
-Just hang up already.

186
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,802
What about the deposit?

187
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,222
Right. You don't need
to return the deposit.

188
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,974
Goodbye then.

189
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,519
If they forfeit the deposit,
it's not considered fraud.

190
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,230
It just becomes a simple case
of the tenant changing their mind.

191
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,817
All right, everyone.
Give me your SIM cards.

192
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,694
Give them to him.

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,949
To the bastards who took
700 to 800 million won,

194
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,743
the 20 million won they gave me…

195
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,663
Let's party!

196
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,834
…was just
a cost-effective investment

197
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,003
for the perfect crime.

198
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,180
TOTAL 299,930 WON

199
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,866
Damn it.

200
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,121
Damn it!

201
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,375
I think we're almost there.

202
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,044
Are you sure you didn't take a wrong turn?

203
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,172
-Let me see.
-I'll make this work to pay off my loan

204
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,758
and pay back my dad as soon as possible.

205
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,136
NO MORE BORING T-SHIRTS

206
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,721
DESIGN YOUR OWN UNIQUE T-SHIRT

207
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,895
-Welcome. We're having a sale.
-Hello.

208
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,313
-Really?
-Take a look.

209
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,564
Excuse us.

210
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,233
-Han-na, let's go.
-What? Okay.

211
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,567
-Feel free to come back.
-Okay.

212
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,572
Wait. Can't we get the samples delivered

213
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,658
and place the order by phone?

214
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,078
I want to compare
different fabrics in person.

215
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,290
And if we can,
we should negotiate the price.

216
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,916
You know how to do that?

217
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,961
Of course.
We have to save every penny we can.

218
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,838
After all, my dad helped us out.

219
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,881
We have to be careful, no matter what.

220
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,927
This is the place.

221
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,181
This fabric is incredible, isn't it?

222
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,182
It is.

223
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,228
I still don't see
what's so incredible about it.

224
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,816
Since the fabric is excellent,
and the printing came out really well,

225
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,901
I'd like to place an order.

226
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:39,986
What?

227
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,072
Was it 18,000 won per piece?

228
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,581
We'll order 100 of each color,
for a total of 300 pieces.

229
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,499
How does 16,000 won sound?

230
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,545
If you order a thousand,
I can go as low as 10,000 won.

231
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,299
-Did you say 10,000 won?
-That's right.

232
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,555
Get a grip. Just order 300.

233
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,727
If we buy a thousand at 10,000 won

234
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,729
and sell them for just 30,000 won each,

235
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,273
that's 30 million won.

236
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,359
Then I can pay my dad back right away.

237
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,195
That's true,
but that's only if these sell out.

238
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,285
Han-na, let's just
bet on the holiday rush.

239
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,499
See? It says, "Love lives here."

240
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,171
I'm supposed to pack these with you
till the end of the year?

241
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,174
If you don't want that,

242
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,510
then we should sell them fast.

243
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,721
All right, sir.

244
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,350
Four hundred of each color.
A total of 1,200.

245
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,310
It's a deal.

246
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,938
Thank you.

247
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,899
What a good son. You get a five percent
discount with a bank transfer.

248
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,068
-Did you tell her?
-No.

249
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,611
Want me to tell her?

250
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,823
"Ha-jin, your husband is a landlord now."

251
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,117
"But you know that building is--"

252
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,286
Gosh, I said I would talk
to her today.

253
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:14,872
I have to go.

254
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,590
-Mr. Kim Nak-su.
-Hey.

255
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,552
When someone comes home,
at least say hello.

256
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,721
Hello.

257
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,605
Putting these in the washing machine
must be so hard, right?

258
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,524
Sorry.

259
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,736
Just kidding.

260
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,281
I landed two contracts today.

261
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,825
So, 120,000 won?

262
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,493
It's 90,000 won.

263
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,372
Then let's get pizza.

264
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,082
You order tonight.

265
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,543
What's gotten into you?

266
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,502
What do you mean?

267
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,464
I mean…

268
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,091
You've been acting so weird
since yesterday.

269
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,594
-How?
-Normally, you would say,

270
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,554
"Sweating all day for just 90,000 won?"

271
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,848
"That doesn't even cover the bus fare!"

272
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,017
Are you sick?

273
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,104
My stomach hurts.

274
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,898
What if you earn more than I do?

275
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,816
I'm so jealous it hurts.

276
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,943
My stomach.

277
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,404
Don't try to change the subject.

278
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,572
What is it?

279
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,828
Well, it's just…

280
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,546
What is it?

281
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,509
Gosh, I can never fool you.

282
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,394
I was thinking of meeting Sang-cheol.

283
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,774
Why? I thought you didn't want

284
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,275
to join his company.

285
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,736
No, I've been thinking about it.

286
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,156
With sales,
you're bound to struggle at first.

287
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,450
So I figured I'd join
when they're starting out

288
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,370
and help give him some direction.

289
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,001
-Are you sure you'll be okay?
-Why wouldn't I be okay? We're family.

290
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,723
ENERGY DRINK

291
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,475
Why is this so expensive?

292
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,240
-That'll be 8,800 won.
-Okay.

293
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,950
Do you have a mobile carrier discount?

294
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,911
Sorry, ACT doesn't get a discount.

295
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,580
-Sorry about that.
-I see.

296
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,291
Do you need a plastic bag?

297
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,250
100 WON A BAG

298
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,211
Oh, there's a charge for it? No, thanks.

299
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,170
-Okay.
-Here.

300
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,239
This is… It's very responsive.

301
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,410
You're a bit too late, Nak-su.

302
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,287
I probably am.

303
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,331
It keeps disconnecting.

304
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,498
I'll look into it further.

305
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,708
-Take it.
-Yes, sir.

306
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,005
I've mentioned before.

307
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,006
Look over there.

308
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,636
We already have a sales director.

309
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,971
-I see.
-We've also hired staff under them.

310
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,433
We don't have any more openings
in the sales department.

311
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,559
Hey.

312
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,561
-Hi, Ha-yeong.
-Nak-su, you're here.

313
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,898
Mr. Han, Director Moon
from Nemo Telecom is almost here.

314
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,233
Really? What should I do?

315
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,278
Ms. Park, could you take care of him

316
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,863
for a moment?

317
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,783
Nak-su, I'll be right back.

318
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,701
-Take one with you.
-No, I'm fine.

319
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,969
It feels like I'm interviewing you.

320
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,222
HAN SANG-CHEOL

321
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,348
Introduce yourself.

322
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,644
What is it that you do here?

323
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,230
I'm a registered director at this company.

324
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,608
I brought my enzyme group-buying
business here and made us a nice profit.

325
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,527
I had no idea.

326
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,365
You should have come sooner.

327
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,701
I know.

328
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,830
Nak-su, even if we wanted
to work with you,

329
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,623
we're fully staffed.

330
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,419
I'm not kidding.
There's literally no desk left for you.

331
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,799
Sales is about hitting the pavement.

332
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,760
Things like that don't really matter.

333
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,012
A desk is just a desk.

334
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,191
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

335
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,819
-Just a moment.
-Sure.

336
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,156
-Excuse me.
-Yes, of course.

337
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,950
Sorry,
I'll send it myself now.

338
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,829
Gosh, let me.

339
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,249
This is really hard to watch, Nak-su.

340
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,417
No, I'm fine.

341
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,335
I'm getting to know how things work here.

342
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,337
Sure. Take a few days to observe

343
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,965
and think if there's anything
for you to do here.

344
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,675
Okay.

345
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,386
If you have any questions
about sales, feel free to ask.

346
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,392
Can I help you with that?

347
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,852
-Yes. Thank you.
-The ink--

348
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,438
Sorry. Can you
send this by courier for me?

349
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,981
-By courier?
-Here's the address.

350
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,399
-Thank you.
-I have one too.

351
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,442
What?

352
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,360
-A courier?
-Me too.

353
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,070
Okay.

354
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,573
-Thank you so much.
-Okay, then.

355
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,159
A courier…

356
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,416
MANGJIN PLAZA

357
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,294
MANGJIN PLAZA SALES OFFICE

358
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,588
JUNGYEONG REAL ESTATE

359
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,147
Hey, who's here?

360
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,857
Come sit down.

361
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,821
-Hi, Dad.
-Hello, Mr. Kim.

362
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,489
What brings you two here?

363
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,616
Go take a look at Su-gyeom's room.

364
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,618
-Just go have a look.
-What?

365
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,412
Oh my gosh. What is all that?

366
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,956
Don't ask me.

367
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,999
Why don't you ask your son?

368
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,460
What is all that?

369
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,462
Some clothes we had made.

370
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,089
-Clothes?
-Yes.

371
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,217
We're going to try
to sell these hoodies online.

372
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,344
So how many did you get?

373
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,013
It's 1,200 pieces total.

374
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,349
-One thousand and two hundred?
-Yes.

375
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,643
I tried to talk him out of it,

376
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,813
but your son was just so determined.

377
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,065
Wait, with what money?

378
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,402
When we were struggling, Mr. Kim helped--

379
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,779
We got funding.

380
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,782
-What?
-I helped him out a little.

381
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,160
With the business proposal and all.
I can whip those up in a flash.

382
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,082
-Are you feeling okay?
-What?

383
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,751
Or are you hiding something?

384
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,005
You've been acting so strange lately.

385
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,300
You're starting
to make me a little nervous.

386
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,385
I'm not hiding anything.

387
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,054
There's nothing to be nervous about. Jeez.

388
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,768
So what do you plan on doing here at home?

389
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,024
Until we can get an office,

390
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,901
we'll work from home.

391
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,944
Do some packaging

392
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,655
and handle deliveries.

393
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,908
Yes.

394
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,746
You too, Han-na?

395
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,206
Yes.

396
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,044
And while we're working,
I'll help out with the housework.

397
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,962
We'll help out together.

398
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,383
Okay.

399
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,639
And you knew about all this?

400
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,807
Absolutely not.

401
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,685
Not all of it.

402
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,438
Just some of it.

403
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,451
Fine. You three can figure it out.
I'm staying out of it.

404
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,953
Just handle things yourselves.

405
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,206
Why three? It's just them. I'm not--

406
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:22,586
Gosh.

407
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,965
Dad, I've given this a lot of thought.

408
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,176
How much will you sell them for?

409
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:34,098
Around 78,000 won.

410
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,775
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION WON PER MONTH

411
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,080
Jeez, you scared me.

412
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,832
Who are you?

413
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,754
Can I help you?

414
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,134
-Never mind.
-Just say it. What is it?

415
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,558
If you don't mind,
may I say just a few words?

416
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,934
Sure. Go ahead.

417
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,273
This won't work.

418
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,025
Who would pay three million won?

419
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,278
If you were the tenant,
would you pay that much for this place?

420
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,449
Then how much should it be?

421
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,201
How can you even think
about collecting rent now?

422
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,120
"First Year Rent-Free."

423
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,539
Even then, I doubt anyone would take it.

424
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,169
Do you have any idea
what this place is worth?

425
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,879
Between 1 and 1.1 billion won.

426
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,797
Wait, how do you…

427
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,885
Are you involved somehow?

428
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,928
Well, I am…

429
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,807
-involved.
-What do you mean, "involved…"

430
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,727
Involved how?

431
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,396
Tell me. What do you mean?

432
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,481
Don't tell me you're…

433
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,816
Wait, could you be…

434
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,574
NA DAE-RYONG
PSYCHIATRIST

435
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,870
You're the doctor at the clinic

436
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,663
on the second floor.

437
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,043
I see.

438
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,046
If this building does well,
you'll get more patients.

439
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,548
That's why you're ordering me around.

440
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,717
You don't have to worry about my clinic.

441
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,804
It's so quiet around here.
My patients actually prefer it.

442
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,222
Really? So why do you care?

443
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,473
Because

444
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,559
you still can't seem to accept it.

445
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,269
Accept what?

446
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,980
This property is not worth
three million won a month.

447
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,322
Accept reality.

448
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,409
What difference would it make
if I accept it?

449
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,661
Things will change.

450
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,080
Acceptance is the first step
to solving a problem.

451
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,042
"Acceptance… is the first step…"

452
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,796
So you just sit in your office
saying useless things like that all day.

453
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,006
I see. Jeez.

454
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,346
I see you've never been.

455
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,431
Been where?

456
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,269
Stop by the second floor.
We can have a chat.

457
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,564
About what?

458
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,649
Why would I go there?

459
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,610
Good lord.

460
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,910
All done. Parked it safely
right by the flowerbed.

461
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,037
Please take care of it again later.

462
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,372
Ms. Kim Na-gyeong?

463
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,915
-Yes?
-Here's your mail.

464
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,250
-Thank you.
-Sure.

465
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,668
Excuse me.

466
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,796
A coffee run is probably
beneath you, right?

467
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,466
Not at all. I was just about
to get some. A hot Americano?

468
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,718
For me…

469
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,053
You parked by the wrong flowerbed.

470
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,806
Really? My apologies.
I'll take care of it later.

471
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,057
-What?
-Iced Americano.

472
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,435
The acidic blend,
an extra shot, and use my points.

473
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,563
You definitely said
"the acidic blend" this time.

474
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,814
You can go now.

475
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,858
-Sorry about that.
-Okay.

476
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,610
Why is he going--

477
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,028
Hey, honey!

478
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,822
I mean, Mr. Han.
Did the Nemo Telecom deal fall through?

479
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,409
They just tested the waters
and then bailed on us.

480
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,078
We put so much effort into it for months.

481
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,330
What do we do now?

482
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,791
Actually, instead of piggybacking
on a company like Nemo Telecom,

483
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,212
it'd be far more effective to score
a direct deal with a major corporation.

484
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,421
You want to…

485
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:39,218
integrate your in-app payment system
with their membership points, right?

486
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,979
Well, shall I

487
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,149
set up a meeting with ACT?

488
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:58,654
Thanks.

489
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,989
-Mine's the non-acidic one, right?
-Yes, of course.

490
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,324
All right.

491
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,118
I'll do all the prep

492
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,287
and handle the presentation too.

493
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,957
Nak-su, if you can make this happen,

494
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,583
I'll give you

495
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,877
a ten percent sales commission.

496
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,549
Okay. Ten percent.

497
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,718
How much would that be?

498
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,389
Also, I'll let
the current sales director go

499
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,432
and bring you on board.

500
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,811
Apparently, he's the one who wasted
six months chasing Nemo Telecom.

501
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,439
From what I hear, the real authority
on the ACT sales team now

502
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,358
is General Manager Do Jin-woo.

503
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,568
What's your relationship with him?

504
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,697
Please. He's my junior.
He's not even on my level.

505
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,699
Is that so?

506
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,784
I used to tear into him all the time.

507
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,371
All right, then.

508
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,623
Can I assume it's settled

509
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,250
and get started on the work today?

510
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,461
-Don't stand up.
-Nak-su.

511
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,463
-We're in your hands.
-Okay.

512
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,299
-Gosh.
-We're counting on you.

513
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,719
I'll need a desk so I can get to work.

514
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,304
Yes! Get him one right away.

515
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,265
A desk! We'll get you one right now.

516
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,392
You can use this room.

517
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,602
You can use…

518
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,354
Ten percent.

519
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,815
IN-APP PAYMENT INTEGRATION PROPOSAL

520
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,494
Sung-gu, how did it go?

521
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,080
November is way too late.

522
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,958
Did Do Jin-woo say
he can't make time at all?

523
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,626
Can't you do something about it?

524
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,253
Please do me a favor.

525
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,379
All right, good.

526
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,298
Okay. Thank you.

527
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,093
That jerk. Acting like he's too busy.

528
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,514
DIGITAL FINANCE AND FINTECH SOFTWARE…

529
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,228
QR-BASED PAYMENT
POINT-OF-SALE INTEGRATION

530
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,787
Since the pandemic,
mobile-based consumption has surged.

531
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,831
Contactless payments
continue to be preferred.

532
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,875
In-app payment is no longer just an option

533
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,379
but has established itself
as the default payment method.

534
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,797
THE FINTECH MARKET…

535
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,299
…LEVERAGING THE USER BASE…

536
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,012
As converting dormant points into cash
becomes more common…

537
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,957
Did you forget how hard it was…

538
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,086
to get money out of people? You idiot.

539
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,631
Let's do this.

540
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,973
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION WON PER MONTH

541
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,188
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION PER MONTH

542
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,816
FIRST THREE MONTHS FREE!
RESTAURANTS, CAFES, SELF-CHECKOUT STORES

543
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,170
So there are patients after all.

544
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,213
Hyeon-jun, your phone.

545
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,716
-Thank you.
-Of course.

546
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,176
-He looks fine.
-See you.

547
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,635
-Yes, see you next time.
-Okay.

548
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,952
You've been staring at me.

549
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,039
What? When?

550
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,458
Never mind, then.

551
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,171
I'm not some weirdo.

552
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,632
Okay.

553
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,760
I just have trouble breathing sometimes.

554
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,055
My chest suddenly feels tight,

555
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,017
and I can't ride the bus.

556
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,938
So it's like a panic disorder.

557
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,943
What did the doctor tell you to do?

558
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,115
Well?

559
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,117
No wonder you were staring.

560
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,744
What are you talking about, kid?

561
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,873
If you need to see him, do it soon.

562
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,254
Why would I go see him? You're ridiculous.

563
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,838
At first,

564
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,926
my mom said
it was just my lack of willpower.

565
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,887
Now, she says she's very sorry.

566
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,353
You shouldn't do anything
you'll feel sorry for later.

567
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,782
Do you not like it, or are you not hungry?

568
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,577
It's delicious. I'm eating just fine. Why?

569
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,162
Then stop picking at your food
and eat up.

570
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,123
Your face is looking thin.

571
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,083
What is it?

572
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,086
No, I'm just trying to eat more veggies.

573
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,754
Goodness.

574
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,631
Mr. Kim, this seaweed is so good.

575
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,592
-Right? It's delicious.
-Have some.

576
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,427
Thank you.

577
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,306
-It's really good.
-I'll get you more. There's plenty.

578
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,436
Put some over here too.

579
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,395
Okay.

580
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,647
Dig in.

581
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,117
Are the clothes selling well?

582
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,328
No.

583
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,206
Once they go viral,
they'll sell out in no time.

584
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,544
Mr. Kim, please teach your son
the tricks of the trade.

585
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,838
He doesn't listen to me at all.

586
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,423
Trust me.

587
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,217
Once we hit our stride,
we'll sell them all.

588
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,430
Shoot.

589
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,974
-Hello, Sang-cheol.
-Nak-su, when are you coming in?

590
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,852
I was planning to go straight to ACT.

591
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,979
Come on, it's the big day.

592
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,439
We should go together.

593
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,690
Come by 11:00, sir.

594
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,275
Really? Okay, I got it.

595
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,235
Oh my, I need to get ready.

596
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,738
-Okay, I'll get your things.
-Jeez.

597
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,073
Eat up, you two.

598
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,659
He barely touched his food.

599
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,921
-Hi, honey.
-Is Ha-yeong coming with us?

600
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,923
Yes, we usually go to meetings together.

601
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,383
-I see.
-Why?

602
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,301
Well…

603
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,181
Should I sit this one out?

604
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,474
No, of course not.

605
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,476
I'll drive. You two get in the back.

606
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,144
-All right.
-Come on.

607
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,741
POINT UTILIZATION INFERIOR TO COMPETITORS

608
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,413
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

609
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,498
What, you don't like it?

610
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,750
It's not that.

611
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,544
It's perfect.

612
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,547
The concept, design, and research

613
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,590
really make the proposal stand out.

614
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,800
Do you think so?

615
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,512
I can tell you worked
at a major corporation for a long time.

616
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,848
-You're no joke.
-Right?

617
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,225
It's a waste to take this only to ACT.

618
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,478
We should pitch this
to all three major telecom companies.

619
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,105
That's a great idea.

620
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,815
-Nice.
-Okay, it's this one.

621
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,484
-I need you to click it. Click-click.
-Yes. I love it.

622
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,368
Thank you.

623
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,165
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

624
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,332
Let's head in.

625
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,375
Let's go.

626
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,186
Nak-su, are you coming?

627
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,520
We're late. Hurry up.

628
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,439
Okay, I'm coming.

629
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,525
-Think you can handle it?
-Please, this stuff is easy.

630
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,652
-It is? To go to the next slide…
-Yes.

631
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,362
-Click. That's it.
-Click. Okay.

632
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,906
-Click. Snap.
-Click.

633
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,865
-Click.
-Click.

634
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,368
-Got it.
-Two, three.

635
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,038
-Click.
-Okay. We cut it by 40%.

636
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,831
-Click, okay.
-Click. That's perfect.

637
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,335
So, once the payment goes through…

638
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,295
-Click.
-So the direction…

639
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,214
-Click.
-Click.

640
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,049
-Two, three.
-Click.

641
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,219
Let me know when to change the slide.

642
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,810
…when you ask me, and I'll…

643
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,646
Click.

644
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,696
MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK JEONG-TAE

645
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,629
-Mr. Song.
-Yes?

646
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,716
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

647
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,177
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

648
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,345
Yes, hello.

649
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,514
Hello, sir.

650
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,016
Hello. My goodness.

651
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,309
Welcome.

652
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,813
These are the people I mentioned.

653
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,691
-I'm Han Sang-cheol.
-Hello. I'm General Manager Do Jin-woo.

654
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,818
-I'm Director Park Ha-yeong.
-Nice to meet you.

655
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,238
I was a little disappointed, sir.

656
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,489
What?

657
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,908
How could you just leave so suddenly?

658
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,703
I should have at least
treated you to a proper meal.

659
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,290
Things were hectic back then.

660
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,417
Once this project is wrapped up,

661
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,336
we can arrange something then.

662
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,088
I'll look forward to it, sir.

663
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,965
Let's move to the conference room.

664
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,383
Okay.

665
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,719
-Jun-seop, finish up here.
-Yes, sir.

666
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,560
Next, by integrating
our in-app payment module

667
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,063
within the ACT membership app…

668
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,482
Next slide.

669
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,359
As you can see…

670
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,777
What's wrong?

671
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,697
As you can see in the table
on the next slide…

672
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,865
Just a moment.

673
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:10,992
There.

674
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,079
By offering consumers
more ways to use their membership points,

675
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,915
providing a better user experience,

676
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,792
and integrating telecom membership points

677
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,711
that were previously limited in use…

678
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,796
What the heck?

679
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,508
-What's wrong with this?
-By integrating telecom points

680
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,260
that were limited,

681
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,304
we can maximize…

682
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,388
Is it not working?

683
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,515
-I got it.
-…their actual impact…

684
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,100
I said it's fine.

685
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,852
THANK YOU

686
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,492
Jeez.

687
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,232
Oh boy.

688
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,735
I prepared a lot for this,
but there were some errors.

689
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,694
I'm sorry.

690
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,114
Let's stop here.

691
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,492
You've already given us
such thorough materials.

692
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,952
No need to explain any further.

693
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,120
Yes. Please refer to the email I sent you.

694
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,205
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

695
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,374
Ms. Kwon, could you turn on
the lights, please?

696
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,333
Yes.

697
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,337
Oh man.

698
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,600
Mr. Baek is not in the room.
Why is everyone so tense?

699
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,477
Relax.

700
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,984
-You worked so hard on this, sir.
-Well…

701
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,527
-Good work, sir.
-Good work, sir.

702
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,861
You really came prepared.

703
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,323
What's your title at this company?

704
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,743
I can answer that.
We're treating him as a director.

705
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,498
It's been tough for our team
without you around.

706
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,334
We've really been feeling it lately.
Haven't we?

707
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,753
No one has anything to say?

708
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,257
What did you all think about the proposal?

709
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,886
Well, I reviewed

710
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,514
all the materials you sent over by email.

711
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,727
The proposed 1.5% commission

712
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,188
isn't exactly the industry's lowest,

713
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,026
as it says here…

714
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,444
-What about you, Ms. Kwon?
-Yes?

715
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,740
Having someone who knows our situation

716
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,575
as the point of contact

717
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,786
will probably make
communication easier, and--

718
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,289
We're not here
to make our lives easier, are we?

719
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,083
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

720
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,460
What about you, Ik-hyeon?

721
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,087
With 5 billion won in membership points
expiring each month,

722
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,589
using in-app payments

723
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:33,051
could increase point usage and improve
customer satisfaction while cutting costs.

724
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,761
That's very optimistic of you.

725
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,905
All right. Let's do this.

726
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,616
Thank you.

727
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:01,454
-I look forward to working with you.
-I look forward to it as well.

728
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,373
Funny how fate works, isn't it?

729
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,542
We ended up working together again.

730
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,129
But as you know, Mr. Kim,

731
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,508
we're working with
quite a few startups right now.

732
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,676
And companies with former ACT employees

733
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,929
are often viewed more critically.

734
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,181
I trust you'll understand
where we're coming from.

735
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,101
Since you're proposing a six-month trial,

736
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,894
can we focus on building mutual trust…

737
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,898
and proceed with the contract
on a no-commission basis?

738
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,070
I shouldn't be speaking
to you about this, Mr. Kim.

739
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,697
-What do you say, Mr. Han?
-And after the six months?

740
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,616
You get upgraded to a partner company.

741
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,869
As a reward for your patience,
we'll make sure to offer you

742
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,579
better terms than what you proposed today.

743
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,249
-Can we trust you on that?
-Wait. Hold on.

744
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,291
Of course.

745
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,544
All right. Let's do it.

746
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,296
You're very decisive, sir.

747
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,174
I was a science major,
so I'm quick with numbers.

748
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,717
I see.

749
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,845
I majored in engineering,
so I knew nothing at first.

750
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,471
Nak-su gave me a really hard time.

751
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,141
-Really?
-Why would you do that, Mr. Kim?

752
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,769
All right. Then we're agreed.

753
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,397
I'll see you
at the follow-up meeting, Mr. Kim.

754
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,651
-Sir, could I have a word?
-Sure, of course.

755
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,655
You can take your time to catch up.

756
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,409
Man.

757
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,749
Mr. Kim.

758
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,171
Good work, sir.

759
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,964
-Good work, sir.
-Good work, sir.

760
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,509
Thanks, everyone.

761
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,476
Yes, sir.

762
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,321
-You were great.
-I know, right?

763
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,823
-So pretty too.
-I think I was born for this.

764
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,076
Nak-su. Let's get going.
Traffic's going to be bad.

765
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,455
-Why did you do that?
-Excuse me?

766
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,624
They're not paying us a dime
for six months.

767
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,626
Why did you jump at the offer?

768
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,046
We have to play the long game
and get our foot in the door.

769
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,925
On the bright side, we're getting
free exposure for our service.

770
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:22,220
And they promised to make us
a partner company in six months.

771
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,554
What about me?

772
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,723
I made dozens of calls
just to get this meeting.

773
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,351
And I stayed up for days prepping.

774
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,519
You promised me ten percent of the sales.

775
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,065
I'll go get the car.

776
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,651
-Okay. Thanks, Ha-yeong.
-Say something.

777
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,240
You have no reason to be mad at me.

778
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,159
Weren't you the one
who said you had pull around here?

779
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,288
Then you should've used that pull.
I'm the one who's taking the hit.

780
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,917
You were acting like you'd crush it

781
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,543
once you got to ACT.

782
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,295
But you were stammering

783
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,297
and breaking out in a cold sweat.

784
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,634
If this is how you are on your home turf,

785
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:05,054
how could I possibly trust you
and make you the sales director?

786
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,305
Let's go for now.

787
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,641
-We can talk on the way.
-Hey.

788
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,521
You called me this morning
just to drive you, didn't you?

789
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,024
You were the one who offered to drive.

790
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,110
I happen to have a good eye for people.

791
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,698
I remember the day I first met you
like it was yesterday.

792
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,907
What are you doing?

793
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,244
"This guy is a snake,
just testing the waters."

794
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,080
"We're definitely not going to get along."

795
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,916
Hey, that's a bit--

796
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,501
For some reason, I never liked you.

797
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,630
That's why I still haven't saved
your number in my phone. Got it?

798
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,133
Nak-su, if you keep going,

799
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,552
I'll tell you about some of my grudges.

800
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,053
I don't care.

801
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,597
And you two seemed to get along great.

802
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,391
Do Jin-woo is a snake too.

803
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,767
You two have fun.

804
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,770
But in the end,

805
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,189
you'll get what's coming to you.

806
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,734
You snake bastard.

807
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,362
Nak-su.

808
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:04,905
Nak-su!

809
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,067
NTC BANK

810
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,403
OCTOBER LOAN INTEREST PAYMENT NOTICE
INTEREST AMOUNT: 3,208,333 WON

811
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,201
Hey, Su-gyeom.

812
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,162
-Yes?
-How much longer are you gonna do this?

813
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:36,831
Well…

814
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't know.
I'm not sure when we'll sell everything.

815
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,509
-Kim Su-gyeom.
-Yes?

816
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,678
What did I tell you
when I gave you that money?

817
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,012
Answer me.

818
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,474
What did I say when I gave you
the 30 million?

819
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,812
To focus on school.

820
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,440
So how long are you going
to keep doing this nonsense?

821
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,151
When are you going to stop
playing this little game?

822
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,488
Dad.

823
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,283
I know how hard you worked for that money.

824
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,829
That's why I want to make money fast,
so I can pay you back right away.

825
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,873
I just…

826
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,335
I'm sorry.

827
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,382
That's not what I want to hear.

828
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,968
Su-gyeom.

829
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,013
You go off on your own,
taking risks, failing…

830
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,347
Fine, I get it.

831
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,934
But do you know what happens
when you're drowning in debt?

832
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,563
You end up losing yourself.

833
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:46,317
You'll lose sight of who you are
and why you started this.

834
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,402
That's worse than losing money.

835
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:52,072
You need to stay inside the same fence
as everyone else, no matter what.

836
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,742
Even if it looks uncool to you,

837
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,410
even if it doesn't seem impressive,

838
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,747
that fence is the only thing
that keeps you safe in the end.

839
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,748
Dad.

840
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,043
But that fence

841
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,712
didn't keep you safe.

842
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,510
That fence lead you
to the middle of nowhere, made you suffer,

843
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,678
and pushed you out.

844
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,682
Did you see that coming?

845
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,769
You didn't.

846
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,564
You couldn't keep yourself safe.

847
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,779
So how can you be so sure
about my future?

848
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,878
I guess you're right.

849
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,965
I'm not in a position to say that.

850
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,884
That's not what I meant.

851
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:54,885
Hey. Listen.

852
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,013
When I get a good job
and make a lot of money,

853
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,140
you'd better listen to me then, okay?

854
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,477
-Dad, I--
-Get back to work. Sorry to bother you.

855
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,938
Dad, that's not what I…

856
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,610
I didn't know you were home.

857
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,821
Yes, I got home early.

858
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,368
You should eat.

859
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,412
I already ate. I'm going to wash up.

860
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,289
Honey.

861
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,167
Nothing's going on, right?

862
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,921
I almost wish something was going on.

863
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,383
I'm fine.

864
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,643
Yes, I'm on my way.

865
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:26,977
Of course.

866
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,356
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Please wait just a bit longer.

867
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,654
Excuse me, are you waiting
for a designated driver?

868
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,697
-Yes.
-All right.

869
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:43,035
I'm sorry to ask,
but could I put this scooter in the trunk?

870
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,119
Sure. Go ahead.

871
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,622
Great, thank you. Please get in.

872
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,805
Rerouting.

873
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:03,889
TURN LEFT

874
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,269
How many times is that now?

875
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,897
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

876
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,024
Can't you see the screen?

877
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,485
You should've turned left back there.

878
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,279
I'm very sorry.
I'll get you there right away.

879
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,336
Here we are.

880
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,717
Thank you.

881
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,303
Where am I anyway?

882
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,009
AWAITING RIDE REQUEST

00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:25,637
It's 200,000 won.

884
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,306
What? To Yangsu-ri?

885
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,434
It'll be tough to get back.

886
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,978
Let's just go. Where are they?

887
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,563
19 JUNGGI-RO 9-GIL, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL

888
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,732
Why here of all places? Damn it.

889
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,736
TTOKDARI DINER

890
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,534
Jeez, he always gets ramyeon.

891
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,328
Let's get grilled mackerel.

892
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,746
-They have squid here.
-Ramyeon.

893
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,664
-Fine, get the squid.
-I'm getting what I want.

894
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,459
-Ramyeon. Here.
-Hey!

895
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,668
Hey.

896
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,840
-This isn't even cuttlefish.
-How can you drive--

897
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,091
The designated driver?

898
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,844
-Yes.
-Okay. I'm out of here!

899
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,055
You punk. Come on.
When did you call for a driver?

900
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,850
-Where are you going, man?
-Hey, I have to go.

901
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,812
Sorry about that. Those bastards.

902
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,146
-Hey, you--
-Let's go.

903
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,105
Okay.

904
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,691
My car's the black one across the street.

905
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:22,319
-Mr. Kim.
-What? Mr. Kim?

906
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,487
Mr. Kim?

907
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:27,908
Mister.

908
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,202
I'm so tired here.

909
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,370
Right.

910
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,041
Seriously, why did you drink so much?

911
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,001
He's my friend. Say hi.

912
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,253
Let's go. See you next time.

913
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,672
-Come on.
-The car's over there!

914
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,507
-Over there?
-Just go that way.

915
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,466
Let's go!

916
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,718
All right, Mr. Kim
will take you home tonight.

917
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,220
Got it?

918
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,305
I'll call you later. Good work today.

919
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,557
Okay, sir.

920
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,392
Why are you doing this to me?

921
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,853
Round two is on me!

922
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,155
GO STRAIGHT FOR 8 KM

923
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,827
What is it?

924
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,956
Getting a call
from a punk like you at this hour

925
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,125
already puts me in a bad mood.

926
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,711
What is it, Mr. Kim?

927
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:26,216
You said you checked everything, Mr. Kim.

928
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,556
Hey!

929
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,020
I told you to check it
three or four times, didn't I?

930
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,981
The meeting's tomorrow!

931
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,192
Who do you think you are
to take responsibility?

932
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,614
You're a grown man
and you still can't get anything right.

933
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,493
Just submit your resignation
tomorrow morning.

934
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,120
No excuses.

935
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,415
I'll make sure you get
a generous severance package.

936
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,168
Go start your own business.

937
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,254
Open a chicken joint.
I'll order from you every day.

938
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,466
Enough, you bastard! Just shut up!

939
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,302
I'm so sick of you!

940
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,803
You bastard, you need to…

941
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:18,810
That's right. You're going
to get an earful from my driver.

942
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,897
Sir, tell this bastard
to get his act together.

943
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,982
Just swear at him for me.

944
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,233
Sir, please don't do this.

945
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,945
I'm so frustrated
that I'm about to lose my mind.

946
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,365
Let him have it, please.

947
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,908
Just one good swear word.

948
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,494
That's enough, sir.

949
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:39,456
Okay, if you swear at him,
I'll give you an extra 200,000 won.

950
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,585
Getting 200,000 won to swear?
That's not bad, right?

951
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,339
You're okay with it, right?

952
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,174
He says it's fine.

953
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,802
Just let him have it!

954
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,804
Sir, you're very drunk.

955
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,431
Shut up! Just take it like a man!

956
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:57,766
Okay?

957
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,560
Sir.

958
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,563
You don't want the extra 200,000 won?

959
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,858
You get 400,000 in total!

960
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:08,652
Jeez!

961
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:13,824
Get a grip.

962
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,160
Damn it. I said to swear at him!

963
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,954
You son of a bitch!

964
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,164
"Son of a…"

965
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,920
Hey, Mr. Kim.

966
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:30,132
Please get a grip.

967
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,802
Did you spend all these years
with your head up your ass?

968
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:38,724
If it wasn't for me,
you'd have been fired long ago.

969
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,810
So do your job right, okay?

970
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,978
Hey.

971
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:55,008
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

972
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,874
So your wife still doesn't know
about the first-floor property you bought.

973
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,084
Sir!

974
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,127
The water's not working.

975
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,108
Excuse me, Dr. Na.

976
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,839
I think we're on the same level
of stupidity. I can't trust that guy.

977
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:37,968
This apartment is the culmination
of my 51 years.

978
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,344
Dad, you're the best!

979
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,721
-Who?
-I got kicked out.

980
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:45,100
When you hear something like that,
how does it make you feel?

981
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,726
I'm with a patient.

982
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,187
Sitting face-to-face
with a complete stranger…

983
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:51,398
I really can't do that.

984
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,693
Do you two even consider me
part of this family?

985
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,778
Come to your senses, Kim Nak-su!

986
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:02,576
