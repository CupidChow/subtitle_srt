00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,758
Mr. Kim.

3
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,972
Wait.

4
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,683
What are you doing here, sir?

5
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,228
Gosh.

6
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,064
What an unbelievable coincidence.

7
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,233
He came here on purpose.

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,652
So, you're washing cars.

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,446
I honestly had no idea you were here.

10
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,034
I don't know how he found out,
but he definitely knew.

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,454
-It's been a while.
-It really has.

12
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,416
Well, this is pretty awkward.

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,918
I can't ask you to wash my car.

14
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,379
Maybe I should just go
to a machine wash nearby.

15
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,552
No, on second thought,
I think that would be even ruder.

16
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,012
How much longer on that one?

17
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,724
I just have to dry it and wax it.

18
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,810
Then I'll wait.

19
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,737
HAND CAR WASH

20
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,369
Take your time, sir.

21
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,829
Since I'm here anyway,

22
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,832
I'd be honored to have you wash my car.

23
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,126
Why?

24
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,379
The thing is…

25
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,299
I could really use
some good luck right now.

26
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,974
It's in two weeks.

27
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,394
The executive promotion announcement.

28
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,153
Jeez.

29
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,205
Nak-su, your reservation's here.

30
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,164
What?

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,999
Your reservation's here.

32
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,669
Okay.

33
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,463
Right, I did have a reservation.

34
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,800
It totally slipped my mind.
I have a reservation.

35
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,387
I have to do that one
after I finish this.

36
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,306
Is that right?

37
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,852
Well…

38
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,271
It is what it is.

39
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,607
See you next time.

40
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,236
I'll come back soon with good news.

41
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,032
Bye.

42
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,033
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:30,919
-Yeong-gil!
-Yes?

44
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,088
-Change the engine oil on this one.
-Okay.

45
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,632
Why would you lie like that?

46
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,759
Come on, you played along.

47
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,178
Was that a former colleague from ACT?

48
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,432
Yes.

49
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,643
I might not be here next time.

50
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,957
-It came out great.
-I'm getting a little emotional.

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,710
If you order over a thousand,
I can do 10,000 won each.

52
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,504
Another 1,200 this time?

53
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,048
Just 100 for now, please.

54
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,305
One, two, three.

55
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,976
My family's on a tight budget these days.

56
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,436
My mom's constantly rushing around,

57
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,980
and my dad's busy
trying to clean things up.

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,275
-Jeez.
-Try a different pose.

59
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,908
That's why we have
to get real results, Han-na.

60
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,452
Whether it's promotions or marketing,
we have to do it right.

61
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,787
-Hey.
-We have to--

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,664
If the model looks like he's carrying
the weight of the world,

63
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,500
who's going to buy the clothes?

64
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,628
It says "Love Lives Here," remember?

65
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,883
-Sorry.
-If you really want to help your family,

66
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,343
do your job right.

67
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,637
Act like a professional.

68
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,061
One more time.

69
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,438
Let's take one as a couple.

70
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,949
One, two…

71
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,124
One, two, three.

72
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,182
Jeez.

73
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,883
I'm home.

74
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,928
The average selling price
of Seoul apartments

75
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,389
has risen by 0.6% compared to last month.

76
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,183
Gangdong-gu, in particular,
surpassed the three Gangnam districts

77
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,270
and recorded the highest rate
of increase within Seoul.

78
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,105
For a while, Gangdong-gu
had been undervalued,

79
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,774
but with the launch of a large-scale
redevelopment project,

80
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,193
the market sentiment has rebounded.

81
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,280
-The weather forecast…
-Also, Mapo-gu and Nowon-gu--

82
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,323
Here it is.

83
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,158
From late fall…

84
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,912
Have you found a place
to open your own office yet?

85
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,997
People across the city stepped out…

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,084
A real estate agent I know
asked if I wanted

87
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,253
to take over her office.

88
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,546
That's great.

89
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,548
How much is the rental premium?

90
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,844
Fifty million.

91
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,804
Really?

92
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,140
This is unusual for early winter.

93
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,726
Heavy showers accompanied
by thunder and gusty winds

94
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,770
are expected across the country,

95
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,897
so be sure to bring an umbrella
when you go out.

96
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,440
Honey.

97
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,526
-What if no one goes to the car wash?
-The rain will continue…

98
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,486
Well…

99
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,154
…making it hard to catch
a clear sky…

100
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,864
Are you going to watch the ball game?

101
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,033
-What channel was it?
-There's no game today.

102
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,201
You're right.

103
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,833
EPISODE 12
RAIN SHOWER

104
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,670
CAR WASH OWNERS' FORUM

105
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,552
ACT HQ CORPORATE VEHICLES
CAR WASH SERVICE VENDOR RECRUITMENT

106
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,720
CAR WASH VENDOR RECRUITMENT

107
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,892
"6.2 million."

108
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,477
CONTRACT AMOUNT: 6.2 MILLION WON/MONTH

109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,646
Wow, they're paying well.

110
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,439
Jeez.

111
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,359
Well, look who's smiling.

112
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,944
Yes.

113
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,072
Did you finally snap
from not working for a few days?

114
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,449
What are you looking at?

115
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,577
"ACT Headquarters Corporate Vehicles"?

116
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,204
It's for washing the executives' cars.

117
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,872
You can't do that.

118
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,542
The competition
for those things is insane.

119
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,460
Just look at the number of views.

120
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:24,963
VIEWS: 3,453

121
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,674
Plus, it's a major corporation.
They'll be really picky.

122
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,259
You're not some master detailer.

123
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,720
You've only done small jobs
in the neighborhood.

124
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,679
A TON WILL APPLY

125
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,264
I won't do it.

126
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,518
If you can't, you can't.
Why say you "won't"?

127
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,024
No, it says here.
It requires two or more full-time staff.

128
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,402
I see.

129
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:48,987
So you won't do it.

130
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:50,864
Right.

131
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,741
You got so flustered
when that colleague came.

132
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,119
You wouldn't be able to get anything done
in a parking lot full of people you know.

133
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,245
You shouldn't apply.

134
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,249
I'm not worried about you.

135
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,710
Our brilliant Mr. Kim
will figure something out.

136
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,857
Honey.

137
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,816
Yes?

138
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,863
Why don't you look into
opening your own automatic car wash?

139
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,159
-Why?
-It seems like everyone's going that way.

140
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,244
Maybe because the economy's bad.

141
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,248
The car wash is doing fine.

142
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,419
It is?

143
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,964
Well, you know…

144
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,177
Oh, right.

145
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,348
Ta-da.

146
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,767
Su-gyeom's rent for this month.

147
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,852
Wow, it's thick.

148
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,398
Looks like his business is doing well.

149
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,819
Don't you rather have your son as a tenant

150
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,612
instead of the toast shop owner?

151
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,741
-Honey.
-Yes?

152
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,540
So, ACT…

153
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,336
is looking for a company
to wash their corporate vehicles.

154
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,629
At ACT?

155
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,256
Yes.

156
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,552
What should I do?
The terms are pretty good.

157
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,472
It feels wrong, doesn't it?

158
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,601
Or am I wrong? Should I do it?

159
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,647
It's not about what you "should" do.

160
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,483
If something about it bothers you,
then you don't do it.

161
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,237
Whether it's an automatic car wash or ACT,

162
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,698
just do whatever makes you comfortable.

163
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,242
If Kim Nak-su does something,
he has his reasons.

164
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,620
And if he doesn't,
I know he has his reasons for that too.

165
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,517
CAR WASH VENDOR RECRUITMENT

166
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,452
You're going to wash cars?

167
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,331
Serves you right.

168
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,917
All that talk about becoming an executive.

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,920
I was 50 and you made me beg you twice.

170
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,589
I got fired from Taejeong
because you took the Kukkiwon project.

171
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,882
Did you know that?

172
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,093
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,680
-Tae-hwan.
-Yes.

174
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,057
What are you doing?

175
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,141
Hello.

176
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,727
We're done talking. He's about to leave.

177
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,396
Go on inside.

178
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,565
-I'm going back in.
-Hold on.

179
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,861
Hand-washing cars is hard on the body

180
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,239
but easy on the mind.

181
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,366
Think about it seriously.

182
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,580
Could you really bring yourself
to wash cars at ACT?

183
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,252
In front of Sung-gu and Song-hee?

184
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,510
A few days ago,

185
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,888
Do Jin-woo came to the car wash.

186
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,683
I couldn't wash his car.

187
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,352
I lied to send him away.

188
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,190
I felt so pathetic.

189
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,819
So you deliberately want to go to ACT

190
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,822
to try and overcome
that pathetic pride of yours. Is that it?

191
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,365
I want to understand.

192
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,368
What the company I worked at for 25 years

193
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,205
truly means to me in my life.

194
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,671
Jeez.

195
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,970
All right. Good thing you came to me.

196
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,639
You're lucky to have a friend like me.

197
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,266
What is it?

198
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,436
This commercial building is part
of the third new city development.

199
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,854
The subway's going in on the left,

200
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,814
and the second and third floors
are sold out.

201
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,232
-You--
-Just listen.

202
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,400
The foot traffic's huge,

203
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,111
and a big franchise cafe
is moving in on the second floor.

204
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,739
I bargained it down to 1.1 billion won.

205
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,951
You haven't spent your severance, right?
We could each put in 550 million--

206
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,536
You dumbass!

207
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,413
-Come on. Get over here.
-Why?

208
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,622
Follow me, you punk.

209
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,167
-I'm coming.
-Seriously, this guy!

210
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,418
Where are you going?

211
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,879
-I haven't told anyone else about this.
-We'll be right back!

212
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,505
-Get over here.
-What is it?

213
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,466
MANGJIN PLAZA
URGENT SALE, FOR LEASE

214
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,343
Here it is.

215
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,720
My 500 million severance

216
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,597
and a 550 million won loan.

217
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,310
LEASE INQUIRIES

218
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,732
But you managed to find a tenant.

219
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,234
A tenant?

220
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,070
Hi, Dad!

221
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,200
I couldn't find one,
so Su-gyeom is using it.

222
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,953
Snap out of it. Let's go practice.

223
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,039
Washing cars.

224
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,084
Keep it up.

225
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,462
Let's go.

226
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,214
Get a grip.

227
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,263
ACT HQ CORPORATE VEHICLES
CAR WASH VENDOR INTERVIEWS

228
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,730
A lot of young people showed up.

229
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,315
Don't chicken out.

230
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,858
Tough odds for us old-timers.

231
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,527
It's fine.

232
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,321
INTERVIEW ROOM

233
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,198
-Refreshing Car Wash.
-Yes.

234
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,574
Come on in.

235
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,119
Remember, passion and spirit.

236
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,120
Okay?

237
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,830
Let's get in there.

238
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,373
Take a seat.

239
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,212
Two, three.

240
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,214
-Hello, we're--
-Hello, we're--

241
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,715
Yes, please have a seat.

242
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes.

243
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,011
NAME: KIM NAK-SU

244
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,013
In line with ACT's management philosophy…

245
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:31,973
NAME: HEO TAE-HWAN

246
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,350
…by using eco-friendly detergents…

247
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,603
we consider the environment, and…

248
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,982
by providing a car wash history service,

249
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,901
we offer ACT employees a refreshing…

250
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:44,861
GENERAL MANAGER

251
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,280
…a refreshing car wash experience

252
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,574
which truly sets us apart…

253
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,160
I mean, that truly sets us apart.
Thank you.

254
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,164
You were a general manager here?

255
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,415
Yes.

256
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,792
-And you were a manager.
-Yes.

257
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,586
-Surprised?
-No.

258
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,212
Well,

259
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,840
we get applicants like you often,

260
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,884
but in the end, they don't last.

261
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,761
I last… I lasted 25 years.

262
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,017
Anyway, I'll see you later.

263
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,518
Yes.

264
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,829
Please come this way.

265
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,040
Please stand behind this line.

266
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,417
Form two lines, please.

267
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,294
Refreshing Car Wash.

268
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,253
-Yes.
-Yes.

269
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,838
You can take this car.

270
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,926
-Crystal Wash.
-Refreshing Car Wash.

271
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,011
-You can do this car.
-Easy Car Clean.

272
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,888
-Yes.
-You can take that car.

273
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,642
The rest of you, please wait here for now.

274
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,269
Starting now, you have ten minutes
to wash this car.

275
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,479
Please keep the product

276
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,688
-from splashing around.
-Okay.

277
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,357
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

278
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,484
Okay, begin!

279
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,448
Try your best not to
splash the cleaning products.

280
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,845
Here.

281
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,124
The problem with this car

282
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,875
is that the sensors
are just too sensitive.

283
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,043
You know your cars.

284
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,422
I used to drive this
when I was an assistant manager.

285
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,925
That gray sedan over there?
I've driven it more than my own car.

286
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,345
But have you driven an executive's car?

287
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,557
"2809." That's my boss's car.

288
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,936
He may not care about other things,
but he can't stand dirty wheels.

289
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,064
Since we have
a full understanding of these things,

290
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,359
we're able to offer
this kind of special service.

291
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,736
Hey, we're behind! Let's hurry!

292
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,279
Please shave 30 seconds off!

293
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,764
WAITING AREA

294
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,601
The corporate car wash vendor
for the second half of this year…

295
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,272
is Refreshing Car Wash.

296
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,072
Thank you so much.

297
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,243
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

298
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,244
WIND QUICK DELIVERY

299
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,454
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

300
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,585
-We sold almost all our inventory.
-Yes!

301
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,426
So what should our next item be?

302
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,805
Look at you, CEO Kim Su-gyeom.

303
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,641
Now that's how a successful CEO sits.

304
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,562
No. I'll remain humble.

305
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,606
Come on. Go even further.

306
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,525
Put your feet up on the desk
and everything.

307
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,320
All right, then. Maybe just a little…

308
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,493
One second.

309
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,494
Okay.

310
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,472
That call earlier was from your dad.

311
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,765
Yes.

312
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,476
So you're packing up
and flying to the US right now?

313
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,521
Yes, as soon as I sort things out.

314
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,023
Did your dad say to come right away?

315
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,817
Yes, he was really mad.

316
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,403
And I think he's not feeling well.

317
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,406
I'll sort things out and be back soon.

318
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,284
Hold down the fort, all right?

319
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,747
The bus is here.

320
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,124
Bye.

321
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,792
Han-na.

322
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,294
Yes?

323
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,172
What should I do?

324
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,924
What?

325
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,468
Without you here.

326
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,679
What am I supposed to do?

327
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,641
Hey, how should I know?

328
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,730
You'll figure it out somehow.

329
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,566
I'm going.

330
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,569
Excuse me.

331
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,755
What's this?

332
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,965
Are you trying to steal my job?

333
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,552
I got the job.

334
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,013
I start next week.

335
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,432
That's great.

336
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,272
REFRESHING CAR WASH

337
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,235
Take all the car washing supplies

338
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,653
in the trunk of this car.

339
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,863
What?

340
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,491
A gift for your new job.

341
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,118
When you got your first job 25 years ago,

342
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:09,870
I couldn't afford it.

343
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,956
Let's just call it even with this.

344
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,499
ON-SITE AND CORPORATE CAR WASH

345
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,710
You knew I'd get the job?

346
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:20,172
You're our family's
greatest success story.

347
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,549
Of course you would land the job.

348
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:25,094
If you'd gotten tutoring instead of me,
you would've gotten into SNU.

349
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,013
What's the point of saying that now?

350
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,058
Don't come back now.

351
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,564
Wash cars in the big city.

352
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,067
Don't be like me, stuck on the outskirts.

353
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,071
Hey, don't say that!

354
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,115
You're great.

355
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,044
OPEN YEAR-ROUND
REFRESHING CAR WASH

356
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,048
I think we're almost done.

357
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,800
Okay.

358
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,553
-Congratulations on the job!
-Congratulations!

359
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,016
You really didn't have to get a cake.

360
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,894
Come on. It's like you won
the World's Best Car Wash Competition.

361
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,979
-Put it here.
-Congratulations again, sir.

362
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,773
All those late nights you worked
finally paid off.

363
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,941
Oh, come on.

364
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,444
Say "thank you" already.

365
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,279
-Thank you, everyone.
-Thank you.

366
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,947
Should we blow out the candles together?

367
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,657
-Sure.
-One, two, three!

368
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,911
Congratulations!

369
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,454
Congrats! You pulled it off!

370
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,957
-Make sure you do a good job.
-I just need to do what I'm told.

371
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,251
-But you are good at it.
-Let's go eat. My treat.

372
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,128
-What?
-Let's grill some meat today.

373
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,048
-Stone-grilled barbecue!
-Stone-grilled barbecue!

374
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,051
The jjajang there is really good.
It's a great place.

375
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,428
-Hey, you have to take the cake!
-Right.

376
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,555
Here, be careful.

377
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
So, about this--

378
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,850
-Honey.
-Yes?

379
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,603
If you run into someone you know,
just smile, okay?

380
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,439
Just say hello to them first.

381
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,566
It's more embarrassing
to try and hide. Got it?

382
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,151
You're worrying for nothing again.

383
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,112
If I cared about things like that,
I wouldn't have applied.

384
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,072
Okay.

385
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:18,082
REFRESHING CAR WASH

386
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,294
What's with the mask?

387
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,296
Let's take the stuff out.

388
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,216
For crying out loud.

389
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,802
After talking so big
in front of your wife…

390
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,179
-It's for the dust.
-Whatever.

391
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,889
Hey, Ik-hyeon's here.

392
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,767
Never try acting.

393
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,396
Mr. Kim.

394
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,117
Let me do it.

395
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,702
Ik-hyeon, it's okay.

396
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,537
I don't mind.

397
00:24:58,998 --> 00:24:59,873
Ik-hyeon.

398
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,542
Don't worry, sir.

399
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,544
It's not that I'm worried.

400
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,255
Everyone will find out eventually…

401
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,673
TODAY'S SCHEDULE: 35 CARS

402
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,508
…that we're doing this.

403
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,176
So no need to tell them in advance--

404
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,390
Mr. Kim.

405
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,018
I'll keep it a secret. I will.

406
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,312
I know it's not my place,
but if I could just say one thing.

407
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,605
Go ahead.

408
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,816
It makes me nervous
when you get all serious like that.

409
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,151
What is it?

410
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,987
I respect you.

411
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,406
I truly do.

412
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,917
He probably really meant that.

413
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,171
He has nothing to gain
by flattering you now, right?

414
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,007
How about a nice iced Americano?

415
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,719
Sounds good.

416
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,935
This is going so much faster
with the two of us.

417
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,562
The cars are mostly clean.

418
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,647
I don't think this will be
too hard at all.

419
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,608
That's why it was so competitive.

420
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,650
This is totally doable.

421
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,445
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

422
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,031
There was one thing
I forgot to mention earlier.

423
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,866
The other vehicles are fine,

424
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,368
but the executive vehicles
require some special care.

425
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,536
-Okay.
-Yes.

426
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,622
These are the handover instructions.

427
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,417
Just take a look at this
and follow it exactly as written.

428
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,376
All right.

429
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,629
Read it carefully.
Don't skip anything. Take care.

430
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,671
Just a moment.

431
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,925
Do we have to use these exact brands?

432
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,718
That's why I gave it to you.

433
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,638
So what about the cost
of these products?

434
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,890
That's included in the service fee.

435
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,684
You should read the contract properly.

436
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,938
And why do we clean the golf clubs?

437
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,362
We understand. All right.

438
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,614
-Take care.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,035
And have your drinks or snacks
over there in the corner, out of sight.

440
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,328
Right.

441
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,166
-Take care.
-Yes.

442
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,876
-Yes.
-Understood.

443
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,630
"Sensitive to tire pressure."
What the hell?

444
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,298
-Who gives a damn?
-Hey.

445
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,301
Let's just do it. Come on.

446
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,598
Didn't you use to go out
on the course with Mr. Hwang sometimes?

447
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,267
Oh man.

448
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,853
And now you're cleaning
the man's golf clubs.

449
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:26,979
What a life.

450
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,191
The air pressure is fine.
What more do they want from us?

451
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,776
Do they want us to add more?

452
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,070
-Keep it down.
-Excuse me, you two.

453
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,656
Come with me for a moment.

454
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,743
About Managing Director Cho Gi-jung.

455
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,913
The only joy he gets on his commute
is watching the Hangang River.

456
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,667
Today, those fingerprints on the glass

457
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,044
totally threw him off.

458
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,504
We're sorry.

459
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,799
Put yourself in his shoes.

460
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,218
In a way, his precious daily routine
was disrupted.

461
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,636
Wouldn't you be angry?

462
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,189
See? It's your hand.

463
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,982
Those stubby fingers.

464
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,151
And you've got piano hands?

465
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,694
Your fingers look exactly the same.

466
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,904
Pass me the towel.

467
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,366
-What in the world…
-You should've been more careful.

468
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,744
I don't think this was us.

469
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,121
It's definitely your hand.
Be careful from now on.

470
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,248
I don't think it's ours.
Someone else must have--

471
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,292
You were leaning here
and drinking coffee.

472
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,335
I saw you.

473
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,254
My, they're working so hard.

474
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,675
This is delicious.

475
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,680
-What are we doing, hiding here?
-Just eat. We don't have time.

476
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,974
Have some seaweed.

477
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,143
I eat this every day.

478
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,519
Really?

479
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,272
There you are.

480
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,191
Can one of you come with me?

481
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,150
Hurry.

482
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,444
-Keep eating.
-What?

483
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,490
-I'm eating your seaweed.
-Don't finish it!

484
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,867
Damn it.

485
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,578
Over here, sir.

486
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,121
Yes, this car.

487
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,334
Actually, I…

488
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm so sorry.
Something came up unexpectedly.

489
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,551
It's no problem at all.

490
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:23,887
Yes.

491
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,056
I was just on my way out.

492
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,893
Yes, of course.
I'll call you when I get there.

493
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,270
Okay.

494
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,439
-He just started.
-Really?

495
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,900
Make it quick, please.
I have to leave right now.

496
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,151
Yes, sir.

497
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,455
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HWANG TAE-SAN

498
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,339
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

499
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,051
I'm just on my way out now.

500
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,221
I'm sorry. I must have missed that.

501
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,890
Dinner? Tonight?

502
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,436
Yes, I understand.

503
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,859
Hey, open all the windows.

504
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,448
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HWANG TAE-SAN

505
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:29,995
Sir, are you okay?

506
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,748
I can't… I can't breathe.

507
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,083
Are you okay?

508
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,252
Yes, I'm fine.

509
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,087
Sir,
please call the company clinic--

510
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,130
No, don't!

511
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,800
Not the company clinic. Don't.

512
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,844
I'm fine.

513
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,888
Should I get you something to drink, then?

514
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,056
Just some water, please.

515
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,265
Just a moment, sir.

516
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,817
Sir.

517
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,529
If you're done here,
you can get back to work.

518
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,532
I'm fine. I'm…

519
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,493
fine…

520
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,001
What are you doing here?

521
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,839
Why are you here…

522
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,346
You turned me down

523
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,307
for this?

524
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,198
-That's not it, Jeong-tae.
-You…

525
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,243
Do you have any idea what I went through

526
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,578
to make you an executive?

527
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,038
Don't try to talk.

528
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,332
Jeong-tae, breathe slowly.

529
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,501
And loosen your belt.

530
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,753
You need to see a doctor.

531
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,923
It's not fatal.
You were just startled, that's all.

532
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,884
But it won't go away on its own.

533
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,178
You need to see a doctor
and take medicine.

534
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,890
I know what that's like.
You have to listen to me.

535
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,560
And take things easy.

536
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,272
Sir!

537
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,692
I brought you some water.

538
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,073
Please take him to a doctor.

539
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,241
-Okay.
-Thank you.

540
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,762
Thank you.

541
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,477
Thank you.

542
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,895
Sure. Bye.

543
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,870
MANAGING DIRECTOR LEE HAN-NA

544
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,836
Dad.

545
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,632
Are you going to a funeral?

546
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,675
No.

547
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,719
Can you give me a ride?

548
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,685
It's a mentorship interview for students.
Did they tell you to wear a suit?

549
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,312
No, it's just…

550
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,732
The interviewers are from the HR team
of a major corporation.

551
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,485
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

552
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,197
I need more experience, Dad.

553
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,408
I'm still not sure what I like

554
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,119
and what I want to be.

555
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,916
You need experience?

556
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,003
You retook your CSAT,

557
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,172
worked at a startup,

558
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,716
even got scammed,

559
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,929
and ran an online store.
A 20-year-old who's done all that?

560
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,059
If you ask me, you've already got
more than enough experience.

561
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,521
Out of all that, wasn't there
a single thing you enjoyed?

562
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,315
There was, but--

563
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,358
There you go.

564
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,152
Then what are you so unsure about?

565
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,197
Just start from there, kid.

566
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,576
Why make it so complicated?

567
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,710
Kim Su-gyeom?

568
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,295
What?

569
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,006
That's the Kim Su-gyeom I remember.

570
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,468
A kid with a peculiar rebellious streak
and a stubborn, by-the-book nature.

571
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,220
We make a good team, don't we?

572
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,932
Why don't we get some stock
and start selling for real?

573
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,978
Should we put something like this
on our hoodies?

574
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,648
If it weren't for you,
I couldn't have done anything.

575
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,984
You make me

576
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,613
want to become something more.

577
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,907
You'll figure it out somehow.

578
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,413
HAN-NA

579
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:27,083
I've arrived at the airport.
Take care while I'm gone.

580
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,506
Dad, can you pull over up there?

581
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,345
I'll call you, Dad.

582
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,346
Okay.

583
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,014
Thank you.

584
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,150
Hello.

585
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,330
Thank you.

586
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,047
Attention passengers.

587
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,549
Under aviation security rules,

588
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,177
liquids and gels are not allowed

589
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,304
in carry-on baggage…

590
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:22,931
HAN-NA, WHERE ARE YOU?
WAIT FOR ME

591
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,641
…for international flights.

592
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,864
I've been looking all over for you.

593
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,922
Did you take a taxi again?

594
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,221
Why'd you come?

595
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,768
I really have to go now.

596
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,480
I know.

597
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,608
Look, I…

598
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,741
I like you.

599
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,777
Take it.

600
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:46,741
What are you doing?

601
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,409
My apologies.

602
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,455
You know, it just occurred to me

603
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,042
that your office gets a lot of sunlight.

604
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,839
I thought a little potted plant
by the window would be nice.

605
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,708
2025 EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS

606
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,543
ANNOUNCEMENT TIME CHANGED
TO 2:00 P.M. TODAY

607
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,591
MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK JEONG-TAE

608
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,994
-I'll be on my way, sir.
-Okay.

609
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,454
Right. Yesterday,

610
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,873
we got a yakgwa gift set delivered.

611
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,876
-Excuse me?
-It's from a client.

612
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,462
I left it in the staff lounge
for everyone.

613
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,548
Thank you. That's very kind.

614
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,051
Grab a box and take it to Mr. Kim.

615
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,303
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes.

616
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,763
He's nearby.

617
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,142
And let me know
if he seems happy to get it.

618
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,354
Thanks.

619
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,076
I should go pre-rinse that car.

620
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,129
What is it?

621
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,216
If you have something to say, say it.
I'm busy.

622
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,928
I don't understand.

623
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,554
What?

624
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,848
Whatever Mr. Baek asked you to do,

625
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,351
was it really harder than this?

626
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,896
If you were going to hide
and work wearing a mask,

627
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,189
you could have just--

628
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,944
I'm sorry.

629
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,405
Is this better?

630
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,034
Do Jin-woo knows you work here.

631
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,830
He told me to give this to you.

632
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,625
You won't take it, right?

633
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,712
I'll tell him you refused.

634
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,672
What is it?

635
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,549
Yakgwa.

636
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,844
Sounds delicious. Leave it.

637
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,305
Leave it.

638
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,026
I'll say you didn't take it.

639
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,819
Why do you care about my pride?

640
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,320
I don't know.

641
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,365
I just wish you didn't accept it.

642
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,201
I don't want to see
Do Jin-woo toying with you.

643
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,411
You…

644
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,204
really liked me, didn't you?

645
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,290
Yes, I guess so.

646
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,334
The executive promotions
will be announced soon.

647
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,670
You'll have to wash
Do Jin-woo's car starting tomorrow.

648
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,422
Can you really do that?

649
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,342
Sung-gu.

650
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,971
Do you skip work
if you wake up in a bad mood?

651
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,600
What kind of question is that?

652
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,727
Come on.

653
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,812
Get back to work.

654
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,568
All right.

655
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,884
One minute until the announcement.

656
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,262
Why are you more worked up than I am?

657
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,764
Fifty-five, fifty-four…

658
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,516
-Get back to work.
-…fifty-three…

659
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,851
-Go on.
-…fifty-two, fifty-one, fifty,

660
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,729
forty-nine, forty-eight,

661
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:30,024
forty-seven, forty-six, forty-five,

662
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,818
forty-four, forty-three…

663
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,445
The announcement is up.

664
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,119
SALES DIVISION REORGANIZATION
AND EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS

665
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,893
Nak-su, what are you doing?

666
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,062
Come on, let's finish this up.

667
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,189
Okay, I'm coming.

668
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,300
-Sir?
-Yes.

669
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,218
This month's evaluation.

670
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,307
-Good work.
-You too.

671
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,308
Nak-su, what is it?

672
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,770
CAR WASH SERVICE WRITTEN EVALUATION

673
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,981
Is this a decent score?

674
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:52,982
SATISFIED

675
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,735
In corporate terms, it's an A.
So it's good, right?

676
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,778
I used to always give you A's too.

677
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,451
Then let's work harder, okay?
We need to renew our contract.

678
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,494
-Right.
-Sorry, I have to go now.

679
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,371
-Hurry up. You'll be late.
-Right.

680
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,084
Hey, honey. I'm leaving now. Yes.

681
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,846
"THE WAY BACK"

682
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,946
…street corner

683
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:43,199
Where I wait alone in sorrow

684
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:47,078
Only the cold rain and wind

685
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:51,040
Blow on my cheeks

686
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:57,463
Even if I can't say I love you

687
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:04,971
-I have to…
-I have to at least say goodbye

688
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,058
The one who left

689
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,102
Without a word--

690
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,187
Why'd you turn it off?

691
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,231
I hate it when people sing along with me.

692
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,652
You probably just hated that it was me.

693
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,114
I've seen you sing a duet
with Baek Jeong-tae…

694
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,576
at karaoke quite a few times.

695
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,289
You've been drinking.
Did you call for a driver?

696
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,748
Yes, I did.

697
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,667
Good. Head on out.

698
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,547
You should have washed my car that day.

699
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,345
I told you I needed some good luck.

700
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,686
I didn't make it.

701
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,109
I'm the designated driver.
Anyone going to Banpo-dong?

702
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,153
That's me. What took you so long?

703
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,364
I'm sorry. The entrance was hard to find.

704
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,825
I called ages ago. Jeez.

705
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,078
Give her the keys already.

706
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:13,873
Thanks.

707
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,958
Where is the car parked?

708
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,752
Just press the button on the key.

709
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,253
I'm too drunk to remember.

710
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,679
I'm sorry.
You should call for another driver.

711
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,764
What do you mean?

712
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,767
From my experience,
I don't think this will end well.

713
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,352
Take care.

714
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,771
Wait a minute. Hey.

715
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,106
-Ma'am, wait!
-Hey! Don't.

716
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,567
-Where are you going?
-Enough. Don't.

717
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,736
Can you believe this?

718
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,947
Have I done something seriously wrong?

719
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,117
That's for her to decide.

720
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,374
Yes. You're right.

721
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,881
I'm not the one who gets to decide.

722
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,764
Call for another driver,
or figure it out yourself.

723
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,890
I'm busy.

724
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,141
Yes, sir.

725
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,070
Mr. Kim.

726
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,075
Why do you think I didn't make it?

727
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,037
Did Mr. Hwang change his mind?

728
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:38,499
Or did the other committee members object?

729
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,460
Or maybe

730
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,588
they thought I was
too young to be an executive.

731
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,425
If not that, then was it because

732
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,927
I only went to a junior college?

733
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,972
Mr. Kim.

734
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,310
Why on earth didn't I make it?

735
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,439
What was the reason I was rejected?

736
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,359
You know this company inside and out.

737
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,278
Why did…

738
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,405
Why didn't I get it?

739
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,948
I really don't know why.

740
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,409
From the day I joined this company,

741
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,745
the only thing I ever thought about
was my performance!

742
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,374
I have…

743
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,214
I have devoted 19 years of my life to ACT.

744
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,096
That means I deserve to be

745
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,017
an executive at least once, doesn't it?

746
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,857
I get it.

747
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:49,778
Then why…

748
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,283
Why!

749
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,870
There was no competition, so why?

750
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,865
Baek Jeong-tae is staying another year.

751
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,371
He might just send me to the factory,
like he did with you.

752
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,709
He probably won't.

753
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:47,920
Why not?

754
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,923
Because he needs you
to become an executive director.

755
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:55,553
That's how the company
uses you and Baek Jeong-tae.

756
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,057
I don't want to work for a company
that uses me like that anymore.

757
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,809
Then quit, you punk.

758
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,310
Your family's rich, right?

759
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,230
That apartment isn't mine.

760
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,649
It's in my in-laws' name.

761
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,193
Is that right?

762
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,821
That explains it.

763
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:16,907
I see.

764
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,119
Jeez.

765
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,998
Now you seem more like the Mr. Kim I know.

766
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,583
What, you punk?

767
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,876
You seemed different until just now.

768
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,295
To be honest,

769
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,924
I thought you'd be happy that
I didn't become the managing director.

770
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,098
I was secretly looking forward
to washing your car.

771
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,270
I thought it might make me
feel a bit relieved.

772
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,772
It's a shame it didn't happen.

773
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,239
How have you been
since you left the company?

774
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,867
What on earth happened to you

775
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,703
that made you capable
of saying something like that?

776
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,210
I'm sorry.

777
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:14,423
We're not really the type
for cozy little talks like this.

778
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,010
Right.

779
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:22,473
BANPO BRIDGE
WELCOME TO SEOCHO

780
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:38,656
Bye.

781
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,284
Mr. Kim.

782
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,255
Here.

783
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,811
Mr. Kim, why…

784
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,856
Why didn't I make it?

785
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,538
Why did you want to be an executive?

786
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,916
Excuse me?

787
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,127
Not why you didn't make it.

788
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,505
The reason you pushed yourself so hard

789
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,716
and what you were living for.

790
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,509
Do you know?

791
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:51,854
Jin-woo.

792
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,817
Try being honest with yourself.

793
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,779
That should help you in life.

794
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,534
Oh, and…

795
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,789
I think I earned this much.

796
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,177
I lost.

797
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,305
I'm the one who lost.

798
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,699
Do Jin-woo didn't quit the company.

799
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,953
And just as I thought, Baek Jeong-tae
didn't send him to the factory.

800
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,830
Will this even work?

801
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:58,212
Their relationship
was one of mutual necessity.

802
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,047
I'll make it work.

803
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,674
I'll get as much help as I can
from the other divisions.

804
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:03,884
I'll go meet

805
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,969
the support team.

806
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,097
The AI surveillance camera package
and private network…

807
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,725
These guys are still holding on
to their positions.

808
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,644
…successfully rebounded.

809
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,396
Recently, as fiscal tightening has eased,

810
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,233
the volume of public institution bids
has been expanding again.

811
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,360
-This means…
-The only thing that's changed

812
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,488
is that they get to attend meetings again.

813
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,705
Sir.

814
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,086
The managing director
asked me to give you this.

815
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:43,048
He wanted me to thank you
for always washing his car so well.

816
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,560
BEEF SHORT RIBS

817
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,861
This time, we get to eat it.

818
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,822
Take your time and savor it.

819
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,574
Here, say "Ah."

820
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,284
It's so good.

821
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,513
Su-gyeom is still juggling
his business and college.

822
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,183
YONSEO UNIVERSITY
MENTORING PROGRAM

823
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,021
Hello.

824
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,607
I'm Assistant Manager Kwon Song-hee,
the mentor for Team 3.

825
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,566
Nice to meet you.

826
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,571
JOB BOOT CAMP WITH ACT
5-WEEK WORK EXPERIENCE WITH PROFESSIONALS

827
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,749
What's with this font?
Why is it so festive?

828
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,958
I'm sorry.

829
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,754
Sales is all about the details.

830
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,089
Am I right or wrong?

831
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,342
Change it. Quickly. Now!

832
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,511
Not that one. No.

833
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,848
He says the mentoring program
is harder than he expected.

834
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,642
And this. What's with this blue color?

835
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:17,643
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

836
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,646
-Thank you for your hard work.
-And we failed to renew

837
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,230
our contract with ACT.

838
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,732
-This is so unfair.
-Hey.

839
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,484
Don't make a scene. Let's go.

840
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,195
We got fired from the same company twice.

841
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,781
No, I can't anymore.

842
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,200
We told them we quit
and walked out of there.

843
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,536
What do I do now?

844
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,747
You could say
I fired the company this time.

845
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,957
That's right.

846
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,917
-Not again.
-It's coming.

847
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,420
Let's go get some barbecue.

848
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,715
It's okay.

849
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,428
It'll pass.

850
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,557
I was just startled, that's all.

851
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,768
I'm back.

852
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:01,645
REFRESHING CAR WASH

853
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:06,441
I ended up back at my brother's auto shop.

854
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,199
There's one thing that's different.

855
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:17,494
Listen. Let's lower the price
and separate interior and exterior washes.

856
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,705
At over two hours per car,
there's no profit in it.

857
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:22,040
I officially went into business
with Heo Tae-hwan.

858
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:25,127
In the end, managing our regulars
has to be our main focus.

859
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,045
We'll be reservation-only.

860
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,089
And with the customer data we collect,

861
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,299
we can send out texts periodically.

862
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,303
So, what I mean is,

863
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,223
let's go out and make some sales.

864
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:43,311
And I now have time to take a walk
with my wife every night.

865
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,271
Oh my.

866
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,944
Gosh, it stings.

867
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,697
Goodness, hurry up.

868
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,532
Okay. Man.

869
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,703
Gosh.

870
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,748
Can you believe we're the only ones

871
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,000
who were missing out on this?

872
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,084
I know, right?

873
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:10,964
I've worn dress shoes my whole life
and never knew what this felt like.

874
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,930
Let's do it.

875
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,932
Let's take over the office.

876
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,730
Let's pay the 50 million won
for the rental premium.

877
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,649
I have a steady income.

878
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,401
So let's do it.

879
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,114
Don't let that license
you worked so hard for go to waste.

880
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,916
I'll think about it
until we get to that streetlight.

881
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,170
-Honey.
-Yes?

882
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:54,382
I know this is random,
but isn't it amazing sometimes?

883
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,094
That we're living like this?

884
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:58,678
What?

885
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,098
How did you know I was going to say that?

886
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,599
I think about it a lot too.

887
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,853
-Gosh.
-You know, back when we first met…

888
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,188
Yes.

889
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,690
If I hadn't

890
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,111
run to that bus stop…

891
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,614
I wouldn't have been
the top performer that month, would I?

892
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,950
Right. And…

893
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,247
We wouldn't even have Su-gyeom.

894
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,373
Exactly.

895
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,545
What would've happened

896
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,716
if you hadn't pushed us
to buy that apartment?

897
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,678
How would we have handled

898
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,805
-the loan for the commercial unit?
-Jeez.

899
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,267
And what would've happened…

900
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,688
if I hadn't bought that commercial unit?

901
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,774
-If you hadn't…
-Yes.

902
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,653
…then you might've caused a bigger mess.

903
01:00:58,238 --> 01:00:59,865
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

904
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,119
Let's just say

905
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,664
we got off lightly.

906
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,791
It could've been worse.

907
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,711
How do you stay so positive?
You're amazing.

908
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,589
Not everyone can do what you did.

909
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,509
Who else would think to wash cars
in the parking lot of a company

910
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,845
they'd worked at for 25 years?

911
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,389
Anyone could do it.

912
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,016
It's just for the money.

913
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,934
You're trying to play it cool again.

914
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,984
Only Kim Nak-su would make that choice.

915
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,530
Anyone else would've stumbled,
and that would've been the end of them.

916
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,407
Only you, Kim Nak-su,

917
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,993
could have made it this far.

918
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,913
That's how I see it.

919
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:54,294
So let's take it easy from now on, okay?

920
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,464
Let's take small steps

921
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,300
so that even if we fall,
we won't get hurt too badly.

922
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,345
Barefoot. Just like this.

923
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,317
I don't want to take over the office
and pay for the rental premium.

924
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,777
That's no fun.

925
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:23,240
I want to build something
from scratch on my own.

926
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,326
That's more my style.

927
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,454
If you do something
you're not cut out for, it can backfire.

928
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,498
So what's the better move?

929
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,958
Pretty obvious, right?

930
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:36,836
Park Ha-jin.

931
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,506
Why are you

932
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,175
so adorable?

933
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,638
Kim Nak-su.

934
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,683
Why do you make me

935
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,060
feel sorry for you?

936
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,527
You're amazing, Park Ha-jin.

937
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,907
You're great, Kim Nak-su.

938
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,785
You're scary, Park Ha-jin.

939
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,040
You're cute, Kim Nak-su.

940
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,671
-This is nice, right?
-It is.

941
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,006
Let's walk more often.

942
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,551
Okay. Should we take a picture?

943
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,845
-What?
-Let's take one to remember this.

944
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,513
A selfie. Here.

945
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,849
Hold on.

946
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,312
One, two, three.

947
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,733
REFRESHING CAR WASH

948
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,248
Can I have it?

949
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,167
Go ahead.

950
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,379
I'll be back.

951
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,672
Hey, I have the card.

952
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,341
-What? Right.
-The card.

953
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,676
Don't buy the jumbo-sized wax.
Get the small one.

954
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,178
-Okay.
-You always go big.

955
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,846
-Okay.
-Big appetite, big head.

956
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,348
Hey, stop it.

957
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:27,947
Shoot!

958
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,949
Jeez.

959
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,785
Man!

960
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,082
-Get inside!
-It's a rain shower!

961
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,256
Gosh.

962
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,803
Where did this rain suddenly come from?

963
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,015
We just have to wait it out.

964
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,100
Let's take a break.

965
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,562
Oh man.

966
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,174
Nak-su! Get in here.

967
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,302
Tell me right now. Can you do it or not?

968
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,972
What should I do?
Please tell me.

969
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,641
-Come on, what do I do?
-Are you HQ's errand boy?

970
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,436
You might as well be the errand boy.
What else would you do?

971
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,729
Sir. You don't want
the extra 200,000 won?

972
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,440
Let's stop here.

973
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,191
Mr. Kim.
Please take care of this.

974
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,569
Can you take the lead
and try to sort it out?

975
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,113
I don't think we can solve this that way.

976
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,239
You punk.

977
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,366
-What you're doing isn't work.
-Mr. Kim.

978
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,659
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim.

979
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,370
-Nak-su!
-Come to your senses, Kim Nak-su!

980
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:01,833
Dad.

981
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,669
Hey, Mr. Unemployed.
Hey there, unemployed Mr. Kim.

982
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,589
We made 340,000 won, Dad.

983
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,299
I landed my first contract today.

984
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,759
Why would I be ashamed
of you for working?

985
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,012
I'm just worried
you'll get into an accident.

986
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,014
You don't have to push yourself.

987
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,348
I'm sorry.

988
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,267
What are you sorry for?

989
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,935
Thank you, Dad.

990
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,438
You've been through so much.

991
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,064
General Manager Kim.

992
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:28,485
Nak-su.

993
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:31,696
Be happy.

994
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,662
Lunchtime!

995
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,709
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM
