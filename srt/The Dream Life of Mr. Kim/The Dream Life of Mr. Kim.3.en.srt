00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,137
-Honey!
-Hi.

3
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,847
Sorry to keep you waiting.

4
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,900
Excuse me.

5
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,487
Mr. Kim Nak-su?

6
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,851
Should I get a refill?

7
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,770
-No, thanks.
-Okay.

8
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,148
Shall we start talking?

9
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,650
Sure, let's talk.

10
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,072
Which company do you--

11
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,116
You know I work for a credit card company.

12
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,161
Right. A credit card company.

13
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,121
Then what school did you--

14
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,998
Just a junior college.

15
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,207
-Next.
-Next.

16
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,960
Then…

17
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,048
-Par--
-My parents?

18
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,924
No.

19
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,843
Don't you want to know anything about me?

20
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,386
Of course I do.

21
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,347
I really do, but…

22
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,892
I…

23
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,480
I need to use the restroom for a second.

24
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,774
Excuse me.

25
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,910
Damn you, Loafer.
I didn't know that, did I?

26
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,623
I thought I'd be able to talk smoothly,
like I did at job interviews.

27
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,875
Stop with the nagging.
Do you have any tips?

28
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,378
Zodiac sign?

29
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,755
I don't know anything about that stuff.

30
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,516
I HOPE YOU MEET SOMEONE NICE

31
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,907
BUS STOP

32
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,955
First of all, I apologize.

33
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,081
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,042
It's Sunday today.

35
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,836
The one day we get to rest.

36
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,379
Cut to the chase.

37
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,797
Right.

38
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,843
What good does it do to you
to just leave after an hour?

39
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,554
Considering all the time
and energy you spent preparing for this,

40
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,973
it would be a huge loss for you.

41
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,932
A loss?

42
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,017
Yes.

43
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:32,147
If I were you, I'd at least treat it
as practice for the next blind date

44
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,607
and sit through it.

45
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,358
Since you came out on the weekend,

46
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,819
you should at least
get something out of it.

47
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,948
We weren't done with the fries,
but you cleared the table.

48
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,450
I finished them.

49
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,744
How greedy of you.

50
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,162
DEBIT CARD RECEIPT

51
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,873
Even college students
have credit cards these days.

52
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,832
How come you don't?

53
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,709
I…

54
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,545
I really am getting a free bike, right?

55
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,215
Jeez, what would I gain from scamming you?

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,591
Can I really use

57
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,177
the landline and the internet
at the same time with this?

58
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,136
Of course.

59
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,971
-Do you play Fortress?
-Yes.

60
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,390
You don't have to
go to internet cafes now.

61
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,851
Once you install this,
Fortress runs great at home.

62
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,186
-Really?
-Yes.

63
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,688
I'm done.

64
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,982
-Me too. Thank you.
-Okay.

65
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,985
This month's sales competition is no joke.

66
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,071
I was sweating bullets.

67
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,409
See? Good thing you didn't go home, right?

68
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,287
Well, I did get something out of this.

69
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,124
Why didn't you talk like this before?

70
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,420
It's been a month
since I joined the company,

71
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,217
and this is actually my first time
meeting people outside of work.

72
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,053
My gosh. You must work overtime every day.

73
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,471
Yes.

74
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,723
-Here's your pen.
-Okay.

75
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,154
Do you enjoy your work?

76
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,075
Not really.

77
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,661
Then why not have some fun
instead of overworking yourself?

78
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,496
Otherwise, what's the point of living?

79
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,706
What do you mean?

80
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,626
I need to get promoted, buy a house,
and get married. I should work hard.

81
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,253
When you get married,

82
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,673
are you going to take it easy at work?

83
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,432
You are so beautiful.

84
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,227
Come on now.

85
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,272
Are you trying to get me
to buy something else?

86
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,122
What's so great, Dad?

87
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,374
You survived as a general manager
at a big company,

88
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,210
bought an apartment in Seoul,
and sent me to college. So what?

89
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,270
Where are you going?

90
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,152
I'm going to sleep somewhere else tonight.

91
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,570
Why?

92
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,704
Because I think it's only fair.

93
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,833
I know Dad isn't coming home
because of me.

94
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,213
I'll call him tomorrow and apologize.

95
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,383
I can at least do that much for him.

96
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,844
I won't mean it, though.

97
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,014
Good night.

98
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,350
Su-gyeom.

99
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,231
On your way out,

100
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,650
please throw away the boxes
by the front door.

101
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,366
Is there anything else?

102
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,662
And…

103
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,126
go buy me one more of these, please.

104
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,673
Come on.

105
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,475
Do you know

106
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,644
how I feel

107
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,397
after giving your dad an earful?

108
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,484
It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

109
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,405
Your dad is absolutely
in the wrong from start to finish.

110
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,656
And yet,

111
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,325
after 10 or 20 minutes,

112
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,787
I'm the one who feels worse.

113
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:04,210
He always manages to make me apologize,
even when I don't mean it.

114
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,048
"Okay, honey. I'm sorry."

115
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,800
"I think I was wrong."

116
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,732
I'm sorry, son.

117
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,567
I've really

118
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,695
spoiled your dad.

119
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,450
You sure have.

120
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,535
Why did you do that?

121
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,207
I don't know.

122
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,252
I guess

123
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:51,716
I wanted our home to be the one place
where your father wouldn't feel small.

124
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,972
Also, think about
your dad's face, you know?

125
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,892
When his eyebrows droop like that
and he's all sulky,

126
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,729
he looks so pitiful.

127
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,025
So,

128
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,153
are you giving up on
the real estate license exam too?

129
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,708
I should just mop the floor myself.

130
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,504
What luxury was I hoping for, really?

131
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,091
Goodness, why's this thing
acting up again?

132
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,427
Don't be like me.

133
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,139
You do what you want.

134
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,058
It's okay for children to do that.

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,687
You're allowed to do that, Su-gyeom.

136
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:56,531
EPISODE 3
MVP

137
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,657
I've been using

138
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,992
ACT's fastest

139
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,036
and most expensive Super Giga
Internet Plan for the past two years.

140
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,996
But its actual speed

141
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,416
wasn't even a hundredth
of the speed I'm supposed to get.

142
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,419
I'm sure many other users have experienced

143
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,296
the same issue, not just me.

144
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,133
Until ACT gives a reasonable response,

145
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,135
I'll make sure to get
to the bottom of this.

146
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,219
HEAD OF SALES
HWANG TAE-SAN

147
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,346
This has been your IT-BOY.

148
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,764
IT-BOY WILL GO ALL THE WAY

149
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,183
Turn on the lights.

150
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,947
Is he well-known?

151
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,575
EMERGENCY MEETING ABOUT
YOUTUBER'S EXPOSÉ ON ACT'S INTERNET SPEEDS

152
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,577
-He has over two million subscribers.
-My gosh.

153
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,704
How many articles have been published?

154
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,539
Two online outlets have covered it so far,

155
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,542
but it hasn't hit the main pages
on the web portals yet.

156
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,670
Isn't this an issue
for the Infrastructure Team and not us?

157
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,672
That's true for the YouTuber case,

158
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,342
but our sales division also needs
a full investigation.

159
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,510
If there were any instances
of us proposing contracts

160
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,346
knowing there was no Giga coverage,

161
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,973
we could be sued
for illegal business practices.

162
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,979
The quote was based on Super Giga,
but this area isn't covered yet.

163
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,147
SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST 2025

164
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,524
Get it installed.
It's just a few months at most.

165
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,696
It just made it to the main page.

166
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,409
ACT SLAMMED FOR "FASTEST SPEED" CLAIM

167
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,044
Okay, everyone.

168
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,798
This was supposed to be my day off,
but I came in because of this.

169
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,132
But seeing the state of things,

170
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,761
it doesn't seem like something
that requires my presence.

171
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,890
So, I'd like for you to follow
Mr. Baek's orders

172
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,559
and respond to this issue proactively.

173
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,938
-But, Mr. Hwang--
-Please take a seat.

174
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,774
All right, then. Have a good day.

175
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,368
Who's taking the meeting notes right now?

176
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,204
I am, sir.

177
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,791
I don't think there's any need
to include my name in the attendees list,

178
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,834
don't you think?

179
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,211
I was only here for ten minutes.

180
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,006
Understood, sir.

181
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,216
Have a good day.

182
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,935
Let's take ten.

183
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,162
Mr. Kim.

184
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,205
What is it? Let's talk later.

185
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,041
-I need to go.
-Just one minute, sir.

186
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,375
What is it?

187
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,505
To be honest,
I recorded our conversation that day.

188
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:00,923
What?

189
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,384
I recorded it when I told you
about the Yangpyeong case.

190
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,888
It is a bit ambiguous,
so I'd like for you to take a look.

191
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,226
You scary bastard.
Why would you record that?

192
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,395
I always do it when I report something.
Just in case.

193
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,273
-I have to watch my back.
-Wow, you're unbelievable.

194
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,818
But that's not what's important.

195
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,072
Before the meeting,
I listened to the recording again,

196
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,575
and Mr. Baek was there
with us at the time, right?

197
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,202
Listen to this.

198
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,244
ACT HEADQUARTERS 10

199
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,705
Yes, but we have to start
the service next week.

200
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,707
What? Is there a problem?

201
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,627
No, sir.

202
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,089
What's there to worry about?

203
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,009
What are you saying?

204
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,264
So, if Mr. Baek decides
to make an issue of this,

205
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,893
shouldn't he also bear
part of the responsibility?

206
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,526
Yes, Mr. Baek. I'll be right there.

207
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,905
Delete that, you punk.

208
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,035
You little…

209
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,662
-Delete it.
-Okay.

210
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,746
-Jeez.
-Okay.

211
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,753
Why would I?

212
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:24,966
Jeong-tae.

213
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,552
Come on. Lighten up.

214
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,388
You know Hwang Tae-san's
survived three years

215
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,848
just by knowing when to back out.

216
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,434
Gosh, that little weasel.

217
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,980
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

218
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,189
The nails that stick out

219
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,067
get hammered down
during performance review season.

220
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:46,195
So it's a bit risky for me
to make any big moves right now.

221
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,616
If Hwang Tae-san tells me to crawl,
I have to crawl.

222
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,661
Every time I see him,
he asks me why I played golf

223
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,414
with the directors last time.
It's driving me crazy.

224
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,838
Nak-su.

225
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,925
You don't have anything

226
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,761
they can hold against you, do you?

227
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,100
No, I'm good.

228
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,101
Then…

229
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,272
can you take the lead
and try to sort it out?

230
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,192
Me?

231
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,612
This could actually be
an opportunity for you.

232
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,697
Don't you think so?

233
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,033
Managing Director Kim Nak-su.

234
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,206
You can't do it?

235
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,168
I can. It's a good opportunity.

236
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,127
Understood.

237
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,297
Let's make it work.

238
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,115
Yes.

239
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,075
Goodbye, sir.

240
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,118
Hello.

241
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,078
Hi.

242
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,209
How's that going?

243
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,710
What?

244
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,838
How's what going?

245
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,384
The bomb that dropped today.

246
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,429
I heard some YouTuber totally lost it
over the slow internet speed.

247
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,557
Oh, that one?

248
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,684
It's nothing serious.

249
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,728
It seems pretty serious.
I even saw an article on it online.

250
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,607
No, it's not a big deal.

251
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,651
Our very own…

252
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,611
Nak-su…

253
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,030
will handle it without a problem.

254
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:53,990
I will.

255
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,409
I see.

256
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,453
After all, you do have
25 years of experience.

257
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,082
Show us what you got.

258
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,128
Show us what you got.
Show us what you got.

259
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,215
I will show you.

260
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,217
I didn't mean to tease you.

261
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,389
Mr. Baek.

262
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,565
Don't you think they're going to try
to pin the blame on the subcontractors?

263
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,900
-Jeez.
-You think so?

264
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,486
That will just make people more upset.

265
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,281
And yet, that's the kind of choice

266
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,326
our company always makes.

267
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,178
I should sit there.

268
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,269
As per Mr. Baek's direction,

269
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,272
I'll be taking charge of this case.

270
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,025
So, let's hear
what everyone thinks, shall we?

271
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,527
-Go on.
-As I mentioned earlier,

272
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:17,114
the issue is recommending Giga Internet

273
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,283
in areas where it's not available.

274
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,619
But my team has not made
such recommendations,

275
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,372
and we haven't had
any customer complaints about it either.

276
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,709
But if Team 1 has in fact done that,

277
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,337
then we'll step in
and help out as much as we can

278
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,505
to get it sorted--

279
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,882
Sorry to cut you off, Jin-woo.

280
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,386
I appreciate your concern for my team.

281
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,263
But we're still figuring out
the exact situation,

282
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:45,309
so let's save the hypotheticals for now
rather than rushing in, shall we?

283
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

284
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
Anyone else?

285
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,607
Anyone from my team?

286
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,652
For now,

287
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,115
maybe we should pass this
over to the Infrastructure Team.

288
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,119
The most important thing right now
is a fast response,

289
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,704
-and also--
-I don't think

290
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,665
we can solve this that way.

291
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,732
Let's not make things difficult.

292
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,526
Let's focus on the core issue here.

293
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,822
A famous YouTuber said he was paying
top money for the best internet plan

294
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,868
from Korea's best telecom company,

295
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,454
only to go, "The service was terrible

296
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,706
and not worth what I paid."
So he called us out.

297
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,624
-Yes.
-I've said it again and again.

298
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,086
A direct approach is necessary
in situations like this.

299
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,589
Be open and honest.

300
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,007
You're right, Mr. Kim.

301
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,300
The simplest way is

302
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,761
to just admit what happened
and deal with it by the book.

303
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,803
Song-hee.

304
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:04,930
Yes, Mr. Kim.

305
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,266
Get in touch with the YouTuber
and tell him

306
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,769
to take down all the videos.

307
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,982
Go on.

308
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,610
All the videos. Okay.

309
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,696
All…

310
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,114
A refund?

311
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,741
Yes.

312
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,326
GET A REAL ESTATE LICENSE IN A YEAR

313
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,452
INTENSIVE COURSE INFO SHEET

314
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,536
Okay.

315
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,999
May I ask

316
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,418
why you want to get a refund?

317
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,505
I gave it some thought, and--

318
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,507
Don't lose your confidence.

319
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,551
It's the kind of exam
even grandmas can pass.

320
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,929
It's not that I'm not confident--

321
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,140
The one or two million won tuition fee
is not what's important.

322
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,102
You're shaping your next 50 years,
the second phase of your life.

323
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,396
Let me explain.

324
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,815
It's not about money.

325
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,818
-Look at them. Tell her.
-They started with no prior knowledge.

326
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,694
And they passed in just six months.

327
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:01,946
FASTEST EXAM PASSERS

328
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,074
If you pass both exams in one go,
we offer a scholarship.

329
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,743
Look over there. "The 2024 Hall of Fame."

330
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,829
How wonderful is that?

331
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,998
No wonder so many students
enroll at this academy.

332
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,708
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

333
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,795
Let me speak.

334
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,602
What?

335
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,604
You're out. Where are you?

336
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,815
Jongno. On my way back home.

337
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,025
You're nearby.
Do you want to come join us?

338
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,236
-Have you eaten?
-What are you up to?

339
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,406
We're having lunch at Namdaemun Park View.

340
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,617
We can add one more person for free
with our membership.

341
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,245
Don't bother.
Enjoy your date with your husband.

342
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,329
Come quickly.

343
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,291
If not now,
when will you ever eat at a hotel?

344
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,003
I had dinner with your brother-in-law
at the Hyatt two years ago!

345
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,547
Okay. Good for you.

346
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,590
Come quickly.

347
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,758
Sang-cheol has something to tell you.

348
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,761
Why would your husband
have anything to say to me?

349
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:08,971
Lure her with the king crabs.

350
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,180
-King crabs?
-Yes.

351
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,892
The king crabs here are holy crabs.

352
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,061
These king crabs are in-crab-ible!

353
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,272
-Come over!
-See you in a bit.

354
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,443
I'll ask for support, and…

355
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,737
That little punk is trying to play me?

356
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,492
You're lucky you have
a team leader like me.

357
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,870
If you take Do Jin-woo's bait
on a day like this,

358
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,915
you'll end up dancing
to Team 2's tune forever.

359
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,125
So, you really think

360
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,170
a YouTuber with two million subscribers

361
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,631
will just take the video down
because we asked?

362
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,341
You think I was born yesterday?

363
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,259
Then?

364
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,346
We're going with a counterattack strategy.

365
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,431
Now's the time to go hard.

366
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,434
Then he'll be like, "What's going on?"

367
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,563
Then we can negotiate
from a more advantageous position.

368
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,274
They don't make nuclear weapons
to actually use them.

369
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:07,154
We really need to think carefully here.

370
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,323
This might take away
any room left for negotiation.

371
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:10,824
What do you mean?

372
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,284
Instead of "What's going on?"

373
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,955
he might go, "They want me to take
the videos down without even apologizing?"

374
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,040
"Are they insane?"

375
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,168
It might provoke him even more.

376
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,379
Those guys make a living
off ads and sponsorships.

377
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,756
Would he go that far against
a major corporation like ours?

378
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,341
That's the point.

379
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,634
"What the heck?"

380
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,553
"A major corporation is abusing its power
against an influencer."

381
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,389
He could very much react like that.

382
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,770
Song-hee,
you've been quiet this whole time.

383
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,980
This concerns you too.

384
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:41,981
Sorry?

385
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm asking what you think.

386
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,443
What I think--

387
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,862
What do you suggest we do?

388
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,949
If it were up to me,

389
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,078
I wouldn't have handled it like this.
Not in a million years.

390
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,002
Let's put the idea on hold for now. Then…

391
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,088
But I've already sent the email.

392
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,388
-Unsend it.
-Unsend?

393
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,279
SENT MAIL

394
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,031
"IT-BOY" VIDEO DELETION REQUEST
SALES TEAM 1

395
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,366
READ RECEIPT

396
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,660
STATUS: READ

397
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,292
Why did you choose now,
of all times, to be efficient?

398
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,627
You guys too.

399
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,380
You should've stopped me at the meeting
if it was such a bad idea.

400
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,506
I'm sorry.

401
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,009
Seriously. You should've
tried harder to stop me.

402
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,304
It's so hard to work with you guys.

403
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,348
My gosh.

404
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,853
Sung-gu.

405
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,611
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

406
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,947
How did your call
with Yangpyeong go this morning?

407
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,408
I begged and pleaded,

408
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,036
so I think we can get away with it.

409
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,120
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

410
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,288
Remember, we have…

411
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,710
What do you expect me to do with it?

412
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,170
Go away.

413
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,506
Jeez.

414
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,219
Today's ACT incident
reminded me once again

415
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,514
of just how pathetic the mindset
of major Korean corporations really is.

416
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,807
It's not surprising at all.

417
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,225
So starting now, we--

418
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,280
You guys even have a CEO's office.

419
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,868
With our new Chief Destruction Officer
over there, Kim Su-gyeom,

420
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,204
we'll thoroughly break
all conventional rules.

421
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,914
Let's start with that.

422
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,999
Give him a round of applause.

423
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,377
-Welcome.
-Su-geon.

424
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,587
-It's Su-gyeom.
-I haven't made up my mind yet.

425
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,677
I still can't quite tell
what kind of company this is,

426
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,556
so let me watch you work a bit
before I make a decision.

427
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,147
Go on.

428
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,319
Okay. If that's the case…

429
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,863
What? Let go of me.

430
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,739
Are you sure?

431
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,703
Ta-da!

432
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,247
I'm a pro.

433
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:52,129
I'll get some more of those king crabs
that my sister loves so much.

434
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,463
Get the legs, will you?

435
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,591
Plenty of legs. Got it.

436
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,925
A lot of them, honey.

437
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,144
So you see,

438
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,813
I'm planning to quit my job

439
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,107
and fly solo.

440
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,150
Fly solo?

441
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,361
Not exactly solo.
There'll be about three of us as co-CEOs,

442
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,031
and we're planning
to try and get into fintech.

443
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,783
She doesn't know all that jargon.
Dumb it down for her.

444
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,243
-Dumb it down?
-Yes.

445
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,245
Anyway, go on.

446
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,333
As you know, I've been
a software developer all my life,

447
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,709
so I'm terrible at sales.

448
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,586
He's a nerd.

449
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,087
I see.

450
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,256
If Nak-su, with 25 years…

451
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,341
-Is it 25 years?
-Yes!

452
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,508
If Nak-su joins us,

453
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,928
with his experience
at a major telecom company,

454
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,182
it would be like putting wings on a tiger.

455
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,520
I actually have a few connections
over at ACT,

456
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,274
and I asked around to see
what kind of offer it would take

457
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,652
to bring in someone
with Nak-su's level of experience.

458
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,614
I'm used to developer salaries,
so when I looked, I was honestly like,

459
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,657
"Huh?"

460
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,910
It was lower than I expected.

461
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,540
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14,086
That came out wrong.
That's not what I meant.

463
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,712
Anyway, I believe I can make him

464
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,006
a better offer than what he currently has.

465
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,342
Right.

466
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,177
He's basically saying

467
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,223
he can give Nak-su a bigger salary.

468
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,933
I understand that perfectly.

469
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,186
Can you casually ask him

470
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,398
if he has a plan B
in case there's any issue

471
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,775
with his executive promotion this year?

472
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,735
ACT has a bit of a reputation

473
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,613
for not being flexible in how it operates.

474
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,158
Honestly, I think his talent
is kind of wasted at ACT.

475
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,785
Just look at what happened today.

476
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,788
You saw how ACT handles issues that arise.

477
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,123
Goodness gracious.

478
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,166
You saw it too, didn't you?

479
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,419
In what world
is that a reasonable response?

480
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
That was pathetic.

481
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,173
How can they handle it like that
in this day and age?

482
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,343
Didn't you say you were friends
with that YouTuber?

483
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,847
We're not super close.
He's an acquaintance.

484
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,223
-An acquaintance?
-Yes.

485
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,349
What's going on?

486
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,852
Did something happen
at my husband's company?

487
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,978
You don't know?

488
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,647
I actually got an email
from ACT's Sales Team 1,

489
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,232
asking me to take the video down.

490
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,859
Why should I take down my video?

491
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,694
Why should I? Why?

492
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,820
Gloves are off.

493
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,989
I'll put everything I've got
as IT-BOY on the line

494
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,866
and see this through to the end.

495
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,452
And I just got a report

496
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,205
about a public facility
in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province.

497
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,000
Whether intentionally or not,
ACT went ahead

498
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,086
and forced the completion of construction,

499
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,381
even though Super Giga Internet service
isn't available in the area.

500
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,342
That's corporate abuse.

501
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,346
If you've been affected by this,
let me know.

502
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,139
I'll step up and handle it.

503
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,266
This has been IT-BOY.

504
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,061
Support me by liking,
subscribing, and enabling notifications.

505
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,520
LEGAL TEAM LEADER
HAM HYEON-GYEONG

506
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,230
Are there any other links up yet?

507
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,691
You can assume most of them
have already been posted.

508
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:12,454
2ND EMERGENCY MEETING ABOUT
YOUTUBER'S EXPOSÉ ON ACT'S INTERNET SPEEDS

509
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,622
How many views so far?

510
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,249
The first video has surpassed
two million views,

511
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,085
and the second one,
uploaded just recently,

512
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,045
has surpassed five hundred thousand.

513
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,671
It's all over social media,

514
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,965
and even the office worker forums
are buzzing.

515
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,133
ACT VIDEO TAKEDOWN REQUEST

516
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,969
It seems like our request
to have the video taken down

517
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,554
is becoming quite an issue.

518
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,769
Kim Nak-su.

519
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,855
-Yes, sir.
-Did you really think

520
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,900
he'd just say, "Yes, sir,"
and take it down?

521
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,737
Don't you have any empathy?

522
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,866
I didn't exactly order my team
to make him take it down.

523
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,536
I just floated the idea
that we could try--

524
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,998
What's done is done.

525
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,793
Let's post a corrective order notice
on our website now

526
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,503
and a separate apology statement.

527
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,380
Even if we end up paying a fine,

528
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,841
we need to respond quickly from now on

529
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,592
to minimize the damage to our image.

530
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,718
I agree.

531
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,346
We'll take care of that
on our side right away.

532
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,516
-Okay.
-I need to check something.

533
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,895
Where's the public facility in Yangpyeong
that was mentioned in the recent video?

534
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,689
Who's in charge of that?

535
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,862
You need to be honest about
whether this was intentional or a mistake.

536
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,947
We need to know in order to respond.

537
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,490
If we get an administrative sanction,

538
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,827
worst case, we could have
our business suspended

539
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,579
or even be barred from public bidding.

540
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,748
We'll easily lose tens of billions.

541
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,335
One person's idea
turned into an official company order.

542
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,463
We must investigate
and compensate properly.

543
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,132
Okay. I'll get to the bottom of this.

544
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,723
Do I need to tell you right now?

545
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,767
No.

546
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,146
You can tell us
when you're ready, Mr. Baek.

547
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:07,819
We'll discuss it
within the sales division first.

548
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,463
-Team 2.
-We were not in charge of this.

549
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,507
You're excused.

550
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,679
-Good work in there, Mr. Do.
-Thanks.

551
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,598
Myung-heon and So-yeon, keep an eye on it.

552
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,849
Yes, sir.

553
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,184
Was it you guys?

554
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,145
Of course it was you guys.

555
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,188
Where is it?

556
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,652
Shall I tell him?

557
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,157
It's Yangpyeong Dream Cultural Center.

558
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,118
The Giga Internet
will be installed in August,

559
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,162
but we signed the contract
without any prior noti--

560
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,914
My gosh.

561
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,209
Kim Nak-su.

562
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,420
What on earth were you thinking?

563
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,634
I'm asking what you were thinking
when you did that!

564
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,015
I apologize.

565
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,393
Leave me with Nak-su.

566
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,652
What the hell were you thinking?

567
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,613
What goes on in that head of yours?
You really--

568
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,662
Let's do what we can.

569
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,045
Nak-su.

570
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:50,839
Yes.

571
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,551
We've been stuck in this company
for over 20 years.

572
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,137
At this point, it's safe to say

573
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,849
no one here actually likes us.

574
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,645
The higher-ups hate us for not quitting.

575
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:09,107
Our subordinates hate us
and wonder why we haven't been fired.

576
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,693
You need to know

577
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,030
what you can actually do
from where you stand.

578
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,617
If you can't handle it yourself,
the company won't handle it for you.

579
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,535
They won't wait for you!

580
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,789
Do you feel wronged?

581
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,541
No.

582
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,169
If you can't handle it,
just tell me already.

583
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,462
What's it going to be?

584
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,674
Just say it. If you can't handle it,

585
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:38,303
I'll tell Do Jin-woo to do it,
whether it's the YouTuber or Yangpyeong.

586
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,556
I'll take care of it, sir.

587
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:46,978
Nak-su.

588
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,022
Yes.

589
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,446
You really are running out of time.

590
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,365
You have to change.

591
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,576
You have to take responsibility

592
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,663
for all the choices you made.

593
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,095
Okay.

594
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,477
Yes.

595
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,813
I'll connect you
to the Technical Support Team right away.

596
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,314
SCAMMED BY ACT FOR TWO YEARS

597
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,732
Wow. Over three million views.

598
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,942
3.01 MILLION VIEWS

599
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,946
Are you actually laughing now?

600
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,449
A person with real class laughs
through the hard times.

601
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,704
The Yangpyeong case…

602
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,832
If what the Legal Team said is true,
this is a major incident.

603
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,000
I won't get dragged into it, will I?

604
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,337
Here he comes.

605
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,264
For you, sir.

606
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,398
-Ik-hyeon.
-Yes, sir.

607
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,858
Let's step outside for a moment.

608
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,902
Shall I join you?

609
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,009
Mr. Kim,

610
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,720
let's work with Team 2 for now.

611
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,642
We don't have time to deal with both
the YouTuber and Yangpyeong right now.

612
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,478
Let Team 2 handle the YouTuber,

613
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,897
and we'll head to Yangpyeong right now

614
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,857
and beg for forgiveness.

615
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,319
We'll tell them

616
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,571
we'll waive next year's fees.

617
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,909
I'll talk to the Customer Support Team.
They'll make it happen.

618
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:13,124
If you feel uncomfortable asking
Do Jin-woo about the YouTuber, I'll do it.

619
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,253
It's not that I feel uncomfortable
about it.

620
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,590
Can't we handle the YouTuber case

621
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,134
and let Do handle the Yangpyeong case?

622
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:24,844
Why?

623
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,679
What do you mean, why?

624
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,681
The Yangpyeong case
is clearly our responsibility.

625
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,017
Why would we make Team 2 clean it up?

626
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,144
Do Jin-woo's close with the Tech Team.

627
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,604
I even saw him earlier

628
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,397
-talking with Jun-seop--
-We can't do that.

629
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,399
Right?

630
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,235
-I guess we can't.
-No, sir.

631
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,280
You really think so?

632
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,200
Do Jin-woo might actually prefer that.

633
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,159
Even if…

634
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,245
even if that were the case,

635
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,956
we need to clean up our own mess.

636
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,834
-Right?
-It's the right thing to do.

637
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,502
Yes, I know.

638
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,380
But…

639
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,592
All eyes in the company
are on us right now.

640
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,304
The Yangpyeong incident
is just a minor mix-up with the client.

641
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,223
Right now,
whoever fixes this YouTuber mess

642
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,183
becomes the MVP.

643
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,394
Ik-hyeon, you don't understand.

644
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,565
I can't afford to take it slow
and go step by step right now.

645
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,609
I need to show off tangible results.
That's the position I'm in.

646
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,195
You don't know the half of it.

647
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,031
What?

648
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,867
What is it?

649
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,287
Come on. You know this is how I am.

650
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,414
You've known me for over a decade.
You know me.

651
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,874
-You--
-Mr. Kim.

652
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,462
Fine. Don't look at me like that.

653
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,423
Okay. Let's go.

654
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,508
You think

655
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,094
we shouldn't handle
the YouTuber case, right?

656
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,220
We shouldn't.

657
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,598
-Are you sure?
-Definitely.

658
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,434
-Wouldn't Jin-woo prefer that?
-We can't, sir.

659
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,679
The weather's really nice.

660
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,812
Have you sorted out your thoughts?

661
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,361
I'm sorry. I'm getting more confused.

662
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,738
Still?

663
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,742
I don't want to live like my dad.

664
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,577
That's for sure.

665
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,000
Do you honestly think
I'm a good fit for this company?

666
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,128
You're not.

667
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,340
Then why did you recommend me?

668
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,343
Do you remember back in middle school?

669
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,471
Middle school?

670
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,307
Back in eighth grade,

671
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,893
they took my earrings
during a random bag search.

672
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,105
You were the class president.

673
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,733
After it was over,
you went to the teacher's office and said,

674
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:10,737
"Han-na wasn't wearing them.
She just had them in her bag."

675
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,990
"Confiscating them seems a bit harsh."

676
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,284
And you got them back for me.

677
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,243
I did?

678
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,874
Do you remember what you said to me
as you were handing me back my earrings?

679
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,711
You told me not to bring
stuff like that to school,

680
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,590
saying it would be my loss
if I got a bad school record.

681
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,842
That's the Kim Su-gyeom I remember.

682
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,054
A kid with a peculiar rebellious streak

683
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,848
and a stubborn, by-the-book nature.

684
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,272
I knew it. I don't belong here.

685
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,567
I recommended you because you don't.

686
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:54,280
Your by-the-book nature
could help keep us grounded.

687
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,494
Thanks to you, I ended up
with a clean school record back then.

688
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,881
We'll go to Yangpyeong
and handle it ourselves.

689
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,760
As for the YouTuber case, I think
it's better to explain face-to-face.

690
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,804
I already asked the Tech Team for support.

691
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,515
I've prepared all the tech materials,

692
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,725
and we'll tidy it up
with the PR Team later.

693
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,353
-Mr. Kim, I have the car ready.
-Sure. Let's do that.

694
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,647
If you're ready,
we can head to Yangpyeong now.

695
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,815
Okay.

696
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,902
Song-hee.

697
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,446
What are you doing?
You're coming with us, right?

698
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,657
Me?

699
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,246
-Of course, I should.
-Okay.

700
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,833
It's better if several of us
apologize together.

701
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,709
Okay.

702
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,089
Once we're done, I know a restaurant
that does great griddle jjajang.

703
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,632
It'll be my treat.

704
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,051
That sounds delicious.

705
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,473
We'll be heading out first, Mr. Kim.

706
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,225
Okay.

707
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,145
I'll bring Jun-seop
and a member of the Tech Team with me.

708
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,729
We'll keep you posted.

709
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,774
Are you going to the YouTuber's house?

710
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,402
No, we're meeting
his agency's CEO first for now.

711
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,613
The YouTuber seems reluctant
to meet us himself.

712
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,449
Okay. Good luck.

713
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,493
I'll make sure to take care of it.

714
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,622
Thank you.

715
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,001
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

716
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,045
There's heavy traffic, so it'll take
about an hour and 40 minutes.

717
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,256
-We should hurry.
-Okay. Jeez.

718
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,133
Let's go, Song-hee.

719
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,593
Okay.

720
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,220
Hello.

721
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,388
Hello, it's me.

722
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,932
Who…

723
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,559
It's me, Sang-cheol.

724
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,561
Don't you have my number saved?

725
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,812
Sang-cheol…

726
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,689
Oh, hi! What's going on?

727
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,692
What?

728
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,281
Hang on.

729
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,200
Give me a second.

730
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:05,244
-What? Yes.
-The YouTuber, the IT-BOY.

731
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,662
He's an acquaintance of mine.

732
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:07,788
Really?

733
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,583
Yes, we've had drinks
together a few times.

734
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,295
If it's all right with you, I'll organize
a meeting and arrange a time.

735
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,505
Really? Can we do that today?

736
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,217
Of course! He's my friend's best friend.

737
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,344
Is that so?

738
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,303
Yes.

739
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,556
Honestly, this shouldn't have
escalated this far.

740
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,392
I got frustrated just seeing
how things were unfolding.

741
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,645
Tell me about it.

742
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:34,190
That's why I contacted you.

743
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,276
I thought maybe I could be
of some help to you.

744
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,949
By the way, who was it?

745
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,784
What kind of idiot

746
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,161
tells a YouTuber to take their video down?

747
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,081
Just some idiot. A totally crazy idiot.

748
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,208
Okay. Give me a minute.

749
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,502
I'll get back to you right away.

750
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,259
Thank you.

751
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,678
Have some of this. Have some coffee.

752
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,432
-Where did Jin-woo go?
-Sorry?

753
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,725
Jin-woo.

754
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,185
Which way did he go?

755
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,687
-This way or that way?
-Over there.

756
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,021
-There.
-This way?

757
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,148
Where are you going, Mr. Kim?

758
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,360
What's his deal now?

759
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,600
Jin-woo!

760
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,353
Wait!

761
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,816
What's going on, Mr. Kim?

762
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,526
I don't think

763
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,237
we need to contact the agency.

764
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,239
What do you mean?

765
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,826
I've got a direct line to the YouTuber.

766
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,204
I think I can meet him
one-on-one and sort this out.

767
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,998
Great. If you give me his contact,

768
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,000
-I'll reach out and handle--
-No.

769
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,502
You don't need to trouble
yourself with that.

770
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,755
My team will handle this matter. Okay?

771
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,839
But we should--

772
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,467
No, I feel bad as it is.
I know how busy you are.

773
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,761
You really don't need
to concern yourself with this.

774
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,762
We'll handle it.

775
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,140
Since he's a tech YouTuber,

776
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,184
the Tech Team should join
to explain the details.

777
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,771
You can sum it up in a document
and give it to us.

778
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,980
That will do.

779
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:41,525
What's that? Is that the document?
Give it to me.

780
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,861
Let me have that.

781
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,864
I can read it
and explain it to him, right?

782
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,575
Your resources are too valuable
to waste on this.

783
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,702
Go rest up. What's that? A gift?

784
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,621
Give me that.

785
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,625
Head back in. We'll handle this.

786
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,543
See you.

787
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,630
Sorry?

788
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,673
Mr. Kim? Hello?

789
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,425
Was that Mr. Kim?

790
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,052
-Yes.
-What did he say?

791
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,265
He said to go on head
to Yangpyeong by ourselves.

792
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,186
-What the…
-I'll be monitoring it

793
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,604
-in real time.
-Ik-hyeon.

794
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,272
You got the news, right?

795
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,024
What is going on?

796
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,235
Mr. Kim said he'll meet the YouTuber
and resolve this.

797
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,694
It's better this way.

798
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,446
I'm sorry.

799
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,115
Please. You didn't do anything wrong.

800
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,784
Keep up the good work.

801
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,743
Good luck.

802
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,787
Thank you.

803
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,671
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. I got it.

804
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,302
Yes, I talked to him.

805
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,805
I'll text you the address.
We'll meet you there.

806
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,515
Don't worry about it.

807
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,308
Take your time.

808
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,894
Thank you so much.

809
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,354
Please. No need to worry now.

810
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,189
You came through big-time.

811
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,191
I'll see you at home, Ha-yeong.

812
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,776
-See you.
-Okay.

813
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,819
Bye, Ha-jin.

814
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,028
-Bye.
-I'll get going then.

815
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,488
-Thank you.
-See you.

816
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:10,614
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

817
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,995
You really have
the best sister in the world.

818
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,874
It would be great if your husband
could start working with Sang-cheol.

819
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,294
In times like these,
family should stick together.

820
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,172
That wasn't free lunch today.
I've given you a mission.

821
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,593
I was so distracted earlier
that I didn't quite catch it.

822
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,553
So what is it that Sang-cheol does?

823
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,933
See? Even if we tell you,
you don't get it.

824
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,519
It's fintech.

825
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:43,230
Then elaborate on what it is for me

826
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,149
and stop treating me like a fool.

827
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,530
It's like…

828
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,949
It's fintech.

829
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,912
So what the heck is that? Jeez!

830
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,622
He's so…

831
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,124
He's super annoying.

832
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,792
Shall we play some music?

833
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:04,752
Good idea.

834
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,631
How can a person be this annoying?

835
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,050
You think he's like this at home?
His wife must go crazy.

836
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,969
Just listen to the music.

837
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,763
Focus on the rhythm and the tempo.

838
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,891
Let's pick up some refreshments
for the staff on our way there.

839
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,392
We can't go empty-handed.

840
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,477
Good idea.

841
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,187
Am I the only one who's annoyed?

842
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,356
-Hello?
-I'm always the only one who's annoyed!

843
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,859
-Hello, Nak-su.
-Hello.

844
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,569
-How long has it been?
-How are you?

845
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,862
-Here.
-For me?

846
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,324
This is the friend I told you about.

847
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,867
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

848
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,911
I'm Kim Nak-su from ACT Sales Team 1.

849
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,120
It's nothing big, but…

850
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,957
I won't ever forget the favor
you did for me.

851
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,500
Oh, please.

852
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,419
It'll be nice to see IT-BOY after so long.

853
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,880
How is he? Has he calmed down a bit?

854
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,590
I've buttered him up a bit.

855
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,635
From what I saw,
it seemed like a simple technical issue.

856
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,721
Exactly. It's just a simple issue.

857
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,975
This would have been prevented
with better communication.

858
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,601
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

859
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,437
I'll explain everything
and clear up any misunderstandings.

860
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,565
-Okay. Let's go.
-Thank you so much.

861
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,899
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

862
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,278
-How are things at ACT these days?
-We're barely scraping by.

863
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,738
Come on. I know how competent you are.

864
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,657
-Let me take that.
-It's fine. Let me.

865
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,658
-I can…
-This way.

866
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,621
This is Mr. Kim Nak-su,
a general manager at ACT.

867
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,668
This is for you.

868
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,421
-Goodness.
-You shouldn't have.

869
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,048
I feel bad.

870
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,510
The red areas indicate
completed Giga network construction,

871
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:40,264
and the blue areas indicate
planned construction, as you can see.

872
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,974
But if you look here…

873
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,101
I can't believe a major Korean corporation

874
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,730
would stoop so low to cheat
a small public facility!

875
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,732
-We are very sorry.
-We apologize

876
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,609
-We're sorry.
-Hold on.

877
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,360
The person in charge didn't come?

878
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,572
Regardless of the reason,

879
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,282
I once again express my deepest apologies.

880
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,200
Okay.

881
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,702
-All right.
-I mean it.

882
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,953
Anyway,

883
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,206
we're truly grateful to you, IT-BOY.

884
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,752
You bringing this issue to light
keeps us on our toes

885
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,129
and pushes us to make our service better--

886
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,089
-Gosh.
-Let me.

887
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,841
-Let me.
-No, please. Here.

888
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:17,718
Here.

889
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,346
The person in charge should've come!

890
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,014
What are you all doing here?

891
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,349
Is this some joke?

892
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,516
We're sorry.

893
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,726
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

894
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,437
By the way, whose idea was it
to have me take down the video?

895
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,105
It caught me off guard

896
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,650
when I was told
to take the video down out of nowhere.

897
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,403
The bastard who was dumb enough
to ask you to take it down…

898
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,906
I mean, the employee…

899
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,992
I will take responsibility
and ensure that the employee

900
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,078
faces appropriate disciplinary action.

901
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:45,788
I'm sorry.

902
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,498
We'll make the service free for a year

903
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,124
as a token of our apology--

904
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,627
I don't need that.
Just hand me the contract.

905
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,003
Here.

906
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,715
-I'm so sorry.
-Goodness.

907
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,967
Can we…

908
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,232
What are you still doing here?

909
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,900
We're very sorry.

910
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,193
Go!

911
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,821
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

912
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,299
Call Mr. Baek Jeong-tae.

913
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,009
Okay. Calling.

914
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,971
Hello, Nak-su.

915
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,099
Sir, it's all taken care of.

916
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,350
Okay. Well done.

917
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,061
I gave a proper apology

918
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:54,898
and explained
the technical issues in detail.

919
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,860
He agreed to upload
a follow-up video right away,

920
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,820
and I've handled everything.

921
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,905
It all went well.

922
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,492
-How about Yangpyeong?
-As for Yangpyeong…

923
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:09,121
It went well in Yangpyeong too.

924
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,122
It did?

925
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,959
I made sure my team knew what to do.

926
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,127
Okay.

927
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,504
Are you at the office?

928
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,174
I'm almost there.

929
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,968
If you haven't eaten,
shall we grab dinner?

930
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:23,969
No.

931
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,929
I'm actually with someone now.

932
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,016
Are you? Okay.

933
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,976
Good job today.

934
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,436
-Jeong-tae!
-What?

935
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,481
I'm sorry. I'll do better.

936
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,149
Okay.

937
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,151
-I'll do better!
-Okay.

938
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,152
I--

939
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,454
What's the point
of nagging him over and over

940
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,331
when he just doesn't get it?

941
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,420
He's still stuck with the mindset

942
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,673
of a student waiting
for his homework to be checked.

943
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,384
I'm seriously fuming.

944
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,720
Let me.

945
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:16,146
Should we order some more tuna belly?

946
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,147
Sounds good.

947
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,149
Ms. Woo.

948
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,944
I'm just glad things worked out well.

949
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,823
Where were we?

950
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,118
MVP.

951
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,745
Right.

952
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,247
SONG IK-HYEON

953
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,415
-Hello, Ik-hyeon.
-Mr. Kim.

954
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,376
We're just leaving Yangpyeong now.

955
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,877
Okay. How did everything go?

956
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,338
It's been taken care of for now.

957
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,382
I don't think they'll take it to court.

958
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,217
What a relief.

959
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,427
It went well with the YouTuber too.

960
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,762
I told you.

961
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,598
People who live off ads and sponsorships
will always fold.

962
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,059
I showed up, frowned, and pointed out

963
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,562
that it clearly says
"construction planned."

964
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,981
He panicked
and said he'd delete the video,

965
00:55:59,064 --> 00:55:59,982
then apologized.

966
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,734
You should have seen it.

967
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:04,528
Well done, sir.

968
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,156
What did they say when you told them
we'd waive their fees?

969
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,952
They declined and asked
to cancel the contract,

970
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,954
so we canceled it
without the termination fee.

971
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,622
I see.

972
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,499
That was the best we could do.

973
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,293
Okay.

974
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,752
I'm sorry about today.

975
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,505
Don't worry about it.

976
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:26,633
It's not like they were
a major client or anything.

977
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:27,759
You know?

978
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:30,846
Let's just work hard
and find us more clients, okay?

979
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,931
Okay. Have a good night, sir.

980
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:36,351
You guys must be hungry.
Let's have dinner.

981
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:37,978
Dinner?

982
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,564
You've done so well today.

983
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,441
We should have a company dinner.

984
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,192
Everyone's coming, right?

985
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,069
Yes, but…

986
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,696
Let's go to Ttokdari Diner.

987
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,282
Days like this call for a drink.

988
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,326
Let me ask them first.

989
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,328
What do you mean? Aren't you on speaker?

990
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,246
Come if you're free.

991
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,749
I'm almost there. I'll order first.

992
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,917
Pork neck for you, Song-hee.

993
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,001
That's right!

994
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,211
We'll call you back, Mr. Kim.

995
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,005
No need to do that!

996
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,507
Just come if you're free.
Don't force yourself if you're tired.

997
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,051
I'll see you all soon.

998
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,302
Mr. Kim.

999
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,973
Great.

1000
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,808
Do you two

1001
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,352
have plans tonight?

1002
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,230
Dinner with my boyfriend.

1003
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,608
I made a reservation a month ago.

1004
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,278
It's on a whole different level
from Ttokdari Diner.

1005
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,530
And you, Sung-gu?

1006
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:33,033
The fifth round of the wedding dress hunt.

1007
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,035
The fifth round?

1008
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,246
Are there even
any dresses left for her to try on?

1009
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,748
What do you say?

1010
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,421
I'll set course for Ttokdari.

1011
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,006
Why is there no end to my work?

1012
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,591
-Why?
-Seriously.

1013
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,218
I hate this.

1014
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,553
-Babe.
-Hi, honey.

1015
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,180
-I…
-I'm sorry, but…

1016
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,724
Why is everybody apologizing?

1017
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,107
Okay.

1018
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,859
Hello. Table for four, please.

1019
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,278
-Drinks?
-One soju and two beers.

1020
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,990
Will you order the meat
after the rest of your party arrives?

1021
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,658
No, they'll be here any minute.

1022
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,535
Four pork belly and two pork neck.

1023
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,453
-Okay.
-Please be quick.

1024
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,164
I'm starving.

1025
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,969
So sweet.

1026
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,264
The soju sure tastes sweet tonight.

1027
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,644
You've got mail.

1028
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,453
Good work today, sir.

1029
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,246
-Good work today, sir.
-Good work today, sir.

1030
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,957
-Hi. Good job today. Sit down.
-Ma'am! One soju and a beer!

1031
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,335
We happened to be hungry
right when you called to invite us to eat.

1032
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,420
We were so excited.

1033
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,178
Let's go for a single today.

1034
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,596
I'm still hungover.

1035
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,182
Still? We all drank together.

1036
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,726
Someone got a hole-in-one.

1037
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,935
You're right.

1038
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:25,687
That's one lucky guy.

1039
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,064
The guy in the middle got it?

1040
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,398
CONGRATULATIONS
HOLE-IN-ONE

1041
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:29,691
Looks like it.

1042
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,234
Wait.

1043
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,237
That's Choi Sang-pil, isn't it?

1044
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,739
You're right.

1045
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,491
Choi Sang-pil of LK Telecom!

1046
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,493
That one is the managing director of ACT.

1047
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,953
They're the sales directors
from the three major telecoms.

1048
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,371
You're right.

1049
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,582
Why would those pricks all gather here?

1050
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,667
Come on. Let's just go.

1051
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,295
-Let's go.
-Hang on a minute.

1052
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,219
Mr. Choi Sang-pil.

1053
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:00,806
It's been a while. What's with your tone?

1054
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,349
I'm hurt.

1055
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,726
It's not like we're cops.

1056
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,730
Me? I'm at Suwon Country Club.

1057
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,359
I just saw your photo.

1058
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,485
KIM NAK-SU

1059
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,153
Korea Fair Trade Commission?

1060
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,405
I guess he happened to see

1061
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,324
that hole-in-one photo from back then.

1062
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,367
And?

1063
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,828
He just made some small talk and hung up,

1064
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,329
but I know that bastard.

1065
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,456
He's not the type
to call without a reason.

1066
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,295
Are you saying
he caught a whiff of something?

1067
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,465
One hundred percent.
He's a total Fair Trade Commission whiz.

1068
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,759
I was just on the phone
with Mr. Yoon from TU.

1069
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,928
We should lay low for the time being.

1070
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,430
We don't want
to be suspected of colluding.

1071
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,432
They're like Dobermans.

1072
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,351
Once they bite, they never let go.

1073
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,311
Okay. I understand.

1074
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,272
I can't believe that hole-in-one

1075
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,440
is coming back to bite us like this.

1076
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,820
-I'm sorry.
-Let's be careful for now.

1077
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:34,316
Fine dust hit 185 micrograms
in Daegwallyeong, Gangwon Province,

1078
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,276
and 209 in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province.

1079
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:44,284
I've done my part.

1080
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:48,330
Seoul, Gyeonggi, Gangwon,
as well as Chungcheong and Jeolla…

1081
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,467
ASAN FACTORY SAFETY MANAGEMENT
TEAM LEADER RECRUITMENT NOTICE

1082
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,345
POSITION: GENERAL MANAGER OR ABOVE
20+ YEARS EXPERIENCE PREFERRED

1083
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,514
IF THERE ARE NO APPLICANTS

1084
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:08,475
MANDATORY ASSIGNMENT MAY BE ISSUED

1085
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,477
I'm going to Ulleungdo Island.

1086
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,479
They told me to go manage the facilities.

1087
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,815
-Show us what you got.
-You really are running out of time.

1088
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,944
Those bastards never planned on sending me
to Ulleungdo in the first place.

1089
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,320
You have to change.

1090
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,905
-They want me to quit on my own.
-Nak-su!

1091
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:23,865
If we get an administrative sanction…

1092
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:27,035
-We'll easily lose tens of billions.
-The company won't handle it for you.

1093
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,286
They won't wait for you!

1094
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,713
Living a long life
would be a disaster for me.

1095
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,538
Just say sorry and be done with it.

1096
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,550
Why is your team falling
so far behind Do Jin-woo's?

1097
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:37,963
-…I'd make him managing director.
-I don't think we can solve this that way.

1098
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,505
You must have thought about it too.

1099
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,967
Why weren't you answering, Mr. Kim?
Please take care of…

1100
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,677
-Have a great life!
-…enter this room…

1101
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,470
-What's so great, Dad?
-…ashamed as a mother.

1102
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,868
You have to take responsibility…

1103
01:02:47,018 --> 01:02:50,475
-…lose my chance at becoming an executive?
-…for all the choices you made.

1104
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,687
We decided to send him to Asan.

1105
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,941
I'm the one who made the call.

1106
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,863
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

1107
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,424
MISSED CALL
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

1108
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,633
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

1109
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,567
FINE DUST LEVEL
VERY HIGH

1110
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:24,778
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

1111
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,852
You know better than anyone
how hard I've worked at ACT

1112
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,270
for the past 25 years.

1113
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,189
I'm still useful to the company.

1114
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,526
Executives are always
on the company's side.

1115
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,986
You're not in a gang.
It's not about loyalty and betrayal.

1116
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,129
Let's go make some sales.
Let's get out there.

1117
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,032
It's been a while, hasn't it?

1118
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,160
I'll shatter it.
Like a bird breaking out from its shell,

1119
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,870
I'll break your company's shell

1120
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,123
so that you guys can fly.

1121
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,291
Is Nak-su

1122
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,460
out of the office again?

1123
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,339
Isn't Nak-su going to be an executive now?

1124
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,677
I guess having experience
really does make a difference.

1125
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,886
Help me out, guys.

1126
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:33,304
If you do,

1127
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,391
I promise to give you
great performance reviews.

1128
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,857
