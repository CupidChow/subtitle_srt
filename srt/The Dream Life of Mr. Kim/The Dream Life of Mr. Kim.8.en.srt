00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,221
Once he's all done,

3
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,722
you take some sand

4
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,016
and sprinkle it on top.

5
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,728
Then you just sweep it up.

6
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,690
And toss it in here.

7
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,024
Then you're done.

8
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,110
Do I have to clean up the poop?

9
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,194
Yes.

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,448
Attention, all employees.

11
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,952
Thank you for your hard work this morning.

12
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,872
Lunchtime is until one o'clock.

13
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,127
We hope you all enjoy your lunch.

14
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,879
Lunchtime!

15
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,721
You have to run for your lunch
around here.

16
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,763
Excuse me?

17
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,474
-If you're late, you'll get nothing.
-Okay.

18
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,018
And only one yogurt per person!

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,227
Okay.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,605
Jeez.

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,983
Bye.

22
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,403
-Hey!
-Shoot!

23
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,030
-Darn it!
-Hey.

24
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,072
Nice!

25
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,742
You really are leaving
without having done anything.

26
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,994
There was no work for me to do.

27
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,537
Yes, there was.

28
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,414
That wasn't work.

29
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,334
It was just an errand.

30
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,211
Actually, it was better for us
that you didn't do any work here.

31
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,921
Don't think of it like that.

32
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,173
HQ will push harder.

33
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,842
I heard they're going
to shut down this factory.

34
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,219
Why are you so surprised?
We hear things too.

35
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,267
The pressure from HQ will get worse,
and things will get a lot tougher here.

36
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,352
I haven't done anything.

37
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,354
Yes, you have.

38
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,565
You don't think there's a difference
between the world ending tomorrow

39
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,567
and it ending a year from now?

40
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,194
That one year is so precious.

41
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,156
Whether we hide underground
or flee to another planet,

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,034
it gives us time to plan.

43
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,245
And it gives us precious time
with our families.

44
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,955
Don't you think?

45
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,876
In the end,

46
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,631
you did a great job keeping
the workers at this factory safe.

47
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,884
You should take credit for that.

48
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,306
If that's the case…

49
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,852
You could have at least
thrown me a surprise farewell party.

50
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,396
-What?
-Or, at the very least,

51
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,064
you all could've given me a card.

52
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,357
You say you guys are grateful,

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,484
but no one's seeing me off.
They're just playing ball.

54
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,361
Is having me here not enough for you?

55
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,865
That's right.
I prefer quantity over quality.

56
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,326
My apologies.

57
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,580
If I'd known, I would've
prepared a big send-off or something.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,250
Whatever.

59
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,670
I even put on a little show
and made you all bomb shots.

60
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,588
Right.

61
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,049
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

62
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,634
It was so, so good.

63
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,930
Just keep thinking about it, then.

64
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,975
Because you'll never have it again.

65
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,019
I'm going now.

66
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,772
Can I have your business card?

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,026
Your timing is ridiculous.

68
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,195
Just give me one anyway.

74
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,628
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Kim!

75
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,463
Yes.

76
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,923
Good luck. Thank you.

77
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,759
Thank you for your hard work.

78
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,718
Thank you.

79
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,678
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

EPISODE 8
ALL IN

82
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,128
KIM NAK-SU HAS LEFT THE CHAT

83
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,296
Mr. Kim left the…

84
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,384
-Mr. Do, did you enjoy your--
-You're back from lunch.

85
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,553
-Did you have a good lunch?
-Sleep some more.

86
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,764
-The lunch break isn't over yet.
-No, sir. I was brainstorming.

87
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,643
Did you know Mr. Kim Nak-su came up
with the idea of public Wi-Fi zones

88
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,271
and insisted that we expand on them?

89
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,400
Really? He was a legend.

90
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:02,028
He was someone to look up to.
It's a shame how things turned out.

91
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,613
Is something wrong?

92
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,574
You didn't know either?

93
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,618
Mr. Kim left the company today.

94
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,538
-What?
-That's why he left the group chat.

95
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,708
If he'd given us a heads-up,
we could've thrown a farewell party.

96
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,795
It's a shame.
We didn't even get to say goodbye.

97
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,258
Well, people come and go.
That's how it is.

98
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,219
Sir, there's an issue
with the main conference room.

99
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,513
-We've moved the meeting to Room A.
-Okay. Let's go.

100
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,598
Are you going somewhere?

101
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,766
-Did we have a meeting this afternoon?
-No.

102
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,728
Team 1 doesn't need to attend,
so I didn't tell you.

103
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,355
I'll have Myung-heon fill you in
on anything you may need to know.

104
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,565
From now on.

105
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,317
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,401
Yes, sir.

107
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,406
What was that just now?

108
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,118
He's letting us know
we're just Kim Nak-su's guys.

109
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,476
Breakfast is ready!

110
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,435
Okay.

111
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,312
Su-gyeom, let's eat.

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,108
This is delicious.

113
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,526
What's gotten into you?

114
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,987
Seriously, this is amazing.
Su-gyeom, try some.

115
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,033
Honey, when did you say the results
of your medical checkup would be ready?

116
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,409
Next week, I think.

117
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,662
I'll make a doctor's appointment
and come with you.

118
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,664
It's better if I hear it myself.

119
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,124
There's no need.
I'm sure nothing's wrong with me.

120
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,250
Just humor me.

121
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,128
You don't want to neglect your health
and cost us a fortune later.

122
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,965
Here. Have some of this too.

123
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,676
And let's cancel
some of our insurance as well.

124
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
We need to cut our fixed expenses
as much as we can.

125
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,975
Su-gyeom, you should look into
student loans just in case.

126
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:55,976
Okay.

127
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,437
What's this about loans?
I'll take care of his tuition.

128
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,855
Gosh.

129
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,192
Honey, I have to get ready now.

130
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,736
-You didn't even finish your food.
-Oh my.

131
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,323
Honey, when we go to the campsite later,

132
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,783
wear this, okay?

133
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,370
And shave your beard

134
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,205
-so you look clean.
-All right.

135
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,589
Dad.

136
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,174
Yes?

137
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,384
Well…

138
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,807
Is this about
what we discussed?

139
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,436
Just give me some time. I'm working on it.

140
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,563
No, I'd been meaning to tell you this.

141
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,191
They caught the guy who scammed me.

142
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,569
-Really?
-Yes.

143
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,987
You don't have to worry anymore.

144
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,907
Dad, I'm heading out now.

145
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,492
Why? We can go together.

146
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,744
I'm running late.

147
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,328
Jeez.

148
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,414
-Honey, what are you doing? I'm late.
-Okay.

149
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,999
Bye, Su-gyeom.

150
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,672
This is already my fourth interview.

151
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,717
Some kid way younger than me said,

152
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,970
"Why should I hire you, Ms. Park Ha-jin?"

153
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,849
That just completely
crushed my confidence.

154
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,604
That's why I told you not to waste time
on the real estate license thing.

155
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,148
You don't have to put up
with that kind of nonsense.

156
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,902
You think I like hearing that?
I'm doing it so we can make a living.

157
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,449
Gosh, forget it.

158
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,535
Hey, don't be late to the campsite.

159
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,079
Ha-yeong said it was tough to book.

160
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,250
Do I really have to go?

161
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,418
Of course you do.

162
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,004
I arranged this whole thing for you.

163
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,132
Just come and hear
what Sang-cheol has to say, okay?

164
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,259
I'm not grilling the meat.

165
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,637
Fine. I'll grill the meat.

166
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,681
That's the place, right?

167
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,144
-Good luck.
-See you later.

168
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,229
-Okay.
-All right.

169
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,529
DAHAN REAL ESTATE

170
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
Hello.

171
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,325
FRIENDLY ADVICE, HONEST SERVICE

172
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,868
-Please, have a seat.
-Okay.

173
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:20,912
Jeez.

174
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,798
TAKE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN EAT

175
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

176
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,718
Hello.

177
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,262
-Hi.
-Hello.

178
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,430
-Su-gyeom, you're here.
-Hello.

179
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,557
-Go get ready.
-Okay.

180
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,653
I'll put these over here.

181
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,863
Okay.

182
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,701
Su-gyeom, finish up quickly and go.

183
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,952
Okay. Bye.

184
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,911
Bye.

185
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,099
Is this the business
you wanted us to start?

186
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,934
I have to go back in.

187
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,937
We proved that we're capable of something.

188
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,690
I get that you don't want
to rely on your dad--

189
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,776
He offered to give me money.
I was the one who refused it.

190
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,486
Why?

191
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,613
Just because.

192
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,658
If he's offering, why not just take it?

193
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,911
You can pay him back later.

194
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,829
What's the big deal?

195
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,666
Hey.

196
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,252
What did my dad do wrong?

197
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,046
What?

198
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,089
Why should my dad be the one to fund us?

199
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,299
You could…

200
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,345
You could ask your parents for help.

201
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,349
Did I ask him to fund us?

202
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,352
Did I ask you
to borrow money from your dad?

203
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,520
No, but what's with your attitude?

204
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,440
Who do you think got me into this mess?

205
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,779
So it's my fault again?

206
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,991
Are you saying it's my fault
for introducing you to Lee Jeong-hwan?

207
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,331
Fine.

208
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,251
Give me your account number.

209
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,338
I'll pay off your 30 million won,
so just type in your account number.

210
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,512
Here, take this for now.

211
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,305
I'll send you the rest later.

212
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,057
-Han-na.
-I've given it some thought.

213
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,350
I'm going back to the US.

214
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,103
We shouldn't have let things between us

215
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,397
become more
than fond middle school memories.

216
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,067
I'm sorry, Su-gyeom.

217
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,569
I ruined everything.

218
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,239
I'll talk to my parents
as soon as I get there

219
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,407
and send the money.

220
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,784
It won't take long. Take care.

221
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,468
I thought we would be
grilling our own meat.

222
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,637
No,
they do everything for you here.

223
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,931
Thank you.

224
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,226
This isn't the kind of camping
we had in mind.

225
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,437
-I know.
-We should've brought Su-gyeom.

226
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,397
-Please have a lovely time.
-Thank you.

227
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,901
Nak-su, you've worked so hard.

228
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:39,861
Oh, please.

229
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,531
I wish you the best of health
in the next chapter of your life.

230
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,366
Congratulations, Nak-su.

231
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,785
-I hope your business is a success.
-Thank you.

232
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,414
But why did you quit your job?

233
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,335
It wasn't any fun.

234
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,254
And I figured I'd try something new.

235
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,924
He's already received so many offers.

236
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,384
I bet.

237
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,095
He worked at such a huge company
for 25 years, after all.

238
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,184
I recently had to find a sales director,

239
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,518
but it was quite a struggle.

240
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,437
Since you were the standard,

241
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,189
no one quite measured up to you.

242
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,359
Really?

243
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,157
Well, you need to hire people
if you're going to start a business.

244
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,242
So what will you be doing now?

245
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,660
Do you have any plans?

246
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,704
I bet the severance pay wasn't much.

247
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,916
It's more than you'd think.

248
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,587
Goodness, you worry about everything.

249
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,090
I'm sure Nak-su has a plan. Right?

250
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,508
-Yes.
-Okay.

251
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,094
So I want to know what the plan is.
What is it?

252
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,013
Where's the restroom?

253
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,182
Over there. Let me come with you.

254
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,975
-This way.
-Eat up.

255
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,811
I'll be right back.

256
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,729
-This way, Nak-su.
-Okay, thanks.

257
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:06,364
My wife told me
you wanted to make me an offer.

258
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,617
I did.

259
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,247
I guess it wasn't
the right time for me back then.

260
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,458
Are you interested now?

261
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,671
Didn't you say you already hired someone?

262
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,507
You can never have too many sales people.

263
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,926
Really?

264
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,520
But if you decide to join us,

265
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,941
you might have to work
under someone who joined before you.

266
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,568
And?

267
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,987
In that case,
I may not be able to match the terms

268
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,864
that I originally had in mind.

269
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,866
What, are you going to offer me
two million won?

270
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,077
Goodness, Nak-su. Of course not.

271
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,912
Why not? Two million sounds fine.

272
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:59,208
I'd have to offer you
at least 2.2 or 2.3 million won.

273
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,753
Nak-su. I really want you in my company.

274
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,173
Just a second.

275
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,757
Hi, Mr. Eom.

276
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,800
Yes, I can talk.

277
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,218
I'll see you in a bit.

278
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,430
Yes, I saw that.

279
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,015
What do the investors keep asking for?

280
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,308
The IR and what else?

281
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,019
That son of a…

282
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,189
Hey.

283
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,485
-By any chance--
-Wait. Let me go first.

284
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,695
I'm saying this just in case.

285
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,281
There's not an opening
at his company anymore.

286
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,367
I don't want you to get your hopes up.

287
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,788
The offer was months ago.
Nak-su said he wasn't interested.

288
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,916
That ship has sailed.

289
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,131
Don't tell me
that's why you wanted to meet today.

290
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,133
No, of course not.

291
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,469
Of course not, right?

292
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,221
I was almost disappointed.

293
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,267
The high and mighty Park Ha-jin

294
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,437
wouldn't possibly be asking
for a job for her husband.

295
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,314
No way.

296
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,192
-Hey!
-Come to think of it.

297
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,029
I think they said they needed

298
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,659
another person to work under the director.

299
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,385
For the first time ever,

300
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,597
I feel like I have you
in the palm of my hand.

301
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,934
-Do you, now?
-Yes.

302
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,521
My sister, who has nagged me
like my mom my whole life,

303
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,984
is now groveling before me
over her husband's job.

304
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,030
Hey,

305
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,448
is Sang-cheol not back yet?

306
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,575
He left first.

307
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,327
Nak-su! Be good to my sister.

308
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,620
I already am.

309
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,040
My sister really loves you.

310
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,210
-Okay.
-All right. We'll do that.

311
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,671
Great. Talk to you soon.

312
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,299
Who were you talking to?

313
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,009
Mr. Eom.

314
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,554
The guy you hired instead of Nak-su?

315
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,638
Yes.

316
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,146
So is there an opening for him or not?

317
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,399
Gosh,
I really want him to join us.

318
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,279
Please consider what I told you.

319
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,119
What a supportive wife.

320
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,329
What was that?

321
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,788
Nothing.

322
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,441
My dearest, happy Ha-yeong.

323
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,405
Please think it over.

324
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,576
I promise I'll stop nagging you like Mom

325
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,787
and be good to you, okay?

326
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,915
I'm counting on you.

327
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,750
Okay.

328
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,630
-You've had enough.
-All right.

329
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,808
Are you okay?

330
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,813
What about you? Are you okay?

331
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,316
Yes, I am. Why wouldn't I be?

332
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,568
Then I'm okay too.

333
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,043
SOL E&TECH
CEO CHO YUN-HYEONG

334
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,213
Did the managing director of sales quit?

335
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,466
I'll be in touch. Bye.

336
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,343
Not that it matters,

337
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,055
but didn't you say that one director quit?

338
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,850
Damn, this is tough.

339
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,268
SOL E&TECH CEO CHO YUN-HYEONG

340
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,272
You talked smack about them
because they were so bad at their job.

341
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,357
You're my favorite person
to drink with too.

342
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,400
When should we meet?

343
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,945
How about I come over and give you
some pointers on the art of sales?

344
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,281
Sounds good. And the timing's perfect.

345
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,409
I'm thinking of opening a new branch.

346
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,203
And I'd feel a lot better
if someone like you could take charge.

347
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,539
A new branch? Where?

348
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,332
CEO KIM RYUN-HOE

349
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,417
In Jamsil.

350
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,171
I'm thinking of a one-stop shop
for everything from demos to sales.

351
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,717
That's definitely the trend
in retail these days.

352
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,886
You sure know
what you're doing.

353
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,430
If you're going to keep talking
like you're better than me,

354
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,639
we're done here.

355
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,437
Please continue, sir.

356
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,318
The base pay is two big ones a month,
and you can earn more through incentives.

357
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,196
Two big ones?

358
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,490
Not 20 million.

359
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,243
CEO JANG MIN-GYU

360
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,912
I can't go higher than two million.

361
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,246
Two-point-two million won.

362
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,248
Before taxes.

363
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,667
-We can't afford to hire anyone right now.
-I see.

364
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,753
I see you were born in 1972.

365
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,213
-You entered college in '91?
-Yes.

366
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,172
I see.

367
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,926
Our CEO was born in 1976.

368
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,011
Sales! So important.

369
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,097
That's why I do it all at my company.

370
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,184
Wow, you're even available
to work on weekends?

371
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,520
-Yes.
-Awesome!

372
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,979
In that case…

373
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,940
Two million.

374
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,112
Isn't base pay for sales always low?
It's all about the incentives.

375
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,948
But still, man!

376
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,866
Until last week, I was a general manager.

377
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,910
I can't work for that kind of money.

378
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,664
Even delivery drivers
make five million a month.

379
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,748
Then do that.

380
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,917
I can't drive a truck.

381
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,586
Right. That's true.

382
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,965
Then you'll just have to live
off your severance pay.

383
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,466
Come on.

384
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,223
So, what have you been up to?

385
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,224
What do you mean?

386
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,767
What's your daily routine?

387
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,105
Well, once I get up in the morning,

388
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,233
I work out, come home, wash up,

389
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,027
read the paper for a bit,
and eat with my wife.

390
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:42,987
Jeez.

391
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,697
We eat out from time to time,

392
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,782
and on the way back,
I check on my building.

393
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,033
And sometimes I go hiking.

394
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,535
That's pretty much it.

395
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,663
Must be nice. Life is certainly different
on 30 million a month.

396
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,624
Did I not tell you? It's 32 million now.

397
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,085
I get a share from the cafe, you see.

398
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,299
32 MILLION WON / MONTH

399
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,176
I'm so damn jealous of you, Mr. Landlord.

400
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,141
Don't do it.

401
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,311
-Don't do what?
-Whatever it is.

402
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,022
Don't even think about doing
what you're planning right now.

403
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,064
Stop right there.

404
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,401
Don't you dare touch your severance pay.

405
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,819
Just leave it be.

406
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,238
If you do something
you're not cut out for,

407
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,157
it'll only come back to bite you.

408
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,200
Just focus on finding a job.

409
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,369
You're cut out for the corporate life.

410
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,710
NTC CARD PAYMENT COMPLETE: 1,687,150 WON

411
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,670
Jeez, another credit card bill.

412
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,173
You can't think the same way you did
when you had a job.

413
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,091
You have to cut down on your spending.

414
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,177
Hey, I'll pay for everything today,

415
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,888
so listen to me nag a bit more.

416
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,641
Canned peaches, smoked drumsticks,
and spicy jerky, right?

417
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,476
Thanks, Mr. Landlord.

418
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,311
And some anchovies too.

419
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,647
Man, you've got quite the appetite.

420
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,779
Thanks, take care.

421
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,950
DELIVERY DRIVER WANTED

422
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,912
A delivery driver makes five million.

423
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,458
A courier makes three and a half million.

424
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,507
A designated driver
makes about four million.

425
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,930
A retiree on a pension
gets about six million.

426
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,642
A golf instructor makes seven million.

427
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,939
Six million, seven million, six--

428
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,148
Hello, gentlemen.

429
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,776
We want to tell you about
a great commercial building.

430
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,403
SALARY ENDS
BUT RENT DOESN'T

431
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,155
If you invest now,

432
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,450
you'll be able to collect
about six to seven million won in rent.

433
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,165
Hey, I need to go home. I'll call you.

434
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,251
-Sorry.
-Hey, Nak-su!

435
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,419
Where are you going?

436
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,087
Hey!

437
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,409
SALARY ENDS
BUT RENT DOESN'T

438
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,207
Yes, we're still selling
units in our building.

439
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,543
But you might want to hurry.

440
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,712
We're almost out of units.

441
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,963
Take a brochure.

442
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,339
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

443
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,592
Please take a fan.

444
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,385
Please come in for a consultation.

445
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,554
Did you know?

446
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,722
Salary ends…

447
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,974
-…but rent doesn't!
-…but rent doesn't!

448
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,684
-Come take a look inside.
-Thank you.

449
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,269
-Thank you.
-Please go on in.

450
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,771
Yes, you can go in now.

451
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:04,772
SHOWROOM
UNITS FOR SALE

452
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,565
-Come take a look.
-Feel free to look around.

453
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,150
Hello, please take a fan.

454
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,360
I look forward to working with you too.

455
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,906
Hello, welcome to AP Royal.
Do you have an appointment?

456
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,532
No, I just came to take a look.

457
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,950
Welcome, sir.

458
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,579
-Did you call to make an appointment?
-No, I didn't.

459
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,248
I'm sorry. All our consultation slots
are fully booked for the day.

460
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,250
How long until the next appointment?

461
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,710
About 15 minutes?

462
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,089
Sir, I'm afraid
I only have about 15 minutes.

463
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,341
-Would that still be okay?
-Sure, that's fine.

464
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,843
Please come this way.

465
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,724
MANGJIN PLAZA SALES GALLERY

466
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,773
To drink, we have coffee, green tea,

467
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,609
ssanghwatang, and Job's tears tea.
What can I get for you?

468
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,319
I'll just have a hot coffee, please.

469
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,904
One hot coffee.

470
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,947
Okay.

471
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,368
So what brings you here today?

472
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,912
You really don't remember me, do you?

473
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,373
You gave me a flyer
at the convenience store.

474
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,001
Yes, of course. I think I remember now.

475
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,753
This must be fate.

476
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,797
So, have you sold any?

477
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,341
It looks like these are all sold already.

478
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,843
You're quite late, sir.

479
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,638
Well, there's only one property left
that's worth showing you.

480
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,266
It's definitely a great unit.

481
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,853
It's a bit pricey,
so I'm a little hesitant to bring it up.

482
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,021
Let's hear it.
You said you didn't have much time.

483
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,899
All right, then let me give you
a quick rundown.

484
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,025
MANGJIN PLAZA

485
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,112
First off, the building is located
in a well-connected area.

486
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,740
Let's skip that part.
I saw the news about the Line 5 extension.

487
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,367
Then let me just tell you this.

488
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,912
I walked from the station
to the building myself yesterday.

489
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,415
We've been advertising it
as a five-minute walk.

490
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,001
But guess what?
It was a three-minute walk.

491
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,087
Salespeople always say
something is close to the station.

492
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,131
It really was a three-minute walk.

493
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,758
That doesn't mean anything.
You need a lot of foot traffic.

494
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,887
And there will be
a lot of demand in the area.

495
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,140
As you can see, a major IT company
is building its new HQ nearby.

496
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,558
It's just been approved.

497
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,019
The nearby 50,000-home
residential district is nearly full.

498
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,770
And there are schools nearby too.

499
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,356
So in my opinion,

500
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,525
the quality and quantity
of foot traffic here

501
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,611
is nearly on par with Gangnam Station.

502
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,280
Gangnam Station? That's ridiculous.

503
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,948
-Sir.
-Yes.

504
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,617
I'm the expert here.

505
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,871
This location is one of the best
I've seen in my entire career.

506
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,540
Still, comparing it to Gangnam Station…

507
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,917
Thank you.

508
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,585
-Here's your coffee.
-Thanks.

509
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,213
So it's in a prime school district.

510
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,924
What kind of businesses
have moved in here?

511
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,717
Let's see. On the first floor,

512
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,969
a franchise restaurant
and a big pharmacy have signed on.

513
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,514
Clinics are on floors two to five. Dental,
psychiatry, pediatrics, and dermatology.

514
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,308
Interior work will begin soon.

515
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,976
The basement is empty.

516
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,603
In the basement, a famous influencer

517
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,397
is opening a large indoor
golf simulator facility.

518
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,652
Now, if you look at the overall layout,

519
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,111
one type of business is missing.

520
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,613
What do you think it is?

521
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,574
Well…

522
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,160
Sir, let me give you a hint.

523
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,536
-Okay.
-Right here.

524
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,579
FRANCHISE RESTAURANT

525
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,666
After you have a meal
at the restaurant and come outside…

526
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,667
Oh, coffee.

527
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,711
-There's no cafe here.
-You've got sharp eyes, sir.

528
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,464
Five franchise cafes
are in talks with us right now.

529
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,175
They all think it's a must-have location.

530
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,134
Which ones are they?

531
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,763
The bidding is too competitive
for me to disclose that.

532
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,809
Is this one of them?

533
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,273
Keep this to yourself.

534
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,984
They're the most likely candidate.

535
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,653
They never miss out on a prime location.

536
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,739
Their market analysis
is incredibly thorough.

537
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,035
Well, major corporations
are always meticulous.

538
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,000
By any chance, you…

539
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,920
I actually

540
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,715
worked at ACT for about 25 years.

541
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,675
I just retired.

542
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,260
That explains it.

543
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,887
You have the air of
a big company executive.

544
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,724
I got tired of it and quit.

545
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,017
So, where's this unit?

546
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,853
If you look here, it's in the corner.

547
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,979
It's the only one left.

548
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,106
I knew that would be the one.

549
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,567
I had my eye on that spot from the start.

550
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,945
A corner spot like this
gets traffic from both sides.

551
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,071
My goodness.

552
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,032
How do you know so much about this?

553
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:25,991
Oh, please.

554
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,579
With a spot like that, the monthly income
from rent would be about six…

555
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,749
Maybe seven…

556
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,046
It would be about nine million.

557
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:40,881
I see.

558
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,550
I bet you already knew that.

559
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,053
No, I thought
it'd be around eight million.

560
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,555
I see. Nine million…

561
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,724
Yes, this row here is eight million.

562
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,351
So this one gets nine million, no less.

563
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,977
-I see.
-Yes.

564
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,021
But with VAT, it's about 9.9 million.

565
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,441
You can think of it as ten a month.

566
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:01,943
Ten million a month?

567
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,404
Ten million a month.

568
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,615
Ten million, ten million a month.

569
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,200
Ten million a month.

570
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,911
10 MILLION WON / MONTH

571
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,663
All right. Ten million a month.

572
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,916
-What's the price then?
-It's 1.6 billion won.

573
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,168
-What?
-It's 1.6 billion.

574
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,755
Jeez. That's way too expensive.

575
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,964
-Sir.
-Yes?

576
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,509
Finding tenants is key
for commercial buildings.

577
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,887
And it's impossible for this spot
to ever be vacant.

578
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,888
A solid investment.

579
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,556
I know that.

580
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,018
But 1.6 billion flat, with no discount?

581
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,019
Come on.

582
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,773
As I mentioned earlier,
you're really quite late to the game.

583
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,943
Even the promotions
we were running before have all ended,

584
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,529
so it's hard to give you a discount.
I'm sorry.

585
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,327
Well, it's a shame,
but I guess that's that.

586
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,537
-I should--
-Sir.

587
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,080
Are you interested at all?

588
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,458
My interest would depend on how you--

589
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,085
-Sir!
-Why are you grabbing--

590
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,378
Please sit for a moment.

591
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,922
Didn't you say you didn't have time?

592
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,715
-Please, just a second.
-Goodness.

593
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,342
Gosh. Seriously.

594
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,094
You really drive a hard bargain.

595
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,764
All right. Then I'll…

596
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,353
Let me ask my director.

597
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,105
What's there to ask?

598
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,566
I bet you've got no say in this.

599
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,650
It's nothing.

600
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,026
He has sharp hearing.

601
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,493
This electrifying tension.

602
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,954
This gambler's instinct.

603
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,415
Ten-million-a-month Nak-su!

604
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,337
You can start next week.

605
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,215
Really?

606
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,385
You were a top credit card salesperson.
How could we not hire you?

607
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,138
Show us what you've got.

608
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,556
Yes, of course.

609
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,059
I'll do my absolute best.

610
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,440
Oh my.

611
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,901
There's no need to cry.

612
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,445
I just thought of my husband.

613
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,786
Where is he?

614
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,001
Come on, Kim Nak-su.

615
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,420
Pick up the phone!
Why aren't you answering?

616
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,798
HA-JIN

617
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,265
Just a moment.

618
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,899
This is the pre-construction price
from a year ago.

619
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,068
I told the director
that you're a former ACT executive,

620
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,321
and he said, "Goodness,
we're no match for him."

621
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,615
So he gave you
such a generous discount right away.

622
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,617
I was honestly shocked when I heard.

623
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,121
So, 1.1 billion won?
That's the price of a decent apartment.

624
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,416
And to sink all that into a unit
in a commercial building?

625
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,129
Sir.

626
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,674
-Oh, dear. Is it time already?
-Are you leaving?

627
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,676
Just give me five more minutes.

628
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,261
Just five minutes.

629
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,720
Five minutes.

630
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,349
Sir, what if we think about it this way?

631
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,142
-How should we think about it?
-There are…

632
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,061
-Yes.
-…no resale restrictions here.

633
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,730
You can sell it right away
after you buy it.

634
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,607
So you buy it for 1.1 billion won.

635
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,235
Then you put it on the market
for 400 million more.

636
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,361
It'll sell in a flash.

637
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,363
You'll make 400 million won
just by sitting back.

638
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:37,033
All right. Why are you
getting worked up? Calm down.

639
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,535
In that case…

640
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,996
-Knock off 100 million won.
-What?

641
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,622
-Make it one billion won.
-No way.

642
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,499
Let's just make it an even one billion.

643
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,794
There are plenty of people
willing to pay the full 1.6 billion won.

644
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,589
It's much better for us
to sell it to them.

645
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,548
Hold on.

646
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,094
Then just sell it to them for 1.6 billion.

647
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,888
Why are you selling it to me for less?

648
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,019
Despite everything, why do you think

649
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,605
I'm making you such a special offer?

650
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,356
Why would that be?

651
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,193
It's because I believe you

652
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,531
would take good care of this unit.

653
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,036
Gosh.

654
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,538
How did you know my job
was in management?

655
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,624
You're amazing.

656
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,209
Sir, I've met my fair share of people.

657
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,794
I could tell just by looking at you.

658
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:34,049
"Here's someone who knows
how to get things done."

659
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,675
Okay, I get it.

660
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,637
I'll take good care of it.

661
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,222
So make it one billion won.

662
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,599
No way. Good lord.

663
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,808
Please leave. I'm late.

664
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,935
Come on, I'm sure you all need

665
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,979
to sell it fast so you can pack up.

666
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,523
The labor, operating costs,
and the promoters

667
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,818
would cost you at least
a few million won a day.

668
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,199
This is why it's such a headache
dealing with seasoned veterans like you.

669
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,117
You already know everything!

670
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,329
I can give a quote right away,
just by taking a quick glance.

671
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,872
It's nothing, really.

672
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,249
Fine. All right.

673
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,751
In that case,

674
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,586
let's do 1.05 billion.

675
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,381
What's with the 0.05?
Let's just make it an even one billion.

676
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,841
I can't.

677
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,219
You should go.
I really can't make that happen.

678
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,471
Why are you being so dramatic?
We were just talking--

679
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,807
-What's wrong?
-One moment. I have a call.

680
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,600
-I ignored mine.
-Yes, sir.

681
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,143
Let's just--

682
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,853
-Jeez.
-You're on your way now?

683
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:29,979
Yes.

684
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,565
I was just talking
to someone about that unit.

685
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,068
-We just wrapped things up.
-What do you mean, "wrapped up"?

686
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,570
No. I can see you
after my next appointment, sir.

687
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,074
Okay, I'll see you soon.

688
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,242
All right. Bye.

689
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,952
Wait a minute. What?

690
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,081
Hey, we weren't done talking.
I haven't even made up my mind yet.

691
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,999
Then please take time to think it over.

692
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,876
Give me a call when you've decided.

693
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,795
I'm running late.
It's gonna delay everything.

694
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,755
Okay. Fine.

695
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,760
So, you'll take it?

696
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,438
Come sit down.

697
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,314
In that case…

698
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,193
What is it?

699
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,987
Talk it over with your wife and come back.

700
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,448
Jeez, why are you
making this so hard for me?

701
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:22,949
We feel more comfortable that way.

702
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,702
It's my money.
Why do I need to talk it over with anyone?

703
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,661
Get back here.

704
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,748
-I understand.
-Jeez.

705
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,124
In that case, sir,

706
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,294
please wire the deposit now.

707
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,421
We should put this on hold.

708
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,715
Or the other buyers
will end up wasting their trip.

709
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,633
-How much?
-Ten percent of the principal.

710
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,557
Hold on. I have a favor to ask,
and this is very important.

711
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,642
You absolutely can't tell any other owners

712
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,061
that you got a 550 million won discount.

713
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,605
We'd be in huge trouble.

714
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,732
I won't. Don't worry.

715
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,985
You're the only one
who got a special discount.

716
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,529
All the other owners paid the full price.

717
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,530
Do you understand?

718
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,618
Thank you.

719
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,661
Thanks.

720
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,718
COMING SOON: PEDIATRICS, DENTISTRY
PHARMACY, RESTAURANT, DERMATOLOGY

721
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,762
Welcome. I've been waiting for you.

722
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,722
There are too many people waiting.

723
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,474
If you sign the contract now…

724
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,184
The subway station is…

725
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,228
I really can't go below 1.2 billion won.

726
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,687
This place is a real bargain.

727
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,231
That's as low as we can go.

728
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,923
I don't need the company anymore.

729
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,676
Ten-million-a-month Nak-su.

730
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,553
Ten-million-a-month Nak-su!

731
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,350
Ten-million-a-month Nak-su!

732
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,731
Where have you been?
You didn't even answer your phone.

733
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,193
What is this?
You should eat a proper meal.

734
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,153
I was going to eat out with you.

735
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,072
But you didn't pick up your phone.

736
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,073
Where's Su-gyeom?

737
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,075
Su-gyeom? He went out.

738
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,536
-Honey.
-Yes?

739
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,210
What are you doing? Hey!
What's with you? Honey!

740
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,045
Hon--

741
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,422
Stop! Stop it!

742
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,555
-Welcome.
-Oh my.

743
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,849
Welcome, sir.

744
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,350
Is business going well?

745
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,435
Yes.

746
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,271
This is huge.

747
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,981
Is this place really yours, Dad?

748
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,860
Could you bring three coffees
over to that table?

749
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,279
Sure. I'll make them for you myself.

750
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,655
-All right.
-Yes.

751
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,783
Please have a seat.

752
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,204
This is really nice.

753
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,624
-That's your problem, Jin-woo.
-I'm sorry.

754
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,791
Oh my.

755
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,043
Well!

756
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,502
-Goodness.
-Look who it is.

757
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,587
-Sir.
-Oh my.

758
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,048
-Hello.
-My light, my joy.

759
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,050
-Jeez.
-My brilliant strategist.

760
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:28,635
Goodness.

761
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,928
Congratulations on the opening.

762
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:30,887
CONGRATULATIONS

763
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,805
Put it down somewhere over there.

764
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,724
-Hey.
-Not there.

765
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,808
Down there. On the floor.

766
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,435
-You punk.
-There.

767
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,103
He can be slow to catch on.

768
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,855
How are things at the company?

769
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,692
Nothing gets done without you, Nak-su.

770
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,987
Can't you come back to the team?

771
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,614
I'll treat you really well.

772
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,617
I'm just so sick of being a wage slave.

773
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,243
Don't you agree, Jin-woo?

774
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,746
All this time,
I failed to see your grand vision.

775
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,247
-I apologize, sir.
-Hey!

776
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,374
Cut the crap.

777
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,209
Go get us some coffee.

778
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,169
-With my own money?
-No.

779
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,671
Just put it on my tab.

780
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,713
Get whatever you want.

781
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,298
Thank you, sir.

782
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,424
Good lord.

783
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,636
I am really sorry about last time.

784
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,305
It's fine. You were only trying
to give me good advice.

785
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,182
I apologize, Mr. Baek.

786
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,642
I'm sorry.

787
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,062
Why are you being like this? Come on.

788
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,606
Just call me by my name like you used to.

789
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,565
Do it.

790
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,403
Honey, just say it once, please.

791
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,867
Jeong-tae.

792
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:35,952
You love it.

793
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:38,705
Nak-su!

794
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,373
Hello, everyone!

795
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,875
-Who's this?
-Oh, hey.

796
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,337
So this is the life of a real man.

797
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,006
I respect you, Nak-su.

798
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,302
Ha-jin, I was out of line last time.

799
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,430
I've been reflecting on my actions.

800
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,140
I'm truly sorry.

801
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,809
Okay, just put it down over there.

802
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,269
Mr. Kim!

803
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,353
Hey!

804
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,188
-Hey, guys.
-Hello, sir.

805
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,858
We heard the good news.

806
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,611
I guess all my time spent
on real estate stuff was for nothing.

807
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,571
This is our staff.

808
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,406
You're on another level, sir.

809
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,324
Have you all eaten yet?

810
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,367
No, we haven't.

811
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,786
Take this and get whatever you want.

812
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,372
Come back here for coffee afterward.

813
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,292
Really? Then can we order

814
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,294
-the large Ttokdari combo meal?
-Hey!

815
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,087
Go to the premium beef spot right across.

816
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,631
Treat yourself to the chef's top cuts.

817
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,300
Thank you so much.

818
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,801
-Thank you.
-And congratulations.

819
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,262
-We'll be there. Please join us.
-Okay.

820
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,264
-I'll head over too.
-Sung-gu, hi.

821
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,432
What the heck?

822
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,683
What…

823
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,812
-What are you doing? Hurry up!
-Okay. Here's your coffee.

824
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,814
-All right.
-Hand them out.

825
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,608
-I'm sorry.
-Just hand them out.

826
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,401
-Here you go.
-Put them all down.

827
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,237
Here you go.

828
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,405
Sir.

829
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,282
I have some prostate issues.

830
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,159
So can I have a tomato sandwich?

831
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,703
Sure. Go ahead.

832
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,789
You're too young for that.
Must be from the stress.

833
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,540
I guess your thing is practically useless.

834
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,626
Oh my. I guess you're right.

835
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,004
Well, it's not alcohol,
but how about a toast?

836
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,547
Now…

837
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,217
All right.

838
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,053
-To Mr. Kim!
-Congratulations!

839
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,147
"Cheers"? Yeah, right.

840
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,445
Honey?

841
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,572
-Yeah, keep on dreaming.
-Honey.

842
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,618
Receiving your severance as a pension
rather than a lump sum

843
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,663
-would be better for taxes.
-Please close the account.

844
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,622
Okay.

845
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,125
I'd also like to apply
for a personal loan.

846
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,876
A personal loan?

847
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,504
Then please fill out this form.

848
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,047
All right.

849
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:56,801
OPENING SOON

850
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,386
-Really?
-I mean it.

851
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,513
-You've made an excellent choice.
-I knew it.

852
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,764
Yes, I understand.

853
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,641
I'll let you know
if a unit becomes available.

854
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,685
You have arrived at your destination.

855
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,644
Let's see!

856
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,437
TIME TAKEN: 3 MINUTES 56 SECONDS

857
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,482
Only three minutes from the station,
even if I walk slowly.

858
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,817
All right!

859
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,153
You'll be opening soon!

860
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,328
Let's see. What could that be?

861
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,747
COMMERCIAL BUILDING SALES MANAGER

862
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,126
"Final payment received. Thank you!"

863
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,092
Oh? Hello.

864
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,761
These days?

865
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,805
I'm just managing a small building.

866
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:47,101
Rent? I pull in
about ten million won a month.

867
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,728
Just a bit of pocket money.

868
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,659
MY STOCKS

869
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,369

SELL ALL

873
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,421

00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,603
"Thirty million"?

879
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,624
Dad.

880
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,710
Dad, this money--

881
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,087
You lied to me, didn't you?

882
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,385
Look at you, lying to your own father.

883
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,804
You think that's being a good son?

884
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,435
I'm sorry.

885
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,604
Do I look that incapable to you?

886
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,899
Thirty million is nothing
when my son's been scammed.

887
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,444
I would pay off three billion for you.
That's what it means to be a dad.

888
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,447
A man shouldn't be stressing
over a few million won.

889
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,492
You can't become a great man
if you're already like this, okay?

890
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
Thank you, Dad.

891
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,078
Everything's okay now, right?

892
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:30,579
Yes.

893
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,790
Good. Just think of it
as a learning experience.

894
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:37,253
You should resign as CEO of destruction,
jealousy, or whatever it's called.

895
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,422
And focus on school, okay?

896
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,799
If you don't want to,
you could join the army early.

897
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,843
While you're there, you could study hard

898
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,720
and get into a better college.

899
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,679
Okay?

900
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,265
Okay?

901
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,981
Anyway, if anything happens,
call me right away.

902
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,357
-Yes, Dad.
-Attaboy!

903
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:27,511
SICK AND TIRED OF ATTACHMENT… THOUGHTS…
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE

904
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,140
Hello?

905
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,392
Hello, sir. I hope you've been well.

906
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,228
I called because someone inquired
about signing a lease.

907
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,481
I see. What is it?

908
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,815
It's a toast shop.

909
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,276
A toast… A toast shop?

910
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,445
Sir, this could actually be
better than a cafe.

911
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,490
In this economy, people look
for the best bang for their buck.

912
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,534
But the space is so large.

913
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,162
Toast? Isn't that something only kids eat?

914
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,457
Not at all. Office workers
often have it as a meal these days.

915
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,751
They even offer whole wheat
and vegan options too.

916
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,712
But this is so different
from what you said before.

917
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,840
Then I could look for more cafes for you.

918
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,967
If immediate profit isn't your priority.

919
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,179
Dad, I'm heading out for a bit.

920
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,722
Just a moment. Hey, Su-gyeom.

921
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,350
-Yes?
-When was the last time you had toast?

922
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,185
-What?
-Toast. The kind you eat.

923
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,020
Toast? I don't know.

924
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,480
Dad, I'm in a rush.

925
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,564
Hold on.

926
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,774
Hey, Su-gyeom.

927
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,526
You just got…

928
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,319
Call me if anything happens.

929
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,987
Sorry, Dad. I'll be back soon.

930
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,615
He just got home.
Where is he going? Hello?

931
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,536
The more I think about it,
I still feel a cafe is better--

932
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,123
Sir, the thing is,
your unit is the only one that's vacant.

933
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,418
If it stays that way,
I don't know how that will look to people.

934
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,713
Sir, it's a toast shop,
but it's a major franchise.

935
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,133
And they said they'll pay
nine million in rent.

936
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,218
What about the deposit?

937
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,177
Twenty million.

938
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,348
Isn't 20 million a bit too low
for the deposit?

939
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,766
Not at all, sir.

940
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,853
The trend these days is to get
higher rent with a lower deposit.

941
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,355
What do you think?

942
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,191
It's all the same to me.
The decision is yours to make.

943
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,831
Yes, all right. Let's sign the contract.

944
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,041
Then I'll send you
the holding deposit right now

945
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,251
and have the contract ready.

946
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,545
All right. Bye.

947
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,633
Okay.

948
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,051
Not bad. Not bad at all.

949
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,595
All right.

950
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,348
Not bad. Not bad at all.

951
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,739
-Are you going to Incheon Airport?
-Yes.

952
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,948
-Please hurry.
-Okay.

953
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,246
Hello?

954
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,290
I'm sorry, Han-na. Don't go to the US.

955
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,875
What?

956
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,128
Please. Don't go.

957
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,506
I even got an investment from my dad.

958
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:13,052
Now, I've put aside
all the distracting thoughts…

959
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,471
and the kiss.

960
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,349
I got rid of them,
and I've made up my mind.

961
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,308
I choose you.

962
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,229
Thank you.

963
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,481
JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH

964
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,450
Drive safely.

965
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,123
I thought you were working part-time.
What was so urgent that you took a cab?

966
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,628
What's with the airport photo?

967
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,672
A little something I posted in advance.

968
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,840
I haven't even booked a ticket yet.

969
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,720
So what?
You don't want me to go to the US?

970
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,101
Bye.

971
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,732
Don't go.

972
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,448
I'm sorry.

973
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,659
Me too.

974
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:23,664
So, should we go grab a beer
with the money we got from the sale?

975
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,875
Let's go.

976
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,051
Okay, everyone.
We just need you to sign here, here,

977
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:39,430
and here. Okay.

978
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,561
DEPOSIT: 20 MILLION
RENT: 9 MILLION

979
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,438
Our HQ also said this is a great location.

980
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,731
That's right.

981
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,318
Thank you so much. We'll do our very best.

982
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,278
Not at all. I'm happy to have you.

983
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,863
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

984
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,241
All right, then.
Please exchange the contracts.

985
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,285
-Just sign…
-Okay.

986
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,162
-…in the same place.
-Yes.

MANGJIN PLAZA SALES OFFICE
GUARANTEED PROFIT, STABLE INVESTMENT

990
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:39,323
Have you ever
made eye contact with a seagull?

991
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,282
No.

992
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:43,452
Ever twisted your ankle dodging one?

993
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,162
Excuse me. Hello.

994
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,914
Hello. How can I help you?

995
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,750
About Mangjin Plaza over there.

996
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,127
I own the first-floor corner unit.

997
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,297
Mangjin Plaza? Yes, what about it?

998
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,841
I heard that a couple of clinics
have been confirmed to move in.

999
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,802
Do you know when they're moving in?

1000
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,179
I'm not sure about that.

1001
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,597
-Do you know?
-No.

1002
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,057
Oh, I think

1003
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,060
one of the clinics on the second floor
has already started seeing patients.

1004
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,311
Really?

1005
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,397
What kind of clinic was it?

1006
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,148
Leave your contact information here.

1007
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,401
I can help you
find a tenant for your unit.

1008
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,986
No, I've already found one.

1009
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,865
-So, yes.
-Okay.

1010
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,617
-Have a good day.
-All right.

1011
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,204
-How did he sign a lease?
-Does that make sense?

HEALTH CHECK-UP RESULTS
KIM NAK-SU

1014
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,569
BLOOD TEST
HEMOGLOBIN 15.2

1015
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,237
But if my hemoglobin is 15.2,

1016
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,114
is that high or low?

1017
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,991
How would I know?

1018
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,535
Let me… I'll explain.

1019
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,122
You're in very good health.

1020
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,416
Oh my gosh. Thank you.

1021
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,336
I told you I was fine.

1022
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,088
Cardiopulmonary function, bone density,

1023
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,799
and blood pressure are all excellent.

1024
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,135
Your cardiopulmonary function

1025
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,429
is especially excellent
for someone your age.

1026
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:30,934
I've been doing
anaerobic sprints regularly.

1027
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,812
-When?
-At the factory. I didn't tell you.

1028
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:37,441
Your liver enzymes are normal,
and so is your cholesterol.

1029
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,486
Wow, with results like these,
you should probably drink more.

1030
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:41,653
You heard that?

1031
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,782
And your reproductive functions
are also in excellent condition.

1032
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,159
Sperm count, motility, morphology…

1033
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,786
Everything is excellent.

1034
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,829
Maybe I should enter a stamina contest.

1035
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,414
Stop it.

1036
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,835
However, your stress index
is on the high side.

1037
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,962
You must be swamped at work.

1038
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,090
I recently quit my job.

1039
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,885
Then it should get better soon.

1040
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,555
Just keep exercising regularly,
and you should be fine.

1041
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:11,850
What was my biological age?

1042
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,894
Your biological age?

1043
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,649
It's 41.

1044
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,360
Forty-one! Forty-one!
I'm the king of stamina!

1045
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,195
Good lord, what?

1046
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,906
They said my biological age is 41.

1047
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,700
That means
you're living with a younger man.

1048
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,661
All right.

1049
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:34,331
So, Nak-su, find a job
while you're still healthy.

1050
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,084
-Take it from someone who's older.
-Yes, ma'am.

1051
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,460
You're creeping me out.

1052
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,714
What's with that smile?

1053
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,636
Ha-jin, let's go out for dinner later.

1054
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,679
LOAFER

1055
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,389
Why? It's a waste of money.

1056
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,224
No, I have something to tell you.

1057
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:56,228
On a day like this, we have to go

1061
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,616
It's good news, right?

Hello?

Hello. It's me, the landlord.

1085
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,408
When were you planning
to start the interior work?

1086
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:34,368
Well…

1087
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,621
I'm not sure how to say this.
I don't think I can open the shop.

1088
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,040
What? What are you talking about?

1089
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,084
We already signed the contract.

1090
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,920
Yes, I'm afraid I can't do it.
I'm very sorry.

1091
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,506
You can't just back out now--

1092
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,591
What about the deposit?

1093
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,386
Right. You don't need
to return the deposit.

1094
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,721

Sir, I'm afraid I only have
about 15 minutes.

00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,969
Would that still be okay?

1105

An IT company
is building its new HQ nearby.

1112
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,483
It's just been approved.

There are
no resale restrictions here.

1118
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,049

1119
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,800
It'll sell in a flash.

1120
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,094
You'll make 400 million won
just by sitting back.

1121
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,477
You absolutely can't tell any other owners
that you got a 550 million won discount.

1122
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,770
We'd be in huge trouble.

1123
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,107
You're the only one
who got a special discount.

1124
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,031
All the other owners paid the full price.

1125
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,683
Oh my, you're back.

1126
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,813

at the building across the street?

Oh, Mangjin Plaza.

1129
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,860
Last week, a TV station or whatever
was over there filming.

1130
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,487
People must have seen what they aired.

1131
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,405
I heard they flipped 300-million-won units

1132
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,157
for over a billion won.

1133
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,617
-Crazy.
-Jeez.

1134
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,120
Wait, you didn't pay
a billion won for it, did you?

1135
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,373
This is a prime location, and it's only
a three-minute walk from the station.

1136
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,624
How can it be 300 million?

1137
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,376
Gosh, what are you talking about?

1138
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,586
The subway construction
has been postponed for ages.

1139
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,381
It doesn't count as a station area
if there's no train running.

1140
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,049
I guess he really didn't know.

1141
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,636
I'm surprised
you managed to sign a deal.

1142
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,097

the sales office
rushed buyers into contracts

that were not actually approved

1148

1166
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,383
You end up losing yourself.

01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,304
Who are you?

Could you be…

1170
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,266
Funny how fate works, isn't it?

1171
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,768
We ended up working together again.
