THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,514
Good thing I've been exercising.

3
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,890
Let's go.

4
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,308
WOLLYONG MOUNTAIN PEAK

5
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,977
WOLLYONG MOUNTAIN

00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,068
HELP PREVENT FOREST FIRES

7
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,238
Damn it.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,587
Hello, this is Kim Nak-su,
general manager of Sales Team 1 at ACT.

9
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,672
I read your diary, sir.

10
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,632
If you could please help me out

11
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,676
and offer me
even the smallest piece of guidance,

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,053
I'll be forever in your debt.

13
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:36,888
Please help me.

14
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,016
Sir?

15
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,020
Sunday at 11:00 a.m.

16
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,480
Meet me at the peak of Wollyong Mountain.

17
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,983
Excuse me? Sir!

18
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,155
Wollyong Mountain at 11:00 a.m.?

19
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,702
Damn it.

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,414
Why couldn't we just talk on the phone?

21
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,416
Why did he make me climb all this way?

I'm sorry. It was such a hard climb.

"No burning of trash."
I'll keep that in mind.

37
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,613
My, you've certainly aged.

38
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,242

Job interview!

44
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,092
I would go meet my client
instead of going to the hospital.

45
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,346
He's crazy. He really is insane.

46
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,768
You're the one who hired me at ACT.

47
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,728
Gosh.

48
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,315
Oh my.

49
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,567
Gosh.

50
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,486
How did you let things get this bad?

51
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,614
I suppose I wasn't good enough.

52
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,577
Of course you weren't.
There's no need to explain everything.

53
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,370
Yes, sir.

00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,290

-"Environment natural…"

56
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,628
You've got about 100
to 200 million won, right?

57
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,589
-What?
-Yes or no?

58
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,799
Why would you ask that?

59
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,468
What do you mean, why?

60
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,764
So I can shove it right down
the throats of your superiors!

61
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,017
I'll handle the delivery myself
so nothing goes wrong.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,644
-Excuse me?
-I'll take about five percent.

63
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,149
Sir? I mean no disrespect,

64
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,569
but did you use such methods
to return to headquarters?

65
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,529
No, of course not!

66
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,656
Then why are you telling me--

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,120
Because I don't see
the same spark in you that I had.

68
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,371
No.

69
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,835
The thing about being
the Safety Management team leader

70
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,589
is that it may look like you're
nothing more than a useless figurehead,

71
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:02,594
but it's actually a position
where headquarters can assign you

72
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,054
all sorts of secret tasks.

73
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,475
Is that so?
I haven't been given a single one.

74
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,560
You'll find out soon enough.

75
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,064
You've come at a very lucky time.

76
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,817
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

77
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,863
It's been over ten years since I retired.

78
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:22,989
"Ten years."

79
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,868
But I still hear things
about what's going on at the company.

80
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,996
Please, just give it to me straight.

81
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,876
When headquarters gives you an assignment,

82
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,045
tackle it head-on.

83
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,300
That will be your new lifeline.

84
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,930
You're going to need this.

85
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,349
Right.

86
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,275

Let's bring Kim Nak-su back to HQ, sir.

93
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,553
What are you talking about?

94
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,598
I'm saying you can bring
Kim Nak-su back if you want.

95
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,521
What do you mean?

96
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,940
Why now? It's so sudden.

97
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,611
It's not that sudden.

98
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,698
Heo Tae-hwan quit.
That opened up some room.

99
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,201
Cut the crap.

100
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,454
Why are you suggesting this?

101
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,417
Damn it…

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,585
What?

103
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,920
It's Asan.

104
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,046
The factory? What about it?

105
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,300
It's a long story,

106
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,762
but the Asan factory
is the HR Team's biggest battle this year.

107
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,142
That's why we need Nak-su to help us out.

108
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,313
Are you sure about this?

EPISODE 6
LIFELINE

111
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,795
When headquarters gives you an assignment,

112
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,089
tackle it head-on.

113
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,801
That will be your new lifeline.

114
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,428
Nothing's happened for days.

115
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,931
Did he even know what he was saying?

116
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,018
Come here.

117
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,441
You haven't done the safety check
for four days.

118
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,785
INSPECTION RESULTS

119
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,829
Are you serious?

120
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,166
I wouldn't have a clue, even if I checked.

121
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,501
Besides,

122
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,006
you told me to keep a low profile
and leave, remember?

123
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,845
What are you, a child?

124
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,932
You got to win a race
to get some lunch in this place.

125
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,977
So, why can't I act like a child?

126
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,438
Sure you can.

127
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,733
As long as you take responsibility
like an adult

128
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,527
if an accident happens
on a day you signed off on.

129
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,447
Before you worry about accidents,

130
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,325
how about focusing on
the safety exercises,

131
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,079
which improve your flexibility
and lower the risk of injuries?

132
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,498
I'd really love to do them properly,

133
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,625
but the person demonstrating at the front

134
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,627
is just so incredibly stiff.

135
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,715
Jeez.

136
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,686
Sung-gu!

137
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,565
Hey.

138
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,785
Mr. Kim!

139
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,995
I have to meet the Production Team.

140
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,663
Okay. Call me later.

141
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,957
Okay. I'm running late.

142
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,167
Right. Go on.

143
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,503
He used to work under me at HQ.

144
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,130
I told him to send an email,

145
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,216
but he came to report to me in person.

146
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,635
Gosh. That kid has no street smarts.

147
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,761
Oh dear.

148
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,806
Where did she go?

149
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,974
I wonder if he's eaten.

150
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,119
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Okay? It's fine…

151
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,622
She's here.

152
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,457
You just stay here.

153
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,006
This car's amazing. What a smooth ride.

154
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,843
Sang-cheol, this car is amazing!

155
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,927
Oh, yes. Right.

156
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:42,392
"Of course I do.
I know you'll never pass."

157
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,768
Stop it.

158
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,813
Did you pass
the pet funeral director exam?

159
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,692
I heard the test
was especially hard this time.

160
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,861
-Here. Have some iced coffee.
-Thank you.

161
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:53,820
Well, I'm off.

162
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,114
Wait.

163
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,659
My wife was a bit rash.

164
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,080
Rash is her middle name.

165
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,500
So if you could let this go,
just this once…

166
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,130
Please reconsider this.

167
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,049
I'm so sorry.

168
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,596
What should I do, Ha-yeong?

169
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,181
Forget it.

170
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,891
This is pathetic. Just take it.

171
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,184
-Okay, fine.
-Yes.

172
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,977
-Go ahead.
-Thanks for the car.

173
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,146
Honey, please. Ha-jin!

174
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,939
Just this once. Please.

175
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,691
Come on.

176
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,984
-Hey!
-Ha-jin.

177
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,569
What's up with you?

178
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,114
-I'm sorry.
-What?

179
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,908
Again. A little louder.

180
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,916
-I'm sorry. I am.
-There you go. That's it.

181
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,585
I'll never look down on you again,
I promise.

182
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,129
So just give the car back.

183
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,381
-Fine, I get it. I'm leaving.
-Okay.

184
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,841
Wait, Ha-jin!

185
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,176
-I'm so sorry!
-Hey!

186
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,928
-Ha-jin, I'm so sorry!
-Hey!

187
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,013
Please, Ha-jin.
Can't you let it go just this once?

188
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,390
I'm really sorry. What was I thinking?

189
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,185
-Ha-jin, please just let this go! Please?
-Hey.

190
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,189
That's enough.

191
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,235
I've seen the 90-million-won performance,
so that's enough.

192
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,154
Hey, what would I even do with your car?

193
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,073
Unbelievable.

194
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,202
I'll just borrow it for the day.
Is that okay?

195
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,914
Of course. That's totally fine.

196
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,958
I'm really sorry, Ha-jin.

197
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,418
Oh gosh. I seriously love you.

198
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,421
Me too! I love you so much!

199
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,673
-What?
-I mean…

200
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,967
I'm sorry. Thank you so much.

201
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,552
And now, Ms. Park Ha-jin,

202
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,596
-the real estate agent!
-The real estate agent!

203
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,390
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

204
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,062
-I'm off, then.
-Okay.

205
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,147
You did great.

206
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,361
Sorry, but there's just one thing.

207
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,863
I have to do this

208
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,408
to get rid of this heavy feeling

209
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,702
in my heart.

210
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,954
You understand, right?

211
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,888
Here we go.

212
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,687
Wait…

213
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,943
Yes! Now this is
what a new car's all about.

214
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,239
This is so satisfying.

215
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,079
Chin strap.

216
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,131
Shouldn't this be oiled?

217
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,467
What?

218
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,887
-Mr. Kim!
-Sung-gu. Hey.

219
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,056
-I have to meet the Logistics Team.
-Really?

220
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,016
The Logistics Team…

221
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,434
Hey, that's a hazard.

222
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,604
Excuse me.
Shouldn't someone be cleaning this up?

223
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,439
-Okay, see you later.
-Okay.

224
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,398
Call me.

225
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,733
Clean it up. Quickly.

226
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,695
You shouldn't leave
things like this on the floor.

227
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,581
SAFETY MANAGEMENT TEAM

228
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,043
What's taking him so long?

229
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,296
JUNG SUNG-GU

230
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,508
"When are you coming?"

231
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,095
No, I'll just wait.

232
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,473
What's this?

233
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,356
Mr. Kim!

234
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,818
Man, this place was hard to find.
I'm sorry I'm late.

235
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,611
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

236
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,279
All done for the day?

237
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,073
Yes.

238
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,576
Right.

239
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,744
Have a seat.

240
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,913
You must be busy.
I'm not interrupting, am I?

241
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,582
No, it's fine.
I'm pretty much done for the day.

242
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,750
Oh, right!

243
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,922
I figured you might not
be eating properly without me around.

244
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,799
Oh my.

245
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,926
-Okay. Drink it.
-Gosh.

246
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,138
I should have visited you sooner.
I'm sorry about that.

247
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,932
No, you must be busy.
So, how are things at the office?

248
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,977
Well… Ik-hyeon, Song-hee, and I

249
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,147
are just doing
whatever Do Jin-woo tells us to.

250
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,442
Things aren't really settled yet.

251
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,112
They say you don't appreciate the spring
until after the flowers are gone.

252
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,990
We all say, "Things were so much better
when Mr. Kim was here."

253
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,074
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,911
I should've protected you guys
to the very end.

255
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,790
I know, right?
When are you coming back, sir?

256
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,007
How should I know?

257
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,177
I…

258
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,306
Oh, Ms. Lee.

259
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,766
Mr. Jung, say hello.

260
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,062
This is Ms. Lee Ju-young,
our factory supervisor.

261
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,689
She's our star worker.

262
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,276
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Jung Sung-gu from Sales Team 1.

263
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,362
Do you have something to report?

264
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,782
The dog's food bowl is attracting flies.

265
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,495
And the poop bag's full,
so take it out front.

266
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,830
I washed the water bowl.

267
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,873
Regardless of all this,

268
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,834
wouldn't it be better to maintain
your connection to Mr. Baek?

269
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,047
You don't have anyone else
to count on in the Sales Team, anyway.

270
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,384
Shouldn't you put in more effort
at times like this

271
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,219
to secure your career?

272
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,236
Jeez, where's my laptop?

273
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,499
Here it is.

274
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,758
JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH
KIM SU-GYEOM

275
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,843
"Kim Su-gyeom"?

276
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,682
LOAN REPAYMENT NOTICE

277
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,225
"Loan"?

278
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,937
REPAYMENT DETAILS
AS OF JULY 2025

279
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,188
TOTAL LOAN
30,000,000 WON

280
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,191
Man, I love this day-drinking culture.
It's the best.

281
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,823
Kim Su-gyeom?

282
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,285
Did you all know about this?

283
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,459
LOAN REPAYMENT NOTICE

284
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,252
It says the number is not in service.

285
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,755
-Try again.
-I've tried more than ten times.

286
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,465
Hey, he's in LA right now.

287
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,674
-What?
-What?

288
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,721
Wait, did that bastard
take out loans in our names and run?

289
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,222
I can't believe it.

290
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,600
He probably took all
our investment money, too.

291
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,769
What a complete scumbag!

292
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,229
Wait. Hold on.

293
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,232
So how much was the loan
he took out in our names?

294
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,611
Thirty million won each.

295
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,737
-Thirty million?
-Thirty?

296
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,946
Thirty million.

297
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,619
-I was going to get a new car.
-Jeez.

298
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,788
So we just have to send the money

299
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,706
to the account listed here, right?

300
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,541
I promised my girlfriend we'd go to Ibiza.

301
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,751
All right, payment sent.

302
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,877
Me too.

303
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,464
-I'll be broke for a while.
-Tell me about it.

304
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,967
Hold on.

305
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,179
You just paid the money back?

306
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,641
Yes. We should take care
of stuff like this right away.

307
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,142
So what now?

308
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,520
What do you mean, "What now?"
Let's just go back.

309
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,940
-We need to prep for school.
-Well, Korea was fun.

310
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,316
It was pretty fun.

311
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,819
Goodbye. Let's never meet again.

312
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,945
Bye.

313
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,030
Take care.

314
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,459
You're not leaving?

315
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,010
Damn it. That bastard.

316
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,014
He could have at least paid
the electricity bill before running off.

317
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,979
Lee Jeong-hwan, you son of a bitch!

318
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,456
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SIM GANG-HUN

319
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,170
-The number you have dialed is--
-Damn it, it's off again.

320
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,506
How am I supposed to get ready

321
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,300
if he's not telling me anything?

322
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,638
Damn it. He's a total fraud.

323
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,933
I should've known when he scarfed down

324
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,811
the herbal duck soup
and five whole scallion pancakes.

325
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,774
I was an idiot for believing him.

326
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,860
Darn it.

327
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,531
Jeez.

328
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,409
EMPLOYEE DORMITORY

329
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,829
Who's that?

330
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,836
What are you doing?

331
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,837
Honey!

332
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,673
What brings you here?
You didn't even call.

333
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,634
It's dangerous this late at night.

334
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,887
I came to surprise you.

335
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,347
You really surprised me.

336
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,140
And where did you get this car?

337
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,310
I…

338
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,271
won the lottery.

339
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,651
Come on, stop joking around.
Seriously, where'd you get this?

340
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,653
It's true.
I'll tell you everything inside.

341
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,489
-Wait, I have to throw this out.
-Okay.

342
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,997
Really? It's Ha-yeong's?

343
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,833
Of course.

344
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,627
Sang-cheol got her a new one.

345
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,964
You don't want to wreck
someone else's car. You should be careful.

346
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,133
Here you go.

347
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,428
Come on in!

348
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,307
Wow, what's all this stuff?
Gosh, this is heavy.

349
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,602
Okay. Here we go.

350
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,604
Let's see…

351
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,445
-You haven't had dinner, have you?
-Nope.

352
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,823
I'll make you a nice hotpot.

353
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,116
Okay.

354
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,410
-That goes up there.
-Here?

355
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,161
-Yes, the freezer.
-All right.

356
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,165
So, did Sang-cheol start his company?

357
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,458
Ages ago.

358
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,336
He's hired people
and even had an opening ceremony.

359
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,714
I see.

360
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,300
Why do you ask?

361
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,469
No reason. Can I help with anything?

362
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,931
Wow, look at you. What's the occasion?

363
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,851
Come on, we'll finish sooner if I help.
What should I do?

364
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,189
After doing housework for a few months,
you finally get it, don't you?

365
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,359
If you calculate the hourly wage
for housework, it's no joke.

366
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,694
Okay. You're right.

367
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,490
All right.

368
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,954
-Honey.
-Oh, you startled me.

369
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,372
I almost cut my hand.

370
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,582
Honey.

371
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,459
What are you doing? Stop it.

372
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,129
-You're staying the night, right?
-No, I'm going home.

373
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,297
-Don't go.
-Come on.

374
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,506
-Don't go.
-Stop it.

375
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,383
-Are you crazy?
-How about another baby?

376
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,760
Another baby?

377
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,386
-I want a daughter.
-Oh my…

378
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,888
-I really want a daughter.
-Stop it.

379
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,140
Su-gyeom isn't cute anymore.
He doesn't listen to me.

380
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,309
-Oh gosh! Seriously, stop it!
-What?

381
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:57,978
My goodness.

382
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,605
Jeez.

383
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,280
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

384
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,824
I can tell this will be awesome.

385
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,284
-All right.
-Ta-da!

386
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,286
-Oh my.
-All right.

387
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,289
Here you go.

388
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,541
Me too.

389
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,670
Here you go.

390
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,798
-Ready?
-Cheers.

391
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,840
Cheers.

392
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,386
What's that?

393
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,262
What?

394
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,681
That flyer.

395
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,849
I don't know.

396
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,020
You taped it up yourself.
What do you mean, you don't know?

397
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,189
I don't know. Why is this even here?

398
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,190
I have no idea.

399
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,153
Man, it's been so long since I had
a home-cooked meal. It looks delicious.

400
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,869
How much longer do you have to stay here?

401
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,959
Well, it's not a position
they give to just anyone.

402
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,962
I'll stay until they find
a suitable replacement, I guess.

403
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,048
So you can't go back to headquarters.

404
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,884
I told you. It's executive training.

405
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,054
-You can't go back.
-I told you, that's not it!

406
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,432
If you keep yelling at me, I'm going home.

407
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,769
Jeez.

408
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,233
Stop denying everything
and explain it to me.

409
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,194
I need to understand
what's going on, don't I?

410
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,219
What are you going to do?

411
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,763
What is there to do?

412
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,475
Are you going to stick it out,
or are you going to quit?

413
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,894
There's still a chance I'll go back.

414
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,187
Okay, fine.

415
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,939
But what if you can't?

416
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,484
Oh, come on.

417
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,280
Don't quit out of anger.

418
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,534
I know it's selfish of me to ask,
but please don't.

419
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,953
We need a plan for the next few years.

420
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,372
And you know all about our loan.

421
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,751
Su-gyeom's a freshman now.
He may pay for his own wedding,

422
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,088
but we have to see him through graduation.

423
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,218
Don't be tempted by the severance pay,
and just hang in there a little longer.

424
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,638
I…

425
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,934
I can help now.

426
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,520
What do you mean?

427
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,818
This wasn't how I wanted to tell you.

428
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,903
What is it? Tell me.

429
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,742
I passed the real estate license exam.

430
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,244
What?

431
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,622
I studied for it without you knowing,
and I passed.

432
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,292
I can't believe you.

433
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,336
What do you take me for?

434
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,588
What are you talking about?

435
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,007
I don't think of you as some superhero

436
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,634
or MacGyver.

437
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,680
I saw you as the Kim Nak-su I know
and made my decision.

438
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,270
I mean…

439
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:31,150
You think earning money
is as easy as it sounds?

440
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,987
Do you think I…

441
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,742
No, I just…
I really don't want you to do this.

442
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,413
Darn it.

443
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,667
You should go.

444
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,809
She really passed
the real estate license exam?

445
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,486
If I get fired…

446
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,657
and she's the only one working…

447
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,285
An excellent choice.

448
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,287
Once you deposit the down payment,

449
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,789
-we'll proceed…
-Gosh.

450
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,499
-…with the contract.
-That's right.

451
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,834
Hey!

452
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:13,961
What are you doing?

453
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,337
Go!

454
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,674
Yes.

455
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,175
Your ID card and…

456
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,678
Please, stop.
You're making me uncomfortable.

457
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,804
-Sang-cheol!
-Let go of me.

458
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,055
Sang-cheol!

459
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,108
The deposit, contract fee,
and installments.

460
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,859
The payments are quite manageable.

461
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,745
Who was that guy?

462
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,748
He's just someone I met for work.
Just stop bothering me.

463
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,375
You really met for work, right?

464
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,876
Right?

465
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,003
Gosh.

466
00:29:56,837 --> 00:30:00,132
-Just don't drink with him.
-Just clean up the house!

467
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,823
Honey.

468
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,745
Honey.

469
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,456
Honey.

470
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,302
Honey…

471
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,803
No!

472
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,604
This isn't right!

473
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,404
He was quiet for a while.
Why is he at it again?

474
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,241
Just leave him be.

475
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,577
Imagine how tormented he must be.

476
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,087
Kim Nak-su!

477
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,839
Who is he?

478
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,925
I'm a general manager.

479
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,011
I rose through the ranks
without skipping a single promotion.

480
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,640
I'm a public recruit from
a prestigious university. Elite of elites.

481
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,643
I'm 99.9 percent sure
I'll be an executive next year.

482
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,644
Got that?

483
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,146
The dog's food bowl
is attracting flies.

484
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,108
And the poop bag's full,
so take it out front.

485
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,119
I bought an apartment in Seoul

486
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,537
with my own money!

487
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,998
And I sent my son to college!

488
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,084
I've worked at a major corporation

489
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,502
for 25 years

490
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,422
as a general manager!

491
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,257
You assholes!

492
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,317
Darn it!

493
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,452
Why are you doing this to me?

494
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,959
What is all this?

495
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,932
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

496
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,730
Kim Nak-su.

497
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,815
Yes, sir.

498
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,568
Hey, why is it so noisy?
Can you hear me?

499
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,820
Yes, I can hear you.

500
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,823
You've been bad-mouthing me,
haven't you?

501
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,493
No, of course not.

502
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,121
I know things are tough.

503
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,374
I hope you're eating well, sir.

504
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,140
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

505
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,976
Two, two, three, four.

506
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,646
Five, six, seven, eight.

507
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,023
Two, two, three, four.

508
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,484
Five.

509
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,202
-So? Can you see it?
-Yes, sir.

510
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,788
-Okay, shoot.
-Yes, sir.

511
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,582
Three.

512
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,544
One, two, three.

513
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,850
Gosh.

514
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,023
I have to go to headquarters later.

515
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,068
I didn't ask.

516
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,947
Managing safety,
reporting to headquarters…

517
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,909
I'm so busy. Gosh.

518
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,579
RECEPTION, PAYMENT

519
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,381
FIVE SAFETY RULES
SAFETY EXERCISES, LOGISTICS CHECK

520
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,801
SAFETY CHECKLIST
FACTORY SAFETY CHECK

521
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,236
Hello, Jeong-tae. It's me, Kim Nak-su.

522
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,157
Are we still on for dinner tonight?

523
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,868
Yes, I already sent you the address.

524
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,411
Why? Did something come up?

525
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,247
No. I was just calling to confirm.

526
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,292
-All right, see you then.
-Oh, there's one more thing.

527
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,836
The Logistics or Production Team here

528
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,464
asked me for some materials
for a training session.

529
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,842
I'll send them to you later,
so could you give me some feedback?

530
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,054
It's just that I feel
like I've lost my touch lately.

531
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,430
So I'm not sure how I did.

532
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,767
I know nothing about that stuff.
Would my opinion even matter?

533
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,603
It's fine.
Could you just take a quick look?

534
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,021
I'll send them to you later.

535
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,731
All right, fine.

536
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,859
I'll see you later then. Thank you.

537
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,661
You can do this, Kim Nak-su.

538
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,750
Does anyone have plans this evening?

539
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,255
It's fine. You can tell me.

540
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,882
We don't have any plans.

541
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,967
We're free too.

542
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,554
Then how about
a Sales Team dinner tonight?

543
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,057
-I'd love that! A team dinner!
-That's great.

544
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,058
Sure.

545
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,185
Should I book
that craft beer place you like?

546
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,145
That place is nice, too, but Ms. Kwon…

547
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:30,897
Yes, sir?

548
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,234
Let's go to that spot your team
used to go to. I want to try it.

549
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,820
All right.

550
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,030
I'll meet you there
after my client meeting,

551
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,073
so send me the address.

552
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,783
-Yes, sir.
-See you all there.

553
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,910
-We'll see you later.
-See you later, sir.

554
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,745
-See you later.
-We'll see you later, sir.

555
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,269
What are you doing?

556
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,860
I have to sell this
to at least pay off the interest.

557
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,239
SELLING COFFEE MACHINE
CONTACT ME

558
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,991
Hey, what is this?

559
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,868
Would you buy this
if you saw this posting?

560
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,163
Then what? What should I do?

561
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,875
It's this one, right?

562
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,834
Yes.

563
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,225
EDIT USED ITEM POST

564
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,518
LESS THAN A YEAR OLD

565
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,648
How do you come up with
these words so easily?

566
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,026
I'm simply listing the facts.

567
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,615
Adding useless details to a listing
just makes you seem untrustworthy.

568
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,705
Is there anything else we can sell?

569
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,500
"Professional high-end speakers."

570
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,752
A turntable and Bluetooth.

571
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,714
"A simple mid-century vibe…"

572
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,051
"Mid-century"? What kind of vibe is that?

573
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,137
Mid-century.

574
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,936
If you also get the desk,
I'll give you both for 300,000 won.

575
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,355
-How about 250?
-280.

576
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,732
-Then 260.
-280.

577
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,817
Fine, 270!

578
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,363
How about 275?

579
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,949
That's our final offer.

580
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,495
All right! We made some money!

581
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,539
Shipping from a convenience store
is fine too.

582
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,748
I made sure it's well-packed.

583
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,583
Okay.

584
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,796
-Let's go to the convenience store.
-Let's go.

585
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,223
Thank you.

586
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,933
-Take care.
-Thank you.

587
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,563
JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH

588
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,147
Man, I'm starving.

589
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,858
Aren't you hungry?

590
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,442
I am too.

591
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,527
Let's go.

592
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,614
I'll get the BLT.

593
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,574
Yes.

594
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,367
Let's eat!

595
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,747
They say,
"Those who don't work, don't eat."

596
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:38,334
It must mean that food tastes better
once you've worked for it.

597
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,003
This bagel is so good.

598
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,921
Should we get one more and split it?

599
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,174
Let's just get another one each.

600
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,843
We earned 3.8 million won today.

601
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,761
-Yeah, let's order more.
-Let's do it.

602
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,891
We make a good team, don't we?

603
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,022
Han-na, since we're on a roll,

604
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,984
why don't we get some stock
and start selling for real?

605
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,736
But with what money?

606
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,030
I'm 30 million won in debt.

607
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,034
I'll look for an investor.

608
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,292
All right.

609
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,343
Let's get going.

610
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,146
Okay.

611
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,573
All right.

612
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,706
Let's do this.

613
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,030
I hope you are
in excellent health and spirits, sir.

614
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,992
Your humble subordinate, Kim Nak-su,
is here to greet you.

615
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,163
What are you doing, man? Get in here.

616
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,293
Here's a hangover drink, Jeong-tae.

617
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,503
My gosh.

618
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,755
And an interdental brush
for after our meal.

619
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,048
Thanks.

620
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,136
All right.

621
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,471
Oh, thank you.

622
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,602
Thank you.

623
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,396
-Enjoy your meal.
-Yes, thank you.

624
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,400
Here, sir. Some radish sprouts.

625
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,695
Enjoy your meal, sir.

626
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:12,905
Are you paying?

627
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,991
Thank you for the meal.

628
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,162
-Eat up.
-Yes. Right.

629
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,956
Jeong-tae.

630
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,544
I've learned a great deal
while working at the factory.

631
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,797
It made me feel
like I wasted my time at the company.

632
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,009
And that I failed to properly
communicate with my team members.

633
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,304
In fact, I'm truly grateful
that you sent me there.

634
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,932
If I hadn't gone to Asan,
I don't think I ever would have known.

635
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,559
Thank you, sir.

636
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,688
-That's a relief.
-Yes, sir.

637
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,194
Oh, wait. Allow me.

638
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,737
Here.

639
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,573
-Let me pour you one.
-Yes, sir.

640
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,744
Thank you.

641
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,124
Since it's been a while…

642
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,167
Jeez.

643
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,633
-Sir!
-Over here!

644
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,551
Thank you.

645
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:19,138
All right. We're not here
to just get wasted all night.

646
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,890
Let's eat for an hour
and then head home.

647
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,391
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

648
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,351
Let's dig in.

649
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,894
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy.

650
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:25,978
Enjoy your meal, sir.

651
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,816
This feels like a company dinner
from an old K-drama.

652
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,317
You think so?

653
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,277
Well, Mr. Kim is pretty old-fashioned.

654
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,487
This vibe fits him perfectly.

655
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,948
True. The age gap
between him and Mr. Do is…

656
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,491
Hey, we're out of drinks.

657
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,701
Where are they?

658
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,205
I'll go get some more.

659
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,043
I had kimchi stew here
a few times for lunch.

660
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,504
-But it tastes different at night.
-Yes.

661
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,091
They use a different broth for the stew
at lunch and dinner.

662
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,969
They use rice water for lunch
and a meat broth for dinner.

663
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,929
They say it's because
having oily broth at lunch

664
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,347
can give you indigestion at work.

665
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,224
I see. So they switch it up.

666
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,101
Wow, I can't believe you noticed.

667
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,811
You're like that too, Sung-gu.

668
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,939
-Pardon?
-I'm saying you're flexible.

669
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,315
Both you and the owner here.

670
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,570
Yes. I am pretty flexible.

671
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,865
Bottle opener.

672
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,449
-An opener?
-Yeah.

673
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,201
Didn't you bring one earlier?

674
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,913
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay. I'll get it.

675
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,915
Would you? It's over there inside.

676
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,209
By the way, is Mr. Kim doing okay?

677
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,004
Which Mr. Kim, sir?

678
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,172
Mr. Kim Nak-su.

679
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,507
You went to the Asan factory, didn't you?

680
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:37,758
Yes.

681
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:41,512
I lost at rock, paper, scissors,
so I had no choice!

682
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,015
I bet you lost on purpose.
You're a very caring person.

683
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,976
Oh no. Not at all, sir.

684
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,687
-So this is why he gathered us here.
-Exactly.

685
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,273
Anyway, it was a business trip,
so I was running around.

686
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,026
I didn't even have time
for a smoke with Mr. Kim.

687
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,819
Still, you should treat him well.

688
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,238
You might end up working for him again.

689
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,824
I'm not sure that would happen.

690
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,660
You never know.
Things are always changing.

691
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,123
If he comes back,
I'll welcome him with open arms.

692
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,583
I still have a lot to learn.

693
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,004
-Okay, fill your glasses. Let's drink.
-Yes, of course.

694
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,882
-Fill your glasses, everyone!
-Okay.

695
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,425
Allow me, sir.

696
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,679
I'm a very lucky leader
to have such excellent team members.

697
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,680
All right, Sales Team!

698
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,182
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

699
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,601
Let's do this.

700
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,187
Oh my.

701
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:32,980
There's more?

702
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,815
My goodness.

703
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,694
Gosh, I'm full.
I'm not sure I can eat more.

704
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,281
It's shrimp. Your favorite.
I'm sure you have room for more.

705
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,664
Jeong-tae,

706
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,291
did you get a chance
to look at what I sent you?

707
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,292
Yes.

708
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,044
I saw it.

709
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:59,006
Well, I threw it together in a hurry.
What did you think?

710
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,633
It was good.

711
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,843
Ever since you were a new hire,

712
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,845
your reports have always been neat.

713
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:05,888
Oh, well…

714
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,224
I wasn't looking for a compliment.

715
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,185
Please let me know
if I should revise anything.

716
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,233
Are you serious?

717
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,485
Yes, of course.

718
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,617
What are you trying to tell me
with that report?

719
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,036
Pardon?

720
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,163
You wrote it for me.

721
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,623
Didn't you?

722
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,711
I told you already.

723
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,254
It's for training at the factory.

724
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:42,425
It's about how stability
has a positive impact on productivity--

725
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,886
Right. So what?

726
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,723
What are you suggesting we do?

727
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,644
To create
a flatter organizational culture--

728
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,147
Is creating
a flatter organizational culture

729
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,024
your job at the factory?

730
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:06,073
To be honest, I don't understand
what that report is for

731
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,118
or what you're trying to say with it.

732
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,911
I have absolutely no idea.

733
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,749
It's neatly organized,
but there's no substance.

734
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,833
Well…

735
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,544
I still have a lot to learn, sir.

736
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,671
I'll take it to heart. I apologize.

737
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,133
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

738
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,469
I think that report

739
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,472
says a lot about you.

740
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:32,725
You punk.

741
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,604
What you're doing isn't work.

742
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,322
If what I'm doing isn't work,

743
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,574
then what exactly am I doing?

744
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,409
You're just going through the motions.

745
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,913
Work is about responsibility.

746
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,791
But you're not taking
any responsibility at all.

747
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,294
No. You don't even know how.

748
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,924
I was sent all the way to the factory,

749
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,301
and I don't know
how to take responsibility?

750
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,808
You really haven't changed one bit.

751
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:19,188
You were always
a really great team member,

752
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,107
but in the end,

753
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,527
I guess you just couldn't be
a good leader.

754
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,749
-Nak-su.
-Wait, Jeong-tae.

755
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,712
Did you call me all the way out here
just to say things like that?

756
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:47,633
I'm only saying this because I care,
and I'm worried about you.

757
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,510
Because you care and are worried about me?

758
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:56,100
Right. Anyway, the reason
I called you here today--

759
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,309
No.

760
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,187
Do you even have the right
to worry about me?

761
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,439
What?

762
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,983
You were the one
who drove me into this hell.

763
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,486
I mean, what kind of perpetrator
worries about their victim?

764
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,947
-Nak-su, you really--
-I'm not working?

765
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,533
Then what the hell have I been doing
for the past 25 years?

766
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,493
You really just don't get it, do you?

767
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,370
You're right. I guess I don't.

768
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,123
That's why I'm cleaning up dog poop
in some factory at my age.

769
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,333
Right. That's the perfect job
for you, punk.

770
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,669
I was going through the motions?

771
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,339
Then what about washing
your underwear and socks?

772
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,591
Does that not count as work?

773
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,758
What are you talking about?

774
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:32,136
If you ask your teammates
to do that now, you'd get sued.

775
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,013
When did I ask you to wash my underwear?

776
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,182
Go ahead and sue me then!

777
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,893
You never worked
with the younger staff. But I did.

778
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,437
I was stuck between you and the others,

779
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,397
trying to please both sides!

780
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,984
That's how I got you this far!
And this is what you say to me?

781
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,861
What about you, then?

782
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,113
Who do you think helped you keep your job?

783
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,364
Are you saying it's you?

784
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,701
Of course it is, you idiot!
You could've been fired straight away!

785
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,162
I'm the one who fought like hell
to defend you!

786
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,999
The Asan transfer was the end of it
because of me! Got that?

787
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,222
You jerk.

788
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,808
So that's what happened. I had no idea.

789
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,603
I really had no idea at all.

790
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,316
I thought it was because Do Jin-woo
is more useful to you than I am.

791
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,361
And since I know all of your shady past,

792
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,072
you felt uneasy having me around.

793
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,950
So I thought you seized the chance
to finally cut me loose.

794
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,910
But that was your grand plan.

795
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,370
Wow!

796
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,872
Brilliant, Baek Jeong-tae.

797
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,708
You asshole.

798
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,418
What, you think you're a good leader?

799
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,921
You toss aside your junior,
who washed your underwear

800
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:49,964
and cleaned up your mess,

801
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,508
then pretend to be all generous.
Is that a good leader?

802
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,385
You son of a bitch.

803
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,430
The worst thing that happened to me

804
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,767
was having you as my senior.

805
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,145
When you get fired someday,
I'll say the same thing to you.

806
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,941
"I think you were just going through
the motions as an executive."

807
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,110
You son of a bitch. How dare you!

808
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,152
-What?
-You asshole!

809
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,071
After everything I did for you,
how could you?

810
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,240
I didn't do any work? Me?

811
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,701
-Hey!
-You son of a bitch.

812
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,827
Going through the motions?

813
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,829
-Did you work, then?
-How can you say that?

814
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,581
You were always out playing fucking golf!

815
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,125
-Hey! After everything I've done for you!
-Damn it!

816
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,627
You of all people can't do this to me,
you bastard!

817
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,045
Why can't I? You bastard!

818
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,131
-"Bastard"?
-You're worse than…

819
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,176
-What's going on here?
-You really are…

820
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,184
I really messed up.

821
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,145
But I feel strangely calm,

822
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,105
and my head is clear.

823
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,650
Is it because

824
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,695
the uncertainty is gone,
regardless of the outcome?

825
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,449
Ha-jin, I'm sorry.

826
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,953
I guess this is it for me.

827
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,838
They say it's really delicious.

828
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,341
Hello.

829
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,136
I need to put on more sunscreen.

830
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,221
I brought some.

831
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,889
-Hey.
-Hello.

832
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,391
-Hello.
-Hello.

833
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,103
-Let's go!
-Let's do this.

834
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,313
-All right. Let's go.
-Let's go!

835
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,940
Everybody, shake it

836
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,650
-Shake to the left!
-Shake to the left!

837
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,069
-Shake to the right, up and down
-Shake it

838
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,423
It must be urgent
for him to come on the weekend.

839
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,097
-Hello, sir.
-You could've just called.

840
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,892
Oh my…

841
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,437
It looks like you've been through a lot.

842
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,773
Well, let's head inside.

843
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,275
Sure.

844
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,029
Wow, it's been a while.

845
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,490
This place has really changed.

846
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,660
You could've just called.
Why come all the way out here?

847
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:07,870
On a weekend, no less.

848
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,831
I didn't want to come, either.

849
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,625
Mr. Kim.

850
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:14,877
Yes?

851
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,046
You should have heard Baek Jeong-tae out.

852
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,718
I told him I'd tell you,

853
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,888
but he insisted on doing it himself
and set up that meeting.

854
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,807
But you two didn't even get
to the main point.

855
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,267
My gosh.

856
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,604
So what was the main point?

857
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:37,983
Right.

858
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,611
Let me explain.

859
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:45,532
ACT has decided to downsize its workforce.

860
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,370
That goes for the staff
at headquarters, of course.

861
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:54,541
And the Asan factory
also needs to be restructured.

862
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,585
So, about that…

863
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,257
We need your help, sir.

864
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,179
-Me?
-Yes.

865
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,600
I'm just on the Safety Management Team.

866
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,187
The HR Team here

867
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,774
is in cahoots with the Production Team,
so they won't listen to us.

868
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,193
The only person
I can ask for help with this

869
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,487
is you, sir.

870
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,739
What am I supposed to do, exactly?

871
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:29,201
Well, if safety management violations
start to accumulate,

872
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,079
we can use that as grounds
to pressure them to resign.

873
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,207
It's a method we've used here before.

874
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,291
Sir.

875
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:39,670
Just 20 people.

876
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,173
Please draw up a list by next week.

877
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:49,179
When headquarters gives you an assignment,

878
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,890
tackle it head-on.

879
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,269
If this goes well,

880
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,187
you won't need Baek Jeong-tae.

881
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,106
I'll make sure you get back to HQ.

882
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,692
It must've been tough
sucking up to Baek Jeong-tae.

883
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,068
No?

884
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,028
Use this opportunity
to get on my good side.

885
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,497
Oh, and…

886
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,836
Here, Mr. Kim.

887
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,676
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT PROGRAM

888
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,931
Don't get the wrong idea.
The notice will be up on Monday.

889
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,893
I'm just giving this to you now,
so you can look it over.

890
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,271
Well, I can't help it
even if you take it the wrong way.

891
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,108
I'll get going now, sir.

892
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,526
Take care.

893
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,778
Make sure you read it carefully.

894
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,870
Hello.

895
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,081
Hello.

896
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,999
-Hello.
-Hello.

897
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,210
Good morning.

898
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,012

Five, six.

904
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,113
Do it properly.

905
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,616
Three, four, five, six,

906
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,201
seven, eight.

907

00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,588
One, two.

910
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,883
Do the safety exercises properly.

911
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,885

919
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:26,855
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

920
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,679
A ladder with no work platform
is a safety rule violation.

921
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,598
I said to clean up!

922
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,769
I've been hearing whispers
about Mr. Kim coming back.

923
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,187
Why would Mr. Kim make that list?

924
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,146
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT

925
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,357
You've never given a damn
about the factory.

926
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,692
-What's with the sudden change?
-I'm just doing my job.

927
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,152
SAFETY VIOLATIONS

928
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,196
Would writing up that list
bring him back to HQ?

929
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,198
You might as well be the errand boy.

930
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,995
-What else would you do?
-You little bastard.

931
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,285
Let's do some work.
Leave if you don't want to.

932
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,495
Hello, Mr. Kim.

933
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,414
And try to hang on to your job
for as long as you can.

934
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,916
That's what being a parent is.

935
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,210
Come to headquarters
and bring your report.

936
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,711
You call this "work"?

937
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,755
And no matter how I look at it…

938
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,842
it doesn't feel like work.

939
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,927
