THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,716
Sir, are you okay?

3
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,177
Are you alive?

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,516
Mister.

5
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,561
Are you okay?

6
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,355
Mister? Hey!

7
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,066
Yes, I'm okay.

8
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,859
Gosh.

9
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,236
Jeez.

10
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,906
Damn it, my car is completely wrecked.

11
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,617
Oh my God. Damn it.

12
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,663
Where the hell is my phone?

13
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,458
HA-JIN

14
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,712
You're getting a call
from someone named Ha-jin.

15
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,298
Give it to me.

16
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,591
Goodness. Hello?

17
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,050
Hi, honey.

18
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,595
Hello, there's been an accident.

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,346
Who is this?

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,308
He was driving my car for me.

21
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,394
Your husband
is my designated driver.

22
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,483
Honey, it's me.

23
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,443
Honey.

24
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,924
Aren't you coming up?

25
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,425
I am.

26
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,928
-Then why aren't you getting out?
-I'll be right up.

27
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,555
Hurry up.

28
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,578
Why is she taking so long?

29
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,166
Why are you standing there? Go to bed.

30
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,418
Dad?

31
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,877
What is it?

32
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,964
Why are you working
as a designated driver?

33
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,842
For no reason. Is there a problem?

34
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,802
I love to drive.

35
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,389
Is it because of me?

36
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,976
Don't say things like that.

37
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,103
Gosh, son.

38
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,896
You've grown so much.

39
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,732
When did you get so big?

40
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,401
Mom's here.

41
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,404
I'm sorry for all the chaos this morning.

42
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,239
You must not have gotten any sleep.

43
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,908
Let's go to bed.

44
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,369
Su-gyeom, go to your room.

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,964
Honey, let's just go get some sleep.

46
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,596
Let's go.

47
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,473
Where?

48
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,849
To see a psychiatrist.

49
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:28,935
Gosh.

50
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,939
You heard what the ER doctor said earlier.
Let's just go and hear them out.

51
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,567
The test results said nothing was wrong.

52
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,985
Doctors just spout nonsense--

53
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,155
So you still don't trust doctors?
Fine, I get it.

54
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,991
Su-gyeom, close the door.

55
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,246
Then will you listen to me?

56
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,753
There's so much
that I don't understand right now.

57
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,131
I don't want to feel like
I'm solving a mystery in my own home.

58
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,132
It feels horrible.

59
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,804
So forget what the doctor said
and listen to me.

60
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,389
Go see a psychiatrist.

61
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,017
-I'm not going.
-Yes, you are.

62
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,853
If I say I'm fine, then I'm fine.

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,155
GO STRAIGHT FOR 8 KM

64
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,910
Hello?

65
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,084
You son of a bitch.
Why are you so full of yourself?

66
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,379
Who do you think you are? You egomaniac.

67
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,049
What are you looking at?

68
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,551
You should be looking ahead.

69
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,427
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,930
Shut up, you bastard!

71
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,685
Don't just go through the motions.

72
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,104
Do some actual work.
Who do you think you are?

73
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,774
Hey! I said look ahead.

74
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,442
Rerouting.

75
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,735
Hang up, you bastard!

76
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,198
Are you sure this is your destination?
This place is…

77
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,118
the commercial property I bought.

78
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,495
Sir, why are we going here?

79
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,502
So you've buried us
under a mountain of debt

80
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,254
for the rest of our lives.

81
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,636
You must have life insurance, right?

82
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,556
In that case,

83
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,641
wouldn't this be better?

84
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,851
What do you think?

85
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,493
Dad, time for breakfast.

86
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,496
Dad?

87
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,707
Dad!

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,336
Mom! Dad is…

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,837
Dad, are you okay?

90
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,214
-I can't breathe.
-What is it?

91
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,549
-Honey.
-I can't…

92
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,384
What's happening?

93
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,053
-Honey.
-The phone. 911!

94
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,096
-I can't breathe.
-You can't breathe?

95
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,599
-I think I need to go to the hospital.
-Okay. Su-gyeom!

96
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,808
Where did my phone go?

97
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:14,976
-To the hospital, now.
-Okay.

98
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,937
-No.
-Help him up. We'll take him.

99
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,939
Here we go.

100
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,899
My God, look at all this sweat.

101
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,025
-Mom, hold on.
-Okay.

102
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,866
Hey. Honey.

103
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,371
I don't think I need to go.

104
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,499
What?

105
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,043
I'm feeling better now. Let's go back up.

106
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,005
You have to go to work.
And you have class soon. Right?

107
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,674
What?

108
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,550
I'm fine. Let's go back up.

109
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,264
Why are you being like this?
I told you I'm fine.

110
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,725
I'm telling you, I'm perfectly fine.

111
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,105
Perfectly fine?

112
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,609
Yes, I just need to get some sleep
and relieve some stress.

113
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,319
Let's go up.

114
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,279
Come to your senses, Kim Nak-su!

115
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,699
Do you think this is normal?

116
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,326
Is this how a rational person would act?

117
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,788
What's wrong with you?
Don't you even think about your family?

118
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,667
You almost died!

119
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,586
You really need to see a psychiatrist.

120
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,424
No person in their right mind
would ever act like this.

121
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,550
Come on.

122
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,593
Let's go.

123
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,887
Okay, I'll go.

124
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,472
-All right.
-Come on.

125
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,184
No, you stay here.
I'll go with your mom, okay?

126
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,145
Go to class.

127
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,991
Why are there so many people here?

128
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,619
PARKING FULL
PLEASE WAIT

129
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,008
Let's hurry. Come on.

130
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,848
EUIKANG GENERAL HOSPITAL

131
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,252
Let's go back to the car.

132
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,754
What's wrong?

133
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,302
Look at you. Look at the state you're in.

134
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,762
How have you been--

135
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,722
Just take me somewhere else. I'm fine.

136
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,852
Not a general hospital.
Let's go to a clinic with fewer people.

137
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,022
Why is this place closed today?

138
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,482
Jeez.

139
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,235
Stop by the second floor.

140
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,820
We can have a chat.

141
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,488
Gosh.

142
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,198
Wait. If that's the case…

143
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,912
MANGJIN PLAZA

144
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,914
START NAVIGATION

145
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,082
Let's go here.

146
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,126
Do you know this place?

147
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,585
EPISODE 10
PATIENT IN UNIT 102

148
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,087
Just drive. Let's go.

149
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,889
Excuse me, when will the doctor be in?

150
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,059
I'm not sure.
His schedule is completely open today.

151
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,186
He must be
taking his time with lunch.

152
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,356
Please fill out the form first.

153
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,152
This place doesn't feel right.

154
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,779
Let's just get it done.

155
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,198
PANIC DISORDER SYMPTOM CHECKLIST

156
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,533
…EXPERIENCED ANXIETY OR FEAR?
NO

157
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,076
ATTACKS START AND PEAK WITHIN MINUTES

158
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,411
Well, this one…

159
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,620
NO

160
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,125
…CHANGED BEHAVIOR TO AVOID ATTACKS
NO

161
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,627
Answer it honestly.

162
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,837
I am being honest.

163
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,298
Nope, and nope.

164
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,340
I'm back.

165
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,551
Did you have
a five-course meal?

166
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,677
What took you so long?

167
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,220
Sangyang Diner went out of business.

168
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,680
Really?

169
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,891
So I had to go all the way out there to…

170
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,814
Look who's here. The owner of--

171
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,024
Yes, let's go in.

172
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,901
Doctor, you have to see me.

173
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,819
Sir, take the form with you.

174
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,112
Please give it to me.

175
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,283
-The checklist.
-Right.

176
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,951
You can go on in now.

177
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,752
Would you like some tea?

178
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,754
No, thank you.

179
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,964
All right. Please have a seat.

180
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,642
Just for ten minutes, then I'll leave.

181
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,021
So your wife still doesn't know.

182
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,023
About what?

183
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,234
About the first-floor property you bought.

184
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,280
I know what needs to be done.

185
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,658
Talk it over with her soon
and find a solution together.

186
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,117
And take your medicine.

187
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,953
What kind of medicine?

188
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,080
For your panic disorder, of course.

189
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,958
I'm prescribing two types.
The first is an anti-anxiety medication.

190
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,627
Take it when you feel an attack coming
or have trouble breathing.

191
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,545
The other one is an antidepressant--

192
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,880
Hey.

193
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,549
You didn't even look at the checklist.

194
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,678
You didn't even examine me.
How can you say I have panic disorder?

195
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,720
What a fraud.

196
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,056
I've already witnessed
your symptoms myself.

197
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,391
When?

198
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,644
Okay.

199
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,939
Why? What is it?

200
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,400
Please come over here.

201
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,110
What's this about?

202
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,321
All right.

203
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,240
You were walking from over there.

204
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,288
Then you found it
harder and harder to breathe.

205
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,708
You clutched your chest and collapsed
right in front of this building,

206
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,293
Mr. Kim Nak-su.

207
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,548
I was the one who helped you.

208
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,134
-Are you okay?
-Excuse me.

209
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,802
I'm a doctor. Please step aside.

210
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,721
Sir, look at me.

211
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,393
I want you to breathe into this.

212
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,103
Take a deep belly breath.

213
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,440
Keep going.

214
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,986
Yes, I'm in front of Mangjin Plaza.

215
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,071
Someone has collapsed here.

216
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,491
With no patients around,

217
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,452
I'd been staring out the window.

218
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,288
I was just doing my job.

219
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,832
So no need to thank me.

220
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,668
BOARD CERTIFICATION

221
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,337
I was ranked second upon admission

222
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,629
and graduated as valedictorian.

223
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,256
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION
PSYCHIATRY

224
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,550
I didn't ask.

225
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,720
Anyway.

226
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,724
I will give you my professional opinion
as a psychiatrist.

227
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,142
You have panic disorder.

228
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,732
You have panic disorder.

229
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,027
Jeez.

230
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:23,988
All right.

231
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,491
Let's call it a condition.

232
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,118
A cold, stomach flu, muscle aches,

233
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,454
and panic disorder. It's just a condition.

234
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,208
So I just have to change my mindset,

235
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,752
think positive, go stay at a temple,

236
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,545
work out, and I'll get better?

237
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,382
No, it cannot be cured
by willpower alone.

238
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,009
Then what am I supposed to do
to get better?

239
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,638
Well, let's take our time
and have a cup of tea.

240
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,932
Is it a cure for panic disorder?

241
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,309
No, there's no such thing.

242
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,519
Then I won't have any.

243
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,648
Okay.

244
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,735
Medication, cognitive behavioral therapy,
and breathing exercises.

245
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,279
Panic disorder treatment
should be approached step-by--

246
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,115
I don't have time for that right now.

247
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,449
You know that.

248
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,201
I have to manage that damn unit.

249
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,662
I don't have the luxury
to do that right now.

250
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,373
-What kind of managing are you doing?
-I have to clean it every day

251
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,500
to get it ready for potential tenants.

252
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,253
If you slap on a sign that says
"first three months free,"

253
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,213
do you think a tenant will just show up?

254
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,802
Then why did you move in here?

255
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,804
Just how much is the rent?

256
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,517
-I don't pay rent.
-What?

257
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,937
Weren't you tempted by the promise
of a franchise cafe moving in?

258
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,356
-Yes.
-"A commercial area like Gangnam Station."

259
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,444
"A three-minute walk from the station."
"The director will cut you a great deal."

260
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,321
-Right.
-And when you said yes,

261
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,824
he told you to discuss it
with your family and come back.

262
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,825
Yes.

263
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,119
Those slick tablet taps
and speedy calculator moves

264
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,455
probably mesmerized you.

265
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,373
Don't tell me you…

266
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,709
Yes.

267
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,756
I was also one of the first people
to buy a unit in this building.

268
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,010
Damn it.

269
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,804
Jeez.

270
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,810
Let's go.

271
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,020
Hurry.

272
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,438
Excuse me. I need to pay.

273
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,064
Please get your prescription too.

274
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,024
-Okay.
-All right.

275
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,906
MANGJIN PLAZA

276
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,450
You insisted on coming to this clinic.

277
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,618
What's wrong?

278
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,702
Look, honey.

279
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,497
A doctor should at least be
smarter than me, right?

280
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,957
-Yes.
-So I can trust him with my treatment.

281
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,250
And?

282
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,170
I think we're on
the same level of stupidity.

283
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,296
I can't trust that guy.

284
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,591
What on earth did you two talk about?

285
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,051
Sir!

286
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,010
Sir!

287
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,097
-Sir!
-Gosh, let's go.

288
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,683
-Is she calling you? She's--
-Where are you going?

289
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,185
Why haven't you answered my calls?

290
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,811
I think you have the wrong person.

291
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,898
I finally got a call.
Someone wants to see it tomorrow.

292
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,608
-Well…
-What do you say?

293
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,776
It's just…

294
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,111
Now I remember.

295
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,864
I actually quit ACT.

296
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,367
She's the CEO of a former client.

297
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,786
-She must not know I quit.
-What are you talking about?

298
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,579
Someone's coming to see Unit 102.

299
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,499
Unit 102?

300
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,709
You must be his wife.

301
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,545
You've been so worried, haven't you?

302
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,381
You should be nice to her
after everything--

303
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,383
What?

304
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,510
I see.

305
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,428
I'll call you tomorrow.

306
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,309
Three months' rent free, right?

307
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,435
Yes, right.

308
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,899
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION WON PER MONTH

309
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,694
FIRST THREE MONTHS FREE!
RESTAURANTS, CAFES, SELF-CHECKOUT STORES

310
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,722
Did you buy this?

311
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,812
How much was it?

312
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,859
One billion

313
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,819
fifty million won.

314
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:35,948
Wait.

315
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,245
Where did you get that money?

316
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,043
I took out a loan for 550 million won.

317
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,837
And?

318
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,672
The other 500 million…

319
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,845
was my severance pay.

320
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,683
Severance…

321
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,436
It's our 1.05 billion-won property.

322
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,397
I'll work hard. I'm sorry.

323
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,774
Kim Nak-su.

324
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,318
I was going to tell you,
but I didn't get a chance.

325
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,195
Kim Nak-su!

326
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,906
-Kim Nak-su.
-I'm sorry.

327
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,491
Come on, Kim Nak-su.

328
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,117
Kim Nak-su.

329
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,036
Kim Nak-su!

330
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,330
Kim Nak-su!

331
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,208
Kim Nak-su!

332
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,382
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,592
Kim Nak-su!

334
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,638
Face reality and tell your loved ones.

335
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,015
Good.

336
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,060
You're doing great.

337
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,855
3,208,333 WON

338
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,742
Give me one.

339
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,704
Come on.

340
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,039
I quit 20 years ago, after I had Su-gyeom.

341
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,749
But I'm craving one like crazy right now.

342
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,167
Give me one now.

343
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,337
I'm sorry. Please don't.

344
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,136
What about the stocks?

345
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,347
I sold them.

346
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,307
Both US and domestic?

347
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,274
Where did that money go?

348
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,699
MOM

349
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,079
517 DONGCHEON-DAERO, SINPYEONG-SI
GYEONGGI-DO, MANGJIN PLAZA

350
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,625
Keep going straight, then left.
Hey, Su-gyeom.

351
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,961
Over here.

352
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,883
What is this place, Dad?

353
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,769
Su-gyeom is here.

354
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,819
Kim Su-gyeom.

355
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,154
Yes?

356
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:24,158
Did the CEO of your company take out
a 30 million won loan under your name?

357
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,748
Is that true?

358
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,295
Yes.

359
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,255
So to pay that back,

360
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,091
you were running a business
with the money Dad gave you?

361
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,093
Yes.

362
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,102
-Okay.
-Where are you going?

363
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,068
Do you two even consider me
part of this family?

364
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,569
Of course.

365
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,697
Then how could you
move all that money around without…

366
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,408
Without even talking to me once?

367
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,621
And what do you expect me
to do about it now?

368
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,793
I don't know.

369
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,087
I don't know anything anymore.

370
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,173
Where…

371
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,509
Honey.

372
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,471
Dad, what is going on?

373
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,225
How did things get this bad?

374
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,979
And what is this place?

375
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,575
We can't go home for a while.

376
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,514
Loafer. Where are you?

377
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,266
A trip?

378
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,226
So is your place empty?

379
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,645
Your daughter didn't go with you?

380
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,607
Hey, didn't you say
the third floor was vacant?

381
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,902
Could Su-gyeom and I
maybe crash there for tonight?

382
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,987
It's taken?

383
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,198
Man, maybe it's the location.
Your building is never vacant.

384
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,992
All right. Have a great time.

385
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,076
Okay.

386
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,539
Jeez.

387
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,209
Let's go to a 24-hour sauna.

388
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,587
And make plans there.

389
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,006
Let's go.

390
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,262
Hey.

391
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,891
Are you mad at me right now
for telling your mom?

392
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,811
What was I supposed to do?

393
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,273
She grilled me like a tax auditor.

394
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,275
I had to come clean.

395
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,568
Get up. Let's go.

396
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,573
I really don't understand you.

397
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,201
What do you mean?

398
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,878
Did you

399
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:28,217
really invest in this for Mom and me?

400
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,678
Good lord.

401
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,811
You wanted to show off, didn't you?

402
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,982
"Even though I got pushed out of my job,
I'm still doing well."

403
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,775
You had something to prove.

404
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,652
Right, Dad?

405
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,365
That's enough. Stop.

406
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,367
You rascal.

407
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:01,291
It was the same
when you made me retake my CSAT.

408
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,629
You said it was all for me,
but in the end…

409
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,091
you wanted to be the father

410
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,386
of a son who went to
Seoul National University.

411
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,762
Am I wrong?

412
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,308
You little brat.

413
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,811
What the family really wants,

414
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,313
what we're all worried about…

415
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,776
you don't even know or care.

416
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,073
Seoul National University, this building…

417
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,663
That's not what we wanted, Dad.

418
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,082
You'll worry. "What if I die?
What if this happens again?"

419
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,751
So you become sensitive
to the slightest changes in your body.

420
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,463
If your heart beats a little faster
or you're a bit short of breath,

421
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,464
you wonder…

422
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,436
Ma'am, since this is a corner spot,

423
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,063
you'll get all the people passing by.

424
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,023
And from this way too.

425
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,025
Take your time and look around.

426
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,488
This place has been vacant
since it was first sold, right?

427
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,447
Yes, but--

428
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,157
Someone who truly sees its value

429
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,575
hasn't come along yet.

430
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,954
Right.

431
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,497
Thank you for showing me around.

432
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,333
Yes, take care.
I'll be waiting for your wise decision.

433
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,459
Please give us a call.

434
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,920
Please wait here
for a moment. Don't go.

435
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,719
Did I say something I shouldn't have
in front of your wife?

436
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,054
No, it's fine.

437
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,223
You're looking so run-down lately.

438
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,267
Wipe the sleep out of your eyes

439
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,309
and shave.

440
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,353
I will. I'm counting on you--

441
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,312
Okay.

442
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,648
-Goodness gracious.
-Please call me.

443
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,774
All right, I will.

444
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,944
Ma'am, don't just leave like that.

445
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,988
I have other places to show you.

446
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,540
Jeez.

447
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,883
Gosh.

448
00:27:58,844 --> 00:27:59,720
What?

449
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,267
What the heck?

450
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,230
Shoot.

451
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,649
Damn it.

452
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,737
Did you sleep here again?

453
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,492
-What the…
-The water's not working.

454
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,204
Man, this building is hopeless.

455
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,456
Excuse me, Dr. Na.

456
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,252
I was rude to you yesterday.

457
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,214
Sir.

458
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,966
Can you help me with this?

459
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,970
My eyes are burning.

460
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,306
Dr. Na.

461
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,601
That's so refreshing.

462
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,187
That could've been bad.

463
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,607
Thanks to you,
I'm all cleaned up.

464
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,403
Talking to your wife made you feel

465
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,489
a bit better, didn't it?

466
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,116
How did you know?

467
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,284
It wasn't on purpose.

468
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,037
I kept hearing voices from outside.

469
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,872
What a terrible hobby you have.

470
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14,253
Do you remember when you first felt
symptoms of a panic attack?

471
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,217
You could have a very serious accident.

472
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,679
No one dies from a panic attack.

473
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
But

474
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,974
what if a sudden panic attack hits

475
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,685
in a truly dangerous moment?

476
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,436
Damn it.

477
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,397
I said to swear at him!

478
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,481
Swear!

479
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,691
Hey!

480
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,944
CONSTRUCTION AHEAD
REDUCE SPEED

481
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,948
Your whole life
could vanish in an instant.

482
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,788
Well,

483
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,958
I keep work matters to myself,
even with my wife.

484
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,128
Let alone my son. And…

485
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,463
God.

486
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,425
Sitting face-to-face
with a complete stranger,

487
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,886
talking about myself,
and going to counseling…

488
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,596
I really can't do that.

489
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,348
If it's too difficult…

490
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,311
why don't we do it

491
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,147
in a different location?

492
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,277
DR. NA DAE-RYONG

493
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,033
Aren't you coming back?

494
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,326
I'm with a patient.

495
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,874
And?

496
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,598
Anyway…

497
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:56,688
So he and I…
joined the company at the same time.

498
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,735
That guy had been a manager forever,

499
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,737
and then the company

500
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,074
suddenly sent him to Ulleungdo.

501
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,160
A few days later,

502
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:14,331
he lit charcoal briquettes inside his car
in the company's parking lot.

503
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,168
So that's why.

504
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,214
Ever since then, whenever
something bad happened at work,

505
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,009
I'd find it hard to breathe.

506
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,096
And my chest would feel
like it was being crushed.

507
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,430
That's how it was.

508
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,307
I see.

509
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,437
The way things work

510
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:43,318
in a major corporation
can be frustrating, you know?

511
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,237
There's pressure from the top

512
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,531
and from juniors
trying to climb the ladder.

513
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,532
God.

514
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,245
I'm sure you wouldn't understand it.

515
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,415
Mr. Kim.

516
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,751
I worked at a university hospital.

517
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,711
And?

518
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,965
Factions, connections, politics.

519
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,843
It's the same there too.

520
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,556
Right. I've seen it on TV.

521
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,600
Is it really that bad there too?

522
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,355
Is it?

523
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,275
Let's not talk about me. Anyway…

524
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,401
Please, tell me.

525
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,153
Why did you leave?

526
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,404
Well?

527
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,117
Perhaps you were betrayed
by a senior you trusted?

528
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,326
Were you?

529
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,163
Okay, that's enough.

530
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,290
Now tell me about you.

531
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,090
I really thought of my mentor

532
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:52,846
as more of a brother
than my own older brother.

533
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,764
For 25 long years…

534
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,020
From what you've said,

535
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,441
getting scammed on the commercial building
was just the final straw.

536
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,194
Even back at the company,
things were already festering badly.

537
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,029
Your mental state, I mean.

538
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,739
People in South Korea

539
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,284
feel the most stress at their workplace.

540
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,829
After going through the school system
and university entrance exams,

541
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,040
the competitive DNA
that's been ingrained in us

542
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,626
fully blossoms at work.

543
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,795
Competition never stressed me out.

544
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,842
Of course, there are some who say that.

545
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,636
No, I'm serious.

546
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,263
Competition was just part of life
even when I was a kid.

547
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,267
I was already competing
with my older brother at home.

548
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,229
What did you compete with him over?

549
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,355
Our grades, of course.

550
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,524
Was your brother a good student?

551
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,943
Please. He was always at the top.

552
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,654
Class president, student body president.
He was no joke.

553
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,615
As the eldest son,
he must have already been the favorite.

554
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,702
And since he was a good student,
he must've been the family's top priority.

555
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,622
My parents subtly encouraged competition.

556
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,668
"If you want to be acknowledged
like your brother,

557
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,336
do something worthwhile."

558
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,464
So, did your brother end up going
to a better college than you?

559
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,590
No.

560
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,133
After his third try,

561
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,386
he ended up
at a private university out of town.

562
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,347
And I got a better job than he did.

563
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,185
So you won.

564
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,481
And at that moment,

565
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,275
how did you feel?

566
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,952
Let's stop here for today.

567
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,752
That's the last one, right?

568
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:48,837
Yes.

569
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,340
There's still so much left.

570
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,720
Sorry. I'll find another place soon.

571
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:03,643
What's all that stuff back there?
Did you draw them?

572
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,773
The roommate I'm living with
is an art major.

573
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,985
I just kind of dabble on the side.

574
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,904
Can I take a quick look?

575
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,072
Sure.

576
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,165
Wow.

577
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,337
Which ones are yours?

578
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,841
This one, and…
I painted everything here.

579
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,265
Han-na, this is way beyond a hobby.

580
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,101
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

581
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,104
There's…
there's something special about these.

582
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,440
Something special?

583
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,984
Is there?

584
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,328
Han-na, should we put something like this

585
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,664
on our hoodies?

586
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,958
-This?
-Yes.

587
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,127
No way. It's too embarrassing.

588
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,254
They're not good enough to sell.

589
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,506
That's not true.

590
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,926
Come on. They're so much better than this.

591
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,179
I guess you're right.

592
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,772
Did you ever think of majoring in art?

593
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,025
I did. I used to love drawing.

594
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,944
I even applied to design schools.

595
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,029
I got into a few.

596
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,156
I see.

597
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:41,825
And?

598
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,869
My father wanted me
to take a gap year and retake the SAT.

599
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,914
So I ended up at Michigan Tech,
which was never in my plans.

600
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,499
You know how it is.

601
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,546
Why are parents like that?

602
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,464
The problem is how they go about it.

603
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,177
I still think it's a form of love.

604
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,139
Because that's probably how they grew up,

605
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,101
and that's the only way
they know how to express themselves.

606
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,703
Yes, three samples for now.

607
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,920
Okay, I'll see you then. Thank you.

608
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,967
They said to come next week.

609
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,680
You have some serious drive.

610
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,434
I'm heading out.

611
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,937
Where are you going to sleep tonight?

612
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,817
I was planning to go to a 24-hour sauna.

613
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,028
Internet cafes are just…

614
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,656
Do you want to sleep here?

615
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,620
What?

616
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,538
Damn it.

617
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,250
-Sir.
-What? Is it urgent?

618
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,293
No, it's not.

619
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,003
Someone's here to see you.

620
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,088
Jeez.

621
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,258
CAR MAINTENANCE FROM A TO Z

622
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,426
Who?

623
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,261
That guy.

624
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,516
-Get back to work.
-Yes, sir.

625
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,227
Ho-jun.

626
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,820
Managing Director Kim Nak-su.

627
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,160
Don't you have anything less sweet?

628
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,581
This one is here
for a routine checkup, right?

629
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,541
MAINTENANCE HISTORY

630
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,877
According to the maintenance history,
only the tires need replacing.

631
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,675
Want to give it a try?

632
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,385
No.

633
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,387
You can learn to change a tire
in ten minutes.

634
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,138
It's like playing with Legos.

635
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,306
Forget it. Why would I?

636
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,060
Do you make good money doing that?

637
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,354
Some months are good.

638
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,773
Other times I make less than those guys.

639
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,651
Yeong-gil, it's getting late.
Let's wrap things up.

640
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,694
Yes, sir.

641
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,195
Yes, sir.

642
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,408
You're staying for dinner, right?

643
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,576
I'm not hungry.

644
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,579
Then why'd you even come?

645
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,747
I saw that you have a sofa over there.

646
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,166
-What?
-Can I crash here for the night?

647
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,087
-Did you two fight?
-Is that a yes or a no?

648
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,436
Are you asleep?

649
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,646
What? No. Why?

650
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,793
Thank you.

651
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,089
For what?

652
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:31,095
I was always so jealous
of my roommate having solo exhibitions.

653
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:36,267
But you're bringing my artwork
out into the world for the first time.

654
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,898
Thank you. I really mean it.

655
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,237
Can I…

656
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,367
move a little closer?

657
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,744
What?

658
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,413
I have something to say.

659
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,600
How close are you getting?

660
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,604
I'm trying to get a little braver.

661
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,565
You know…

662
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,529
If it…

663
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,032
weren't for you,

664
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,286
I couldn't have done anything.

665
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:40,790
You…

666
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,043
make me…

667
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,715
want to become something more.

668
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,929
And I'm grateful for that.

669
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,225
I like that.

670
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,062
So I hope we can

671
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,149
keep doing this together.

672
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,382
Then we should go to bed early.

673
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:39,932
Good night.

674
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,559
Okay.

675
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,102
You too.

676
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,161
TRUSTED PLACE FOR TIRES

677
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,921
You could've just slept at my place.

678
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,255
No, thank you.

679
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
Did you cheat on her?

680
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,219
Come on.

681
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,972
Right, there's no way
you'd do something like that.

682
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,183
How is Su-gyeom?

683
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,560
I heard he was studying
to retake the CSAT.

684
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,063
He got into Yonseo University.

685
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,940
Seriously? Damn.

686
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,526
He's the first in our family
to get into a prestigious university.

687
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,819
Hey, give him a call.

688
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,612
Let me talk to him. It's been a while.

689
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,822
Forget it.

690
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,409
It's been a while since you last saw
Jun and Seo-in, hasn't it?

691
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,247
Look.

692
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,207
The kids have grown up so much.

693
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,672
Say something, you jerk.

694
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,603
So did you finally become an executive?

695
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,648
I quit.

696
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,985
What?

697
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,739
You worked there long enough.

698
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,120
I was fired.

699
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,831
I was demoted to the factory,

700
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,709
and I kept disobeying orders,

701
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,043
so I got kicked out.

702
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,175
When you hear something like that,

703
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,384
how does it make you feel?

704
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,887
What do you mean?

705
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,682
When you hear that I never became
an executive and got fired from my job,

706
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,933
how does that make you feel?

707
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,479
I'm just wondering how big
your severance package was.

708
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,774
I got 500 million won,
but I blew it all on something stupid.

709
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,945
So? How does that make you feel?

710
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,822
What are you getting at?

711
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,408
When you didn't get into
Seoul National University,

712
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,162
I was really happy.

713
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,249
During the IMF crisis,
when you got fired from your job,

714
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,835
and when you ran your business
into the ground,

715
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,296
I was honestly really happy.

716
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,759
So? Does that change your opinion?

717
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,724
Well, I don't know.

718
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:38,069
When we were kids,
Mom once brought some bananas.

719
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,571
Bananas?

720
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,531
They were really expensive back then.

721
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:48,788
A bunch would cost
around 100,000 won today.

722
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,582
Mom gave me two,

723
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,834
and she gave you three.

724
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:59,131
But when I got home from school,
there was only one banana left on my desk.

725
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,384
So I went to you

726
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,095
and asked why there was only one left.

727
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,722
You don't remember?

728
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,768
What did I say?

729
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,395
You said you didn't know.

730
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,189
I went to your room,
dug through the trash,

731
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,399
and found the peel.

732
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,651
I brought it to you and started yelling,

733
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,361
asking why you ate mine.

734
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,532
Do you know what you did to me?

735
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,787
You slapped me.

736
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,709
I went crying to Mom,

737
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,211
and she said,

738
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,923
"So what if your brother had one more?
What's the big deal?"

739
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:45,511
When I said you'd hit me,
she just stopped responding.

740
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,139
Jeez.

741
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,102
That's what I was to the family.

742
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,201
For the first time, in third grade,

743
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,079
I came home so happy
about being class vice president.

744
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,456
Remember what you said?

745
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,500
No.

746
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,127
You don't remember?

747
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,296
Damn it, I said I don't know!

748
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,467
Gosh, you…

749
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,511
don't remember anything at all.

750
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,777
I'm the only one who remembers.

751
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,700
I'm turning in.

752
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,899
The person who came yesterday
didn't like it either?

753
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,319
I guess rent-free for three months
isn't good enough.

754
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:29,073
Then please list it as available
for a short-term lease.

755
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,866
That's probably for the best.

756
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,952
Take your time looking around.

757
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,286
Okay, thank you.

758
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,581
I almost forgot. Ma'am.

759
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:42,169
Please tell your husband
not to sleep here, if possible.

760
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,170
Excuse me?

761
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,381
It makes him look too desperate.

762
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:49,135
From a potential tenant's perspective,
that's actually a major drawback.

763
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,887
Wait, he sleeps here?

764
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:54,932
Oh, so you didn't know.

765
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:59,353
Well, take a look around.

766
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,819
What is that?

767
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,696
Gosh.

768
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,042
URGENT SALE

769
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,544
URGENT SALE
500M WON → 380M WON

770
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,670
FOR LEASE

771
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,263
FOR LEASE
THREE MILLION PER MONTH

772
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:40,394
Nak-su. My dear Kim Nak-su.

773
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:42,938
Jeez.

774
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,149
Come on in.

775
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,944
You already bought the place.
What more do you have to say?

776
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,780
Just sit down and listen.
Su-gyeom, you too.

777
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,908
-Gosh.
-Quick. Sit down.

778
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,285
Okay, listen carefully.

779
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,871
From the front door to the bathroom,

780
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,207
and Su-gyeom, up to your room.

781
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,084
That was ten years' salary
as an associate and assistant manager.

782
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,169
Next.

783
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,547
The kitchen, the utility room,
and this bedroom here.

784
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,217
All that cost me five years
of my salary as a manager.

785
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:16,347
Finally, for five years
as a senior manager,

786
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,683
I worked my fingers to the bone
and scraped together every last penny.

787
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,021
And with all that, we barely bought
this living room and that balcony.

788
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,317
You kept saying
that you were sick of moving around,

789
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,818
so I reluctantly bought it.

790
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,738
But don't forget this, you two.

791
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,865
This apartment

792
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,910
is the culmination

793
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,871
of my 51 years.

794
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,624
My trophy.

795
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,962
Understand?

796
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,463
You're the best!

797
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,799
Dad, you're the best!

798
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,136
Bring it in.

799
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,429
You worked hard too, honey.

800
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:00,266
Good job!

801
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,270
-This is our home!
-Let's have a drink.

802
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,772
All right.

803
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,578
What do we do?

804
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,164
We can't live off the trophy.

805
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,007
Hey, you're up.

806
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,550
I'm leaving.

807
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,635
Okay.

808
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,553
I slept well.

809
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,221
All right.

810
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,641
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

811
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,768
You're slacking off.
You should come early.

812
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,895
What do you mean?
We're five minutes early.

813
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,313
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

814
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,898
Ask him. Go on.

815
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,399
No, you ask him.

816
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,195
Excuse me. Are you the boss's brother?

817
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,283
-Man!
-Give it to me.

818
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,993
They don't look alike at all.

819
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,245
Look at their faces. It's obvious.

820
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,039
You must have money to burn.

821
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,540
Go get changed, you guys.

822
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,500
Yes, sir.

823
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,378
The boss talks about you all the time.

824
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,462
What did he say?

825
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,631
He was bragging about
how high up you were at ACT--

826
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,883
-Hey!
-Okay, I'm going.

827
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,761
-Come on, you're buying coffee.
-What?

828
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,680
That guy loves to run his mouth.

829
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:03,639
Go.

830
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,186
I left something
on the desk in the office.

831
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:10,854
Take it with you.

832
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,539
I ate it. I'm sorry.

833
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:54,857
What if my brother had apologized then?

834
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,942
What if he'd just said "congratulations"

835
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,945
when I became class vice president?

836
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:01,947
Would I be different?

837
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,450
How so?

838
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:09,997
For one thing, I might not see
everyone in the world as my competitor,

839
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,042
and I might not be as jealous

840
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,169
and as prideful.

841
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,588
Jeez. You can never know.

842
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,299
Not unless we can travel
to a parallel universe.

843
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,677
Besides, that competitiveness

844
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,888
may have been what's kept you going

845
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,640
and put food on the table
for your family all this time.

846
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,977
You're right. That's true.

847
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,898
Also, that may be what led you
to make a risky investment

848
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,442
to prove you're not washed up yet.

849
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,614
And my appetite is gone.

850
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,911
How many children do you have?

851
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,079
I've got a son.

852
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,457
Then you must be giving your son

853
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,626
all the love and encouragement

854
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,045
you didn't get from your parents

855
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,631
when you were young.

856
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,384
-Well…
-And you must express your love a lot.

857
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:11,099
I may have failed at other things,
but when it comes to him,

858
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:14,937
I've been making sure
he gets the best education available.

859
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,690
I had him attend the best academies

860
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,526
and got him private tutoring too.

861
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,236
I've really gone all out.

862
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,990
Do you know how that sounds to me?

863
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,996
"I bought him all the bananas
I couldn't have as a child."

864
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,165
That's how it sounds.

865
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,626
Except nowadays,

866
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:41,004
these bananas only cost 3,000 won a bunch.

867
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,652
Honey.

868
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:09,950
Honey?

869
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,298
Let's see.

870
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,259
What did she make today?

871
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,577
Should I make another one?

872
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:56,997
No.

873
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,083
If she leaves work early,
your mom gets home around six o'clock.

874
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,752
Want some?

875
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,545
No, you can have it, Dad.

876
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,012
Where are you staying?

877
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,933
Mostly at internet cafes
or my friend's place.

878
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,560
Okay.

879
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,526
Hey.

880
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:32,032
Did you really not want
to retake the CSAT?

881
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,749
It was my decision.

882
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,300
Should we add some rice?

883
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:51,969
No.

884
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,429
-Mom gets here at six--
-It won't take long.

885
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,514
No, we can't, Dad.

886
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,894
What is it?

887
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,649
What did I tell you?

888
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,567
Good thing we didn't make more ramyeon.

889
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,446
Good things happen when you listen
to your old man. You hear me?

890
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,950
You wanted to add rice. And I stopped you.

891
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,160
You little rascal.

892
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,214
Did she go in?

893
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,632
Be careful.

894
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,636
Did she go up?

895
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,433
She's gone.

896
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,156
-Working as a designated driver again?
-Yes.

897
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,159
-What? Are you ashamed of me?
-No.

898
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,453
Why would I be ashamed of you for working?

899
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,375
I'm just worried
you'll get into an accident.

900
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,170
I won't, kid.

901
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,840
That only happened
because some guy was acting crazy.

902
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,009
I'll be careful, don't worry.

903
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,302
Go on inside.

904
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,430
Actually…

905
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,893
Do you want to work together?

906
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,979
Why do you want to?

907
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,733
What do you mean, "Why?"
I have a 30 million won debt to pay.

908
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,235
Jeez.

909
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,040
Are you okay with going
to Pyeongtaek at this hour?

910
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,625
How are you going to get back?

911
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,752
I'll be fine, sir.

912
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,530
Here's your key.

913
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,365
-Thanks for driving.
-Yes, thank you.

914
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:25,872
All right.

915
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,457
Welcome back.

AWAITING RIDE REQUEST

917
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,798
We got one!

918
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,384
-Where is it?
-It's a ride to Suwon.

919
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,343
CALL CUSTOMER

920
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,928
Let's go.

921
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,927
-Here.
-Thank you.

922
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,095
Hold on.

923
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,930
Here's your tip.

924
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,640
-Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

925
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,058
-Thank you too.
-Su-gyeom!

926
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,107
Look! I got a tip.

927
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,950
Why is this so delicious?

928
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,286
It even has egg in it.

929
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,622
Go easy, Dad. Or you'll get a stomachache.

930
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:51,666
Aren't you tired?

931
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,127
No, I'm fine.

932
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,754
Well, your dad is tired.

933
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:58,924
And cold.

934
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,635
Dad, are you cold?

935
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,553
If you are…

-We got it.

938
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,353
Come on. Let's go.

939
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,894
Oh, my legs. Jeez.

940
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:17,877
WITHDRAWABLE EARNINGS

941
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,255
We made 340,000 won, Dad.

942
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,674
Is it because we accepted
long-distance requests?

943
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,052
After 40,000 won for gas,
that leaves us with 300,000 won.

944
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,971
-Yes.
-Gosh.

945
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,140
I get 160,000 won,
and you get 140,000 won.

946
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,474
Why?

947
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,892
Your hoodie's 10,000 won.

948
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,269
You're ruthless.

949
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:36,146
Jeez.

950
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,273
How many of these did you sell?

951
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,485
-About a hundred.
-A hundred?

952
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,988
That's more than I expected.

953
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,156
No, it's nothing.

954
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,283
You're better than me, son.

955
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,244
My commercial unit
has been empty for three months.

956
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,997
Finally, I can pat your head.

957
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,625
So, are you going to keep doing it?

958
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,919
I have to.

959
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,213
Good.

960
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,966
That's what business is all about.

961
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,553
Sometimes it's good,
and sometimes it's bad.

962
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,475
The market trends are really subtle.

963
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:17,062
That's why you always have to listen
to what people are saying.

964
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:20,899
You know, the ladies at restaurants
and the taxi drivers.

965
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,318
That's where you find the market trends.

966
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,739
You're missing some expensive consulting.

967
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,287
Fine. Get some sleep.

968
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:38,792
You must be exhausted.

969
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,340
But your dad is not.

970
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,590
They just waltz in whenever they please.

971
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:30,718
Fine.

972
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,366
Gosh.

973
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,977
My Su-gyeom.

THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

981
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,143
I told you I'm not selling the apartment.

982
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,478
Why don't you do this for real?

983
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,732
Do you really think I could handle
living in a place like that?

984
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,734
You're on your way
to see the president, right?

985
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:18,988
Do Jin-woo betrayed me and sided with
Executive Director Hwang Tae-san.

986
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:22,617
We're sick and tired
of being treated like we're invisible.

987
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,203
Hey, Nak-su.

988
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,622
So please just help me one last time.

989
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,582
It must be a job where you're needed.

990
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,542
Something only you can do.

991
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,128
Managing Director Kim Nak-su.
