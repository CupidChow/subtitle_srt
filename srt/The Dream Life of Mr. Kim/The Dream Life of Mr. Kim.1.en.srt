-Yes!
-Park Gyeong-tae.

10
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,111
-Park Gyeong-tae.
-Park Gyeong-tae.

11
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,904
-Park Gyeong-tae!
-Quiet now.

12
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,448
Park Gyeong-tae.

00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,453

PARK GYEONG-TAE

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,335
The class president for this semester

16
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,254
is Gyeong-tae.

17
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,298
And Nak-su is the vice president.

18
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,591
Why don't you stand up?

19
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,552
-You too, Nak-su.
-It's okay, Nak-su.

20
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,097
Give them a round of applause.

21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,103
-Gyeong-tae! Park Gyeong-tae!
-Gyeong-tae! Park Gyeong-tae!

22
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,523

00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,572
Our class vice president is Kim Nak-su.

25
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,532
-Kim Nak-su!
-Kim Nak-su!

26
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,577
Mom!

27
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,544
Mom, I'm the class vice president!

28
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,088
What? Vice president?

29
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,090
Yes.

30
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,510
You ran all the way here just because
you got elected vice president?

31
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,429
Wash your hands and sit.

32
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,764
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

33
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,301
Yes, I ran just because
I got elected vice president. So what?

34
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:02,349
I'm moving up to managing director, bro.
I'll be an executive soon.

35
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,850
Goodness.

36
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,478
Time for breakfast!

37
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,437
Coming.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,818
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

39
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,744
-How's the braised kimchi stew?
-I'd say B-minus.

40
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,163
I guess you're getting old too.

41
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,833
You used to season it perfectly before.

42
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,087
I heard the side dish stores
do morning deliveries every day.

43
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,758
I just don't want you to work too hard.

44
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,468
It's good. It's not bad.

45
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,804
Do you also not like it?

46
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,184
-I like it. It's delicious.
-Okay.

47
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,854
He eats just about anything.
No wonder he's so tall.

48
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,489
Son, you and your friends
must talk about it, right?

49
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,243
"Just one more shot, and we could get
into Seoul National University."

50
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,745
-Right?
-No, we don't.

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,582
No one says that?

52
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,668
They all seem happy.
They also said the campus is pretty.

53
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,797
-How about you?
-I feel the same.

54
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,847
Don't we have plain barley tea?

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,433
Why do you keep steeping things
in the water?

56
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,310
It's good for you.

57
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,604
It's sour.

58
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,657
-I'm off.
-Okay.

59
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,159
Let's go.

60
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,372
-Bye, Mom.
-Wait.

61
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,582
Hang on a minute.

62
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,294
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

63
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,299
It's a good day.

64
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,723
Let me.

65
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,850
Gosh. Thank you.

66
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,145
Why can't you throw it out
before it piles up?

67
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,273

Don't forget to apply by Friday.

76
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,856
What is it for?

77
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,024
The company runs a marketing program

78
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,609
for college students.

79
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,571
It's like an ambassador role.

80
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,781
It will be great for your resume.

81
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,702
Work experience at my company
gets recognized everywhere.

82
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,954
You can drop me off over there, Dad.

83
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,539
Okay.

84
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,254
-Bye.
-Bye.

85
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,922
By Friday.

86
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:29,890
You should answer me.

87
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,022
Jeez.

88
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,774
What a good-looking kid.

89
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,803

"We're ready to begin the meeting, sir."

95
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,997
"Okay, I'll be out soon."

I couldn't go, but you two…

98
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,987
The food at the party was so good!

99
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,114
-Right?
-At my daughter's party,

100
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,949
-Myung-heon was…
-You're so lucky, Myung-heon.

101
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,035
I'd never won anything like that before.

102
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,162
He even danced.

103
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,833
That's hilarious.

104
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,724
Mr. Kim.

105
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,059
-Hi.
-Hello.

106
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,435
-Hello.
-Hello.

107
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,355
Okay, then.

108
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,693
Looks like Team 2 all came in early today.

109
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,321
Yes, we came in an hour early
and held a morning get-together.

110
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,823
It was more of a breakfast meeting.

111
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,825
The place we went to today was amazing.

112
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,909
Was it?

00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,494
SALES TEAM 2 GENERAL MANAGER
DO JIN-WOO

114
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,163
Your team seems to do
a lot of fun activities.

115
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,164
Let's go.

116
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,208
Is Mr. Baek in his office already?

117
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,127
-We should say hello--
-That's…

118
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,379
He told me he had some instructions
for me this morning,

119
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,672
-so I--
-I'll just say hi.

120
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,174
He seems very tired. Let's go.

121
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,467
We should quickly say hello--

122
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,719
-Let's go.
-Hang on.

123
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,930
He's not there.

124
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,765
-He's not?
-No. I was just looking around.

125
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,976
-Looking around?
-Yes, around Mr. Baek's office.

126
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,561
What?

127
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,438
Mr. Baek and I are close enough.

128
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,108
I'm sure.

129
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,484
Move. What are you all doing?

130
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,029
Jeez.

131
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,286
What was that?

132
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,413
-Are you okay?
-Mr. Kim!

133
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,456
-Mr. Kim!
-Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

134
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh my gosh.

135
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,960
-Are you okay, Mr. Kim?
-Goodness.

136
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,546
-You don't seem okay.
-I'm okay. Jeez.

137
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,506
I'm fine.

138
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,675
I think you broke something.

139
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,010
I heard a crack.

140
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,727
What?

141
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,937
Damn it.

142
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,628

GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

145
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,599
Mr. Baek's bag is

146
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,643
not this one.

147
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,979
Is it this one? No.

148
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,272
Found it.

149
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,609
Three million won?

150
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,405
I'll just think of it
as my early promotion present.

151
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,868
But I'll buy something a little cheaper.
Around two million won.

152
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,500
-Good morning, Mr. Kim.
-Hello.

153
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,460
Good morning.

154
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,754
I guess you stopped by a cafe.

155
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,631
Yes,

156
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,008
we ran into each other at the station
and stopped by one.

157
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,927
Did you now?

158
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,722
We all know
you prefer the instant coffee mix anyway.

159
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,767
Wrong. I enjoy regular coffee
if someone buys me one.

160
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,727
I'll remember that!

161
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,979
It's three minutes

162
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,647
past 9:00.

163
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,402
I apologize.

164
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,361
-Sorry, sir.
-Sorry.

165
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,739
The staff lounge is stocked
with Starbucks capsules.

166
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,659
Shouldn't you show
a little more interest in the company?

167
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,417
-Sung-gu!
-Assistant Manager Jung Sung-gu!

168
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,210
How much did you pay for your bag?

169
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,089
-This one?
-Yes.

170
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,385
You mean the price?

171
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,428
Yes.

172
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,680
It's…

173
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,848
It's 2.5 million won.

174
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,391
Two point…

175
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,560
Two point…

176
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,895
I'm sorry. A bit excessive, isn't it?

177
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,398
No, I didn't mean that.

178
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,484
A bag like that isn't surprising
for a big-company assistant manager.

179
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,862
Good morning to you all!

180
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,113
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

181
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,197
Hello, sir.

182
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,532
-Hello.
-Hi.

183
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,452
SALES DIRECTOR
BAEK JEONG-TAE (EMPLOYED 27 YEARS)

184
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,287
-Nak-su.
-Yes, sir.

185
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,330
Right.

186
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,999
Have another happy day, everyone!

187
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,417
-Bye, sir.
-Bye, sir.

188
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,002
-Bye, sir.
-Sir.

189
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,671
Come in.

190
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,174
Take a seat.

191
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,807
Hello, Jin-woo.

192
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,351
Hello.

193
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,981
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

194
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,026
On Saturday, the sales directors
of the three major telecoms

195
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,110
are having a golf round.

196
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,321
"Saturday golf with the major three."

197
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,865
-So the big issue that day will be…
-Yes, sir.

198
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,077
It looks like the government will continue
to tighten its budget.

199
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,663
And if the three companies engage
in a bidding war for every public tender,

200
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,123
we'll wipe ourselves out.

201
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,417
-It--
-Right. It's all cutthroat these days.

202
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,002
Exactly.

203
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,338
To put it nicely, it's like a social club.

204
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,881
"Like a social club."

205
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,759
If we let L win the bid
for this upcoming project…

206
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,886
-"Win bid."
-…we'll take the next Ministry deal.

207
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,304
"We'll take it."

208
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,932
Then we'll let T have the next deal.

209
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,683
"T will have the next deal."

210
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,268
That's so distracting.

211
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,979
Just say it in your head.

212
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,065
I'm sorry, sir.

213
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,651
It's a very important meeting.

214
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,569
Which one of you will…

215
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,824
I'll oversee everything, Mr. Baek.

216
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,247
-Jin-woo, you can…
-Yes, sir.

217
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,416
If you'll excuse me.

218
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,793
-Sure.
-Bye.

219
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,005
My gosh.

220
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,884
What was that all about? Let me handle it.

221
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,886
You two should do it together.
It's a big job.

222
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,848
How can I work with a guy who drags
his slippers into the boss's office?

223
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,058
-I can handle--
-Do you enter this room

224
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,519
when I'm not here?

225
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,316
I only came to check if you were in early

226
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,360
and to say hello.

227
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,945
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

228
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,990
Honestly, I'd rather
have my guy get promoted

229
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,200
to managing director over Do Jin-woo.

230
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,202
I mean it.

231
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,245
Yes.

232
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,165
Keep yourself in check.
There are eyes on you everywhere.

233
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,376
Do Jin-woo didn't mean to rat you out.

234
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,044
He's looking out for you.

235
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,341
That's not what…
I had something to tell you this morning--

236
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,261
Just say sorry and be done with it,
for Christ's sake.

237
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,679
Okay?

238
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,890
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,686
And how come your team members
arrive to work at the same time as me?

240
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,105
Jin-woo's team is always ready to go.

241
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,984
Your people always
just barely make it by 9:00.

242
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,944
I'll have a talk with them.

243
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,654
"Punctuality."

244
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,200
And pick me up for golf on Saturday.

245
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,534
"Pick up on Saturday."

246
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,205
You know my new address, right?

247
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,957
Yes, of course. Banpo River Palace.

248
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,083
It's Building 103.

249
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,170
-"Building 103."
-For heaven's sake.

250
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,256
I keep forgetting things these days.

251
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,511
Pick Jin-woo up on your way to my house.

252
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,388
You want me to pick Jin-woo up?

253
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,474
It's better than moving around
in two or three cars.

254
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,017
After all, we'll be drinking.

255
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,563
What now? You don't feel
like giving your junior a ride?

256
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,817
Not at all. I'll do that.

257
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,782
Mr. Kim.

258
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,827
Tattle-tale, tattle-tale, tattling again!

259
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,496
Pardon? What was that?

260
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,039
Nothing.

261
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,544
Mr. Baek told me
to pick you up this Saturday.

262
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,380
I was just told that too, sir.

263
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,967
-I'm sorry.
-Nothing to feel sorry about.

264
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,428
I can just wake up
a little earlier, right?

265
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,474
You'll be too tired. Let me drive.

266
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,894
Don't bother.

267
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,730
My car is bigger. I'll drive.

268
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,233
Okay then.

269
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,443
With so many eyes watching that day,

270
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,780
it would be a lot better to take
your nice car rather than mine.

271
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,199
It's not all about the size, though.

272
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,077
He sure is young.

273
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,580
What a beast.

274
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,457
Look at it go.

275
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,169
This isn't a robot.

276
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,589
It's more like the boss.

277
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,590
Hey!

278
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,883
This is what I get for listening to you!

279
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,845
Ha-jin, Robot Auntie didn't do
anything wrong.

280
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,513
The problem is your old house.

281
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,098
It works just fine for us, doesn't it?

282
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,121
-Is she on vacation?
-Ha-jin.

283
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:23,978
Get a contractor
and have the threshold removed.

284
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,606
That will make the house
look bigger and everything.

285
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,691
If that's all, I'm going.
I've got breakfast waiting.

286
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,569
-Wait! Hold on!
-See you next time, Ha-jin.

287
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,612
HA-YEONG
CALL ENDED

288
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,779
That brat.

289
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,537
What do I do with you?

290
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,207
Both of us are so pathetic.

291
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,503
Right.

292
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,555
ACT STUDENT MARKETER PROGRAM
APPLY NOW

293
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,642
I'm not doing this.

294
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,276
You guys go ahead. See you later. Bye.

295
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,742
Kim Su-gyeom?

296
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,994
Sorry?

297
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,957
Aren't you Kim Su-gyeom
from Gangdong Middle School?

298
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,542
Who are you?

299
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,336
Hey.

300
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,214
I'm Lee Han-na.

301
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,215
What?

302
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,633
I'm Lee Han-na.

303
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,803
Han-na?

304
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,514
Don't you remember me?

305
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,105
Lee Han-na?

306
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,856
Yes!

307
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,778
Didn't you go study abroad
after finishing middle school?

308
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,989
That's right. So you do remember me.

309
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,950
I'm a freshman
at Michigan State University.

310
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,995
It's been so long.

311
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,748
-What are you doing here?
-I'm here as an exchange student.

312
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,625
I see.

313
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,585
Well, I'm sort of here on a half-vacation.

314
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,133
It's been so long.

315
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,219
Han-na!

316
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,429
Okay.

317
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,723
Are you free tomorrow evening?

318
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,433
Tomorrow evening? Why?

319
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,393
Just tell me if you're free or not.

320
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,688
-I am.
-Do you have a pen?

321
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,704
MIYUM ART MUSEUM
7 P.M.

322
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,249
Here.

323
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,168
I'll see you there tomorrow.

324
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,128
Bye.

325
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,469
Let's go.

326
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,602
So how much do we need?

327
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,645
CURRENT EXPENSE X 0.7
= MONTHLY RETIREMENT EXPENSE

328
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,482
Transportation costs.
About 100,000 won, right?

329
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,359
-Phone bills. You need your phones.
-Yes.

330
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,488
Insurance fees.
And your taxes and utility fees.

331
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,449
Are you done with your calculations?

332
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,242
-Yes.
-Yes.

333
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,660
Then you need to add

334
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,871
-one more thing to that pile.
-What?

335
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,373
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?

336
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,292
We haven't calculated
our medical expenses yet.

337
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,251
MEDICAL EXPENSES!

338
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,086
-Right.
-Not clothes,

339
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,671
-but medical expenses.
-They cost a lot.

340
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,216
We can't live for 50 years
without ever getting sick.

341
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,675
-Right?
-That's right.

342
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,511
Write it down. Medical expenses.

343
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,470
MEDICAL EXPENSES

344
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,596
In the year 2033,

345
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,766
if Mr. Kim, a 51-year-old general manager
at a major company in Seoul,

346
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,644
were to live to 100,
fortunately or unfortunately,

347
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,563
how much would his family of three need?

348
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,731
650 million won.

349
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,275
We have 650 million. Anyone else?

350
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,527
I say 730 million won.

351
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,695
-Okay, 730 million won.
-Maybe 800.

352
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,614
Eight hundred?
Do we really need that much?

353
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,325
On average,

354
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,244
you need 1.28 billion won.

355
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,120
-What?
-You need 1.28 billion won?

356
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,373
-1.28 billion won.
-That much?

357
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,416
That's a lot, isn't it?

358
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,459
TOTAL

359
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,837
What do you think?
This is our best-selling model right now.

360
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,466
I'd like a bag priced
between 2.5 and 3 million won.

361
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,468
What kind of design are you looking for?

362
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,679
Any men's briefcase will do. In black.

363
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,641
But in the 2.5 to 3 million won range.

364
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,351
I understand. One moment, please.

365
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,352
Okay.

366
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,898
Sir.

367
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,733
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

368
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,073
SALES SUPPORT TEAM
HEO TAE-HWAN (EMPLOYED 25 YEARS)

369
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,033
Can't you just get it repaired?

370
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,493
The warranty period is over.

371
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,203
Then get it repaired somewhere.

372
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,622
Knock it off.
It's about time I get a new bag.

373
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,916
Then let me have it.

374
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,918
No way! Give it to me.

375
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,965
Are you sure about this?
Won't Ha-jin say something?

376
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,718
I'm spending the money I earned.
No one can say anything about that.

377
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,802
Gosh.

378
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,013
I guess you still have a say at home.

379
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,724
Not just "still."
It will stay like that for good.

380
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,018
What did you want to tell me?

381
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,521
Let's talk at a cafe.

382
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,024
What is it with people and cafes?

383
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,193
The staff lounge is stocked
with instant coffee mix and capsules.

384
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,695
Let's just talk here. What is it?

385
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,075
I'm going to Ulleungdo Island.

386
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,745
On a trip?

387
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,622
Why are you going so far?

388
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,334
They told me to go.

389
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,253
They told me to go manage the facilities.

390
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,589
I've got a month left.

391
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,141
Jeez, man.

392
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,227
What am I going to do?

393
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,315
Sir, I've got the briefcase.

394
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,274
Okay.

395
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,989
It's 2.6 million won,

396
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,533
and it's made of calf leather.

397
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,329
This should be good enough.

398
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,872
Shall I hand it over then?

399
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,749
Mr. Kim told us to handle it ourselves.

400
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,001
Did he? That's done then. I'll send it.

401
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,503
I'm not sure.

402
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,838
I need to leave soon.

403
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,925
There he is. Hello, Mr. Kim.

404
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,551
Did you enjoy your lunch?

405
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,844
-Yes.
-Here.

406
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,471
For you.

407
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,765
Mr. Kim.

408
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:35,724
I'm going to send

409
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,811
the Q2 and Q4 public institution
new business strategy presentation.

410
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,813
I told you to handle it with Ik-hyeon.

411
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,398
Can I really send it over?

412
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,567
Please handle it on your own.

413
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,653
Have a sense of ownership, will you?

414
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,239
Mr. Kim,

415
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,908
this is the very final version,
and it'll be difficult to revise it.

416
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,828
The Managing Director and
the Executive Director will see it.

417
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,374
Hey. Add a space.

418
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,084
-Okay. A space?
-No, change a line.

419
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,878
-An arrow.
-An arrow.

420
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,296
From the top menu, under "Shapes."

421
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,840
-Keep looking.
-Yes, sir.

422
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,174
What's with this font?

423
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,844
It stands out too much. Change it.

424
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,804
-Okay.
-Not that one.

425
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,347
Not that one.

426
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,224
You must be busy. Why don't we handle--

427
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,144
If you were good at your jobs,
I wouldn't be busy. What's with the red?

428
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,270
It's just red.

429
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,232
It's not the red we usually use.

430
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,609
I think it is.

431
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,819
Is it?

432
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:32,990
Take a look.

433
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,201
Do they look the same to you?

434
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,411
Look.

435
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,789
I think it looks a little different
because it's printed out.

436
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,544
What if they're actually different?

437
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,087
It's fixed. Shall I send it?

438
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,213
-Wait.
-Okay.

439
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,257
What if they're actually different?

440
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,425
Here.

441
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,136
Is this red the same as that red?

442
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,095
Huh? The same?

443
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,388
But I was thinking,

444
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,474
maybe we could tone down

445
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,685
-the red a little--
-Just say sorry and be done with it.

446
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,729
What's with all the excuses?

447
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,730
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,273
-Sung-gu.
-Yes, sir.

449
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,691
Train your junior right.

450
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,360
I'm sorry.

451
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,991
Team performance is judged
on details like this.

452
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,745
Performance reviews are around the corner.
Stay on your toes, will you?

453
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,789
-Mr. Kim.
-What?

454
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,958
I have a half day, so I'll get going.

455
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,838
Great timing. What are you talking about?

456
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,173
I told you a week ago.

457
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,800
When was that?

458
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,927
It should be on your messenger app.

459
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,388
Okay. Just go.

460
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,475
See you tomorrow.

461
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,312
-What are you doing? Found it?
-Yes, sir.

462
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,528
Leaving his working colleagues…
Zero loyalty.

463
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,115
Mr. Song already finished
his work yesterday.

464
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,411
"Mr. Song"?

465
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,957
Ik-hyeon definitely lacks loyalty.

466
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,291
Right.

467
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,585
Where on earth does he keep going to?

468
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,629
He said he was going for some inspections.

469
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,797
Infection? Is he sick?

470
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,343
No, inspections.

471
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,680
He's going to analyze
real estate properties on-site.

472
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,014
Real estate?

473
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,307
Yes.

474
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,101
He does that during work hours?

475
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,651
Doesn't he know there's
a real estate master right here?

476
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,487
Look at the stock market these days.

477
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,698
The blue chips are rocketing
through the roof,

478
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,492
while the junk stocks
are crashing to the bottom.

479
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,203
The gap between them
just keeps getting wider.

480
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,454
Polarization.

481
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,540
The same goes for housing prices.

482
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,751
The saying "real estate never loses"
is a thing of the past.

483
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,503
One smart property is all you need.

484
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,796
One smart property.

485
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,590
Okay. Sure.

486
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,386
Come here, Su-gyeom,
my one and only smart son.

487
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,556
Now that you're in college,
you should know stuff like this.

488
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,433
Economics. Personal finance.

489
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,227
Men must know things like this.

490
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,066
You've been doing that for a while.
Just what are you doing?

491
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:18,238
I'm making a door ramp for Robot Auntie.

492
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,448
What's wrong with your mom?

493
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,909
How much did you say you paid for it?

494
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,869
It was 800,000 won.

495
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,828
Eight hundred…

496
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:30,083
I'm worried your mom has
some kind of shopping addiction.

497
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,920
What's the point of me making money
if we don't save it?

498
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,380
Gosh.

499
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,884
What is it?

500
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,762
Right.

501
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,765
What was I going to say?

502
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,726
-A smart--
-A smart property.

503
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,811
Oh, right!

504
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:54,233
We had no choice but to rent
before I became a general manager.

505
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,319
Look at how much
this apartment's value has gone up.

506
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,864
If we hadn't bought it back then,
we would've never been able to afford it.

507
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,699
You did an excellent job, Dad.

508
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:06,036
You remember what I said
when we were buying this apartment, right?

509
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,579
When we were buying this apartment?

510
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,664
Yes.

511
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,836
You really want to buy this apartment?
Don't you watch the news?

512
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,965
It's better to buy it
than to keep paying higher deposits.

513
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,301
People say the cost of mid-tier places
in Seoul goes up as much as inflation.

514
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,636
I've looked into it.

515
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,430
They're all just saying
whatever they were paid to say.

516
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,640
Do you buy what they say?

517
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,810
How would they know if prices
will keep going up or not? Are they gods?

518
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,979
Will they take responsibility
if the bubble bursts?

519
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,523
Forget it. If you don't help me,

520
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,984
I'll ask my parents for a loan
and buy the apartment.

521
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,903
Goodness, do you hear yourself?
Are you out of your mind?

522
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,080
I'm going to do it.

523
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,434
It doesn't matter whose idea it was.

524
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,730
In the end, it's your apartment,
bought with the money you earned.

525
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,857
Well said.

526
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,318
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

527
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,987
-You're the best.
-You're the best, Dad.

528
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,531
Our family is the best.

529
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,827
MIYUM ART MUSEUM
7 P.M.

530
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,460
Will you go up now, Robot Auntie?

531
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,794
-Let's see.
-Enjoy, Dad.

532
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,881
Let me see.

533
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,930
They were being sarcastic, right?

534
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,103
-Mr. Heo Tae-hwan?
-Yes!

535
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,480
Come quickly.

536
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,483
You didn't even tell me what's going on.
What's the rush?

537
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,984
-Go over there.
-There?

538
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,694
-You'll see.
-Okay.

539
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,529
-Mr. Lee. Mr. Heo Tae-hwan?
-Sorry!

540
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,281
I'm sorry. My apologies.

541
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,783
I didn't know it was here.

542
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,576
Give that to him.

543
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,371
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

544
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,623
Let's begin the job training

545
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,502
for your transfers
in the second half of the year.

546
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,504
-Mr. Heo Tae-hwan.
-Yes.

547
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,090
Demonstrate
the confined space entry procedure.

548
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
Sorry?

549
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,927
Climb down.

550
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,054
Down there?

551
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,765
Aren't you working in Ulleungdo
starting next month?

552
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,060
Yes, I am. But I've never done
anything like that before.

553
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,228
In Ulleungdo,

554
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,897
78% of the cable sections are underground.

555
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,192
You need to know how to go in
and perform a basic inspection.

556
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,486
If islanders lose communication
in an emergency,

557
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,446
will you take responsibility?

558
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,073
Climb down.

559
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:55,622
RESTRICTED AREA

560
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,085
That's why I said to wear sneakers.

561
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,212
Everyone else did. Didn't you tell him?

562
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,588
I did.

563
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,099
It's been five minutes. Hurry.

564
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,267
Okay!

565
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,894
Next person, get ready.

566
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,883
Hello, Mr. Kim!

567
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:49,968
Hello.

568
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,057
It's a used car.

569
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,893
But it's covered in plastic.

570
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,853
That's because

571
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,191
I bought some and put it on,
so it could feel like a new car.

572
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,359
Do people really do that?

573
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,320
Your car is fully decked out.

574
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,030
Mine is just a clunker.

575
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,157
Even Mr. Baek drives a domestic sedan.

576
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,661
You won't have to change cars
until you make it to executive.

577
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,039
Sir, please don't tease me.

578
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,958
-How much was it?
-It was…

579
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,294
That's Mr. Song's car.

580
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,962
-Mr. Song.
-Ik-hyeon.

581
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,303
-Ik-hyeon!
-Hello, Mr. Kim.

582
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,890
Sung-gu. You finally bought it, huh?

583
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,103
You've kept your car in great shape.

584
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,523
So modest, so frugal,
and so pleasing to the eye.

585
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,149
Yes.

586
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,109
That car's just for commuting.

587
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,530
Shall we head up now?

588
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,323
We'll get ready for work.

589
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,954
Ik-hyeon.

590
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,541
Mr. Kim!

591
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,043
You finally got a new bag!

592
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,337
Mine was getting old, so I got a new one.

593
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,257
It's the hottest designer brand.

594
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,216
Mr. Do…

595
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,471
Did you see Do Jin-woo's--

596
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,431
Try again, Sung-gu.

597
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,810
Did you buy it after seeing Jin-woo's bag?

598
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,813
No. Does he have one too?

599
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,772
Yes.

600
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,151
-Ik-hyeon.
-Yes, sir.

601
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,820
What do you drive on the weekends?

602
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,206
Mr. Kim! Goodness. So heavy.

603
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,000
What's so funny, guys?

604
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,627
Myung-heon went on a blind date yesterday.

605
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:49,921
Go on, tell him.

606
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,632
-It wasn't bad.
-It sounds like it was.

607
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,175
It was really bad.

608
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,094
As a woman, I think it's a lost cause.

609
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,721
She was nice enough,

610
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,307
but she wouldn't pay a dime
until the third round.

611
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,351
And?

612
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,990
That's the one the clerk
recommended yesterday.

613
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,492
With the credit card discount,
it comes to 2.3 million…

614
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,870
It's 2.3 million won.

615
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,705
I won.

616
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,124
-I won!
-Is that so?

617
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,005
Cheer up.

618
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,173
We can do it!

619
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,634
We can do it!

620
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,345
-Drink up!
-Bottoms up!

621
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,721
-Here.
-Long time no see.

622
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,930
Go get your hair dyed.

623
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,183
Chip in some money before you say that.

624
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,187
So, are you making executive
this year or what?

625
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,773
I've got a rival on the other team,
but he's not a threat.

626
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,025
No connections,
and just a junior college grad.

627
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,611
Isn't he on the same sales team as you?

628
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,363
Why do you ask?

629
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,741
I think I saw him
on your company's YouTube channel.

630
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,117
-Hang on.
-What is it?

631
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,243
I'm Do Jin-woo,

632
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,787
-general manager…
-Watch.

633
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,206
-It's him, right?
-… of Sales Team 2 at ACT.

634
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,166
-Mr. Do! Hang on.
-That punk.

635
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,126
-It's him.
-You're a general manager?

636
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,379
Why would you look up a video like this?

637
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,048
We watch stuff like this all day at PR.

638
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,383
How old is he?

639
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,842
He looks young.

640
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,095
-I don't know.
-To be a general manager at his age,

641
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,055
he must've had fast-track promotions.

642
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,890
Did they ask you
to film something like this?

643
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,308
Whatever.

644
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,686
They didn't, did they?

645
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,062
They didn't.

646
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,772
If I were the boss,

647
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,732
I'd make him the managing director. Look.

648
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,193
-Get that out of my face.
-Stay still.

649
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,321
You see, these days, even executives
have to be young and good-looking.

650
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,990
How does putting up an old man like you
help the company's image?

651
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,909
Get it out of my face!

652
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,619
Shouldn't you start

653
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,246
going to startup fairs like me?

654
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,747
Don't talk crap.

655
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,375
Say what you will,
but I'm the number one choice.

656
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,918
He went to a junior college.

657
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,213
You moron.
Can't you see the bigger picture?

658
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,006
Once you've made it to general manager,

659
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,885
a junior college degree
isn't a handicap. It's a weapon.

660
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,722
It's a testament to 100% pure skill.

661
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,725
Isn't your company always
talking about ESG management?

662
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,310
An executive in his forties
from a junior college

663
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,522
would be perfect for refreshing
the company's image.

664
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,482
-That's so true.
-The usual for me!

665
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,817
All right.

666
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,111
-Here!
-Sorry, I'm late!

667
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,738
-Gosh.
-I'm so sorry!

668
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,240
How is the jobless one
always the last to arrive?

669
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,283
My apologies! Sorry!

670
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,994
A tenant suddenly decided to move out,
so I'm all over the place.

671
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,163
-The third floor?
-They had the whole floor.

672
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,414
Was it the cram school?

673
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,834
Yes. I thought they'd stay for a while.

674
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,961
It's hard to rent out
the third and fourth floors.

675
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,088
-That's right.
-What are you talking about?

676
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,799
-It's about the building.
-What building?

677
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,177
I told you.

678
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,679
I bought an eight-story building
at the end of last year.

679
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,972
Who did?

680
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:46,973
I did!

681
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,602
-What?
-They call me a landlord.

682
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,562
But I'm basically their call center.

683
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,063
The moment something goes wrong,

684
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,608
they call me night and day.

685
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,860
I'm so over it.

686
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,820
Have some food.

687
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,030
You bought a building?

688
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,032
You punk.

689
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,451
You don't read the group chat, do you?

690
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,995
Didn't you know?
He only reads it when it's about him.

691
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,955
-Come on.
-You all knew about this?

692
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:11,956
Jeez.

693
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,293
-The usual.
-Thank you.

694
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,299
-How much is the rent?
-I get around 30 million won.

695
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,012
I didn't mean the yearly rent, stupid.
This isn't Jeju Island.

696
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,890
I know! I meant the monthly rent!

697
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,642
I get 30 million won per month.

698
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,146
Hey, this one's good.

699
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,483
30 MILLION WON PER MONTH

700
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,403
I'm so damn jealous.

701
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,949
Don't be jealous, Nak-su.

702
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,867
Half of it ends up in taxes.

703
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,453
I pay three million won
just for health insurance.

704
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,624
Once you make executive next year,
that'll all be chump change for you.

705
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,793
You'll become one next year, right?

706
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,215
-What's so funny?
-Will he not?

707
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,258
It's nothing.

708
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:06,177
Come on. Bottoms up.

709
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,345
TAE-HWAN

710
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,596
It's good.

711
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,597
No.

712
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,058
-Stop pouring.
-I'm drinking too.

713
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,815
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

714
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,858
Please leave a message…

JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH

719
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,577
Hello, I'm Lee Jeong-hwan,
the CEO of Jealousy, My Strength.

720
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,794
The journey to this moment
has been full of hardships,

721
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,505
and I'm deeply grateful
to the many people who stood by me

722
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,507
and helped me overcome them.

723
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,469
I'd especially like to thank
those who decided to invest in us.

724
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,137
This is more than just funding.

725
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,891
It's an acknowledgment of the vision
of Jealousy, My Strength.

726
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,606
I've been looking for you.

727
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,858
Answer your phone, will you?

728
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,694
-We'll talk details later.
-Okay.

729
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,320
-The night is young.
-Sorry.

730
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,044
-Jeong-hwan! Over here!
-Hi.

731
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,924
How did I do?

732
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,384
You did great.

733
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,344
Let's finish our conversation.

734
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,601
A clothing company makes clothes.
A film company makes films.

735
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,228
Those days are now over.

736
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,147
The brand itself.

737
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,149
Setting up a solid brand.

738
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,109
That's where I'm going to start.

739
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,653
A loyal customer base
will naturally follow.

740
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,364
People who would gladly open their wallets

741
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,492
even if we were to make
fire extinguishers or gas masks.

742
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,870
Can I ask a question?

743
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,124
Can you tell me your name first?

744
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,292
Kim Su-gyeom.

745
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,426
So at the end of the day,
what kind of company is this?

746
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,011
What?

747
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,889
He just explained it.

748
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:43,478
Even after all that,
I still don't quite follow.

749
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,481
Are you saying
you'll actually make gas masks?

750
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,817
What exactly is it that you'll do?
How are you going to make money?

751
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,819
Was it

752
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,906
some kind of metaphor? Gas masks?

753
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,741
Am I missing something here?

754
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,840
I'm asking because I want to see
if my gut's right.

755
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,050
Your parents are…

756
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,178
that is to say, your mother
is probably a homemaker,

757
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,013
and your father's an office worker, right?

758
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,014
Yes.

759
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,226
Your major is
either business or economics,

760
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,061
and you're Korean, right?

761
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,020
Sorry?

762
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,481
You live in Seoul
in a house owned by your parents.

763
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,482
Yes.

764
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,068
Do you live in Gangnam or Seocho?

765
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,070
No.

766
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,905
Okay, I was right 100%.

767
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,407
I knew you'd like him.

768
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,954
You don't act like you're
from Gangnam or Seocho.

769
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,590
We just met. Why talk down to me?

770
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,561
100,000 won feels trivial now.

771
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,979
But in 20, 30 years,

772
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,773
it could be the difference
between life and death.

773
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,484
Make sure you save the money and--

774
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,446
Hello.

775
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,032
Did you buy a new bag?

776
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,450
No, it was a gift.

777
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,787
-Is there anything to snack on?
-You're going to keep drinking?

778
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,665
Just give me whatever.
Anchovies and beans will do.

779
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,626
You said Loafer bought something.
Is it making him some money?

780
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,295
I don't know.

781
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,465
"Avoid a miserable retirement"?

782
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,094
It's nothing. It just came up.

783
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,096
-Park Ha-jin.
-What?

784
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,182
Don't underestimate your husband.

785
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,434
What do you mean?

786
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,477
I really am going to become
an executive next year.

787
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,189
Goodness. Okay, I got it.

788
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,899
Go get changed.

789
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,026
What's going on?

790
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,570
I said I wouldn't make you work.
Why are you watching that?

791
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,488
Okay, I got it. Go on.

792
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,074
Goodness, you stink. You should go change.

793
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,294
That punk.

794
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,382
My son is home!

795
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,970
Welcome home, Su-gyeom.

796
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,014
-I'm home.
-Oh my.

797
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,307
Su-gyeom, you're home.

798
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,767
Did you have dinner?

799
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,436
Come and have a drink with me.

800
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,812
A drink?

801
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,981
-Goodness.
-Sit down.

802
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,274
Sit.

803
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,070
-You two have a good time.
-Dad, I'm…

804
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,533
Want to try the CSAT a third time?

805
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,785
No.

806
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,124
Do you want to study abroad?

807
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,919
Why are you doing this to me?

808
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:55,962
What do you mean?

809
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,674
Tell me if you want to do it, okay?

810
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,636
People say academic background
doesn't mean anything.

811
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,389
But things are different
once you step out into the real world.

812
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,473
Dad,

813
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,851
I have class early in the morning.
I'm gonna call it a night.

814
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,437
I need to go to the office early too.

815
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,855
Sit down.

816
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,899
Let's talk.

817
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,611
-Here.
-Okay.

818
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,118
Son.

819
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:32,748
One of my friends is a landlord.

820
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,753
He owns an eight-story building.
It's huge.

821
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,381
Do you know how much he makes from rent?

822
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,509
He gets 30 million won.

823
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,844
Jeez.

824
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,681
Goodness gracious. I'm super jealous.

825
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:50,349
No.

826
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,811
You think I'd be jealous of him?

827
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,812
Not at all.

828
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,606
I'm not jealous at all.

829
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,567
Do you know why?

830
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,028
Because he's still a jobless bum.

831
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,240
Owning a building means
he's in the rental business.

832
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,534
-How is he a jobless bum?
-He is.

833
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,954
He lives on unearned income.
What else could he be?

834
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,998
Why is that unearned income?

835
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,085
A landlord has to manage the place,
deal with complaints and whatnot.

836
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:22,381
You think people are jealous of landlords
just because they're rich?

837
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,092
People mock them behind their backs.

838
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,178
You think a guy
dragging his slippers around

839
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,013
will get any respect from society?

840
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,891
How would you know that?

841
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,726
Of course I know!

842
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,812
I'm over 50. You think I don't know that?

843
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:37,897
I know everything.

844
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,237
The same goes for my older brother.

845
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,656
He acted all high and mighty,

846
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,243
but he got left behind
and now runs a car repair shop.

847
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,912
You saw him last holiday.

848
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,915
All that grease on his face and clothes.

849
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,792
-Gosh.
-What's wrong with that?

850
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,587
I'm not saying it's wrong.

851
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,965
What I want to say

852
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,969
is that in Korea, after all,

853
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:13,224
you've got to land a job
at a leading global corporation,

854
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,976
sit at a desk,

855
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,271
and type away to make money.

856
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,024
This is both the standard

857
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,945
and the most ideal outcome.

858
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,363
Understood?

859
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,036
I seem very average to you, don't I?

860
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,833
But do you have any idea
how hard it is to lead an average life?

861
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,713
You won't get it
until you step into the real world.

862
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,549
Do you understand?

863
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,427
I respect you, Dad.

864
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,387
I know you've achieved a lot, but--

865
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,270
You have no idea.

866
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,858
If you did,
you wouldn't talk to me like that.

867
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,197
Son.

868
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,700
-Yes.
-My son.

869
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,909
Yes.

870
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,163
Remember this.

871
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,293
Surviving 25 years at a major corporation
as a general manager,

872
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,963
buying an apartment in Seoul,

873
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,842
and sending a kid to college…

874
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,887
That's greatness.

875
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,018
That's greatness, kiddo.

876
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,411
Su-gyeom.

877
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:01,248
Go to your room. I'll take care of him.
Go get some sleep.

878
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,959
You've got class tomorrow. Go on.

879
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,924
Honey.

880
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:11,884
Honey.

881
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,470
Let's get you to the bedroom. Come.

882
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,097
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

883
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,292
I just want to be somebody.

884
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:03,310
It's a bull market.

885
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,645
Great.

886
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,942
"Jin-woo"

887
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,194
GENERAL MANAGER DO JIN-WOO

888
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:13,612
"Can I have your address?"

889
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,117
"I want to pick you up,

890
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,411
but I need the address."

891
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,496
This punk.

892
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,291
He should have sent it already.
So much for seniority.

893
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,881
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim. I was too busy.

894
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,091
It's Building 201.

895
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,510
Jeez.

896
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,469
YOUR FULL ADDRESS

897
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,681
It's right across from Mr. Baek's place.
It could be confusing.

898
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,853
You may find it more convenient to type
"Banpo River Palace Building 201"

899
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,104
into the GPS.

900
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,068
Good morning.

901
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,029
I'm on my way.

902
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,406
Hi, Nak-su. Come to think of it,

903
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,117
I realized I left my golf bag
in Jin-woo's car.

904
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,245
I'll just walk to his place.
See you there.

905
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,749
Okay. I'll be there.

906
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:17,509
BANPO BRIDGE
WELCOME TO SEOCHO

907
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,641
"Palace," my foot.

908
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,185
What are they? Royalty living in a palace?

909
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,034
Jin-woo is so young, though. Jeez.

910
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,828
I bet he's on a key money lease.

911
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,915
Please be on a key money system.

912
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,500
He has to be.

913
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,180
How much is the key money lease?

914
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:08,644
Key money for River Palace.

915
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,979
3.8 BILLION
3.7 BILLION

916
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,274
How can it be?

917
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,279
Can you open the trunk, please?

918
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,532
Sure.

919
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,661
I've been going crazy these days.

920
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,997
Looks like there's an issue
with your address position.

921
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:29,998
Is that so?

922
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,626
If your right arm is bent,
your backswing can be too fast,

923
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,253
and you're more likely to slice.

924
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,004
Darn it.

925
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,173
I should have shown it to you sooner.

926
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,467
Gosh, so much traffic.

927
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,678
Sorry, Nak-su.
I'll hop into the front seat in a minute.

928
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,431
Don't worry.
Whatever feels comfortable for you.

929
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,933
The back seat is so spacious.

930
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,476
Right?

931
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,061
I'd love a big car like this.

932
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,439
Okay. My right arm.

933
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,190
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes.

934
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,944
How's the new apartment?

935
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,947
I'm only renting here monthly,
so it's temporary.

936
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,159
You bought early
and pocketed some cash, huh?

937
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,410
-Hardly.
-What?

938
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,495
The price's gone up a bit
since I bought it.

939
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,581
-Here.
-My right arm?

940
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,916
-Yes, your right arm.
-He owns it!

941
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,919
Why are you gaping like that?

942
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,050
Shall I drive?

943
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,219
-Can you…
-Shall I?

944
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,220
Thank you.

945
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,808
You get a turn, and I get a turn.
It sounds sweet,

946
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,352
but it's also perfect
for drawing unnecessary suspicion.

947
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,312
RIVER PALACE PRICES

948
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,563
Jeez, come on.

949
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,399
Don't be so pessimistic.

950
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:40,527
If you think about the bidding price,
it's a risk worth taking.

951
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,737
6.8 BILLION
6.7 BILLION

952
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,781
I'm not sure.

953
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,204
Going with a separate contract structure…

954
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,414
Did he come just to play around?

955
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,043
ACT won't be the only one
who will benefit from it.

956
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,503
Nak-su!

957
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:58,712
What are you doing? Come!

958
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,088
Yes, sir.

959
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,257
KIM NAK-SU

960
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:19,191
I always crush him
whenever we bet on golf.

961
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,568
He's a total sucker.

962
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,821
Still, his form's actually pretty solid.

963
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,781
-You think?
-Yes. Look at him.

964
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,158
He's not using any unnecessary force.

965
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,410
He must have inherited it.

966
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,288
Maybe not. Sneaky bastard.

967
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,416
Acting all honorable,
acting like he's not into investments.

968
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,417
What a phony bastard.

969
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,044
Just wait. I'll get there.

970
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,255
I'll get there.

971
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,508
I'll become an executive

972
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,095
and make my way
to Gangnam, Seocho, and Hannam.

973
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,596
Good shot.

974
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,611
It went in.

975
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,405
-Hole-in-one!
-It went in!

976
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,533
-What the heck?
-A hole-in-one?

977
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,784
-Hey!
-Oh my.

978
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,619
It's a hole-in-one!

979
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,248
That's a hole-in-one!

980
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,208
Mr. Baek!

981
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,503
I can't believe that went in.

982
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:24,965
It's been 15 years, but I've never
claimed my hole-in-one insurance.

983
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,633
You've got coverage, right?

984
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,510
No, I don't.

985
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:29,845
Not even one-day coverage?

986
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:30,929
No.

987
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,686
KIM NAK-SU

988
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,104
I mean, nothing's impossible.

989
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,188
CONGRATULATIONS
HOLE-IN-ONE

990
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,899
Mr. Hole-in-One, stand in the center.

991
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,483
-Come to the center.
-I'm good.

992
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:44,943
Come on.

993
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,070
-The star of the day.
-Closer, please.

994
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,322
Here we go.

995
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,574
One, two, three.

996
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,910
Good! Let's see some bigger smiles.

997
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,461
DREAM BANK

998
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,046
Thank you for today.

999
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,173
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1000
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,133
-Right. And sir?
-Yes.

1001
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,093
You're getting
the commemorative ball, right?

1002
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,094
A commemorative ball?

1003
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,971
This is a real good-luck charm.

1004
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,181
Everyone buys one.

1005
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,185
Sure.

1006
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,687
-Go for it all.
-I'll ring it up for you.

1007
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,325
There.

1008
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,827
This is where it gets really amazing.

1009
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,622
This one's called the Nak-su Bomb!

1010
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,040
Down it goes!

1011
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,753
Pour it all in.

1012
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,838
-All right.
-What?

1013
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,883
The last par!

1014
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,596
We are no longer competitors.

1015
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,390
We're partners!

1016
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,642
Let's love each other!

1017
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,435
-Love each other!
-Love each other!

1018
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,108
Let's order some more meat.

1019
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,151
-Shall we?
-Eight more servings!

1020
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,611
That will be 2,490,000 won.

1021
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,863
Sorry?

1022
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,407
It's 2,490,000 won.

1023
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,701
Right.

1024
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,494
Shall I chip in?

1025
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,287
Goodness. Just go already.

1026
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:20,247
-Take him.
-Okay.

1027
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,124
I'll pay in full.

1028
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,083
Here.

1029
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,210
In full.

1030
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,796
What do I do now?

1031
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,755
RECEIPT

1032
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,178
Mr. Baek.

1033
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,976
Holy cow!

1034
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,562
Be careful.

1035
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,480
-Is this pure gold?
-I paid 1.5 million won.

1036
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,650
We should have bought it for you.

1037
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:49,860
Please. That's not necessary.

1038
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,529
You did a good job.

1039
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,198
You need to pay good money
for something like this.

1040
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:56,658
That was no ordinary luck.

1041
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,702
That was a stroke of great fortune!

1042
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,663
My number one treasure,

1043
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,373
Kim Nak-su!

1044
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,168
The managing director.

1045
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,754
Thank you.

1046
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,130
Okay.

1047
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,427
Let's have coffee in my office
this afternoon.

1048
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,553
Okay.

1049
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,099
Your boss scored a hole-in-one.

1050
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:22,559
Take good care of him.

1051
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,314
You know how crucial this is, right?

1052
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,942
Let's have a successful
first half of the year.

1053
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,070
Numbers make the man.

1054
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,112
Yes, sir.

1055
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,576
Bye, sir.

1056
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,872
-Bye, sir.
-All right.

1057
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:47,042
Mr. Kim, I did the final check,
and there's something ambiguous.

1058
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,043
Ambiguous?

1059
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,170
The estimate for
the Yangpyeong Dream Cultural Center

1060
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,131
is a bit ambiguous,
so I'd like for you to take a look.

1061
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,218
What's ambiguous?

1062
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,137
The quote was based on Super Giga,

1063
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,848
but this area isn't covered yet.

1064
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,188
CONSTRUCTION MAP
SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST 2025

1065
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,816
That's not true. They're getting
Giga Internet starting in August.

1066
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,610
Yes, but we have to start
the service next week.

1067
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,655
What? Is there a problem?

1068
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,657
No, sir.

1069
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,700
What's there to worry about?

1070
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,788
Get it installed.
It's just a few months at most.

1071
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,665
-No need to hesitate. Come on.
-Okay.

1072
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,459
Come see me around 2:00 p.m.

1073
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,502
I will.

1074
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,964
-Bye, sir.
-Bye, sir.

1075
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,511
Hey.

1076
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,140
They won't be doing
any speed checks or anything,

1077
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,892
but make sure nothing goes wrong, okay?

1078
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,437
-You know what I mean, right?
-Yes, sir.

1079
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,106
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

1080
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,994
Hello.

1081
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,036
It's been a while.

1082
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,789
What brings you here?

1083
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,587
I just…

1084
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,050
Have you eaten?

1085
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,136
No.

1086
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,598
Let's go. Give me a second.

1087
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,522
Is there absolutely no way?

1088
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,152
I guess I can arrange
a meeting over a meal.

1089
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,946
That's more than enough.
I'll take care of the rest.

1090
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,784
The HR team already made the call.

1091
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,329
I don't see how Jeong-tae
can get you out of this.

1092
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,540
Still, I need to try.

1093
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,505
Nak-su, I…

1094
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,052
I go up and down those manholes
dozens of times a day,

1095
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,597
opening and closing the lids.

1096
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,893
But it's so dark down there.

1097
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,148
I really feel
like I'm going to die, Nak-su.

1098
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,486
I bet those bastards

1099
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:23,323
never planned on sending me
to Ulleungdo in the first place.

1100
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,368
Looking at it now, they just want me
to quit on my own.

1101
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,786
Buddy.

1102
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,206
Did you only just figure that out?

1103
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,084
-What?
-I'll be straight with you.

1104
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,379
I feel embarrassed
about having to go to Jeong-tae and say,

1105
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,548
"My buddy's about to get demoted.
Could you please look out for him?"

1106
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,342
At a time like this,

1107
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,512
I don't want to sound
like I'm oblivious to reality.

1108
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,639
I'm desperate too.

1109
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,350
I've been a general manager for six years.
This is my last year.

1110
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:54,062
You think I don't notice how the company
pampers that kid, Do Jin-woo?

1111
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,400
But we're colleagues.

1112
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,860
We came in together, Nak-su.

1113
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,321
Stop making that face. I'm so sick of it.

1114
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,866
Stop acting like you're the victim.

1115
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,785
I'm the victim, not you.

1116
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,550
-Song-hee.
-Yes, sir.

1117
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,742
-Here.
-Thank you.

1118
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,416
I know you're up for a promotion

1119
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,085
to assistant manager next year,

1120
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,129
but…

1121
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,216
how about you get it the year after next

1122
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,177
when you turn 30?

1123
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,346
Sorry?

1124
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,597
The thing is,

1125
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,476
Tae-hwan hasn't even made
senior manager in over ten years.

1126
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,145
I'm not saying this because
he and I came in together.

1127
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,688
For our team's morale--

1128
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,190
Did I underperform this year?

1129
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,277
You did great, but…

1130
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,864
If everyone gets the same evaluation,
he won't stand out.

1131
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:32,285
So if the team members sacrifice a little

1132
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,705
and let Tae-hwan
take the credit, you know?

1133
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,083
You know what I mean, right?

1134
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:40,835
No, I don't.

1135
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:45,632
No, you're smart. I'm sure you do.

1136
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,759
Go get Sung-gu for me.

1137
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,178
-Mr. Kim.
-You'll get a good evaluation next year.

1138
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,638
Go get Sung-gu.

1139
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,241
Just to promote you,

1140
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,576
I stalled everyone else
on our team for one or two years.

1141
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,079
What more could I have done?

1142
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,665
I get it. You must feel wronged

1143
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,958
and betrayed by the company.

1144
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,794
Sure, it's inhumane.
Maybe even brutal. I know.

1145
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,339
But come on, the company is not a charity.

1146
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,343
For 25 years, whether you did well or not,
the company paid you every month.

1147
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,721
Sounds to me like the company's done
its share, don't you think?

1148
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:42,814
Tae-hwan,

1149
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,191
accept the reality now.

1150
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,527
And go find another job

1151
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,947
where you can be treated
with some respect.

1152
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,741
I think that's the right thing to do.

1153
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,373
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

1154
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,626
It looks like you'll become an executive.

1155
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,464
Cut the sarcasm, man.

1156
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,634
I'll get going then.

1157
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,737
Yes. How many times do I have to tell you?

1158
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,323
Yes.

1159
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,367
You made the right decision.

1160
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,705
That's it! We can do this!

1161
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:43,708
Yes.

1162
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:06,564
"JUST LIKE HOW YOU LEFT ME WITH A SMILE"
LEE EUN-HA

1163
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,234
Okay, Mr. Choi.

1164
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,403
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

1165
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:21,246
Nak-su, the conversation went well.

1166
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:22,956
Whenever there's a government bid,

1167
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,792
the three companies
will pull together from now on.

1168
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,002
That's good news.

1169
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:29,796
It's all thanks to your hole-in-one.

1170
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,256
Please.

1171
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,757
Everyone just loved the energy.

1172
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,510
-Well done.
-Thank you.

1173
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:37,887
-Bro.
-Yes.

1174
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,556
I have something to ask you.

1175
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,683
Go on.

1176
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:46,604
Those cruel HR bastards.

1177
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,941
I think they took it a little far.

1178
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,026
-But Nak-su.
-Yes.

1179
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:56,197
I'm the one who made the call on Tae-hwan.

1180
01:07:58,658 --> 01:07:59,576
A month ago,

1181
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,453
HR asked me for a list of underperformers

1182
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,163
in the sales division.

1183
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,292
I kind of knew what was going on,

1184
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,961
but I didn't know you made that call.

1185
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,130
I didn't know
they'd ship him off to Ulleungdo.

1186
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,798
That was too harsh.

1187
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,344
I'm the one who handed them the list,

1188
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:22,098
so I can't exactly go back on my word now.

1189
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,641
You know what I mean, right?

1190
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,268
Sorry?

1191
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,355
Yes, I understand.

1192
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,691
You two started together, right?

1193
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:32,650
Yes.

1194
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,863
I know you've been helping him
here and there.

1195
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,657
You've done enough.

1196
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,410
It's time to think about yourself
and move on.

1197
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,203
Look.

1198
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,040
You cause a stir over something like this,

1199
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,876
and it will count against
your promotion to executive.

1200
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,086
Tell him to think it over.

1201
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,422
It could be better for him
to walk away now.

1202
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,635
The severance budgets
for voluntary retirement are fixed.

1203
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:03,056
If he applies late, it will run out.
He won't get anything.

1204
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,980
He might actually be better off
if he opened a dealership or something.

1205
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,651
-I'll talk to him about it.
-Okay.

1206
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:17,278
Tell him to stay away from trouble.

1207
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,657
I will. If you'll excuse me now.

1208
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,908
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

1209
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,618
I'm feeling the good vibe.

1210
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,664
Let's do well this year

1211
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,415
and deliver great results.

1212
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:30,667
Okay.

1213
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,420
What the heck?

1214
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,759
They locked down the parking lot.

1215
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:44,222
What for?

1216
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:46,808
A SAFETY INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED

1217
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,601
Jeez. I need to get going soon.

1218
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,645
Has there been an accident?

1219
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:08,246
I just talked to Jeong-tae.

1220
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,290
Hello, is this
Mr. Heo Tae-hwan's emergency contact?

1221
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,250
Sorry?

1222
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,877
It's an emergency.
Are you Mr. Heo's emergency contact?

1223
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,505
Hello?

1224
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,173
Hello?

1225
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,511
Wake up! Hurry!

1226
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,042
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

1227
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:28,618
The reporters seem to have caught on.

1228
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,370
Go and smooth things over in advance.

1229
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,207
I rose through the ranks
without skipping a single promotion.

1230
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,835
And recently,
I secured a major project by myself.

1231
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,547
Nak-su, why is your team falling

1232
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,133
-so far behind Do Jin-woo's?
-Rock, paper, scissors!

1233
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:47,011
Do you want to join
your father's company after graduating?

1234
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,429
No, of course not!

1235
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,098
How about working with us?

1236
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,227
You survived as a general manager
at a big company,

1237
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,687
bought an apartment in Seoul,
and sent me to college. So what?

1238
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,606
You'll have to choose someone else.

1239
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,818
A senior manager or higher
with over 20 years at the company.

1240
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,486
I'll be an executive next year.

1241
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,570
Awesome!

1242
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,823
I'm 99.9 percent sure. Got that?
