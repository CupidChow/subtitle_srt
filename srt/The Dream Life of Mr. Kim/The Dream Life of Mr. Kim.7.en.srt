00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,133
Five, six, seven, eight.

3
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,261
One, two, three.

4
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,100
Do the safety exercises properly!

5
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,732
Stop fooling around.

6
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,282
Back to your positions.

7
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,244
We'll go by my count, no music,
starting with number eight.

8
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,706
-He's freaking scary.
-Begin.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,001
You got zapped at karaoke last night.

10
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,960
Oh, that?

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,839
Who's laughing? Answer me!

12
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,425
Your names.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,845
Your names!

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,389
-Lee Dal-jae.
-And the one next to him.

15
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,433
-Choi Mi-ra.
-What was that?

16
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,810
-Choi Mi-ra!
-Choi Mi-ra.

17
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,271
One warning each
for safety rule violations.

18
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,480
What?

19
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,149
-This is ridiculous. I--
-Quiet.

20
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,401
Again. Back to your positions.

21
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,032
We're starting again from number eight.

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,491
Begin.

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,667
Safety slogan, ready!

24
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,587
Start!

25
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,214
-Helmets!
-Helmet, check! Uniform, check!

26
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,174
Safety shoes, check!

27
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,134
-Safety, safety, safety!
-Safety, safety, safety!

28
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,637
Again, with discipline! Start!

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,763
Helmet, check!

30
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,848
Uniform, check! Safety shoes, check!

31
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,351
-Safety, safety, safety!
-Safety, safety, safety!

32
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,187
Less doubt…

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,938
-More determination!
-More determination!

34
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,651
Dismissed.

35
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,070
Move it, people. Hurry!

36
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,118
What is this?

37
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,666
It's a ladder. Why do you ask?

38
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,710
A ladder with no work platform
is a safety rule violation.

39
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,506
I don't use it for work.
I use it as a chair.

40
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,388
Then get a proper chair to sit on.

41
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,598
I'll put it away.

42
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,478
Why won't this thing fold?

43
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,313
It's stiff.

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,735
Your chin strap.

45
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,654
Excuse me?

46
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,197
I said, fasten your chin strap.

47
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,579
Why is your helmet so small?
Don't you have any that fit?

48
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,581
What's all this right here?

49
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,208
Tidy it up.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,753
No one cleans up around here.

51
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,380
What the heck?

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,842
What are you doing?

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,886
Ms. Lee.

54
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,013
I asked what you're doing.

55
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,016
Something's wrong, so I'm checking it out.

56
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,351
What's wrong?

57
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,146
The load ratio's higher than usual,
and there's a bearing problem.

58
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,355
Is that urgent?

59
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,316
Yes.

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,111
I was walking very slowly,

61
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,613
and I almost tripped
and fell over all this.

62
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,741
When everyone rushes out to grab lunch,

63
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,242
it's going to be dangerous.

64
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,370
Yes, I understand,

65
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,247
but I need to do this now.

66
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,666
Who said you couldn't?

67
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,003
I said to clean up!

68
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,637
I'll be back in an hour
to check this again.

69
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,473
And that's not an empty threat.

70
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,725
You and your excuses.

71
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,028
What's with that guy this morning?

72
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,280
Did he fight with his wife or something?

73
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,865
Take it out. We'll fix this later.

74
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,908
Let's get that.

75
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,338
What's this?

76
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,590
-It's about voluntary retirement.
-What?

77
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,258
The application period is one month.

78
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,760
Think it over and let us know.

79
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,844
BULLETIN BOARD

80
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,012
What is this?

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,931
Was this announced today?

82
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,643
They want us to post it here too.
As if anyone here would apply.

83
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,355
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT APPLICATIONS

84
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,023
What? All of a sudden?

85
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,317
-What is it?
-I haven't heard anything.

86
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,322
EPISODE 7
CAUGHT IN THE DOWNPOUR

87
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,657
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT APPLICATION

88
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,952
-The company must be in real trouble.
-Song-hee, we should start coming early.

89
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,246
We can't draw attention
to ourselves in times like these.

90
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,247
Be invisible.

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,040
Be invisible.

92
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,211
-Sung-gu.
-Jeez! What is it?

93
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,712
-Gosh.
-What? Why?

94
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,507
I've been hearing whispers
about Mr. Kim coming back.

95
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,508
What?

96
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,301
Damn you.

97
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,803
Don't say stuff like that right now.

98
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,056
Mr. Do is already
looking at me differently as it is.

99
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,140
Why do you say that?

100
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,184
He's supposed to pick 20 people

101
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,186
from the factory for a layoff list.

102
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,605
Wait. The factory is offering
voluntary retirement too?

103
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,774
Why would Mr. Kim make that list?

104
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,609
Apparently, that's what the job entails.

105
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,444
Would writing up that list

106
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,363
bring him back to HQ?

107
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,700
There's a precedent.

108
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,869
So that's what that was about.

109
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,705
Mr. Kim asked me to look up
that one executive.

110
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,873
Which executive?

111
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,083
Who was it? There was someone.

112
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,628
He became an executive
right after coming back from the factory.

113
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,923
This must be a real headache.

114
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,719
Good luck staying off the list.

115
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,472
-Go on. Get lost.
-Later.

127
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,705
Just keep a low profile

128
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,375
and leave whenever you want.
That's all you have to do.

129
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,798
For the first time since coming here,
I feel like I'm doing real work.

00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,363
Mr. Kim.

136
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,031
-Come this way.
-For what?

137
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,158
You should go ahead and eat first.

138
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,368
No, it's fine.

139
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,119
We insist. You must be very busy.

140
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,788
-Mr. Kim, move to the front.
-What?

141
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,997
Are they serious?

142
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,707
-Go ahead.
-We'll eat after you.

143
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,002
-What was the point of coming early?
-Unbelievable.

144
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,796
Pile it on.

145
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,049
Gosh.

146
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,718
That's… Okay, that's enough.

147
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,261
Thank you so much.

148
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,150
RICE KEEPS US GOING!

149
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,694
We always have extras.

150
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,751
Attention, all employees.

151
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,838
Thank you for your hard work today.

152
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,257
Have a safe trip home.

153
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,218
-See ya.
-You too.

154
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,554
-I'm heading out.
-Wait. Let's go together.

155
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,723
-Have a good one.
-You too.

156
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,433
-See you tomorrow.
-You too.

157
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,810
-Take care.
-You too.

158
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,395
-Good night, Mr. Kim.
-You too, Mr. Kim.

159
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,063
-You too.
-One second, Mr. Kim.

160
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,692
We need to talk.

161
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,694
About what?

162
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,238
You go on ahead.

163
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,785
What is it?

164
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,496
A notice for voluntary retirement
was suddenly put up.

165
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,040
Have you heard anything?

166
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,792
Heard what?
That was also my first time seeing it.

167
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,170
It's just a little strange.

168
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,256
No one here would ever apply
for voluntary retirement.

169
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,507
HQ knows that very well.

170
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,010
Then ask headquarters yourself.
Why ask me?

171
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,095
You don't usually give a damn.

172
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,680
I could say the same thing to you.

173
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,099
You've never given a damn
about the factory.

174
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,392
What's with the sudden change?

175
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,102
I'm just doing my job.

176
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,813
You said you guys take the hit
when non-experts are in charge.

177
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,732
I'm trying to do things right.

178
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,691
Is that a problem?

179
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,402
Are we done here?

180
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,738
I'm leaving.

181
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,493
Are you hiding something?

182
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,623
Are you HQ's errand boy?

183
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,334
I figured

184
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,503
something was going on.

185
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,590
Don't cross the line.

186
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,072
-Hey, son.
-Dad, are you off work?

187
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,073
Yes. Why?

188
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,326
Have you had dinner yet?

189
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,328
No, I haven't. Why do you ask?

190
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,332
I was wondering
if we could have dinner together.

191
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,377
I'd like that, but I'm in Asan.

192
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,296
Yes, I'm nearby too.

193
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,883
There he is, Han-na.

194
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,843
What?

195
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,929
EMPLOYEE DORMITORY

196
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,520
-Dad.
-Oh, hey. Hi--

197
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,980
Hello, Mr. Kim.

198
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,773
Hello.

199
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,818
-Go ahead and park.
-Okay.

200
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,868
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

201
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,494
Oh my.

202
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,955
Goodness.

203
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,665
Come in.

204
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,377
Gosh.

205
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,511
So what did you want to explain to me?

206
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,597
Next.

207
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,310
Even with short consumption cycles,

208
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,354
our loyal customer base,
with its strong brand loyalty,

209
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,608
would gladly open their wallets

210
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,402
even if we were to make
fire extinguishers or gas masks.

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,279
-Okay.
-Next.

212
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,405
PROFIT IS INCALCULABLE

213
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,408
That's it.
Thank you for listening, Mr. Kim.

214
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,286
All right. Thank you.

215
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,248
So you're explaining this to me because…

216
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,875
Su-gyeom has become

217
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,879
the CEO of our company,
Jealousy, My Strength.

218
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,632
That company you mentioned a while back

219
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,218
-about destruction?
-Yes, that one.

220
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,636
That's what happened.

221
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,096
Gosh. So you're the CEO there now.

222
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,476
-Congratulations.
-Mr. Kim. We have the ideas.

223
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,270
And ACT has the infrastructure.

224
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,981
What if we formed a strategic alliance?

225
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,775
An "alliance"?

226
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,109
Or you could invest.

227
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,028
"Invest"?

228
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,366
You should explain now as the CEO.

229
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,912
-Well, we--
-Wait a minute.

230
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,457
Ms. Han-na, could I speak
with Su-gyeom alone?

231
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,293
Yes.

232
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,593
We'll be right back. Let's go.

233
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,185
Thirty million won?

234
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,520
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,855
-Does your mother know?
-No, she doesn't.

236
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,148
Did you gamble?

237
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,650
No.

238
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,485
Then were you scammed or something?

239
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,281
Tell me the truth.
Did someone scam you or what?

240
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,331
When do you need it by?

241
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,543
Whenever it's convenient for you.

242
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,670
Anytime.

243
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,673
Are you sure it's 30 million?
Will that be enough?

244
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,591
Yes.

245
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,844
All right. I will figure something out.

246
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,181
Don't say a word to your mother, okay?

247
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,309
It'll just complicate things.

248
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,227
Thanks, Dad. Thank you.

249
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,484
What's going on between you
and that woman?

250
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,111
Don't look.

251
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,199
I don't really know.

252
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,035
What do you mean?

253
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,666
At least get her some food
before you take her home.

254
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,501
Here.

255
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,587
-Dad.
-Take it.

256
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,769
-Thank you, sir.
-Of course.

257
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,145
We'll get going, Dad.

258
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,521
Call me when you get home.

259
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,145
Now that we have our seed money,

260
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,064
what should we do first?

261
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,357
I don't know.

262
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,610
Maybe we should get new nameplates made.

263
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,238
Just kidding.

264
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,115
Wasn't it funny?

265
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,118
Also, the office is too big
for just the two of us.

266
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,871
-Don't you think?
-I'm putting it on the market.

267
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,999
Until we decide on a product,
we can work at school.

268
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,584
Okay. Let's do that.

269
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,794
Han-na.

270
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,463
We have to do this right this time.

271
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,632
And stop talking about
things like nameplates.

272
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,384
Okay.

273
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,845
I'm really going to try--

274
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,972
I'm saying this
because I'm seriously worried.

275
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,267
My dad made a difficult decision
to give us that money.

276
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,645
But you're starting to sound
just like Lee Jeong-hwan.

277
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,693
Are you comparing me
to that damn con artist?

278
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,819
No.

279
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,613
-I wasn't comparing.
-Then what was it?

280
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,199
Why bring him up all of a sudden?

281
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,955
-What is it?
-You kissed him!

282
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,408
HEAD OF HR

283
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,784
It's difficult, isn't it?

284
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,244
It's not easy.

285
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,747
That's right. It's not a simple task.

286
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,083
To suspend or dismiss someone
for safety violations,

287
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,543
the violations need to be repeated,

288
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,838
or there must be a major one.

289
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,632
You're right.

290
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,597
Sir.

291
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,683
Do you happen to have
a box of tissues in your office?

292
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,103
Yes, I do.

293
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,648
Okay. Could you pull out

294
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,525
all the tissues from the box?

295
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,484
What?

296
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,403
Put all the employees' names in the box,

297
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,448
give the box a good shake,
and draw 20 names.

298
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,244
We'll let those people go.

299
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,289
What kind of nonsense is this?

300
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,792
Right. It makes no sense.

301
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,378
But if you don't help us,

302
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,380
we might have to go with that.

303
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,507
Gosh.

304
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,801
This feels so wrong.

305
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,303
We did put out
a voluntary retirement notice, right?

306
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,014
But they wouldn't even
look at it, would they?

307
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,099
That's what I'm saying.

308
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,643
The atmosphere
here at headquarters is the same.

309
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,353
This is really killing me.

310
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,480
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

311
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,735
Sir, let's get the factory
back to normal quickly

312
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,822
and help them come up
with a Plan B for their lives.

313
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,282
If we don't do this right,

314
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,827
we'll have another unfortunate incident
like with Manager Heo Tae-hwan.

315
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,038
I'm asking for your help
because it's a difficult job.

316
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,000
And since it's difficult,
I'll make sure you're well compensated.

317
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,586
Please help me.

318
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,299
Keep your promise.

319
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,634
Of course. You have three days left.

320
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,679
I'll be waiting for your call, sir.

321
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,329
Mr. Kim. Thanks for everything you do.

322
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,707
-Hi.
-Please take a look over here.

323
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,710
That's right. I completely organized
all the nipple dies.

324
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,003
-Looks neat, right?
-It does.

325
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,840
They might all look similar,
but they have different uses.

326
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,842
But as for me,

327
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,303
I can tell at a glance
where everything goes.

328
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,722
The reason I can tell them all apart is

329
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,058
because I am a certified electrician.

330
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,477
What's with the sudden intro?

331
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,896
No reason. I just wanted to let you know.

332
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,856
Mr. Kim.

333
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,233
Keep up the good work.

334
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,236
Thank you.

335
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,864
Chin strap.

336
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,574
Just carry on as usual.

337
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,369
Carry on, everyone.

338
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,250
Clean this area up.

339
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,044
Get rid of this.

340
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,298
Why is this missing?

341
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,133
I need your name.

342
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,760
-I'm sorry.
-Your name!

343
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,011
One-point deduction.

344
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,721
I can't get a reading.

345
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,765
Yeah, it's not showing anything, right?

346
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,184
-Yes.
-Is it the bearing?

347
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,815
Let's do this.

348
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,574
What?

349
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,702
That's a perfect split!

350
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,169
Congratulations!

351
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,131
-Congratulations, sir!
-Congratulations!

352
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,098
Let's just clap.
We don't want to get on his bad side.

353
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,976
Congratulations!

354
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,199
So then…

355
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,794
2025 INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION FORM

356
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,841
ACT CHICKEN GRAND OPENING
WE FRY AT 5G SPEEDS

357
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,012
Sooner or later,
reality will hit you hard.

358
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,598
Give me a call once it does.

359
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,609
JINPYEONG BRANCH
23 JINPYEONG-RO, ASAN-SI, CHUNGNAM

360
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,736
Are you interested in taking over?

361
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,905
-Come on.
-Excuse me?

362
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,199
You'd be great at running a chicken place.

363
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,034
I can leave all the equipment as is.

364
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,954
Plus, the fridge is already stocked
with the sauce I make.

365
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,791
That's not why I came here. I--

366
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,710
You could sell
sweet and crispy chicken or something.

367
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,380
I don't really have
the knack for that sort of thing.

368
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,551
I came to ask you a few questions

369
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,303
about how things work at the factory.

370
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,014
What would a guy
who only cleaned up dog poop know?

371
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,934
I don't know anything. Nope.

372
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,771
Sorry to bother you.

373
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,314
I'll just be going, then.

374
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,316
Wait. Come on.

375
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,276
-Not so fast.
-Excuse me?

376
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,988
Just buy a chicken, will you?

377
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,115
If you do,

378
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,201
then, who knows, I might be able

379
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,704
to give you some tips
on the inner workings of the factory.

380
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,334
Okay. Please make one quickly
so it's nice and crispy.

381
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,670
-Is regular fried chicken okay?
-Yes.

382
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,046
You do know something, right?

383
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,005
-Of course.
-Okay.

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,803
-Chicken!
-Yes! This is going to be so good!

385
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,013
I call dibs on this chair!

386
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,723
I told you not to run.

387
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,101
Hello.

388
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,311
Hello there. Two as usual?

389
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:36,647
Just one for today.

390
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,899
Just one today?

391
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,068
The kids always eat so well.
Isn't that right?

392
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,696
We ate something before coming here.

393
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,780
What?

394
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,407
No, we didn't.

395
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,120
We'll just have one today.

396
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,163
All right. Have a seat.

397
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,249
My only regulars.

398
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,167
Please wait a moment.

399
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,921
-Hello.
-Hey, honey.

400
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,257
-Mom, hurry!
-Sit over here.

401
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,758
All right, I'm coming.

402
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,760
You didn't get the kids any soda, right?

403
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,262
-No.
-Don't get them any.

404
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,351
Hello.

405
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,981
-Do you know him?
-Yes, he's my team leader at work.

406
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,692
It's a pleasure to meet you.

407
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,110
I'm her husband.

408
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,570
Hello.

409
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,322
You should say hello.

410
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

411
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,284
Hi there, kids. Please sit down.

412
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,415
Did you order yet?

413
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,375
-Yes.
-I see.

414
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,502
Should we get it to go?

415
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,005
Mi-ra's not coming home tonight.
Let's eat in my room.

416
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,841
-Okay.
-Please don't. Enjoy your meal here.

417
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,676
I was just about to leave anyway.

418
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,180
Excuse me.
You haven't started my order yet, right?

419
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,057
I'm already frying it.

420
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,476
Oh, dear. In that case…

421
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,064
Ms. Lee, I'm not feeling very well.

422
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,733
Please take the chicken I ordered
and enjoy it with the kids.

423
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,692
Pardon?

424
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,569
No, we're fine, really.

425
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,322
Sir, here's the money.

426
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,743
When the chicken's ready,
please bring it to that table.

427
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,912
Wait. We still need to talk
about my restaurant.

428
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,039
Later. I'll come back another time.

429
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,583
-Mr. Kim.
-Don't worry. I've already paid for it.

430
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,584
Say thank you.

431
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,961
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

432
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,296
You're welcome. Enjoy your meal.

433
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,846
I'll be right back.

434
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:34,932
-Mr. Kim.
-Gosh.

435
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,517
I told you I can't eat right now--

436
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,268
You left this behind.

437
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,649
Thank you.

438
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,193
Gosh.

439
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,755
You should go inside.

440
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,481
RESUME
LEE SANG-MIN

441
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,540
FATHER: HOSPITALIZED FOR HYPERTENSION
MOTHER: DECEASED

442
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:24,833
MARRIED, TWO DAUGHTERS, ONE SON

443
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,753
FATHER: HOSPITALIZED FOR HYPERTENSION
MOTHER: HOMEBOUND DUE TO POOR HEALTH

444
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,519
Watch yourselves. Be careful.

445
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,813
What's this?

446
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,981
This isn't wrapped, is it?

447
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,149
This needs to be wrapped.

448
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,444
I've told you. Keep this area organized.

449
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,321
-Yes, sir.
-One-point deduction.

450
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,573
-But sir--
-Your name.

451
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,034
Park Seon-myeong, Materials Team.

452
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,536
Park--

453
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,872
-Attention, please.
-What's going on?

454
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,749
-A fire has broken out.
-Did something explode?

455
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,543
Locate the fire. Go. Hurry!

456
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,380
-Where is it?
-Fire!

457
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,881
Where's the extinguisher?

458
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,303
Mi-ra! Get them all out of here!

459
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,693
Over here!

460
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,654
Fire! Over here!

461
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,616
Get them out of here!

462
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,417
Get them out of here! Let's go!

463
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,835
Get out of here! Now!

464
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,463
Where's the fire extinguisher?
Where is it?

465
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,425
Hit the circuit breaker! Now!

466
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,662
Ms. Lee!

467
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,748
Ms. Lee!

468
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,452
Thank you.

469
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,001
The bearings of the machine
have been causing a lot of issues lately.

470
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,211
And also--

471
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,088
Hold on a moment.

472
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,258
Gosh, this is way too sweet.

473
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,551
How did I ever drink this stuff?

474
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,515
But then again,

475
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,434
you folks working in the factory
need this kind of thing for energy.

476
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,228
Isn't that right?

477
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,065
According to the safety checklist,
there haven't been any issues for months.

478
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,901
Circles, circles,

479
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,112
and more circles.

480
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,992
Those who've been
at the factory long enough

481
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,576
can hear the sound of the engine

482
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,248
and think,
"The machine is off rhythm today."

483
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,751
But this isn't something
a non-expert like him can identify,

484
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,630
since we sent him here
for our own convenience.

485
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,590
Wouldn't you agree?

486
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,218
Yes, that's right.

487
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,724
I don't think it's right
to point fingers here.

488
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,769
We should look at the overall systems
and staffing issues at the Asan factory.

489
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,981
I believe it's time we re-evaluate them.

490
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,359
The injured workers
have all been discharged, correct?

491
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,111
-Yes.
-Ms. Lee.

492
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,782
How many total workers were on the line
where the accident occurred?

493
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,035
Twenty-one people.

494
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,619
Okay, 21 people.

495
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,668
In that case, could I get a list
of the workers from that line?

496
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:46,595
Things just got a lot easier,
don't you think?

497
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:54,519
Let's cite the workers from that line
for safety negligence

498
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,272
and let them all go.
The numbers line up anyway.

499
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,440
Twenty-one people.

500
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,363
Come on.

501
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,822
What's the problem?

502
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,657
A safety accident occurred.

503
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,286
Shouldn't the Safety Management
Team Leader

504
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,497
take responsibility?

505
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,540
Exactly.

506
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:21,338
So take responsibility and step down.

507
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,299
Come to headquarters
and bring your report.

508
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,595
I know this wasn't easy work,

509
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,555
but you wrapped it up nicely.

510
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,392
You did such a great job.
I really mean it, Mr. Kim.

511
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:37,187
Seriously. I'll get going now.

512
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,772
Wait, this is…

513
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,691
You call this "work"?

514
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:46,154
I've been in sales for over 20 years,
working my tail off.

515
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,740
And no matter how I look at it,

516
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,743
it doesn't feel like work.

517
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,370
If you're getting paid, it's work.

518
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,205
Am I wrong?

519
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,875
Did you think you were working
to make Korea an IT powerhouse?

520
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,629
You worked to buy your wife a purse
and pay for your kid's tutors.

521
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,883
Now that you have a good excuse,
relax and get it done.

522
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,218
Who's going to blame you?

523
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,098
Absolutely no one. You get it?

524
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,768
Just give me the list.
Just the list, okay?

525
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,895
What about the staff at headquarters?

526
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,690
How many of them are getting the axe?

527
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,529
At headquarters?

528
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,656
Three.

529
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,533
No, maybe two? Damn, I don't know.

530
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,618
Wait, you said at least
20 from the factory,

531
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,871
but only two from headquarters?

532
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,664
What about it?

533
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,292
You keep changing your story.
What the heck?

534
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,129
What's with you? Come on, Mr. Kim.

535
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,298
This isn't like you.

536
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,050
You're downsizing the factory
by over 20 percent.

537
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,428
But you're leaving the team
at headquarters untouched?

538
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,806
What kind of restructuring is that?
Does this make any sense at all?

539
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,765
Nak-su.

540
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,436
What really doesn't make sense at all

541
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,230
is for a telecom company to have
a cable factory and run it themselves.

542
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,857
Do you get what I'm saying?

543
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,858
What do you mean?

544
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,527
This place will close next year.

545
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,907
-What?
-The factory is shutting down.

546
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,826
A major corporation
saddled with a dump like this?

547
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,578
We're the only ones
in the world doing this.

548
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,831
That's why we've been gradually
offering voluntary retirement.

549
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,625
If we just shut it down suddenly,

550
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,377
they'd raise all kinds of hell
about illegalities and lawsuits.

551
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,754
Why not say something sooner?

552
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,005
I am saying it now.

553
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,799
-You should've told me from the start!
-And who do you think you are?

554
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:30,926
Hey!

555
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:38,475
Why should I have to explain
every little thing to you?

556
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,310
Am I an errand boy?

557
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,854
You've got to be kidding me.

558
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,442
What's wrong with being an errand boy?

559
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,445
Why are you so full of yourself?
You think you're somebody?

560
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,364
You little bastard.

561
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,553
The Super Giga Internet.

562
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,097
After causing that huge mess,

563
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,100
you should've been fired.
But they spared you.

564
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,436
You should be on your knees
thanking the company.

565
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,439
You might as well be the errand boy.
What else would you do?

566
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,607
Right.

567
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,569
They sent you here for safety management.

568
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,405
That's why this whole mess happened.

569
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,619
Nak-su. Let's do some work.

570
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,581
You can leave if you don't want to.

571
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,211
Jeez.

572
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,720
Mr. Kim.

573
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,724
You've got two days left.
We still have a long way to go.

574
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,684
I'm asking for your cooperation.

575
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,504
DO NOT CROSS THIS LINE

576
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,507
-How many of us will get fired?
-How should I know?

577
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:38,345
The accident happened on our line.
Do we have to take the blame?

578
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,889
Why should we take the blame?

579
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,682
Especially when
there are so many higher-ups.

580
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,185
I told upper management
that there was a problem so many times.

581
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,563
-I still have so many loans to pay off.
-I have so many expenses.

582
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,398
-This is hopeless.
-I agree.

583
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,108
Why is everyone so gloomy?

584
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,946
Why don't we get something to eat?
You must not have had lunch yet.

585
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,282
Let's just go eat. Okay?

586
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,203
Let's eat!

587
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,914
Let's eat.

588
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:08,917
Let's eat.

589
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,752
SEOKAM PORK BARBECUE

590
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,129
Okay. Cheers!

591
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,591
-This stone grill looks amazing.
-Right?

592
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,218
Bon appétit!

593
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,644
This is so juicy.

594
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,854
Told you this place was no joke.

595
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,482
This is really good.
How did you find this place?

596
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,942
I've got a new go-to now.

597
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,152
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

598
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,196
Once Mr. Kim gets back,

599
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,657
we have to go to
Ttokdari Diner day and night.

600
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,535
Wait, is it official?

601
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:47,831
Normally, the head of HR wouldn't go
to the factory over an accident.

602
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,416
So something is definitely up.

603
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,918
-I see.
-Song-hee.

604
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,504
You need to pick the right side.

605
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,589
Isn't your profile picture

606
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,800
the one with your arm around Mr. Do?

607
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,761
You're right. Shoot, what do I do?

608
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,097
RECENT PHOTOS

609
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,225
I'll change it to a group photo
with both of them in it.

610
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,478
"The leaders I look up to."

611
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,188
Hearts.

612
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,648
You're so pathetic.

613
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,444
Whatever, Song-hee.
You can be as noble as this rock here.

614
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,487
I'm not ashamed at all.

615
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,582
LINE 1 PRODUCTION

FINAL LIST OF SAFETY RULE VIOLATORS
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT CANDIDATES

619
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,110
What is it?

620
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,573
If you have nothing to say,
I'm hanging up.

621
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,574
Okay.

622
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,203
-You want me to hang up?
-No.

623
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,079
What's wrong with you?

624
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,081
What were you doing?

625
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,126
I have an interview this weekend.

626
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,587
And I have nothing to wear.

627
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,631
At a real estate agency?

628
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,842
-Yes.
-Then buy something to wear.

629
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,471
Yes, I probably will.

630
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,808
-You should try to get the job.
-I will.

631
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,563
What happened?
You said you didn't want me to work.

632
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,315
I don't know.

633
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,318
Are you sick?

634
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,487
No.

635
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,488
Oh, honey.

636
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:48,201
How much do you think you'll get
for your bonus this fall?

637
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,577
Why do you ask?

638
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,248
Well, I was thinking we could just pay

639
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,000
the rest of our mortgage in full.

640
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,378
What are you talking about?

641
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,381
You know there's a fee
for paying off a loan early.

642
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:05,009
No, it's been over three years,
so the fee is waived.

643
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,555
We're paying eight million won
a year in interest alone.

644
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,640
Let's just pay it off. Okay?

645
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,601
And watching the interest rates
fluctuate stresses me out.

646
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,603
Let's just let it be. All right?

647
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,647
You're just listening to nonsense
from somewhere.

648
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,024
Heard it from whom?

649
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,069
I'm a licensed real estate agent,
remember?

650
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,906
Anyway, when that bonus comes in,
don't you dare touch it.

651
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,993
If we have to, we'll combine it
with next year's Lunar New Year bonus.

652
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,744
-Got it?
-I'm hanging up.

653
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,455
Mom sent you
soy-marinated abalone. Did you get--

654
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,721
Mr. Kim.

655
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,015
Oh, hi.

656
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,474
Have you eaten yet?

657
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,059
-What?
-Of course he hasn't.

658
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,311
-Let's go inside.
-Where?

659
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,353
-Come on.
-What?

660
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,022
-Let's go.
-Inside where?

661
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,607
This way.

662
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,567
-Here.
-What?

663
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,654
Just leave everything soaking in the sink
before you leave, okay?

664
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,031
-Okay. Bye.
-Thank you.

665
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,741
-Enjoy your meal.
-Bye now.

666
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,075
-Bye.
-Yeah.

667
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,954
All right, everyone. Mr. Kim is here.

668
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,414
A round of applause!

669
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,671
-Please take a seat.
-Mr. Kim.

670
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,548
I feel like I'm crashing the party.

671
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:26,841
Not at all. Please sit.

672
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,593
No, not here.

673
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,638
You can sit right here.

674
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,224
I'll just stay for a bit then.

675
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,062
Mr. Kim. Can I pour you a drink?

676
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,022
Yes. A glass of soju, please.

677
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,441
Wait. Hold on a second.

678
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,902
Pour him a glass of this.

679
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:47,779
What's that?

680
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,322
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

681
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,242
My wife sent me this.
It's braised tofu. Please try some.

682
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,871
She makes a mean braised tofu.

683
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,998
My goodness. Thank you.

684
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,667
What's going on?

685
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,377
Why are you giving him
the imported liquor?

686
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,837
You're drunk. Sit down.

687
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,839
-Don't take it out on him.
-Think about it.

688
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,550
What did he do to deserve that?

689
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,512
He's just itching
to find a reason to fire us.

690
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,680
Calm down, buddy.

691
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,890
Behave yourself. Just sit down.

692
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,767
-Come on.
-I can't lose this job.

693
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,270
I have two parents at home
who are over 90 years old.

694
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,523
Hey, that's enough.

695
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,818
Are you the only one struggling?
Who here doesn't have sick parents?

696
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,403
Have you saved up any money?

697
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,739
-I've only saved up debt.
-Sir, shall we have a toast?

698
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,117
Excuse me, sir.

699
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,536
Last month, I told you
that the machine was acting up

700
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,621
and that we needed to stop it.

701
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,916
Hey, if we were to miss the deadline,
would you take responsibility?

702
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,670
If someone has to go,
it should be the young guys, right?

703
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,255
-Us?
-Yes.

704
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:52,093
What he means is that young people
have more opportunities, so--

705
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,221
What kind of opportunities?
Where are they?

706
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,349
How should I know?
You'd have more than us. Go find them.

707
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,726
Hey, come on.

708
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,895
The rule at this factory
is first in, first out.

709
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:06,566
It's only fair that you leave
in the order you joined.

710
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,900
That's harsh.

711
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,528
So the old-timers should get lost?

712
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,863
Listen.

713
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,032
Your movements are just too slow.

714
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,118
No, everything you do is slow.

715
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,747
To be blunt,
you guys can't meet your quotas.

716
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,458
So these young folks right here

717
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,085
-are all suffering because of you.
-"Suffering"?

718
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,591
Dal-jae, did you just say "suffering"?

719
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,802
Are you having trouble hearing?

720
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,555
-Are you?
-Gosh. Hey.

721
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,848
"Suffering"!

722
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,476
-What?
-Hey, you little punks.

723
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,188
Who do you think taught you the skills
to work in this factory?

724
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,814
If it weren't for me,

725
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:50,943
you'd have lost
a few fingers by now, you punks!

726
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,906
Gosh, thank you so much
for saving my fingers.

727
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,699
But it's not like you were born an expert.

728
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,118
-You learned from the old-timers too!
-You little bastard.

729
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,161
-Hey, stop.
-What!

730
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,455
Why are you leaving
all the responsibility to us?

731
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,875
-Mr. Kim. How old is your kid?
-I'm not leaving it to you.

732
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,543
-Grab him.
-Come here!

733
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,879
You damn young punks.

734
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,216
Hey, that's enough!

735
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,184
The food's all set out.

736
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:27,647
I had the kitchen lady stay late
to make fried eggs and everything.

737
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,609
So just have some, okay? Please.

738
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,946
Sit down.

739
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,489
-Jeez.
-Just sit down.

740
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,908
-Please sit down.
-Dal-jae, put on your jacket.

741
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,551
Why don't I…

742
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,263
make you all a delicious bomb shot?

743
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,559
Okay, here we go.

744
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:10,356
A golden ratio bomb shot I perfected
over 25 years in sales at ACT.

745
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,192
This isn't your ordinary bomb shot.

746
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,028
You need to be at the right place
at the right time.

747
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,948
The hand that makes it matters,
not just the ratio.

748
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,449
Now prepare to be amazed.

749
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,328
Okay, here I go!

750
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:29,000
The top must overflow
for the bottom to be filled.

751
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,085
The Trickle-Down Shot.

752
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,257
Who wants one?

753
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,216
-Come on.
-Me!

754
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,219
Great. That'll be 10,000 won, please.

755
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,431
I'll send you my bank information.

756
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,434
Here. Pass them along.

757
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,227
I'll keep them coming.

758
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,481
We can fight all we want,
but let's have a drink first.

759
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:56,152
We're all family here, after all.
So let's look out for each other.

760
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,946
-Here's to each other!
-Here's to each other!

761
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,372
Let's go!

762
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,291
Man, it's cold at night these days.

763
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,627
It is.

764
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,797
What did headquarters say?

765
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,594
Do they want to lay off everyone
from the line where the accident happened?

766
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,765
Mr. Kim.

767
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,018
I don't know. I have no idea.

768
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,102
What if…

769
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,688
What if I left instead?

770
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:36,651
Why you?

771
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,780
Because I'm the factory supervisor.

772
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,950
And I'm the team leader.
The Safety Management Team Leader.

773
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,871
You saw how it is.

774
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,292
There's not a single person here
who can afford to quit.

775
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,671
Firing a few of the older guys
won't even make a statement.

776
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,714
So just as a symbolic gesture,

777
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,717
let them replace one young supervisor.

778
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,386
Please take care of it.

779
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,055
What will you do?

780
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,100
Me? I have plenty of offers.

781
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,687
I'm known for being sharp and efficient.

782
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,522
Gosh.

783
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,860
I'll take full responsibility.

784
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,862
Just let me do this.

785
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,618
Do you have any idea
what you're saying right now?

786
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:28,953
Yes, I do.

787
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,332
If there's one person here
who absolutely cannot be fired,

788
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,417
it's you.

789
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,421
You're good at your job.
You're an excellent supervisor.

790
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,382
Even if this factory
were to shut down completely,

791
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,135
you should still be working
somewhere in this company.

792
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,304
That's what I believe.

793
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:50,057
Now is not the time for you
to be playing the hero.

794
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,893
You'll take responsibility for what?
Do you think the company is a joke?

795
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,979
You think you can boss them around?

796
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,397
They crunched all the numbers

797
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,317
and are letting go of people
they don't need anymore.

798
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,030
That's why… I'm asking for your help.

799
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,575
I've worked with only numbers
for 25 years.

800
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,911
And you're asking me to axe you

801
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,621
just to save those people?

802
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:13,873
"Mr. Kim,

803
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,835
please do a lousy job."
That's what you're asking.

804
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,421
Jeez.

805
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,465
I can't do that.

806
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,388
You're so young and naive.

807
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,809
Stop talking nonsense.

808
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,606
And try to hang on to your job
for as long as you can.

809
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,359
That's what being a parent is.

810
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,986
Got that, you little know-it-all?

811
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,531
Stay here until the very end

812
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,242
and take responsibility.

813
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,828
That's your job.

814
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,581
I'm going to go do my job.

815
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,546
Oh, and…

816
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,049
I always pay for my booze.

817
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,301
Here.

818
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,804
That's too much.

819
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,103
Man, it's cold.

820
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,836
BEYOND TELECOMMUNICATION
CONNECTING PEOPLE

821
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,023
OFFICE OF THE HEAD OF HR

822
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,703
That's right. Yes.

823
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,164
Just give me three minutes.

824
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,124
-I'm sorry. Just a moment.
-Okay.

825
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,794
Yes.

826
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,005
Man.

827
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,048
Speak of the devil.

828
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,135
He must've been in a hurry.
He arrived early.

829
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,890
I know, right?
And for something so trivial,

830
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,392
it took way too long.

831
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,936
Then instead of doing that,

832
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,772
how about we have dinner together
after work?

833
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:48,527
Mr. Kim is the sales team's star
when it comes to drinking and socializing.

834
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,988
They say he's very entertaining.

835
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,575
Okay. I'll call you back later then.
All right.

836
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,413
Mr. Kim, please come in.

837
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,165
Have a seat over here.

838
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,883
How does it feel to be back
at headquarters?

839
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,886
Well, it's nice.

840
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,680
You should come back soon.
You've worked so hard.

841
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,642
And think about
what you'd like to eat later.

842
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,936
The higher-ups are waiting.

843
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:29,026
And about the other day… I was a bit rude.

844
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,445
Please forgive me, sir.

845
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,072
I understand.

846
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,242
Really?

847
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:38,953
All right then.

848
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,413
May I have the list?

849
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,007
KIM NAK-SU

850
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,895
Oh, you didn't print it out.
Then can you just send it to me?

851
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,274
Actually, that's a wireless printer.

852
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,234
You can print it
directly from your phone.

00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,036
Actually, Mr. Kim,
just read them out to me.

856
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,621
It's only 20 people.

857
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:23,998
So, who's number one?

858
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,166
Let's get this over with
and go eat, shall we?

859
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,543
All right, who's first?

860
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,380
NO. 6 LEE DAL-JAE

861
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,881

862
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,767
I'd like to apply

863
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,812

ACT RETIREMENT APPLICATION

865
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,876
Here.

866
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,463
Please write the date you want
your voluntary retirement to take effect.

867
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,548
Hold on. I'm sorry.

868
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,384
This is last year's form.
I need to check it.

869
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,598
No, forget it. Don't worry about the rest.

870
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,142
Just sign here on the applicant line.

871
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,864
Mr. Kim, you can just tell me right now.

872
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,659
So, what date should I put down for you?

873
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,744
Next week? We can also do tomorrow.

874
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,581
But wouldn't it be better
to get a few more days' pay?

875
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,042
You already know the rest, I assume.

876
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,587
You'll get an additional 200 million won
added to your severance.

877
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,506
It'll be deposited
to your pension account.

878
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,510
Unless you need it for something major,
it's best to just leave it there.

879
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,681
What date should I put?

880
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,393
-Next week.
-Got it.

881
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:10,938

for approval right away.

What about unemployment benefits?

885
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,535
That's not going to be possible.

886
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,328
Since it's voluntary.

887
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,665
But it's not like the company
is paying for it.

888
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:33,877
Good lord.

889
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:44,263
Funny how flexible you become
when it's about you.

890
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,224
Please, I'm begging you.

891
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,321
Mr. Kim…

892
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,115
SUBMIT EMPLOYEE'S RETIREMENT APPLICATION?

893
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,825
…once you submit, it really is the end.

894
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,493
A final goodbye.

895
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,580
There's no turning back after that.

896
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:15,794
ACT was your first job, right?

897
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,797
So you got a job
right after you graduated from college.

898
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,215
Besides maybe some tutoring,

899
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,926
you've never had any other job, right?

900
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,470
Once you click that,

901
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:29,349
you're looking at 50 years
of living off your savings.

902
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,312
It's really over then. No more paychecks.

903
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,897
From your 330 million won severance,

904
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,483
how much do you think
will be left after taxes?

905
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,527
How many years do you think
you can last on that?

906
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,283
The list.

907
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,660
Will you give it to me?

908
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,164
Jeez.

909
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:59,171
Mr. Kim, let's get the factory
back to normal quickly,

910
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,256
and then you can return to headquarters

911
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,176
to really show your potential
and become an executive.

912
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:08,388
So our company can focus its resources
and move on to the next step.

913
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,557
This list of yours

914
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,645
is the crucial first step
in that whole process.

915
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,942
Come on, say something. What should we do?

916
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,195
I'm… doing this because I'm desperate.

917
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,281
This is the first time
I've ever gone this far. Okay?

918
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,408
Mr. Kim. Sir!

919
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,661
Say something!

920
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,460
God, you talk a lot.

921
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,132
SUBMIT EMPLOYEE'S RETIREMENT APPLICATION?

922
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,635
KIM NAK-SU
PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT: 25 YEARS

923
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,595
SUBMITTED

924
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,974
RETIREMENT APPLICATION SUBMITTED

925
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,350
THIS IS MANAGEMENT SUPPORT

926
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,413
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

927
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,395
GENERAL MANAGER DO JIN-WOO

928
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,103
JUNG SUNG-GU

929
00:56:47,802 --> 00:56:49,323
AWARD PRESENTED TO
KIM NAK-SU

930
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,461
We exceeded our targets…

931
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,051
It boosted sales of our main product…

932
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,057
…17.9%…

933
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,103
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes.

934
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,023
Sorry. Go on.

935
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,566
I'll continue.

936
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,777
You'll notice a 12% growth
in the second quarter

937
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,445
compared to the first quarter.

938
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,571
CHOI JAE-HYEOK, HEAD OF HR

939
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,949
KIM NAK-SU APPLIED
FOR VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT AND LEFT

940
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,242
Especially new contracts
with small companies…

941
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,219
ADD A WAYPOINT

942
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,595
THE ROUTE HAS BEEN SET

943
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,515
MY HOME

944
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,101
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

945
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,936
-Song-hee.
-Yes?

946
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,523
A one-million-won raise versus
leaving at 4 p.m. What would you choose?

947
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,902
I'd have to seriously think about that.

948
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,570
I'd definitely choose leaving at 4 p.m.

949
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,406
Time is going so damn slow.

950
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,080
Did someone come by?

951
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,832
Who would come here?

952
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,918
No, seriously. It's…

953
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,046
The air feels different, you know?

954
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:33,176
I know you don't want to work,
but blaming the air is a new one.

955
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,137
No, for real. What is it?

956
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:53,822
No way.

957
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,665
Goodness.

958
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,334
What? What is it?

959
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,945
I'm home.

960
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,206
What's going on?

961
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,540
Is there anything to eat?

962
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,293
Well, yes.

963
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,128
Just give me anything.

964
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,422
Okay. I will.

965
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,478
Did you take a half-day or something?

966
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,111
Oh, right.

967
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:22,869
Look.

968
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:25,580
What?

969
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,499
I told you.
I have an interview this weekend.

970
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,293
-For the real estate agency?
-Yes.

971
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:33,630
The left one.

972
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,714
This one?

973
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:39,594
-I think this one is better.
-Why ask if you won't listen?

974
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:44,099
I went to the department store
with Ha-yeong and bought this today.

975
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,642
Jeez, you know what?

976
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,310
She said she'd buy it for me,

977
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:50,689
but the moment she saw the price tag,
she completely changed her tune.

978
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:54,609
She forgot how I worked
my fingers to the bone

979
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:58,697
to pay for her tuition.
Honestly, what a little brat.

980
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,575
I should've taken that car back then.

981
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,742
Right?

982
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,914
Am I right or not?

983
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,167
You're right.

984
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,333
What was that for?

985
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,214
What's with you?

986
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,887
Hey, stop it.

987
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,141
-Hey!
-Cut it out.

988
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,392
Hey, Mr. Unemployed.

989
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,312
-Hey there, unemployed Mr. Kim.
-Seriously, stop it.

990
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,066
Your wife has a job interview
this weekend.

991
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,484
Are you just going to sit around?

992
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,402
-Give me a break.
-Huh? Come on.

993
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,447
How much is your severance?

994
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,490
-Stop it.
-Hand it over.

995
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,367
Give it to me.

996
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,661
I'll go buy a new bag and some clothes.

997
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,205
-And go on a trip abroad.
-You're unbelievable.

998
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,791
-Come on.
-Just get me something to eat.

999
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,793
Give me the money. Money, money.

1000
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,253
If you give me a million won,

1001
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,213
-I'll make you the best ramyeon ever.
-Good lord.

1002
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,006
Come on. I told you to stop.

1003
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,774
You've been through so much.

1004
01:02:58,817 --> 01:02:59,693
General Manager Kim.

1005
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,243
I'm sorry.

1006
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,833
What are you sorry for?

1007
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,583
Oh, honey.

1008
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:17,062
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

1009
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,135
You're cut out for the corporate life.

1010
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,846
Don't even think about doing
what you're planning right now.

1011
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,681
So what will you be doing now?

1012
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,725
I bet the severance pay wasn't much.

1013
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,436
Team 1 doesn't need to attend,
so I didn't tell you.

1014
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,815
He's letting us know
we're just Kim Nak-su's guys.

1015
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,317
I can't go higher than two million.

1016
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,403
Until last week, I was a general manager.

1017
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,446
I can't work for that kind of money.

1018
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,406
SOL E&T CEO CHO YUN-HYEONG

1019
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,574
Is this the business
you wanted us to start?

1020
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,618
DAHAN REAL ESTATE

1021
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,661
-Hello.
-Jeez.

1022
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,498
This location is one of the best
I've seen in my entire career.

1023
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,750
This electrifying tension.

1024
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,877
This gambler's instinct.

1025
01:05:26,842 --> 01:05:28,842
