00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,645
MANAGING DIRECTOR KIM NAK-SU

3
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,413
How does it feel?

4
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,250
It doesn't bother me at all.

5
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,420
Really?

6
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,380
That's a relief.

7
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,802
This is how it all started.

8
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:38,015
You hit a hole-in-one,
something that was never meant for you.

9
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,810
From then on,
everything started going downhill.

10
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,064
Man.

11
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,650
Managing Director Kim Nak-su.

12
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,029
MANAGING DIRECTOR KIM NAK-SU

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,407
This could have actually been real.

14
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,536
What are you going to do?

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,331
You got fired, lost your severance,

16
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,791
and you still have
so many years ahead of you.

17
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,712
You have to pay a few million won
every month. Right?

18
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,842
I just have to sort things out

19
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,970
one by one, just like now.

20
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,306
I can do it.

21
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,433
Just keep on working
as a designated driver?

22
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,186
Struggling to pay the interest?

23
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,772
You think you can really live like that?

24
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,107
No.

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,902
Nak-su.

26
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,820
You can't.

27
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,199
You…

28
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:42,371
will never be happy living like that.

29
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,045
Let's just see

30
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,881
who's right in the end.

31
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,872
Gosh. The condensation is pretty bad.

32
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,792
That's because the last tenant
didn't ventilate properly.

33
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,961
If you re-wallpaper that spot,
it'll look good as new.

34
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,255
How much did you say this place was?

35
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,216
A 100 million won deposit
with a monthly rent of 1.6 million.

36
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,345
Or a 200 million won deposit
with a monthly rent of 1.3 million.

37
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:44,141
I don't think I can put down
a larger deposit.

38
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,227
Ma'am, if this is over your budget,

39
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,021
you'll have to look outside of Seoul.

40
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:53,900
Okay.

41
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,781
Sir, I'm almost there.

42
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,743
We're already inside
and looking at the place.

43
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,871
-You are?
-We arrived a bit early.

44
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,998
So I rang the bell
to check if anyone was here.

45
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,958
Turns out your husband was home.

46
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,798
Hi, honey.

47
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,719
As I was saying,

48
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,805
when the kids upstairs start stomping
and running around,

49
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,267
it makes me think,
"Wow, time flies. They've grown so much."

50
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,937
And the guy next door
hacks up a lung at night,

51
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,190
-so I worry about him.
-You can hear all that?

52
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,567
Of course. You hear everything.

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,319
How much are the utility fees?

54
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,279
-The utility fees--
-The utility fees?

55
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,616
They're not that bad
if you wear a puffer jacket in the winter.

56
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,367
No.

57
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,453
I can explain everything
in detail for you.

58
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,496
Did you see the kitchen?

59
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,122
-I told them about it.
-No, it's okay.

60
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,460
If you take a closer look,
it's a very nice place.

61
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,253
Yes, we'll be in touch.

62
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,506
Okay. Please do.

63
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,184
I told you. I've got this.

64
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,727
Take it off the market.

65
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,937
Honey.

66
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,525
I'm not selling the apartment.

67
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,069
Answer me.

68
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,113
Answer me.

69
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,422
No, that's not it.
I'm not getting any calls at all.

70
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,050
Sir, I'm checking now,

71
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,969
and you have a recent accident
on your record.

72
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,847
But I filed an insurance claim
and settled everything.

73
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,850
Yes, but accident histories and complaints

74
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,185
are all reflected
in the dispatch algorithm.

75
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do.

76
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,107
Damn it.

77
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,151
What the hell?

78
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,999
Okay.

79
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,459
It's clean on the inside.

80
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,129
I'd say about 24 or 25 million won.

81
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,090
I'll try to get you more from the dealer.
What do you say?

82
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,469
Okay.

83
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,516
Then I'll call him tomorrow.

84
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,021
I have some work
to finish up in the office.

85
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,606
Clear everything out of the car.

86
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,900
Can I use your car washing supplies?

87
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,485
Sure. Go ahead.

88
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,869
I never took you
to the beach on the weekend.

89
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,497
Just work, home, work, home… I'm sorry.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,543
You were a good car.

91
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,092
You still at it?

92
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,720
-That's good enough. Let's go.
-All right.

93
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,932
You're selling it tomorrow.
Just wipe the dust off.

94
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,600
I'll be done soon.

95
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,149
-Need a hand?
-No, it's fine.

96
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,192
You know what?

97
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,361
I'll turn off the lights,
so you can go ahead.

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,570
I'll close up.

99
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,073
You punk. Barging in here
in the middle of the night…

100
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,117
Go on.

101
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:36,474
EPISODE 11
B+

102
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,811
It's a shame, but it is what it is.

103
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,606
Then we'll just have fun
by ourselves this time.

104
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,401
Yes, of course.

105
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,364
That bastard.

106
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,623
-Jeong-tae?
-Hello, Mr. Yoon.

107
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,588
Sang-pil from LK
can't make it to golf this week.

108
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,923
Do you know anyone you could bring--

109
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,092
I was just about to call you, actually.

110
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,721
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can make it this time.

111
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,266
Really?

112
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,018
Yes. Well…

113
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,353
I'll call you, Jeong-tae.

114
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,397
Okay, I under--

115
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,648
Hell--

116
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,527
TU
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR YOON

117
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,570
I spoke with Jeong-tae.

118
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,073
…the reason it's not a big factor
is phone anxiety.

119
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:38,453
Basically, they feel anxious
about making phone calls.

120
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,704
OKAY, THANK YOU

121
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,915
In fact, a survey targeting Gen Z--

122
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,876
-Let go of me.
-Hold on.

123
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,220
What's going on?

124
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,307
So-yeon, continue.

125
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,186
Sung-gu, what are you doing?

126
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,021
Let us join the meeting.

127
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,357
It's the sales strategy meeting
for next year, isn't it?

128
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,485
Aren't we part of the team?
You are our team leader, right?

129
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,820
I apologize, sir.

130
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:12,904
Sung-gu.

131
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,823
Let's go.

132
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,950
Sung-gu.

133
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,662
I know you're upset about
the recent performance reviews, but--

134
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,580
This isn't about the reviews.

135
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,335
We're sick and tired
of being treated like we're invisible.

136
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,299
Ik-hyeon, do you feel the same way?

137
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,556
In the past few months,
the only time we've been in this room

138
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,018
was when Mr. Kim Nak-su was here
to present as an outside contractor.

139
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,562
You're crossing the line here.

140
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,731
What do you all think you're doing?

141
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,316
-Come on!
-Jun-seop.

142
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,026
That's enough.

143
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,367
I suppose
that was an oversight on my part.

144
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,911
All right. Let's all have this meeting.

145
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,288
Have a seat.

146
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,999
So-yeon, please continue.

147
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,459
Okay.

148
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,590
So, instead of lowering
the monthly base fee for unlimited plans,

149
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,842
-voice calls will be limited--
-Ms. Kwon.

150
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,678
Can you give a rough estimate
of data use by gender and time of day

151
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,014
for people in their twenties and thirties?

152
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,348
Excuse me?

153
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,727
Well, I don't have my laptop--

154
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,728
I know.

155
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,980
I said, "a rough estimate."

156
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,650
So you can't answer
without looking at the data.

157
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,070
Sung-gu, can you tell me about

158
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,324
our competitors' OTT-linked plans
that are starting early next year?

159
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,243
You can look at your laptop
since you have it.

160
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,460
First, half of the data usage by women
in their twenties and thirties--

161
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,212
Ik-hyeon.

162
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,005
At your level,

163
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,841
you should be embarrassed
to be the only one on the team

164
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,343
rattling that off.

165
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,346
I was actually doing you a favor.

166
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,473
I gave Team 1 and Team 2 some time

167
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,893
so you could focus on your main tasks
and gain insights independently.

168
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,686
But for you to see that
as unfair treatment

169
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,521
and take it so personally, I find it…

170
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,816
disheartening.

171
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,443
Personally…

172
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,573
it makes me wonder how
I'm supposed to run the sales division.

173
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,038
Mr. Baek.

174
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,581
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

175
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,668
What's going on?

176
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,337
-Why is it so tense in here?
-I'm sorry, sir.

177
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,674
I'd like to finish our discussion.

178
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,804
Everyone, this isn't a social club.
This is a place of business.

179
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,641
Wouldn't it be more productive

180
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,103
to work on your professional development

181
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,188
than to complain about unfair treatment?

182
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,567
I'll keep an eye on you.

183
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,821
But for today, I'd like you to leave.

184
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,127
Mr. Baek, if you don't mind,
please have a seat.

185
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,839
So-yeon, let's continue.

186
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,509
All right, I'll resume the presentation.

187
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,845
Sixty-three percent of Gen Z have stated

188
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,682
they prefer texting
and messaging apps over phone calls.

189
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,977
In line with this, we can package
add-on OTT services

190
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,771
to encourage an increase
in data consumption.

191
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,815
The drive belt's shot too. What do we do?

192
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,900
Leave it for now. Remind me later.

193
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,360
-Okay.
-All done.

194
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,487
Next time, come by for a checkup,
not just for tires.

195
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,448
-We're great with imported cars too.
-Right.

196
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,742
We use genuine parts at a great price.

197
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,243
Take care now.

198
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,620
TRUSTED PLACE FOR TIRES

199
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,788
Goodbye.

200
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,376
Nak-su.

201
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,462
-Yes?
-So, I got a call.

202
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,756
It's about your car.

203
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,008
You'll only get
about 20 million won for it.

204
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,426
Twenty?

205
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,554
That car is fully featured.

206
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,764
It's an older model,

207
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,891
and the engine warranty
is about to expire.

208
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,393
Damn it.

209
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,811
So what do you say?

210
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,067
Check somewhere else.
See if you can get another million for it.

211
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,861
I'm leaving.

212
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,280
Hey.

213
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,908
All right. Thanks.

214
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,451
No, that's not it.

215
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,496
See this SUV there? That one.

216
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,749
How about you give it a wash?

217
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,459
What?

218
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,128
When you're done, wash that sedan
Ho-jun's working on over there.

219
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,048
Put some real effort into it
and give it a good wash.

220
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,467
Wait, what?

221
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,302
I just… Wait.

222
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,430
Since you came all this way,

223
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,308
you might as well earn some money
for the ride home. Here.

224
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,976
-Okay?
-What?

225
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,823
Yes, Mr. Baek.

226
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,786
About that golf game this weekend

227
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,914
with the sales directors
from the three major telecoms…

228
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,499
I think we'll have to cancel.

229
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,292
No one's available.

230
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,253
Really?

231
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,381
That's disappointing.

232
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,051
I'll call the golf course
and the restaurant to cancel.

233
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,430
Are you really disappointed?

234
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,016
Excuse me?

235
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,815
Please excuse me.

236
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,774
MR. HWANG TAE-SAN

237
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,152
Enjoy your lunch, sir.

238
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,195
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

239
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,824
Everyone can make it this weekend.

240
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,950
Yes.

241
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,844
What's Kim Nak-su up to these days?

242
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,887
Excuse me?

243
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,763
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes.

244
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,307
Is anyone in touch with him?

245
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,563
Round two is on me!

246
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,236
Well, are you or not?

247
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,488
I don't think so, sir.

248
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,949
Jeez, you guys…

249
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,287
All right. Get back to work.

250
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,542
Why do you think he's looking for him?

251
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,545
Hey, you're back.

252
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,131
You washed my car!

253
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,966
Since you said you'd be a while,

254
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,552
we gave it a wash after the repair.

255
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,180
That guy did it.

256
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,598
Thank you.

257
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,768
He did such a good job.

258
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,394
How much do I owe you?

259
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,647
How much for a car wash here?

260
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,191
You're the owner, so you decide.

261
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,777
It's on the house.

262
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,655
This is too good a wash
to be on the house.

263
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,199
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it today.

264
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,867
-All right. I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

265
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,869
-Thanks again.
-Take care.

266
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,288
-Okay.
-Jeez.

267
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,331
Bye.

268
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,382
What do you mean, "on the house"?

269
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,926
You said I should earn cash
for my ride home.

270
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,389
Here.

271
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,559
Forget it.

272
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,310
You earned at least this much.

273
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,937
I said forget it.

274
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,147
Come on. Don't.

275
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,983
I got a new regular, thanks to you.

276
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,568
Jeez.

277
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,739
Nak-su.

278
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,408
What?

279
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,201
Why don't you do this for real?

280
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,704
Do what?

281
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,333
Do you want me to wash cars?

282
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,295
-Gosh.
-I'm serious.

283
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,213
You have a knack for it.

284
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,592
Waxing, interior steaming,
and disinfecting for a 2.5-hour service.

285
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,218
For 50,000 won?

286
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,178
Just three cars a day.

287
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,432
We'll get you a proper uniform.

288
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,060
That stuff matters.
You gotta have that expert vibe.

289
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,981
And don't come shuffling around
in slippers like you did today.

290
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,482
Who said I'd do it?

291
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,776
Hey.

292
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,322
Why not shave your head?
You'd look like a master.

293
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,699
I said I'm not doing it.

294
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,369
Unbelievable.

295
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,877
Three times 50,000 is 150,000.

296
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,880
And 150,000 times 22 is…

297
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,259
150,000 times 22.

298
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,554
It's 3.3 million.

299
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,405
What are you doing?

300
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,534
Can you get my phone?

301
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,956
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

302
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,465
Here.

303
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,930
Answer it.

304
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,306
It's fine.

305
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,600
Are you not picking up because I'm here?

306
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,103
What are you talking about?

307
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,961
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

308
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,822
I'm…

309
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,741
starting work tomorrow.

310
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,284
Where?

311
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,745
My brother's auto shop.

312
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,330
Chang-su's?

313
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,290
What will you be doing?

314
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,542
You know, stuff.

315
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,545
What can you do there?

316
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,964
Are you getting into
something dangerous again?

317
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,842
No, it's not like that.

318
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,678
I'll be washing cars.

319
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,611
Should I pack you a lunch?

320
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,156
No, it's fine.

321
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,598
I hate that I look good in this.

322
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,517
REFRESHING CAR WASH

323
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,896
Looking at your car's service history,
everything else looks fine.

324
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,564
-You just need to change the oil.
-Okay.

325
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,524
And top up the coolant for her.

326
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,942
-Yes, I will.
-Good.

327
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,405
Anyway, since it will be a few hours
before you pick it up,

328
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,949
why don't you get it detailed?

329
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:25,743
Detailed?

330
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,829
He's a former
Sales General Manager at ACT.

331
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,331
Why would you tell her that?

332
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,750
Is that right?

333
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,668
Well then…

334
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,378
Yes, please.

335
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,130
Great, thank you.

336
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,177
ONLY THREE CARS A DAY!
50,000 WON

337
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,108
This is so satisfying.

338
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,101
She's really inspecting it.

339
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,152
You're so meticulous.

340
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,529
It's like a new car.

341
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,532
Sales is all about the details.

342
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,741
That's right.

343
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:49,869
How much is it?

344
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,914
-It's 50,000 won.
-Okay.

345
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,049
I feel like the kimchi

346
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,553
cooks faster on the stone grill.

347
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,680
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

348
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,599
-Two more servings, please.
-Okay.

349
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,684
Slow down, will you?

350
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,728
You're going to puke, man.

351
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,438
One car and I'll work it all off.

352
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,981
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

353
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,358
When's our stone-grilled
jjajang ramyeon coming?

354
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,611
-I'll bring it right out.
-Okay.

355
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,905
-Interesting.
-What is?

356
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,449
You seem to enjoy it.

357
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,409
It doesn't matter if I enjoy it.

358
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:32,912
Here you are.

359
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,206
Look at this.

360
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,000
-What is it?
-Jjajang ramyeon.

361
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,210
Your phone's ringing.

362
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,211
MR. BAEK JEONG-TAE

363
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,881
Do you just pour it onto the grill?

364
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,049
Yes.

365
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,761
-Gosh.
-Enjoy.

366
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,061
This is delicious.

367
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,896
It's seriously good.

368
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,023
SEOKAM PORK BARBEQUE

369
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,734
The number you have dialed is currently--

370
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,195
That punk. Damn it.

371
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,661
Hey.

372
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,871
Try calling Kim Nak-su.

373
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,791
-Right now?
-Yes, now.

374
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,673
Yes, just a moment.

375
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,472
The number you have dialed is currently--

376
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,682
It's off, sir.

377
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,895
Have you guys eaten?

378
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,188
No, not yet.

379
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,316
Shall we have lunch together, sir?

380
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,317
-Actually--
-Then…

381
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,861
go grab some food with this,

382
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,989
stop by the department store,

383
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,283
and pick me up a beef short ribs gift set.
Get the most expensive one.

384
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,451
Yes, sir.

385
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,619
-All right.
-Yes, sir.

386
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,704
Yes, sir.

387
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,041
Looks like he needs to ask him
for a big favor.

388
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,085
I'll call you.

389
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,513
Gosh.

390
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,391
Nak-su.

391
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,523
Your favorite.

392
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,444
Take it. It's heavy.

393
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,364
-Why are you here?
-You weren't answering your phone.

394
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,241
Ever wonder why I don't answer?

395
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,077
I did.

396
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,248
Come on. Take it.

397
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,083
I don't want it. Take it back.

398
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,711
Jeez.

399
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,630
Fine, then get in the car.

400
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,549
Let's just talk for a minute.

401
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,259
About what?

402
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,470
You stubborn punk.

403
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,805
-Nak-su, just for a second.
-It's already listed

404
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,559
for 20 million won below the market price.
I don't think we can go any lower.

405
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,936
Is there enough parking here?

406
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,521
Of course.

407
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,236
You can always find a spot,
even if you come home late.

408
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,030
Call me.

409
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,323
-Okay.
-All right.

410
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,663
It's been a while, Ha-jin.

411
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,290
-Hello.
-Hello.

412
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,633
I've brought some beef short ribs.

413
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,510
His favorite.

414
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,595
Thank you.

415
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,893
I feel bad that I'm always
the one receiving things.

416
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,686
Last time you came,

417
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,648
I should have given you
something better than side dishes.

418
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,857
Don't say that.

419
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,527
You would have accepted it then.

420
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,864
And I assume you would've
taken better care of him too.

421
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,949
Right?

422
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,792
I'd like to…

423
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,545
speak with him for a moment.

424
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,588
Where are you going?

425
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:16,343
We're just grabbing a quick beer nearby.

426
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,347
You've come all this way.
Why go out for drinks?

427
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,599
Just have them at our place.

428
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,647
I wouldn't want to impose.

429
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,983
Nak-su, get in. Let's go.

430
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,818
Honey.

431
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,156
This shouldn't be discussed at home.

432
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,867
I'll be right back after we talk.

433
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,830
Then I'll see you later.

434
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,207
Take this.

435
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,917
Please.

436
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,295
Come on.

437
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,546
There.

438
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,801
-Nak-su, let's go. Get in.
-All right.

439
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,511
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

440
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,762
Okay, all right.

441
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,103
Well, then…

442
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,397
He'll be back soon.

443
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,794
It's been a while
since you've been here, hasn't it?

444
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,257
When I was an assistant manager
and you were an associate,

445
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,385
we used to come here
and complain so much about the company.

446
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,930
We said, "Let's never be like them."

447
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,807
"Let's fix this damn company for good."

448
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:02,491
After you left the company,
I came up here by myself once.

449
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,160
It was only then

450
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,538
that I realized I'd made a huge mistake.

451
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,042
I'm sorry, Kim Nak-su.

452
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,544
Please forgive me.

453
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,672
Why bring up the past?

454
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,590
Forget it.

455
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,343
Go sweet-talk Do Jin-woo.
You picked him over me.

456
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,053
Do Jin-woo?

457
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,309
He betrayed me and sided
with Executive Director Hwang Tae-san.

458
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,398
The golf group I arranged with
the three major telecom sales directors?

459
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,901
Do Jin-woo pushed me aside
and gave Hwang Tae-san my place.

460
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,362
They shut me out. Damn it.

461
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,200
They're just trying
to take it all for themselves.

462
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,078
At this rate, I don't think
I'll get my executive contract renewed.

463
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,955
You're just reaping what you sowed.

464
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,623
It's the same for your team.

465
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,292
Do Jin-woo?

466
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,712
He's subtly excluding Team 1
and cornering them.

467
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,089
They won't last long either.

468
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,466
Why the hell are you telling me all this?

469
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:05,971
I need your help.

470
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,306
With what?

471
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,266
I don't even work
for that company anymore.

472
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,977
Nemo, Taejeong, iBroad.

473
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,813
You're close with
the working-level contacts there.

474
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:19,318
Get them in on the upcoming
private network bid.

475
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,862
Even if the three major telecoms
scheme together,

476
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,405
if smaller companies suddenly jump in,

477
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,365
they won't be able to control
the winning bid.

478
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,410
Their little golf group or whatever
won't save the big three.

479
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,583
So you're secretly planning
to betray your own side.

480
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,128
How can you think that
as an ACT executive?

481
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,340
You're willing to harm the company
just to hang on to your job?

482
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:45,302
So what if I want to stick around
a little longer?

483
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,428
Is that so wrong?

484
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,723
That's just greedy.
You've earned enough already.

485
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,558
You could go to any other company.

486
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,269
Just let it go. Why are you being
so pathetic about this?

487
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,312
What's pathetic?

488
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,147
You are. You're being very pathetic.

489
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,485
And you weren't?

490
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,987
Didn't you want to be like me?

491
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:08,492
You think you would've been any different
if you'd become an executive?

492
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,746
I'm just honest about what I want
and I'm trying to protect it!

493
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,665
What's so pathetic about that?

494
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,378
I know you still have

495
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,214
something you can't let go of.

496
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,092
That's why you followed me
all the way up here.

497
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,259
Gosh.

498
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,929
You're talking nonsense.

499
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,265
Nak-su, look.

500
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,603
Honestly, I wouldn't have
made it this far without you.

501
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,730
I admit it.

502
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,316
So please just help me one last time.

503
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,987
If this goes well,
I swear I'll find a position for you.

504
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,323
An executive position
at a smaller company.

505
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,534
A salary of at least 150 million won.

506
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,957
I keep my promises.

507
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,919
I'm begging you.

508
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,505
Jeez.

509
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,222
How am I supposed
to get Taejeong and the others

510
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,849
to enter the bid?

511
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,308
Don't be ridiculous.

512
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,562
Come on.

513
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,064
You know how.

514
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,985
Entertain them
or find some dirt to blackmail them.

515
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,280
Or threaten
to cut their contracts with ACT.

516
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,034
That's what you always had me do.

517
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,121
Nak-su, this is how we both survive

518
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,208
and protect your people from being treated
like outcasts under Do Jin-woo.

519
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,586
This is actually a good thing.

520
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,729
I told you I'm not selling the apartment.

521
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,982
-Why are you having people come by?
-You answer me first.

522
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,193
What did he say?
Did he offer you another job?

523
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,696
Don't do it. You hear?

524
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,617
The people who saw the apartment today
were all interested

525
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,868
and said they'd call tomorrow.

526
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,496
Selling it will get us
through the worst of it.

527
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,831
You don't have to push yourself.

528
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,335
So we'll sell this place
to pay off the loan.

529
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,378
Where are we going to live?

530
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,506
You must have thought about it.

531
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,426
A multi-family building
in Gyeonggi Province.

532
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,511
For rent?

533
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,597
Yes, for rent.

534
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,725
Given our situation,
we have no other choice.

535
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,982
Now it's your turn. Answer me.

536
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,526
Will you work with him?

537
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,406
Answer me now.
Are you going to work with Jeong-tae?

538
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,704
Answer me!

539
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,624
Fine, I won't!

540
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,003
I said I won't, okay?

541
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,506
Let's just throw this away.

542
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,644
My passenger had been day-drinking,
so he was screaming his head off.

543
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,313
I got startled and slammed
right into the guardrail.

544
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,232
That was a close call. Are you okay?

545
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,900
No, I'm fine.

546
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,069
-Will it take long?
-Not at all.

547
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,029
We'll fix it quickly
so you can drive it tonight.

548
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,406
-Okay.
-Good.

549
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,158
Right, let's check the rest.

550
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,827
This part looks fine.

551
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:42,831
Oh man.

552
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,420
I don't know what he ate,
but the smell is just…

553
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,465
Anyway, please hurry.
I haven't made my quota this month.

554
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,092
Gosh.

555
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,177
Don't worry, I got this.

556
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,306
Are you sure? Thanks, man.

557
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,307
Thank you.

558
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,684
Yeong-gil, get the wrench. Let's hurry.

559
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,312
And do the reset quickly, will you?

560
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,495
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

561
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,539
-Take care.
-Drive safely.

562
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,796
Hey, good work.

563
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,798
-Let's go get some food.
-You go ahead.

564
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,343
Do you want me to get you some gimbap?

565
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,677
I don't feel like eating.

566
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,514
All right. Get some rest.

567
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,100
-Let's go.
-He's not eating?

568
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,810
How could he have an appetite?

569
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,437
-Go on, you guys.
-Okay.

570
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,855
See you.

571
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,696
ASSISTANT MANAGER JUNG SUNG-GU

572
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,701
Sir, are you coming?

573
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,536
Yes, let's go.

574
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,666
Hello, Sung-gu.

575
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,834
-Mr. Kim!
-Jeez. You scared me.

576
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,213
-Where are you, sir?
-Why do you ask?

577
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,424
We're out of the office right now.

578
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,176
We were talking about how we missed you,

579
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,427
and we wanted to see you.

580
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,179
What for? Aren't you busy?

581
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,598
Funny you should ask.
We're not busy at all.

582
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,974
We miss you, Mr. Kim.

583
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,268
Mr. Kim, if you're not busy,

584
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,646
we'd like to come see you.

585
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,606
There's something we want to discuss.

586
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,245
-I'm off to lunch.
-Okay.

587
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,454
Enjoy your meal.

588
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,831
Enjoy your meal.

589
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,251
Aren't you eating?

590
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,961
I actually…

591
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,338
brought my lunch.

592
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,590
Wow, how frugal.

593
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,261
Before you eat, let's have a quick chat.

594
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,471
Okay.

595
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:10,687
You understand, right?

596
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,940
Wait, but why?

597
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,360
I closed the deals on half of the studios
and two-bedroom units

598
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,987
managed by this office.

599
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,697
I know.

600
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,992
And you've been taking your commissions
without any delays.

601
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,912
That's an interesting way to put it.

602
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,914
What do you mean?

603
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,376
You make it sound like
I took money I wasn't supposed to get.

604
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,587
I earned it, you know.

605
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,674
I'm the one who climbed up steep hills
to show units, convinced landlords,

606
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,177
and drew up the contracts. I did it all.

607
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,181
And I'm the one who pays the rent here,
covers the utility fees,

608
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,350
pays for advertising,
and registers the listings. That's all.

609
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm sorry.

610
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,897
If you feel so wronged,
go open your own agency somewhere else.

611
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,356
I'm sure you'd do great.

612
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,196
Okay. I understand.

613
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,656
So today is my last day?

614
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,576
Yes. Thank you for understanding.

615
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,702
Enjoy your lunch.

616
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,829
Before I leave,

617
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,249
I'd like a clear copy
of my settlement statement, please.

618
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,460
Why?

619
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,297
I have something to compare it with.
Would that be too much trouble?

620
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,008
No.

621
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,929
Here you go.

622
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,848
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

623
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:29,808
Enjoy your meal.

624
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,075
Why is everyone so fidgety?

625
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,368
What? No, we're not.

626
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,206
What did you want to talk about?

627
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,290
Spit it out.

628
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,627
Mr. Kim.

629
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,214
Did you by any chance meet with Mr. Baek?

630
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,008
How did you know?

631
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,803
I was the one who picked out
the beef short ribs.

632
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,929
He did.

633
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,600
What did he say?

634
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,896
Nothing much.
Just asked for a little help with a job.

635
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,982
-So what did you decide?
-Hey.

636
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,402
Is Do Jin-woo giving you a hard time?

637
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:24,904
Is he?

638
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,658
Jeez.

639
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,410
I think his goal is

640
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,705
to replace us next year
with new people in the sales division.

641
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,293
Mr. Kim. Is work
keeping you busy these days?

642
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,211
Why do you ask?

643
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:43,214
I don't know what Mr. Baek
asked for your help with.

644
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,801
But whatever it is,
it must be a job where you're needed.

645
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,720
Something only you can do.

646
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,265
Don't you think it might be
worth giving it a try?

647
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,934
It could lead to another opportunity.

648
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,645
And just in case,

649
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,857
-if that job has something to do with us--
-Sung-gu.

650
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,651
I'm just saying.

651
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,281
Please consider what's at stake
for us before making your call.

652
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,575
I just want things to be like before.

653
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,453
I want us all to be working together.

654
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,580
Mr. Kim.

655
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,751
Eat up.

656
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,095
What are you going to do about this?

657
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,264
Do you know how much
this genuine leather seat costs?

658
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,515
What's going on?

659
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,767
I messed up a little.

660
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,726
What?

661
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,353
Gosh.

662
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,688
Sir, I'm so sorry.

663
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,649
-Ho-jun! Get the leather cleaner.
-Yes?

664
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,025
-Okay.
-Will that get it out?

665
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,568
If it doesn't,

666
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,862
I'll call a specialist
or find another way.

667
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,906
I'm very sorry.

668
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,161
Hey, Nak-su.

669
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,663
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:59,207
How can someone in the service industry
be so unprofessional?

671
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,792
-Sir, here.
-Thanks.

672
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,168
Go get a wet sponge.

673
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,503
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

674
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,797
I'll take full responsibility
and restore it, so--

675
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,966
-Just clean it off already.
-Yes, sir.

676
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,884
-Ho-jun…
-I'm having a crappy day.

677
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,844
-I'll do it.
-It's fine. You go sit over there.

678
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,097
-You can go inside.
-But…

679
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,779
Nemo, Taejeong, iBroad.

680
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:34,283
Get them in on the upcoming
private network bid.

681
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,829
If this goes well,
I swear I'll find a position for you.

682
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,212
DIRECTOR JUNG BYEONG-UK
NEMO TELECOM

683
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,797
CEO JANG GWON-HYEOK
IBROAD

684
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,465
I have them.

685
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:53,011
TAEJEONG TELECOM
HEO TAE-HWAN, HONG HYEON-JUN

686
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,930
I have all of them.

687
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,288
You told me I would be paid my share.

688
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,003
Jeez.

689
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:32,842
That's not…

690
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,968
What?

691
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,012
What's going on?

692
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,223
How many times do I have to say it?

693
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,893
This woman is unbelievable.
How can I help you?

694
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,144
Honey, what's wrong?

695
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,937
Just a second.

696
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,608
You never said anything about
deducting expenses from my commissions.

697
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,901
I've told you a million times.

698
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,946
It's customary to split
utilities and ad fees.

699
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,991
Isn't that what you're taking
60 percent for?

700
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,577
Did you not use the water cooler here?

701
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,620
And the printer?

702
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,748
You should've at least told me beforehand.
It's not in the contract.

703
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,250
Unbelievable. This woman is a real pain.

704
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,253
Then give me a breakdown
of those extra expenses.

705
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,798
-I need to know before I pay.
-Hey, lady!

706
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,884
I hired you even though you were old,
and this is how you repay a favor?

707
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,220
Old? Hey, watch your mouth. That's enough.

708
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,472
-Honey, stop it. Let's go.
-Fine. I'll stop.

709
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,641
-Just a minute, though.
-What is it?

710
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,434
"A favor"? What favor?

711
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,895
I worked so hard for you.

712
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,897
Is it wrong to ask
for what I rightfully earned?

713
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,274
-Get out!
-Don't you touch her!

714
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,777
You stay out of this! Just get out!

715
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,654
-Out!
-Don't. Honey!

716
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,197
-Gosh!
-I'm not leaving.

717
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,199
Not until I get what I'm owed.

718
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,535
I've let it slide,
but now you've gone too far.

719
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,620
You're acting like I was a terrible boss!

720
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,663
Gosh, stop!

721
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,750
-Let go!
-You let go!

722
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,627
Hey, let go!

723
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,635
That was a really ugly ending.

724
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,596
Exactly how much does she owe you?

725
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,974
I think it was around a million won.

726
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:04,809
A million?

727
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,520
I'm getting that money back
no matter what.

728
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,773
Just let it go.

729
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,110
Let it go? It's a million won!

730
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,990
Goodness.

731
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,243
Damn it.

732
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,215
Did you hear from the people
who saw the apartment?

733
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,679
Yes, I agreed to sell it
to the ones who reached out first.

734
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,097
Everything's been scheduled.

735
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,724
Why do you ask?

736
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,393
Text them.

737
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,312
Tell them the deal is off.

738
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,982
We're not selling or renting it out.

739
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,901
I'm going to protect that apartment.

740
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,619
How?

741
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,955
I'm going to work with Baek Jeong-tae.

742
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,590
So that's why you came to see me.

743
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,552
I don't want to raise my voice
in that apartment anymore.

744
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,930
It'll be our family's home
for a long time.

745
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,974
Why?

746
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,727
Why are you getting involved
with him again?

747
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,687
Seriously, why?

748
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,940
There's no reason.

749
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,067
Beggars can't be choosers, you know?

750
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,071
What, so you can get betrayed
and go through all that pain again?

751
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,579
Is protecting the apartment
that important?

752
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,916
What does it mean to you?
It's just an apartment.

753
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,542
A block of concrete.

754
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,296
Why are you sacrificing yourself
to protect that?

755
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,091
I'm not sacrificing myself.

756
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,927
You don't know anything.

757
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,099
Yes, it all sounds great.
Living in a rental on the outskirts,

758
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,727
washing cars at my brother's auto shop,
saving up little by little,

759
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,146
the three of us sticking together,
cheering each other on,

760
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,316
holding out until the day
we can move back to Seoul.

761
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,151
That all sounds great.

762
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,486
Yes.

763
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:24,156
We can do that. What's the problem?

764
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,616
I'm old.

765
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,204
I'm old and tired. I'm exhausted.

766
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,334
Honey.

767
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,463
Do you really think I could handle
living in a place like that?

768
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,344
In that run-down,
cramped multi-family building,

769
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:50,099
I'll spend every night thinking
about that damn commercial unit I bought.

770
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,686
I'd feel so sorry for you and Su-gyeom

771
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,104
that I'd barely sleep.

772
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,815
That's what would happen. I'd break down.

773
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,443
That's why I'm fighting so hard
to stop that from happening.

774
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,903
Why can't you see that?

775
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,788
Okay.

776
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,876
Finally, some honesty.

777
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,004
In the end,

778
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,674
it was never about
wanting to protect our home.

779
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,053
You were

780
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,973
seething inside
while washing those cars, weren't you?

781
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,310
Thinking, "I'm General Manager Kim."

782
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,063
"I'm not supposed to be
doing this." Right?

783
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:43,277
All that talk about protecting
the apartment and us was just an excuse.

784
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,656
What you really wanted to protect

785
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,701
was that petty pride of yours.

786
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,631
Hey.

787
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,426
You think you're the only one getting old?

788
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,456
Excuse me.
One more bottle of soju, please.

789
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,083
Yes, sir.

790
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,419
-Thank you.
-Thanks. Come again.

791
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,545
Bye.

792
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,548
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

793
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,924
One more bottle of soju.

794
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,511
-Sir?
-Yes?

795
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,846
I'm sorry, but we're closed now.

796
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,722
-Why?
-We're closed.

797
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,019
How much is the rent here?

798
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,690
-About six, seven million?
-Hey, Jeong-ho.

799
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,859
Do you want to move into my building?

800
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,695
-Whatever you say.
-Three months' rent is free.

801
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,739
-Let's get you up.
-What are you doing?

802
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,533
-One, two, three.
-What's going on?

803
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,784
-There we go.
-You people…

804
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:19,582
What the…

805
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,042
Not a single taxi around.

806
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,047
Damn it. My phone's dead.

807
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,009
Excuse me.

808
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,803
-Yes?
-Can you please charge this for me?

809
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,098
-We're closed.
-Sir.

810
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,768
Which way is Gangdong-gu?

811
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,479
Gangdong-gu?

812
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,608
East, west, south, north, so…

813
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,610
It'd be somewhere over there.

814
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,069
Okay.

815
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,779
-Thank you.
-Right.

816
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,950
Are you walking all the way there?

817
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,744
I guess so.

818
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,663
Well, the Earth is round, so…

819
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,208
I've got to go.

820
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,276
BUNDANG - GANGDONG-GU

821
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,518
That sobered me up real quick.

822
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,294
The damn ball never goes in.

823
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,382
It had to drop right in
on that day, of all days!

824
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,342
Sir.

825
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,470
Just 20 people.
Please draw up a list by next week.

826
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,890
I'd like to apply
for voluntary retirement.

827
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,560
You should've given him the list.

828
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,478
They had nothing to do with me.

829
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,981
You should've
just given it to him, damn it!

830
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,316
So, you'll take it?

831
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,611
Talk with your wife and come back.

832
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:56,071
Jeez, why are you
making this so hard for me?

833
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,781
Don't. Let him go!

834
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,993
It's my money.
Why do I need to talk it over with anyone?

835
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,621
How could you spend that money like that!

836
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,249
You crazy bastard!

837
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,418
Damn it.

838
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,397
How…

839
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,651
How did it come to this?

840
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,574
I was almost there.

841
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,784
Kim Nak-su!

842
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,744
The managing director.

843
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,582
I was just one step away.

844
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,129
I don't know anymore.

845
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,300
I really…

846
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,096
really don't know.

847
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,098
What do you mean you don't know?

848
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,936
This is all the result of your choices.

849
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,360
I told you.

850
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,654
You can't live like this.

851
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:23,784
You'll end up choosing to work
with Baek Jeong-tae again.

852
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:29,707
Mr. Kim.

853
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,877
Let me ask you something.

854
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,218
Why the hell…

855
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,513
did you want to be an executive?

856
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,309
You never even took a trip
with your family,

857
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,353
never made it to your kid's graduation,

858
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,856
but just worked like crazy.

859
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,568
What were you chasing after all that time?

860
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,987
What was it all for?

861
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,197
Tell me.

862
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,490
You really have to ask?

863
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,533
Yes.

864
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,161
I really don't know.

865
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,082
I wanted to protect them.

866
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,292
What?

867
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,462
Ha-jin, Su-gyeom, my family,

868
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,215
my home, and my job.
Protect all of it. Is that wrong?

869
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,300
Is that all?

870
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,177
Really?

871
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,888
Just be honest for once.

872
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,603
Fine. My pride.

873
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,273
Just like Ha-jin said,
I wanted to protect my pride.

874
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,357
So what?

875
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,735
Are you any different?

876
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,614
You don't have the guts
to wash other people's cars for a living.

877
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,949
So you're trying to leech off
Baek Jeong-tae.

878
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,284
Aren't you?

879
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:51,288
What did I do that was so wrong?

880
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,790
What did I do?

881
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,587
I get it.

882
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,424
What did I do so wrong with my life?

883
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,763
When we were young,
the world told us to just charge forward.

884
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,891
But now…

885
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,604
they tell us not to charge forward.

886
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,565
They say I should reflect on myself,

887
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,109
look around at others,
and things like that.

888
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,154
But when I look inside myself,

889
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,534
I'm not there. It's empty.
Completely hollow.

890
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,161
And when I look around me,

891
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,414
they're all riding on my back.

892
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,001
My parents, the loans,

893
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,753
retirement.

894
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,255
Ha-jin.

895
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,048
And Su-gyeom.

896
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,554
It's so heavy.

897
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:51,932
By the way,

898
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,476
Su-gyeom…

899
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,855
has grown up so much.

900
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,401
That kid…

901
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:07,197
He was worried his dad
might get into an accident again.

902
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:10,450
So he followed me
when I worked as a designated driver.

903
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,036
That made me feel reassured.

904
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,998
He gets that from his mother.

905
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,499
Ha-jin actually…

906
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,711
didn't say anything else.

907
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,382
The day I retired, she simply said,

908
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,593
"You've been through so much,"

909
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,095
and gave me a hug.

910
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,683
But why is Ha-jin…

911
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,478
getting thinner and thinner?

912
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,401
I thought…

913
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,616
I was the one protecting them,
but I wasn't.

914
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,162
It was Ha-jin and Su-gyeom

915
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,415
who were quietly
watching over me from behind.

916
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,169
And my pathetic self…

917
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,838
I was…

918
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,676
clinging to that flimsy pride of mine
the entire time.

919
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:15,724
Yes.

920
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,894
Yes, that.

921
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:24,149
Let's both let go of that. Okay?

922
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,113
Mr. Kim.

923
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,786
You've been through so much.

924
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,625
Man…

925
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,378
Serving that son of a bitch
Baek Jeong-tae,

926
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,757
making sales day and night,
and entertaining clients.

927
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,636
With that money,
you sent Su-gyeom to college

928
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,722
and bought a home with Ha-jin.

929
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,936
You really did your best.

930
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:04,773
And…

931
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,567
I'm sorry.

932
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,250
I've never…

933
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,337
given you even a single gift.

934
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,175
Thanks.

935
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,595
I feel lighter.

936
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,486
Go home now.

937
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,490
You know Ha-jin is waiting up
and worried about you.

938
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,824
You're right.

939
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,452
She probably called.

940
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,497
My phone's dead. She's going to be so mad.

941
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,718
Take good care of yourself.

942
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,556
Go on.

943
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,604
Run!

944
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,819
Nak-su.

945
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,159
Be happy.

946
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,540
Thanks.

947
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,835
Mr. Kim.

948
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,421
Goodbye.

949
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:35,799
Okay.

950
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,312
I'm so sorry.

951
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,855
All right.

952
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,115
Good morning.

953
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,909
-You're up?
-Yes.

954
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,161
Good morning.

955
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,209
Dad, can I have one bite?

956
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,294
Make your own.

957
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,505
Then I don't want any.

958
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,632
Fine, here.

959
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,342
Thank you.

960
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,311
Who is it?

961
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,188
Yes, we're here to see the apartment.

962
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:59,401
My goodness, I forgot.

963
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,655
I completely forgot to call.

964
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,825
But since they came all this way,
I'll just show them around.

965
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,744
Come on in.

966
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,498
-Just one more bite.
-Hold on.

967
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,961
The balcony in these older apartments
isn't completely useless.

968
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,840
Some people grow
a vegetable garden out here, and--

969
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,801
It's great for barbecuing
when the weather's nice.

970
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,678
You can put exercise equipment here too.

971
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,389
But most importantly,
this place has great energy.

972
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,641
After I moved here,
I got promoted twice in a row.

973
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,062
And this woman here
is a real estate agent.

974
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,481
She passed both parts
of the exam in one go.

975
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:39,858
I did.

976
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,276
And… Su-gyeom!

977
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,529
Come on out for a second.

978
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,991
This is our son.
Look at the awards behind you.

979
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,367
Over there.

980
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,828
He goes to a university in Sinchon.

981
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,038
My goodness.

982
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,082
Your whole family is amazing.

983
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,542
You can go back now.

984
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,668
Okay.

985
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,755
Do you happen to play golf?

986
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,922
-Yes.
-Yes.

987
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,592
Then here's the final highlight.

988
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,635
Okay, get ready.

989
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:11,181
I got a hole-in-one this spring.

990
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,224
-Really?
-Yes.

991
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,186
-I've never seen one in person.
-Touch it. It brings good luck.

992
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,105
-Okay. Jin-a, you touch it.
-Right.

993
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,316
-So you get into that high school.
-All right.

994
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,443
-Touch it.
-Gosh.

995
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,570
You'll definitely get in.

996
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,886
Su-gyeom.

997
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,811
-One point three--
-Hey, no.

998
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,730
Don't be ridiculous. Put 1.5 million won.

999
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,524
-Okay.
-It was expensive.

1000
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,900
MEN'S BRIEFCASE AND HIGH-END BELT

1001
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,860
Around 1.5 million. For sale.

1002
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,196
Oh boy.

1003
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,575
The place is so nice, isn't it?

1004
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:17,038
The balcony is huge,
and the view is amazing!

1005
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,835
The wallpaper is clean enough.

1006
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,423
Wait, you could really
stub your toe on this.

1007
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,386
I guess we can't use
the robot vacuum here, either.

1008
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,430
Is this the master bedroom?

1009
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:36,224
-I think this is it.
-I'll get you a new one as a gift.

1010
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:44,274
The new models have extendable legs
that can get over door thresholds.

1011
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,734
-Right.
-There's a lot of cool new stuff.

1012
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:47,819
Why would you?

1013
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,864
For the tuition.

1014
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,200
You paid for my tuition.
Let's just call it even with this.

1015
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:57,036
You've been rubbing that in
for so long. I'm fed up.

1016
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,372
Just let me know
if you need anything else.

1017
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:02,709
Do you want to see the master bedroom?
It's so spacious and nice in there.

1018
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,918
-Have a look.
-Ha-jin.

1019
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,630
Is Nak-su busy these days?

1020
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,968
I have something
that I'd like to run by him.

1021
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,428
It's not fintech.

1022
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,388
Yes, he is busy.

1023
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,848
He is?

1024
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,141
The master bedroom…

1025
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,147
Don't do something you'll regret.

1026
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,816
Hey, Nak-su.

1027
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,235
Why are you doing this to me now--

1028
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,581
That bastard.

1029
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:53,301
Hello, Baek Jeong-tae speaking.

1030
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,388
Right now?

1031
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,696
Hello, sir.

1032
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,201
Please.

1033
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,754
You're on your way
to see the president, right?

1034
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:11,546
Jin-woo, what took you so long?

1035
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:12,589
I'm so sorry.

1036
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,050
It's a crucial project,
so I made sure to finish it properly.

1037
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,719
-Over here.
-All right.

1038
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,809
We polished it,
changed the brake pads and everything.

1039
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,312
Mr. Shin, you should at least
treat us to a good meal.

1040
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,689
-All right.
-Please sell it to someone nice.

1041
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,524
-I will.
-Thank you.

1042
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:35,570
There we go.

1043
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,031
What the heck?

1044
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,991
-Long time no see, Chang-su.
-Hey!

1045
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,285
-It's been forever.
-I know.

1046
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:43,911
What's up?

1047
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,080
What do you mean, "what's up"? Just wait.

1048
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:47,498
You've been well?

1049
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:50,960
Here we go.

1050
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,087
All right.

1051
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,423
A grand opening gift.

1052
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,133
Jeez.

1053
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,137
-Let's have some tea.
-Sounds good.

1054
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,389
-It's hot. Let's go inside.
-Yes, after you.

1055
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,609
Anyway, Kim Nak-su is something else.

1056
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,319
Okay, done.

1057
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,945
-All done?
-Yes.

1058
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:27,747
Nice!

1059
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,790
Looks great.

1060
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,510
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

1061
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,388
REFRESHING CAR WASH
WE CARE FOR EVERY CAR

1062
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,931
Really, Dad?

1063
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,849
Can I really use that commercial unit?

1064
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,435
I only said okay
because your mom wouldn't stop asking.

1065
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:50,728
Say "thank you."

1066
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,982
Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

1067
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,025
This…

1068

Man.

1071
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,746
I should add some water.

It's good.

1073
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,262
This is my son.

1074
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:29,892
They don't look alike.

1075
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,902
-Who is he?
-The psychiatrist on the second floor.

1076
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,238
He's very handsome.

1077
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,498
We'll be leaving now.

1078
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,876

-Yes, let's take the subway.
-Okay.

1083
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,642
-Sounds good.
-Let's go.

1084
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,688
Should we get jjajangmyeon on the way?

1085
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,899
Jjajangmyeon… I'd like that.

1086
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,410
Dad.

1087
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:30,995
Yes.

Mr. Kim!

1095
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,190
-Yes?
-He wants a car wash.

1096
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,860
Okay, just a sec.

Do you have any idea what I went through
to make you an executive?

1106
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,888
Well, it's nice to see you
working again after so long.

1107
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,641
Well, this is pretty awkward.

1108
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:01,562
I don't know how he found out,
but he definitely knew.
