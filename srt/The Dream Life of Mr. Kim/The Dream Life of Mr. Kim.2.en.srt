00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:45,963
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

2
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,804
Sir!

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,847
Sir, wake up!

4
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,808
-I'm entering now.
-Go.

5
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,414
What more could I have done?

6
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,542
Sounds to me like the company's done
its share, don't you think?

7
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,180
His name is Heo Tae-hwan!

8
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,016
Heo Tae-hwan's my husband. Where is he?

9
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,768
Where… Oh my goodness.

10
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,061
EMERGENCY CARE CENTER

11
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,109
All right, come in.

12
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,236
2001 ACT EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

13
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,195
SPRING, 2001

14
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,280
Go on in.

15
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,073
We just need to check up to here.

16
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,575
Hello.

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,340
HEO TAE-HWAN

18
00:01:58,415 --> 00:01:59,286
Hello!

19
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,331
INTERVIEWER

20
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,167
KIM NAK-SU

21
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,422
Have a seat.

22
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,009
I hear the competition rate
for major corporations

23
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,927
has jumped to 10 to 1
after the IMF crisis.

24
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,721
How does it feel getting this far?

25
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,432
Mr. Heo?

26
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,602
Well, I'm very delighted--

27
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,228
It's an honor for my family!

28
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,317
You seem to be overdoing this, Mr. Kim.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,278
No, sir. This is the company
I've wanted to join the most.

30
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,489
You must have applied
to other companies too, though.

31
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,200
No, sir. All throughout
my university life,

32
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,745
my goal was to join ACT, the leader
of Korea's telecommunication industry.

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,123
That is why I only applied to ACT.

34
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,545
I know quite a few people in HR
at other companies.

35
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,675
I can find out if you're lying
with one phone call.

36
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,884
No, sir.

37
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,553
I'm not lying.

38
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,436
Of course, the birth of my child
would be a joyous occasion.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,148
But without the company,
neither my child nor I could exist,

40
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,443
so I would ask my wife
for her understanding

41
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,238
and go meet my client
instead of going to the hospital.

42
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,282
He's crazy.

43
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,034
He really is insane.

44
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,327
Lastly,

45
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:26,665
why don't you tell us
what you felt about each other?

46
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,041
Go on.

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,584
Mr. Heo?

48
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,675
He seems very passionate and confident.

49
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,471
He doesn't seem confident.

50
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,603
Mr. Kim, say something nice
about him as well.

51
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:54,484
Well, I guess he has a sense of humanity.

52
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,156

00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,659
Thank you.

ACT, A TELECOM LEADER CONNECTING PEOPLE

56
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,205
I'll see you again
on my first day of work. Thank you.

57
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,042
You were really good.

58
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,795
Right. Well, have a good day.

59
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,548
I saw you when we took
Hyundai's aptitude test last week.

60
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,633
We took it at Daebang Middle School.

61
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,429
I think you're really going to succeed.

62
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,848
Well, then.

63
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,767
Good luck, everyone.

64
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,738
EPISODE 2
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE

65
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,824
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

66
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,409
As a student marketer,

67
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,496
I would like to connect the psychologies
of the brand and the consumer.

68
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,540
To achieve that, I majored in advertising

69
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,334
and interned at an advertising agency…

70
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,543
Kim Nak-su.

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,048
-Hello.
-I was looking everywhere for you.

72
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,133
My name is Kim Su-gyeom,

73
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,929
and I'm applying for the ACT Futurist
university student marketer position.

74
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,223
-Hey, it's Su-gyeom.
-As a university student…

75
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,849
He applied to be the student ambassador.

76
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,686
Gosh, look at you taking such good care
of your son on top of everything.

77
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,481
Come with me for a moment.

78
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,702
The reporters seem to have caught on.

79
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,079
Reporters?

80
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,498
"Manager in his fifties relocated
to Ulleungdo overnight."

81
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,960
"Office worker ordered
to climb down manholes."

82
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,755
If they write articles like that,
it'll make a lot of people uncomfortable.

83
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,132
And you'll be the one who ends up losing.

84
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,761
I understand.

85
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,560
Buy some gifts on the way.

86
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,853
It's all right, sir.

87
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,771
I'll take care of it. It's fine.

88
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,274
All right.

89
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,901
I'm depending on you.

90
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,528
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,449
You mean, right now?

92
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,826
Yes. Right now.

93
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,495
This is the top priority
for the Executive Director.

94
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,331
Okay, then.

95
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,833
Good. Call me when it's done.

96
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,167
Sir.

97
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,461
What is it?

98
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,006
What will happen to Tae-hwan, then?

99
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,382
What do you mean?

100
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,635
Will his transfer be canceled?

101
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,973
I was on my way to discuss that
with the head of HR.

102
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,685
Go and smooth things over in advance.

103
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,979
Make sure he doesn't lose his temper

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,773
and go blabbing about it
to some workers' rights group.

105
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,152
-Nak-su.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,113
Be smart, okay?

107
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,824
You should be focusing on yourself.

108
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,326
If this drags you down…

109
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,038
You know what'll happen.

110
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,039
Yes, sir.

111
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,082
All right.

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,626
Go.

113
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,064
Let's see… You're a senior.

114
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,106
Yes.

115
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,651
And you're a freshman.

116
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,693
Yes.

117
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,158
KIM NAK-SU'S SON

118
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,580
Can you come up with a toast?

119
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,539
A nice phrase.

120
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,999
A toast?

121
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,126
Yes. Something with a cool Gen Z vibe.

122
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,127
Give a suggestion.

123
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,089
This is what marketing is all about.
It's nothing special.

124
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,969
I don't really drink much, so…

125
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,304
You're not like your father.

126
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,306
-Hey.
-Okay.

127
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,821
Hello.

128
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,240
Hey.

129
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,283
My son.

130
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,411
It's nice to see you here.

131
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,370
Gosh.

132
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,206
You look so good in a suit.

133
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,001
So you're here for the interview?

134
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,390
So when are the results coming out?

135
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,516
I'm not sure.

136
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,855
What? You don't want it?

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,108
I'm not asking you to join the Marines
or prep for a national exam.

138
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,570
I just want you to have a fun experience.
What's the problem?

139
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,488
How was the interview?

140
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,991
I just don't know.

141
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,538
We'll see.
I'm sure you'll get good results.

142
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,708
Are you heading home now?

143
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,211
Or do you not know that either?

144
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,008
Fine. I'll see you later.

145
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,636
Bye.

146
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,768
Jeez. He's not even answering me.

147
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,490
I'm hungry.

148
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,783
Should we go eat?

149
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,202
-Let's go.
-What should we have?

150
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,037
Korean food.

151
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,330
-Again?
-Stone pot rice.

Mr. Kim Su-gyeom?

156

Who is this?

157
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,190
I'm Lee Jeong-hwan.
We met a while back.

158
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,942
I got your number from Han-na.

159
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,152
You don't act like you're
from Gangnam or Seocho.

160
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,197
I was quite rude to you.

161
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,949
I'm really sorry.

162
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,202
No, it's fine. I--

163
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,453
Let me talk to him.

164
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,163
Hey, Su-gyeom.

165
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,540
Oh, hey.

166
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,750
Where are you?
Are you at school again?

167
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,253
No, I'm not.

168
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,421
Then where are you?

169
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,465
Well, I'm with a friend…

170
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,427
at an exhibit.

171
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,096
What exhibit?

172
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,180
Well…

173
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,723
It's…

174
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,600
Are you busy?

175
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,812
Can you come by my workplace
for a moment?

176
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,522
Right now?

00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,033
Did you eat?

180
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,750
Hey, I brought a gift for you.

181
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,005
It's not one of those gold herbal pills.

182
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:16,259
I made a hole-in-one two weeks ago.

183
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,512
I wasn't even in good condition that day.

184
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,349
I was in shock about something,
panicked even.

185
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,976
I don't even remember.

186
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,103
I just hit the ball,

187
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,982
and it just went right
in the hole somehow.

188
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,652
You know how bad I am. It was crazy.

189
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,987
A hole-in-one? It's insane.

190
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,157
I spent so much money that day.

191
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,700
That cost 1.5 million won.

192
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,870
A hole-in-one… Incredible.

193
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,501
What I want to say is…

194
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,297
Let's just hang in there, all right?

195
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,842
We're at the ninth hole of our lives.

196
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,054
Who knows if we'll end up
with a bogey or a hole-in-one?

197
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,972
The company said

198
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,308
they'd do well by you,
so if you just wait--

199
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,559
What will they do about me?

200
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,315
-Well, they're discussing it now--
-I'm sure they won't let me

201
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,359
return to headquarters

202
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,070
just because I tried to commit suicide.
So what are they saying?

203
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,697
Tae-hwan, I'm not sure, either.

204
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,115
You should calm down first--

205
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,116
Hey.

206
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm on sick leave, you know.

207
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,749
It's unpaid
because it didn't happen on the job.

208
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:34,254
I can't even imagine how much
the hospital bills are going to be.

209
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,339
Damn it.

210
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,301
They haven't told me anything
for the past two weeks.

211
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,137
They should at least tell me
what they'll do

212
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,681
so I can make plans.

213
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,559
Nothing's changed
since I lit up those charcoal briquettes.

214
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,852
Wouldn't it have been better

215
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,106
for everyone if I'd been left to die?

216
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,774
You bastard. How could you say--

217
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,733
A hole-in-one?

218
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,694
So what?

219
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,281
Did you bring this to me
thinking it would comfort me?

220
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,282
Seriously?

221
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,658
-Go knock yourself out.
-Hey!

222
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:07,287
Hey, this is expensive.

223
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,746
Gosh, it got a dent.

224
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,041
I have no special skills, no savings,

225
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,960
and all I have is my apartment deposit.

226
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,879
I can't even imagine
how I'll survive my remaining years.

227
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,924
Living a long life
would be a disaster for me.

228
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,968
Tae-hwan.

229
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,011
Hey, buddy.

230
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,930
I've been

231
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,309
your friend for 25 years.

232
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,895
I can tell what you're thinking
just from your expression.

233
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:39,527
You're thinking,
"Damn. I'm so glad I'm not this loser."

234
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,987
-Jeez.
-Right?

235
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,448
"At least I own an apartment in Seoul,

236
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,283
and I'm general manager
at a big corporation."

237
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,493
"I even sent my kid to college."

238
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,913
"Gosh, I'm so relieved that I'm not him."

239
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,415
"I'm much better off."

240
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,499
Hey.

241
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,752
You can't deny it, right?

242
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,379
You're wrong.

243
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,218
All you're thinking right now is,

244
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,805
"What if this idiot makes me lose
my chance at becoming an executive?"

245
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,016
I'll just go.
I'll come back when you're feeling better.

246
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,309
Nak-su.

247
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,268
Hey!

248
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,645
Have a great life, Nak-su!

249
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,043
Hello. It's been a while.

250
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,002
Hi.

251
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,797
Don't worry about him.

252
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,174
I'm sure the company
will take good care of him.

253
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,343
He's worked at ACT for 25 years.

254
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,929
Then why did they do that to him?

255
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,600
Hey, it's been a while.
Do you remember me?

256
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,643
Yes.

257
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,936
Right. Well…

258
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,147
Here. Have some snacks
with your friends--

259
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,149
-What are you doing?
-It's not for you.

260
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,901
We don't need your money.

261
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,320
Here, take it.
I'll see you next time. Bye.

262
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,675
What do you think?

263
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,759
Asan?

264
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,387
The factory safety management position?

265
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,142
Yes. Tae-hwan is actually
from Cheonan, which is right nearby.

266
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,311
As compensation for what happened,
how about giving him five million won…

267
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,788
HEAD OF HR - GENERAL MANAGER
CHOI JAE-HYEOK (EMPLOYED 23 YEARS)

268
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:41,114
…and sending him there?

269
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,276
I think he'll accept that.

270
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,904
My gosh.

271
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,575
We should create a manual
for cases like this.

272
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,538
But if we do this,
Heo Tae-hwan won't quit.

273
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,790
Right.

274
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,208
Are you okay with that?

275
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,628
Of course not.

276
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,048
That's why we've changed
our company policies.

277
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,593
From now on,
we won't beat around the bush.

278
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,471
We'll just recommend resignation directly.

279
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,015
Sir.

280
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,977
With what happened,
you'll have to choose someone else.

281
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,439
A senior manager or higher
with over 20 years at the company.

282
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,607
Again?

283
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,278
Senior manager?

284
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,238
-At least.
-Gosh.

285
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,741
You're all so ruthless.

286
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,993
That's the state our company is in.

287
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,746
Just give it some thought.

288
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,997
Who can we send?

289
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,045
Let's see.

290
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,547
Let's see now.

291
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,389
If it's a senior manager or higher,
there's Kim Nak-su from Team 1,

292
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,267
Do Jin-woo and Shin Jun-seop from Team 2,

293
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,855
and then Oh Jung-sik and Cho Jae-jung
from the SMB team.

294
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,191
There is a perfect candidate.

295
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,612
But you don't seem to realize it.

296
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,618
Kim Nak-su?

297
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,711
He and Heo Tae-hwan are close colleagues.

298
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,797
-He--
-Think of it this way.

299
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,299
He'll be saving his colleague
and going there in his place.

300
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,134
How noble is that?

301
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,145
Honestly, he was incredible as a salesman,

302
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,232
but after becoming a manager,
he hasn't been doing well.

303
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,278
Don't you agree?

304
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,573
Disagree?

305
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,366
He's working with me on something.

306
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,867
I know.

307
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,745
I heard he got a hole-in-one last week.

308
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,207
When do you think
you'll be done with that?

309
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,169
Come on. Can't somebody else do it?

310
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,341
Gosh.

311
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,011
I'm not suggesting this
with ill intentions.

312
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,263
I don't have any grudges against him.

313
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,558
But we have to do our job. That's all.

314
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,355
By when do you need an answer?

315
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,987
Just let me know by the end of the month.

316
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,789

317
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,961
Your son got the job.

318
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,088
It hasn't been announced yet, though.

319
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,382

When are you coming back?

322
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,284

323
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,958
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

324
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,712
Where are the license exam workbooks?

325
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,422
Which license exam, ma'am?

326
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,218
Well, I haven't decided yet.

327
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,762
Funny, isn't it?

328
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,391
If you just tell me
where they generally are, I'll…

329
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,268
-Come this way.
-Okay.

330
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,108
Enjoy your time, ma'am.

331
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192
Thank you.

332
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,027

MISSED CALLS
MY DARLING NAK-SU

350
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,801
Why did he call so many times?

351
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,638
My gosh.

352
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,892
Why did you force him
when he doesn't want to do it?

353
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,101
Don't be naive.

You've got to push kids these days.

So, is he saying he won't do it?

360
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,655
I don't know.

361
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,699
I congratulated him,
but he ignored my text.

362
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,284
I have no idea what he's up to.

363
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,786
So what are you saying?

364
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,289
I'll make a reservation
at the Chinese restaurant we always go to,

365
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,416
so bring Su-gyeom there by 7:00 p.m.

366
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,835
Can't we talk about this at home?

367
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,671
I got everything ready
to make crab stew tonight.

368
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,049
No, we can't.

369
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,718
It won't sound as serious
if I talk to him at home.

370
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,349
Don't be too hard on him later, honey.

371
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,558
Okay?

372
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,726
All right. See you later.

373
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,523
Jeez.

374
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,569
Call Meiran.

375
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,113
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

376
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,367
Call Me-I-Ran.

377
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,828
Sure.

378
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,624
-Hello, this is Meiran.
-I'd like to make a reservation.

379
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,209
For what time?

380
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,211
Tonight at 7:00 p.m. for three people.

381
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,884
You should be careful
when using our company messenger.

382
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,262
Rumors say the audit team
is monitoring our messages.

383
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,431
Then they shouldn't have done that
to Mr. Heo in the first place.

384
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,559
Anyway, it won't hurt

385
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,352
to be careful for a while.

386
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,311
He's here.

387
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,857
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim.

388
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,983
Here, sir.

389
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,942
You eat it.

390
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,882
Focus on work, everyone.

391
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:03,966
Why are you so tense?

392
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,009
Yes, sir.

393
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,680
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

394
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,682
How is Mr. Heo? Is he okay?

395
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,727
He's better now.
He's also talking normally.

396
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,562
That's a relief.

397
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,023
I'll visit him soon too.

398
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,692
Okay. You can visit him
during lunchtime like I did.

399
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,485
-Sure.
-But…

400
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,696
how did you know I visited him?

401
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,032
Mr. Baek told me over lunch.

402
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,326
Is that so?

403
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,285
Yes.

404
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,043
So he made me do all the work,
then had lunch with Do Jin-woo?

405
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,801
-Hey.
-Did you enjoy your lunch, sir?

406
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,261
Yes. You?

407
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,474
I didn't get to eat
since I had to go to the hospital.

408
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,267
What did Tae-hwan say?

409
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,647
Well, he's still a bit unstable.

410
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,067
We decided to send him to Asan.

411
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,276
Asan?

412
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,905
That's great. I should've told him
while I was there.

413
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,800
-Nak-su.
-Yes?

414
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,883
Why is your team falling
so far behind Do Jin-woo's?

415
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,473
Are you talking about sales figures,

416
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,393
solutions, or customer management?

417
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,852
In every area.

418
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,104
Tell me why

419
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,190
Team 1 is far behind Team 2
in every single area.

420
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,860
You must have thought about it too, right?

421
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,948
Well, there are several reasons.

422
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,034
Since the pandemic,
local governments and public offices

423
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,453
have cut their budgets drastically, so--

424
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,455
It's the same for every team.

425
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,127
The disaster control staff
used to give us sales tips,

426
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,796
but it's difficult
to get in touch with them these days.

427
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,089
So the groundwork is tricky--

428
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,676
Is your team the only one
going through that right now?

429
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,016
Well, this isn't easy for me to say,

430
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,601
but my team members

431
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,856
have changed.
We're not on the same page anymore.

432
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,774
What do you mean? How have they changed?

433
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,737
For example,
they will suddenly take half a day off

434
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,488
on the day a project's due.

435
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,575
Some just go home for personal reasons.

436
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,743
You mean Ik-hyeon?

437
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,246
How do you know about that?

438
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,797
He's my real estate mentor.

439
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,591
What?

440
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,511
Remember how I was wondering
whether or not to sell my old apartment

441
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,889
because the reconstruction
was dragging on?

442
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,891
Ik-hyeon gave me some advice.

443
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,476
He told me to keep it.

444
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,269
I earned quite a bit.

445
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,729
I see.

446
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,814
The price is soaring now.

447
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,401
That's why I'm renting a place
at the same complex as Do Jin-woo.

448
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,488
I see. So that's why.

449
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,532
Did you even know
that he's a real estate expert?

450
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,745
Well, we don't really
talk about personal stuff.

451
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,749
If my subordinate
had been taking so much time off,

452
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,752
I would have asked what he was doing

453
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,128
and what he was learning

454
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,089
at least once.

455
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:31,965
You think a team leader

456
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,176
is someone who just stares
at reports all day?

457
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,721
A team leader should figure out
each member's strengths

458
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,681
and help them perform their best.

459
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,437
That assistant manager you always
smoke with. What is he good at?

460
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,438
What are his strengths?

461
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,233
Well…

462
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,904
I just feel frustrated, all right?

463
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,449
Do you think Do Jin-woo's team
is selflessly devoted to working?

464
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,245
You've got smart people under you
who are wasting their talent right now!

465
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,082
Nak-su.

466
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,876
You're a general manager.

467
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,753
And one at a major corporation.

468
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,966
So please, think bigger and act bigger!

469
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,885
I'm saying this…

470
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,430
for your sake.

471
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,731
Doesn't ice cream
sound perfect right now?

472
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,525
-No way.
-Let's get popsicles.

473
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,110
I'll give you my credit card, then.

474
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,404
-Take this--
-That's no fun.

475
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,198
Mr. Kim, you look so tired. Have this.

476
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,450
Thanks.

477
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,493
-Come on.
-No, thanks.

478
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,246
Jeez. Then let's do this.
Rock, paper, scissors!

479
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,664
I won.

480
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,085
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Congratulations.

481
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,212
-No, So-yeon was too slow.
-Sorry, sir.

482
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,214
-No, I wasn't.
-She wasn't.

483
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,758
-Thank you.
-I'll be back soon!

484
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,260
Thank you.

485
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,220
Dark chocolate for Mr. Shin.

486
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,055
-Green tea for Myung-heon.
-Yes.

487
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,349
-And mint chocolate for So-yeon.
-Wow.

488
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,934
-Right?
-Mr. Do.

489
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,895
You should've taken my card
when I offered.

490
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,314
-I'd have looked cooler.
-We'll escort you out.

491
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,860
What are you all doing in the afternoon?

492
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,696
Well,

493
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,822
I'm--

494
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,200
I have to write up
a security equipment list.

495
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,826
That only takes ten minutes.

496
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,870
I have to prepare
for an upcoming retention meeting.

497
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,664
And I have to help him prepare for that.

498
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,087
Let's go get some coffee

499
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,422
and some fresh air.

500
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,927
Come on. Let's go.

501
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,097
Mr. Kim…

502
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,807
Yes?

503
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,644
Are you quitting?

504
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,524
Is it that weird for me
to suggest getting some fresh air?

505
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,693
No, sir. I'm sorry.

506
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,153
No, sir. Let's go.

507
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,073
-Where should we go?
-Twosome Place? Or the new Coffee Bean?

508
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,075
No, let's walk a bit
and go to Compose Coffee.

509
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,326
Okay.

510
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,869
Let's have pour-over coffee.

511
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,055
Right.

512
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,974
It's true.

513
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,434
Times have really changed.

514
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,938
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

515
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,399
Sorry for saying something
about you buying a foreign car.

516
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,943
You're young.
It's okay to splurge a little. I'm sorry.

517
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,319
It's all right, sir.

518
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,326
These days, you know,

519
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,744
I sometimes think…

520
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,206
When I was younger, I had seniors
that I really didn't want to be like.

521
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,791
There are people like that.

522
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,544
But if, by any chance,

523
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,088
as unlikely as it may be,

524
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:03,010
you ever think of me
as someone like those seniors…

525
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,262
You know, an uptight boomer--

526
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,638
Oh my.

527
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,057
Are you okay?

528
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,058
Yes, I'm fine.

529
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,103
You must have allergies.

530
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,064
-Should we have stayed inside?
-No, it's fine. Don't worry about me, sir.

531
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,316
You sure?

532
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,067
-Then focus.
-Yes, sir.

533
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:23,238
From now on, I'll try to be a leader
who really listens to your opinions

534
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,534
and stays in tune with your perspectives.

535
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,077
-All right?
-Right.

536
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,165
Sung-gu, I'm going to have a smoke.

537
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,833
Will you join me?

538
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,919
Oh, I didn't bring my cigarettes.

539
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,297
Oh dear.

540
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,549
Rock, paper, scissors
to see who gets them?

541
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,134
Rock, paper, scissors--

542
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,178
-No, I'll go get them.
-It's fine.

543
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,387
-I'll go.
-You sure?

544
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,389
-Yes.
-Take your time.

545
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,067
Mr. Baek told me about you, Ik-hyeon.

546
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,944
I hear you're secretly
a real estate expert.

547
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,654
I had no clue.

548
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,822
No, sir.

549
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,451
What's your take
on Seoul housing prices, Ik-hyeon?

550
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,497
Well, generally speaking,

551
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,625
various regulations have been tightened,
so there will be fewer transactions--

552
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,918
You're right.

553
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,671
Real estate is all about
the flow of the market.

554
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:22,839
As for me,

555
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:26,134
I listen carefully to what taxi drivers,
restaurant owners,

556
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,636
hikers,

557
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,806
and people like them have to say.

558
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,725
You can read the market flow
from what they say.

559
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,477
-Song-hee.
-Yes?

560
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,688
You sometimes take a taxi
after a company dinner, right?

561
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,441
-Yes.
-And when the driver makes small talk,

562
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,443
you get annoyed
and put on your headphones,

563
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,279
and you say, "Sorry,
but I want to go home quietly."

564
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,614
-I know you do.
-I don't--

565
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,116
You shouldn't.

566
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,617
They're our customers too,

567
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,995
and they're the barometer of the public
and the market that we need to follow.

568
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,122
-Okay?
-Okay.

569
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,998
You tend to do that.
Even when I'm talking--

570
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:57,958
-Sir.
-Hey.

571
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,168
-I brought my cigarettes.
-What took you so long?

572
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,545
-I'll be back.
-Yes, sir.

573
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,798
Don't talk behind my back.

574
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,804
He's not planning
on doing this every day, is he?

575
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,764
He'll keep it up for a week tops.

576
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,142
I'm dying to go back to work now.

577
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,768
Then I guess he achieved his goal.

578
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,021
What's gotten into him today?

579
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,649
Things are already tense
at the office because of Mr. Heo.

580
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,944
That's why he's doing this.

581
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,197
He's coming.

582
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,408
So tense.

583
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,705
I want you guys to know this too.

584
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,749
-We didn't hear what you said over there.
-Right.

585
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,334
-Sung-gu!
-Yes, sir!

586
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,961
-Hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

587
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,921
He's so tense.

588
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,006
Well…

589
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,468
To put it briefly,

590
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:53,138
I will support your creativity
and your bold ideas!

591
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,390
I'll actively support ideas

592
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,685
born not from the obligation to work

593
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,812
but from a bright vision
for our company's future!

594
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,314
What do you say?

595
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,191
-Wow.
-That's nice.

596
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,817
Awesome!

597
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,236
Then how about

598
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,281
you bring in some new product ideas
by next week?

599
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,160
About five ideas each.

600
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,120
Five?

601
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,747
Don't feel too pressured.

602
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,166
But bring ideas
that can deliver solid results.

603
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,627
Something concrete that we can show HQ.

604
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,297
Work should have clear results.

605
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,590
Got it?

606
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,717
Let's go and work our butts off.

607
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,135
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

608
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,265
I should have spent quality time
with you guys sooner.

609
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,024
JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH

610
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,447
ART THAT CAPTURES TIME
SENSE THAT FILLS SPACE

611
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,284
Wow, I wanted to see this.

612
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,079
It was pretty nice.

613
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,582
I wanted to see
Palestine's Ballet Academy.

614
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,460
What did you think of that photo?

615
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,878
That was so sudden.

616
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,132
I'm not sure.
I didn't get to see that one.

617
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,301
That's impossible.

618
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,470
That photo is the size of an entire wall.

619
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,223
Amid the horrors of war, the children--

620
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,642
Oh, to be honest,

621
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,186
I have a trauma related to war.

622
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:27,274
So I rushed past photos
of Palestine or Ukraine

623
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,277
and I didn't see that one.

624
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,320
Ballerina? I mean, Ballet Academy?

625
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,448
I didn't know there was a photo like that.

626
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,788
Are you okay?

627
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,130
What am I even doing?

628
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,799
Did you say he interviewed
for a student marketer job?

629
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,800
Yes.

630
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,844
Yes, that's right.

631
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,014
My father applied for me
without even telling me.

632
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,183
I don't think he forced
that suit on you, though.

633
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,436
He hung it in my room this morning.

634
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,733
Do you want to join
your father's company after graduating?

635
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,860
No, of course not!

636
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,155
I guess you didn't really enjoy
the interview today, then.

637
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,117
-You're not like your father.
-Hey.

638
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,828
No.

639
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,039
They were mean…

640
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,458
Any moves that can liven up
the mood at a company dinner?

641
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,417
…and rude.

642
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,461
I'm just asking
because you look like an idol.

643
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,545
It's a compliment.

644
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,130
Come on.

645
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,050
They weren't the kind of people
I'd want to work with.

646
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,138
Will you guys come in for a bit?

647
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,693
You met last time.

648
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,986
Say hi.

649
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,447
I'm Ethan Jae-ho Park. Nice to meet you.

650
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,658
I didn't want to work in law
like my parents,

651
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,326
so I came to Korea.

652
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,369
Jacob Lee.

653
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,373
I go to Priston Philosophy,

654
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,667
but I'm taking time off
for philosophical reasons.

655
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,002
Ash.

656
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,386
Su-gyeom.

657
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,971
Kim.

658
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,056
"Su-geon"? As in "towel"?

659
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,100
-Gyeom.
-Oh, Su-gyeom.

660
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,768
Su-gyeom.

661
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,189
If you don't have any special plans,
how about working with us?

662
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,819
Han-na strongly recommended you.

663
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,655
She said our company
needs talent like you.

664
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,033
We really need you.

665
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,619
We lose focus sometimes.

666
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,413
You could change us completely,

667
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,540
and we could change you completely too.

668
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,043
A chemical reaction that only occurs
in small companies like ours.

669
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,221
YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED
AS AN ACT STUDENT MARKETER

670
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,308
DAD

671
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,727
You heard, right?

672
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,979
Let's eat out tonight. All three of us.

673
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,523
And send a reply.

674
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,573
What kind of work would I be doing?

675
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,159
Before that,

676
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,620
let me introduce someone
who inspired me and this company.

677
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,872
Ethan.

678
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,544
Tom Peters.

679
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,881
The most influential
business thinker of this era

680
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,133
and the world's greatest
management scholar.

681
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,719
He proposed innovative
management practices and said,

682
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,638
"In the 21st century,
you can't succeed by just improving."

683
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,390
"Destruction is cool."

684
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,351
Destruction.

685
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,228
True innovation occurs

686
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,230
in the process
of taking on challenges, failing,

687
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,983
and achieving unexpected success.

688
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,403
Do you know why large companies
stop innovating?

689
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,492
Sometimes, you meet wonderful friends.
But some are worse than your enemies.

690
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,660
-Right.
-Those who don't repay you.

691
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,788
That's why we're gonna discuss friendship.

692
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,583
-Which is the worst?
-Which is the worst?

693
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,755
ACT HEAD OF HR

694
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,424
Hello?

695
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,968
Yes, it's been a while.

696
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,638
It's fine. We can talk.

697
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,640
Yes.

698
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,102
Right.

699
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,898
I understand.

700
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,442
I'll think about it
and get back to you by next week.

701
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,236
All right. Bye.

702
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,616
That was work, right?

703
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,495
What did they say?

704
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,458
They told me to go to the Asan factory.

705
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,587
And they'll give me five million won
as compensation.

706
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,549
So?

707
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,051
What do you want to do?

708
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,306
Just say something, will you?

709
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,726
You're just gonna take the money
and do as they say?

710
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,024
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Bye.

711
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,652
-Hello.
-Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

712
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,362
Yes. Kim Nak-su for 7:00 p.m.

713
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,114
-Please wait.
-I'll be in Room 7--

714
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,783
Wait, sir. I'll confirm right away.

715
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,577
Please hurry.

716
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,120
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

717
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,917
What are you talking about?

718
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,712
Where's the owner? Let me talk to them.

719
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,881
Sir, I checked several times
with the employee

720
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,257
who took the reservation calls,

721
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,385
but there's no reservation
for today at 7:00 p.m.

722
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,429
Here. Look at my call history.

723
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,931
Here. 2:10 p.m.

724
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:52,891
You see this?

725
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,227
Perhaps you made a reservation
for a different date or time.

726
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,354
You've got to be kidding me.

727
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,399
Are you saying I'm the one
who made a mistake?

728
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,568
Can you check for other reservations

729
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,694
under the name Kim Nak-su?

730
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,280
I didn't even mention any dates.

731
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,990
I just said, "Tonight at 7:00 p.m."

732
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,325
It's your mistake!

733
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,826
Bring the owner!

734
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,456
-Sir, come to the counter.
-Can't you do your job properly?

735
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,540
Honey.

736
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,250
You're here. Gosh, what a pain.

737
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,668
Let's just go somewhere else.

738
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,045
Hang on.

739
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,547
Even if we leave,
we have to get to the bottom of this.

740
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,049
-Sir!
-Hi.

741
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,092
It's been a while.

742
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,052
Sir.

743
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,596
You should educate
your employees properly.

744
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,057
I'm so sorry about that.
Let me take you to your table.

745
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,517
I'm only letting this slide
because of you.

746
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,478
Of course. Please, come this way.

747
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,646
My gosh.

748
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,482
-I'll give you some stir-fry on the house.
-Make sure we get three buns.

749
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,524
Sure.

750
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,110
What are you waiting for? Come on.

751
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,532
My dear son.

752
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,334
So when's the orientation?

753
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,753
What orientation?

754
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,005
"What orientation?"

755
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,633
The student marketer role.
You must have gotten the text.

756
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,968
Oh, right.

757
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,095
It's great, right?

758
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,098
We'll see each other at work sometimes.

759
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,058
We can also have lunch together.

760
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,979
Why aren't you answering?

761
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,189
What? You don't want it?

762
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,069
What?

763
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,198
I'm going to take
the real estate agent exam.

764
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,284
I just want to give it a try.

765
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,163
I even signed up for a class
on the way here.

766
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,289
ENROLLMENT APPLICATION

767
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,708
So don't try to stop me.

768
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,919
What's gotten into you?

769
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,462
What do you mean?

770
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,423
If you're bored, just tell me.

771
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,926
I told you to tell me if you wanted
to go to Japan with your mother.

772
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,302
My company offers a package tour.

773
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,471
Do you think I'm doing this
because I'm bored?

774
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,099
Then what is it?
Am I not earning enough money?

775
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,392
It's not that.

776
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,396
You know, with what happened
to Tae-hwan recently…

777
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,232
What?

778
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,443
We don't know what could happen to you.

779
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,364
It'd be nice for me to have
some kind of license too.

780
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,074
Unbelievable.

781
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,246
Heo Tae-hwan couldn't even get promoted
to senior manager for 10 years.

782
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,664
If he hadn't been born

783
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,292
in an era when you could easily
get a job with a degree,

784
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,128
he couldn't even have dreamed
of joining the company with me.

785
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,337
How can you compare…

786
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,548
I'm a general manager.

787
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,217
I rose through the ranks
without skipping a single promotion.

788
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,179
I'm a public recruit from
a prestigious university. Elite of elites.

789
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,307
And recently,
I secured a major project by myself.

790
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,311
I'm 99.9 percent sure
I'll be an executive next year.

791
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,312
Got that?

792
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,483
Wow, it made such a difference.

793
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,318
You've mastered it now.

794
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,989
Why isn't it coming out?

795
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,038
I should pay you for lessons.

796
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,625
So an executive's wife can't work, then?

797
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,128
-I can only do chores at home?
-I'm not saying you shouldn't work.

798
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,839
You're trying to speculate in real estate.

799
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,592
What are you talking about?

800
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,219
It's not like that these days.

801
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,970
If you want to work, do something else.

802
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,473
There are lots of things
housewives can do.

803
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,850
You want me to do part-time jobs
like making dolls?

804
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,019
Yes, that's a good idea.

805
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,814
You think it's easy?
That requires skills too.

806
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,650
Do you want me
to just stay home and do nothing?

807
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,527
What am I supposed to do?

808
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,364
How about flower arrangements?
That's nice.

809
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,241
Doesn't that require skills too?

810
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,327
Jeez. Stop it.

811
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,995
That's enough, all right?

812
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,416
-Kim Su-gyeom.
-Yes?

813
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,544
Don't waste your time on useless stuff

814
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,587
and take the opportunity--

815
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,589
I got a job offer.

816
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,801
A job offer?

817
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,845
Yes, at a startup company.

818
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,013
What kind of company?

819
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,058
They're working on their brand value…

820
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,226
What's their name?

821
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,146
What's the name?

822
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,398
Jealousy, My Strength.

823
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,652
-Jealousy…
-Is it a matchmaking agency?

824
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,988
-It's not that.
-…My Strength.

825
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,447
Wait, this is a film.

826
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,285
Jealousy, My Strength as a company name?

827
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,371
How did that company find you
and give you an offer?

828
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,707
Well, just through acquaintances.

829
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,458
Here it is. Jealousy, My Strength.

830
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,877
They even got the grammar wrong.

831
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,003
BEGIN JEALOUSY EXPERIMENT

832
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,212
What is this?

833
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,676
Jeez.

834
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,137
My goodness.

835
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,056
So how is this company making money?

836
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,059
They're figuring out
a revenue model right now.

837
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,519
What would you do in this company?

838
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,812
Be jealous?

839
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,355
I'd be the CDO…

840
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,149
CTO? You, the Chief Technology Officer?

841
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,401
No, the CDO.

842
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,570
It's short for Chief Destruction Officer.

843
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,530
Destruction? Like destroying things?

844
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,743
Yes. Tom Peters used that term
when talking about innovative management.

845
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,704
"In the 21st century,
you can't succeed by just improving."

846
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,830
"Destruction is cool."

847
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,374
So what is a CDO?

848
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,710
So, it's short
for Chief Destruction Officer.

849
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,962
What will you be destroying as chief?

850
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,965
I want to do this.

851
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,550
Do what?

852
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,178
-The CDO.
-So what on earth is a CDO?

853
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,642
You haven't been asked
to invest money or anything, right?

854
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,561
There are a lot
of cryptocurrency scams these days.

855
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,105
No, it's not like that.
These guys have vision.

856
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,607
Vision, my ass.

857
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,945
My son received a job offer
as a Chief Destruction Officer

858
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:42,156
from a startup company
named Jealousy, My Strength?

859
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,449
Unbelievable.

860
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,034
I have no idea

861
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,620
where to start explaining.

862
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,206
Dad, I don't want to
join a major corporation.

863
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,332
What are you saying?

864
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,001
You think it's easy
to join a major corporation?

865
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,586
I want to find my own thing.

866
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,089
Is being a Chief Destruction Officer
something only you can do?

867
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,217
All major corporations also started off
as small startup companies.

868
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,178
No, my company started off
as a major corporation.

869
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,973
Companies like Amazon and Google
started from a garage.

870
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,433
Amazon was an internet bookshop,

871
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,687
and Google had a clear goal
as a search engine.

872
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,647
Worthless flashy startups

873
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,399
can't be compared to companies like that.

874
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,151
If they're lacking something,
I can help them grow.

875
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,236
I'm your son.

876
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,404
Am I worthless too?

877
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,364
The problem is that
you're refusing to take

878
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,157
the great opportunities
I'm making for you!

879
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,410
I've done everything you told me to
since I was little.

880
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,954
Workbook programs, tutoring,
cram schools, retaking the CSAT.

881
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,832
Is there anything I've refused to do
in the past 20 years?

882
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,335
I can tell what fits my aptitude
and what doesn't now.

883
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,712
You've never had a proper job.

884
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,256
How would you know
what fits your aptitude or not?

885
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,217
Just join the military, then!

886
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,427
What nonsense.

887
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,264
Excuse me.

888
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,850
Should I bring your food later?

889
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,227
-No, it's fine. Please bring it in.
-Okay.

890
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,565
All right.

891
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,568
I got you four more buns.

892
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,528
They look delicious.

893
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,614
Meiran's stir-fries are the best.

894
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,326
Here you go.

895
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,454
Do you eat out somewhere else these days?

896
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,247
What?

897
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,207
Come here instead of Meiran.

898
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,667
I'll offer you lots of extras.

899
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,503
What? Meiran…

900
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,422
Please enjoy your food.

901
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,011
What was that?

902
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,348
Where's Meiran, honey?

903
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:31,932
Meiran…

904
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,728
That's the Chinese restaurant
near my company.

905
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,814
How did you know to come here, then?

906
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,276
You told us to come to the place
near our house. This is Ssangyonggak.

907
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,153
This place is Ssangyonggak?

908
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,155
SSANGYONGGAK

909
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,740
-Oh dear!
-Wait.

910
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,076
Then did you make a reservation
at Meiran, not this place?

911
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,452
Oh man.

912
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:55,289
This is why I worry these days.

913
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,792
I can't believe it.

914
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,419
I guess I really am getting old.

915
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,754
I got confused.

916
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,006
-My goodness.
-Right. You are old.

917
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,758
Here, eat some stir-fry.

918
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,760
Su-gyeom, eat up while it's warm.

919
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,220
Apologize, Dad.

920
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,097
What?

921
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,476
You should apologize
to that employee when we leave.

922
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,770
For what?

923
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,772
You made a mistake and blamed him for it.

924
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,733
You even shouted at him and insulted him.

925
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,944
I think you should apologize.

926
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,487
-Let's eat.
-Apologize.

927
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,446
Just eat.

928
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,657
You said you had to get
to the bottom of it.

929
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,909
Now you know that it was your mistake.

930
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,619
Hey, I'm always busy working.

931
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,038
-So I might make mistakes.
-That's why you should apologize!

932
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,081
Hey!

933
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,084
I'm a regular here.

934
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,711
I've brought you and your mom,

935
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,755
my friends,
and even had company dinners here.

936
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,090
I boosted sales for them!

937
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,551
What does that have to do
with yelling at an employee?

938
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,802
Dealing with complaints

939
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,804
comes with the job
in the service industry.

940
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,181
It wasn't a complaint.
You just made a mistake!

941
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,850
You punk!

942
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,489
What's so great, Dad?

943
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,285
You survived as a general manager
at a big company,

944
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,455
bought an apartment in Seoul,
and sent me to college. So what?

945
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,748
Don't you see…

946
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,504
the way your own son
is looking at you right now?

947
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,341
Doesn't that scare you?

948
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,815
I'll excuse myself first.

949
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:46,901
Where are you going?

950
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,361
You should eat!

951
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,740
Damn it.

952
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,828
I'm full.

953
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,747
Eat this by yourself.

954
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,792
I feel ashamed as a mother.

955
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,961
My son said such things to his father,

956
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,923
and I have nothing to say to him.

957
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,467
Eat up.

958
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,304
Where are you going? Sit down.

959
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,223
Honey.

960
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,368
Excuse me.

961
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,582
I'm sorry about earlier.

962
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,462
I…

963
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,757
I'm sorry about earlier.

964
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:57,513
My father told me
to give this to you on the house.

965
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,519
Excuse me.

966
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,354
Could I have a bottle of soju?

967
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,397
Sure.

968
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:16,156
SSANGYONGGAK

969
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,587
Use this umbrella.

970
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,726
Come on. What are you doing?

971
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,103
Let's have a drink.

972
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,980
I'll go to your neighborhood.

973
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,066
Fine.

974
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,364
Hey.

975
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,951
I'm on my way back
after working outside the office.

976
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:05,456
I just happened to pass by
the skate and wine place we went to often.

977
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,124
How about a drink?

978
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,209
What?

979
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,963
All right. I understand.

980
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,466
Bye, then.

Jeez.

985
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,940
He's no fun.

986
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,741
How could you
have just left me there too?

987
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,827
Yes, I ate everything. Happy?

988
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,705
I'm going to the office.

989
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:51,877
No, I'm not going home.
I'm going to the office.

990
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,922
What do you think? To work, of course.

991
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,675
No, I have to go.

992
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,135
I have to do everything myself.

993
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,390
It's been such a long day.

994
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,143
Everyone was talking nonsense to me.

995
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,270
My gosh.

996
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:12,690
How's Su-gyeom?

997
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,900
No, never mind.

998
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,152
Tell him to do whatever he wants.

999
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,447
I'll go home tomorrow. Hang on.

1000
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,490
Taxi!

1001
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,492

Sir.

00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,229
-Yes?
-Did you sleep here?

1009
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:22,981
Yes.

1010
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:25,525
I really respect your dedication.

1011
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,735
Thanks.

1012
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,862
Did you figure out a way to resolve it?

1013
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,280
What?

1014
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,366
Fortunately, it doesn't affect our team.

1015
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,331
But I heard your team promoted
Giga Internet more actively.

1016
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,334
What are you talking about?

1017
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:46,046
Didn't you come to work
after seeing that video?

1018
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,631
What video?

1019
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,467
What's going on?

1020
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,346
I've been using ACT's
fastest and most expensive

1021
00:57:53,446 --> 00:57:55,639
Super Giga Internet Plan
for the past two years.

1022
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,932
But its actual speed

1023
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,185
wasn't even a hundredth
of the speed I'm supposed to get.

1024
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:04,356
I'm sure I'm not the only one
experiencing this.

1025
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,859
Especially when exchanging
high-quality, large-volume data,

1026
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:12,572
there must have been huge
direct and indirect losses.

1027
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,685
That's right.

1028
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:15,659
This is a scam!

1029
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,752
Yes, this is Shin Jun-seop

1030
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:26,878
No.

1031
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,380
You've called Team 1.

1032
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,466
Mr. Song isn't here right now,
so I answered instead.

1033
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,885
-That isn't handled by our team.
-Sales Team 2.

1034
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,512
-I'll tell the Tech Team.
-Yes.

1035
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,764
We're checking the results
for that region.

1036
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,100
We'll discuss this
with the Tech Support Team.

1037
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,562
-I'll explain it to you now.
-As for compensation, we…

1038
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,564
Please wait a moment.

1039
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,982
I'll contact our manager.

1040
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,026
I'll get him on the line. Please wait.

1041
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,403
Why weren't you answering, Mr. Kim?

1042
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,946
Please take care of this.

1043
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,783
It's Yangpyeong Dream Cultural Center.

1044
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,910
They said they saw the video
and checked their speed.

1045
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,412
Yes, hello.

1046
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,830
I told you.

1047
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,416
That area isn't covered
by Giga Internet yet.

1048
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,335
Get it installed.

1049
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,171
It's just a few months at most.

1050
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,298
-No need to hesitate. Come on.
-Okay.

1051
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,340
Sir?

1052
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,301
Sir, please.

1053
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,595
They're making a fuss
about reporting this.

1054
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,554
Please take it.

00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:25,645

00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,573
-Song-hee, take this.
-Okay.

00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,034
Hello? Well, I…

1061
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:49,795
We'll hold a meeting…

1062
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,630
You need to respond
after there's a manual.

1063
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:52,798
That way we can…

1064
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,929

1067
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,875
If we get an administrative sanction,
we'll easily lose tens of billions.

1068
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,211
You need to be honest about
whether this was intentional or a mistake.

1069
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:16,006
Can you take the lead
and try to sort it out?

1070
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:20,010
A direct approach is necessary
in situations like this.

1071
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,554
Be open and honest.

1072
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,097
Just say it.

1073
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,100
If you can't handle it,
I'll tell Do Jin-woo to do it.

1074
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,937
I'm asking what you were thinking
when you did that!

1075
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:34,441
You have to take responsibility
for all the choices you made.

1076
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,904
All eyes in the company
are on us right now.

1077
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,406
Right now, whoever fixes
this mess becomes the MVP.
