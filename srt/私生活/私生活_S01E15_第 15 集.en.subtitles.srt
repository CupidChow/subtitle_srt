ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,100
This is the report Lee Jeong-hwan wrote
on Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

4
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,269
The Analysis Team

5
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,230
says it's likely that Lee Jeong-hwan

6
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,526
probably faked Jeong Hyeon-cheol's death
and hid him somewhere.

7
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,625
SEND PHOTO?
YES, NO

8
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,086
According to the analysis,

9
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,924
he is an over-90-percent match to
Jeong Hyeon-cheol from 8 years ago.

10
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,390
Send in the men.
Send in everyone available.

11
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,202
Come this way.

12
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,876
Go in that room!

13
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,508
How did they know we'd be here?

14
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,057
-What is this?
-I'll lure them.

15
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,851
Take him to the car.

16
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,814
Okay. Be careful.

17
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,985
Okay. Then, I'll follow you, Jeong-hwan.

18
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,988
No. You have to protect Joo-eun.

19
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,532
Why? I'm the one who needs protection.

20
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,787
Hey, wait. Jeong-hwan!

21
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,293
-Hey, thugs!
-You!

22
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,253
Hey!

23
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,493
Don't come closer.

24
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,800
Hey!

25
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,344
Stop!

26
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,393
You bastard!

27
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,732
Mr. Lee!

28
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,777
Mr. Lee Jeong-hwan.

29
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,448
Why don't you come out now?

30
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,077
If you keep hiding,

31
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,621
I'll stick a nail in your wife's face.

32
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,775
Get your hands off her.

33
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,195
Do you pay my salary?

34
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,699
Don't order me around. You're not my boss.

35
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,910
Come on out before I beat up your wife.

36
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,537
Fine.

37
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,665
I'll cut your hands off first.
You just wait.

38
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,637
-What?
-Hey.

39
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,683
Damn it.

40
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,033
I'll stop them. Get in the car and drive.

41
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,536
Start running as soon as I make a move.

42
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,559
Hey! Damn it!

43
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,687
Damn it.

44
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,384
Go upstairs.

45
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,406
Long time no see.

46
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,953
Director Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

47
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,788
Damn it.

48
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,171
Gosh, you were alive all along.

49
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,299
I got someone
to impersonate you for nothing.

50
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,012
Goodness. That cute punk, Lee Jeong-hwan.

51
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,973
By the way,

52
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,767
you have your phone, right?

53
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,273
VIDEO HAS BEEN SAVED

54
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,322
Give it to me, so we can end this.
Stop wasting my time.

55
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,210
Just hand over your phone
then I'll let you off.

56
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,464
Goodness. You are still so frustrating.

57
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:33,304
By the way, depending on the quality
of the photo, you might get a fat bonus.

58
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,848
No.

59
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,188
You'll never do that.
That's not the kind of person you are.

60
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,816
Why? Because you're evil.

61
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,112
You tricked me eight years ago.
I won't fall for that again.

62
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,908
You made people think
that I was a sexual predator.

63
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,958
I'm sick of this.

64
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,589
I'm so sick

65
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,467
of living like this.

66
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,178
No!

67
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,110
Mr. Jeong. Mr. Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

68
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,347
Die, you bastard!

69
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,433
Damn it.

70
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,888
Jeong-hwan.

71
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,766
I'll come back to save you.

72
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,813
They lost Cha Joo-eun.

73
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,611
Damn it.

74
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,371
Where is it?

75
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,414
Where's what?

76
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,918
There are a lot of witnesses here.

77
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,421
They all saw you kill Jeong Hyeon-cheol

78
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,465
and take his phone.

79
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,639
Did you manage to give it to Cha Joo-eun
in that short amount of time?

80
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,893
I guess you did.

81
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,896
Then,

82
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,982
let's see how strong your love is.

83
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,652
Search him.

84
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,494
-Look for the phone.
-Oh, his phone.

85
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,891
What happened?

86
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,649
Are you all right?

87
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,863
Where's Jeong-hwan?

88
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,791
Let's find out what you saved her under.

89
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,002
MY LOVE

90
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,602
Jeong-hwan, are you all right?

91
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,604
This is Kim Jae-wook.

92
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,025
I'll cut to the chase.

93
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,153
You have Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone, right?

94
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,699
Bring back the phone here.

95
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,701
Hello?

96
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,287
Hey, Cha Joo-eun.

97
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,623
Hey.

98
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,460
She hung up.

99
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,755
What's her problem?

100
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,763
Let's think.

101
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,933
Think, Joo-eun.

102
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,606
Lee Jeong-hwan probably knew
it would turn out this way.

103
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,652
He should be waiting for me.

104
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,489
I have to come up with a plan.

105
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,873
Joo-eun.

106
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,045
Take this. This is very important.
Keep it safe.

107
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,802
The number you have dialed…

108
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,429
What's her problem?
Why isn't she answering the phone?

109
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,443
ALBUM, PHOTOS, VIDEOS

110
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,165
I won't see you off.

111
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,713
LEE DONG-JU, MINISTER OF LAND,
500 MILLION WON

112
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,966
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

113
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,428
KWON HYUK-JANG, CHIEF JUDGE,
400 MILLION WON

114
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,855
YOO BYUNG-JUN, CHIEF PROSECUTOR,
300 MILLION WON

115
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,106
This is for you.

116
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,322
PARK, HWAYEONG CITY MAYOR
300 MILLION WON

117
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,616
PARK, JANGHWA CONSTRUCTION
200 MILLION WON

118
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,659
KIM, KANGSU DAILY
150 MILLION WON

119
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,957
Everyone is in the photos.

120
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,294
Everyone in the ledger.

121
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,090
They are all scumbags.

122
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,885
The number you have dialed is currently…

123
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,145
She hung up on me
when your life is in danger.

124
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,396
What do you think?

125
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,149
Joo-eun won't come back.

126
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,692
Why?

127
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,904
Because she knows that you're an asshole.

128
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,993
Fine. Then, let's try this out.

129
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,496
Why don't we send her a video?

130
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,582
A video of you losing a finger.

131
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,212
I can't wait to see
how she'll react this time.

132
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,881
Hey, get me a knife.

133
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,178
-Film this.
-Yes, sir.

134
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,539
MY LOVE

135
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,468
Did you finally realize
that we need to talk like sensible adults?

136
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,848
I'll be there in 30 minutes.
Don't lay a finger on him until then.

137
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,477
If you do, you'll never find
Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone.

138
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,649
Let me warn you first.
If you go to the police…

139
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,817
Hello?

140
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,612
Damn it. She hung up on me again!

141
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,157
How did he know?

142
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,743
Know what?

143
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,704
How did he know we were meeting

144
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,789
Jeong Hyeon-cheol there?

145
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,045
The person who attacked me that night
was a woman.

146
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,844
Who are you? What are you doing here?

147
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,512
Was it this person?

148
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,182
And the female detective erased
the CCTV footage.

149
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,768
Yes, it's her. She's the one who came by.

150
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,978
No way.

151
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,980
But she's a detective.

152
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,441
Jeong-hwan told me

153
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,986
that GK shadows could be anywhere.

154
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,408
They're people around us
who we would least suspect.

155
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,580
Are you saying that Kim Jae-wook
has Lee Jeong-hwan?

156
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,541
We don't have time. If we don't go now--

157
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,876
Okay.

158
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,087
I'll call for backup. Let's get going now.

159
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,296
Before that,

160
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,799
you need to do something for me.

161
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,058
What's this?

162
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,185
It's Director Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone.

163
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,729
Give it to Detective Kang.

164
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,274
Is this really Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone?

165
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,235
No.

166
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,655
Then what is it?

167
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,826
The one who attacked me
the other night was Detective Kang.

168
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,204
I clearly remember now

169
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,832
those eyes.

170
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,767
MYUNG-HYUN

171
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,105
Yes, Myung-hyun.

172
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,735
What's up, Myung-hyun?

173
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,948
-Let's go.
-Where to?

174
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,625
So, is this Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone?

175
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,335
Keep it safe.

176
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,046
Okay.

177
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,090
Call the nearby police station for backup.

178
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,800
Okay.

179
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,393
Phone R. POW. ES.

180
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,021
What are you doing?

181
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,275
I keep getting weird text messages.

182
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,486
Call for backup quickly.

183
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,322
Okay.

184
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,952
This is Corporal Kang
of Violent Crimes Team 3

185
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,871
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

186
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,918
NEW MESSAGE

187
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,379
Retrieved phone. Police on their way.
Evacuate the site.

188
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,303
A backup has been called in.

189
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:25,349
And the 1325 phone is now moving
to the location mentioned earlier.

190
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,151
Get out of there.
The shadow took care of it.

191
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,153
What do you mean?

192
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,074
I can't tell you
about the shadows in detail.

193
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,243
You already know that.

194
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,663
Leave. There's no time.
The police will be there in ten minutes.

195
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,749
Yes, sir.

196
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,968
Lee Jeong-hwan's finger won't do.

197
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,846
See you later.

198
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,393
They got our location.
We need to move now.

199
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,519
Yes, sir.

200
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,340
You know that

201
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,553
you've beat me up a lot, don't you?

202
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,141
So,

203
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,393
don't be upset.

204
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,355
You're just reaping what you sowed.

205
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,696
What is that?

206
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,744
What is it?

207
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,620
Get him. What is it?

208
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,820
Yes.

209
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,448
What? An attack?

210
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,270
If I go to jail this time…

211
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,073
I don't see Lee Jeong-hwan.

212
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,992
What happened?

213
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,218
Mr. Han,

214
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,722
I really, really, really respect you.

215
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,601
You did your best to help him

216
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,604
even though he's your rival in a way.

217
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,565
That's how men should be, right?

218
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,403
A man's road or not,

219
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,947
why am I driving?

220
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,616
MO BYEONG-BOK CLINIC

221
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,451
I was afraid something would

222
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,204
happen to you.

223
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,249
I'm sorry I scared you like that.

224
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,543
It's okay.

225
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,096
While we were apart,

226
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,975
I missed you so much that I could die.

227
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,686
Same here.

228
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,567
The way you look,
your face, and your smile.

229
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,029
If I had them in my heart,

230
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,076
I thought I could remember them
even if we were apart.

231
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,581
I thought I could picture them
whenever I wanted.

232
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,834
But I was wrong.

233
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,838
Strangely,

234
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,052
I could hardly remember your face

235
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,098
no matter how much I missed you.

236
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,523
That's why I have to be with you.

237
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,445
I want to say something

238
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,656
that I didn't tell you.

239
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,369
Thank you, really,

240
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,456
for being alive.

241
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,805
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

242
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,766
Yes, I'm okay.

243
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,562
I should have been careful
not to hurt my lips.

244
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,980
Gosh, those bastards.

245
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,733
Those terrible bastards.

246
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,527
How dare they hurt my husband's lips.

247
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,772
What's this?

248
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,737
Joo-eun gave you this
saying that it was Jeong Hyeon-cheol's?

249
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,864
Yes, sir.

250
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,620
You've been exposed.

251
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,009
Clean up the traces of 1325.

252
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,178
Sir.

253
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,351
Get out.

254
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,856
I'll do my best
if you give me another chance.

255
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,983
I will never make a mistake again.

256
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,779
Do you know what kind of a mistake
you've made?

257
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,048
Before we take follow-up measures,
get out.

258
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,302
If you don't want to die
in a car accident,

259
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,763
quit the police and find a new job.

260
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,934
Do you want me to help you out?

261
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,464
You're a detective,
but you didn't even notice a tail?

262
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,593
You're unqualified in many ways.

263
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,596
Tell me about that car

264
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,015
before I run the plate.

265
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,268
You are

266
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,021
a GK shadow?

267
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,565
Myung-hyun.

268
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,693
I'm sorry.

269
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,574
You're really scary.

270
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,205
What should I do?

271
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,291
Tell me.

272
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,337
Let's…

273
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,591
just not see each other any more.

274
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,763
Myung-hyun.

275
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,308
I'm really sorry.

276
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,894
It was you.

277
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,273
You were the one who made it hard for me

278
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,901
and made me regret the job I was doing.

279
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,628
What's up? You never call me first.

280
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:28,052
I'm busy, so you have to make it quick.
Summarize your question.

281
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,722
Get to the point and make it simple.

282
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,848
Sure.

283
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,686
Have you been approaching
Assemblyman Yoo Byung-jun?

284
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,438
What's your plan?

285
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,608
A good plan.

286
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,612
Where is President Choi's ledger?

287
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,367
Did you think I'd never find out,

288
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,202
Ms. Jeong Yoon-kyung?

289
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,874
Don't worry.

290
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,710
I don't care how you've been living.

291
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,589
Because we're strictly business.

292
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,886
So, what kind of business
do you want to talk about?

293
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,264
Is your plan by any chance

294
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,100
to become the First Lady

295
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,062
or something like that?

296
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,566
If so, I want to tell you
that it's impossible.

297
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,151
The very moment

298
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,489
he finds out who you really are,
you'll be finished.

299
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,495
You're terrible at doing business.

300
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,832
Business is about

301
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:45,004
exchanging what each party wants.
It has to be a win-win game.

302
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,592
It's not about ending a relationship
on a cold note like you.

303
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,848
Anyway, thanks
for ending our relationship neatly.

304
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,855
By the way,

305
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,820
I like the sound of that.
Thanks for the idea.

306
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,571
And

307
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,452
I'm not Jeong Yoon-kyung.
I'm Sophia Chung.

308
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,770
You're here.

309
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,150
I'm on time, but you came early.

310
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,444
Because I was eager to see you.

311
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,238
I guess that made me light-footed.

312
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,369
Today

313
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,623
I'm going to tell you
an interesting story.

314
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,333
I'm excited.

315
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,921
I'll tell you my real name,
so listen carefully.

316
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,133
Jeong

317
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,802
Yoon-kyung.

318
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,931
That's my real name.

319
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,144
I see.

320
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,273
Doesn't it sound familiar?

321
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,694
Jeong Yoon…

322
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,988
Kyung?

323
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,368
YEAR 2007

UI CONSTRUCTION SECRETARY OFFICE
EXCHANGE STATEMENT

325
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,208
Did you find anything on Jeong Yoon-kyung?

326
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,125
Yes, sir.

327
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,218
JOB APPLICATION

328
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,930
You're right. I'm that Jeong Yoon-kyung.

329
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,765
How dare you.

330
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,728
Sit down. I'm not finished yet.

331
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,647
Don't you dare get cheeky.

332
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,526
Don't you want President Choi's ledger?

333
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,823
Weren't you looking for it desperately?

334
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,660
I'm sure you can tell by now.

335
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,787
That's right.

336
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,873
I have that ledger, too.

337
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,670
And I know Kim Jae-wook pretty well.

338
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,423
He'd never hand the ledger over to you.

339
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,802
You also know that, don't you?

340
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,516
I believe we can be great partners.

341
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:50,314
Our next honored guests are Assembly Yoo
from the Conservative Reform Party

342
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,442
and Sophia Chung,
an environmentalist from France.

343
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,028
Let's invite them to the stage.

344
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,254
It's the file on Candidate Nam Hyeon-jeong
that was in the ledger.

345
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,592
-Yoo Byung-jun!
-Yoo Byung-jun!

346
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,468
The current government

347
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,388
is old-fashioned
and is unwilling to change.

348
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,974
Take a look,

349
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,351
and you'll realize how greedy she is.

350
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,646
She took bribes from Choi regularly.

351
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,441
But then again, everyone in that ledger
is the same.

352
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,822
Don't destroy her, though.

353
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,825
Convince her to support you instead.

354
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,952
Do you understand?

355
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,890
Thank you. Goodbye.

356
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,030
What is this?

357
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,115
A surprise when it's not even my birthday?

358
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,743
I'm in a pickle right now.

359
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,204
What did you do this time?

360
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,208
What is it?

361
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,877
-I know.
-That?

362
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,463
That you met with Yoo Byung-jun
and Kim Jae-wook.

363
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,133
What are you scheming?

364
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,595
Everything's going well, so don't worry.

365
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,932
Fine.

366
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,726
I'll come clean first.

367
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,981
Jeong-hwan and I have joined hands
with Ms. Oh.

368
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,234
We're all helping Kwon Hyuk-jang.

369
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,112
So what the hell are you doing
with Candidate Yoo?

370
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,949
I thought we were in this together.

371
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,784
To catch Kim Jae-wook.

372
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,078
You said we were a team.

373
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,873
You said you wanted to ruin
all of his plans.

374
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,004
So what are you doing with Yoo Byung-jun?

375
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,468
You're practically rooting
for Kim Jae-wook.

376
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,638
Want a glass?

377
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,806
No, thanks.

378
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,976
Are you doing this

379
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,439
to make Kim Jae-wook jealous?

380
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,317
That's not a revenge.

381
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,278
You're only ruining yourself.

382
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,615
So quit it.

383
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,494
Is that why you told Lawyer Oh about me?

384
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,750
Sophia Chung's real name
is Jeong Yoon-kyung.

385
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,210
Jeong Yoon-kyung.

386
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,050
See? You're no different.

387
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:09,138
You have your reasons,

388
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,808
just like I have mine.

389
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,435
Got that?

390
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,272
We all just want

391
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,443
to become happy. That's all.

392
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,162
Want to hear a tacky story?

393
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,666
It's about a woman from the countryside

394
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,211
who became a local news announcer.

395
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,006
She wanted to become the main news anchor.

396
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,718
Hello.

397
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,472
Her score and skills

398
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,810
when joining the company had nothing to do
with the kind of job she'd have.

399
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,522
-What? Wait--
-There were countless other factors

400
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,065
that were far more important.

401
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,025
A league.

402
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,030
They had created a league of their own.

403
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,408
ANNOUNCER TEAM

404
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,743
Min-jeong, is the script ready?

405
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,036
Oh, that…

406
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,248
Here you go.

407
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,795
She was the executive's niece.

408
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,056
Come in.

409
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,062
Thanks.

410
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,738
Ten seconds until standby.

411
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,292
At around 6:10 p.m. today,
a fire broke out at a factory

412
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,086
in Masang-dong, Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do.

413
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,089
Okay.

414
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,092
We've just received…

415
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,969
Received…

416
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,180
Goodbye.

417
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,807
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

418
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,518
-Thank you.
-She was assigned

419
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,438
-to the Seoul headquarters.
-Congratulations.

420
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:26,275
The announcer from the countryside
was transferred to a radio station.

421
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,444
-You're going to Seoul.
-You should treat us.

422
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,987
I'm so sad that you're leaving.

423
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,697
-Thank you.
-It's sad.

424
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,365
-See you soon.
-I hope so.

425
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:41,165
No matter how hard she tried,
she could never join their league.

426
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,004
Come in.

427
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,590
She's here.

428
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,091
Hey.

429
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,302
Hello.

430
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,595
It's nice to meet you.

431
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,764
I'm Producer Lee Man-gi.

432
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,182
This is Seung-taek.

433
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,099
Hello.

434
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,310
Sit here and wait.

435
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,524
That was when she got the wrong idea.

436
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,156
She became curious

437
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,493
about those in the league.

438
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,912
That's why I'm thinking

439
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,289
about joining them.

440
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,669
Then perhaps, I could be a bit happier.

441
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,963
All right.

442
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,840
I'll leave now.

443
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,592
Sure.

444
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,394
You should also tell that announcer…

445
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,607
about how you're living now.

446
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,122
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

447
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,264
And the reinvestigation
of Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

448
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,058
It's a standstill.

449
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,479
They'll have it drag on for a few months
then cover it up once the dust settles.

450
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,775
I'm sorry.

451
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,322
Had it not been for Detective Kang,
we would've had

452
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,574
full control over that case.

453
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,995
What happened to her?

454
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,415
She resigned and vanished.

455
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,338
GK shadows are terrifying.

456
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,092
And Jeong Hyeon-cheol's body?

457
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,137
It's safe.

458
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,805
What's your plan?

459
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,183
They even created
a fake Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

460
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,185
I won't allow them
to use his body as well.

461
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,063
What's your next move?

462
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,191
I should let everyone know

463
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,361
what a filthy asshole Yoo Byung-jun is.

464
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,156
They need to know
that he should never become the president.

465
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,743
This is tough.

466
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,621
Yet the weather is beautiful.

467
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,838
What will you do?

468
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,262
We should stop them all.

469
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,475
The news, the police…

470
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,435
All of them.

471
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,329
Reporter Kim Gi-cheol?

472
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,666
Mr. Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

473
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,877
No, I'm his younger brother.

474
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,796
I see.

475
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,802
He wanted you to have this.

476
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,849
Thank you for mustering up the courage.

477
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,275
Hey!

478
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,209
I can upload it. However,

479
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,211
no one will see it out.

480
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:00,799
All the popular channels
will be monitored by GK.

481
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,262
As you know, we need
to spread this as much as we can.

482
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,181
If not, no one will believe it.

483
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,807
This isn't celebrity gossip.

484
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,228
Kwon Hyuk-jang is our only bet.

485
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,903
What's wrong?

486
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:28,410
Because both Yoo Byung-jun
and Kwon Hyuk-jang are scumbags?

487
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,999
Let's just focus on what we can do.

488
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:39,505
Let the world know about their true faces.

489
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,468
Leave the decision up to people, not us.

490
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,386
Joo-eun.

491
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,304
Yes?

492
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,890
I think I got myself a fine wife.

493
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,102
You better treat me well if you know that.

494
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:55,812
Okay.

495
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,234
CONSERVATIVE REFORM PARTY

496
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,996
Hello.

497
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,583
I'm Candidate Nam Hyeon-jeong
from the Conservative Reform Party.

498
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,044
As of this moment,

499
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:23,048
I'm officially withdrawing my candidacy.

500
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,052
I am truly grateful

501
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:31,223
for all the support I received
from the people and our party members.

502
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:35,352
In addition, I will be supporting
Candidate Yoo Byung-jun.

503
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:39,523
I also ask that our party members

504
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:43,735
support Mr. Yoo Byung-jun
in this race as well.

505
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,738
Thank you.

506
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,969
Hello.

507
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,138
They've owned this store for 20 years.

508
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,306
I see.

509
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,433
-Hello.
-Hello.

510
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,310
-Goodness.
-I'm too far away.

511
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,644
How's business these days?

512
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,938
Gosh, it's really difficult.

513
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,858
As you can see, many people
don't shop at the market.

514
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,901
I see. Hang in there.

515
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,361
It will get better for you.

516
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,904
Okay. Thank you.

517
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,867
Goodness. You're giving me too much.

518
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,118
That's enough.

519
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,203
This place has the best tteokbokki.

520
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,040
-Try some.
-Thank you.

521
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,169
It's really tasty.

522
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,174
Let me give you more.

523
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,301
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

524
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,595
-Hello.
-How much would you like?

525
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,556
HELPING THE ELDERLY
WITH ASSEMBLYMAN YOO BYUNG-JUN

526
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,183
One, two…

527
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,313
The piglet is almost done
with building the house.

528
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:05,984
A wolf is seen salivating from afar.

529
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,904
"This is good.

530
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,448
I'll gobble them all up tomorrow."

531
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,825
"No! Help me!"

532
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,843
Things are looking up.

533
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,055
You should be more careful
at times like this.

534
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,099
If you get into a scandal--

535
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,976
Are you talking about Sophia Chung?

536
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,648
I'll get rid of her soon. Don't you worry.

537
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,161
That foolish woman.

538
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:55,135
DEPUTY CHIEF KIM JAE-WOOK

539
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,532
DEPUTY CHIEF KIM JAE-WOOK

540
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,136
THIS IS LEE JEONG-HWAN

541
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,527
I apologize.

542
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,946
No, it's okay.

543
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,948
It's better to be safe than sorry.

544
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:13,171
I trust that you'll put it to good use.
I'll get going now, sir.

545
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,256
Mr. Lee.

546
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,258
Thank you.

547
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,053
Goodbye, sir.

548
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:25,058
As a token of gratitude, I'll tell you
something important next time.

549
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,520
I'll look forward to it, sir.

550
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,574
I'm Assemblyman Kwon Hyuk-jang.

551
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:46,955
Recently, unverified slanderous
remarks about me have been spreading.

552
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,665
As a result,

553
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,586
I have decided to reveal
a shocking photo to you all.

554
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,754
Here it is.

555
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,473
This is what you call proof,

556
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:09,144
not some scribbles written
by an unidentifiable individual.

557
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,980
This is what you would consider
a hard evidence

558
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,525
that cannot be refuted by anyone.

559
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,986
We can't see the photo well.
Please bring it closer.

560
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,155
Please show it to this side.

561
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,615
A bit more to this side.

562
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,165
Did you not keep an eye

563
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,918
on those around him?

564
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,504
Well, I did give out orders,
but Lee Jeong-hwan

565
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,215
was too quick.

566
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,523
Put an end to everything you were doing.

567
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,441
Remove all traces.

568
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,070
Don't get the wrong idea.

569
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,490
This order isn't from me.

570
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:53,581
Assemblyman Yoo is guilty of receiving
three billion won from President Choi

571
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,834
in return for handing over

572
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:59,337
Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone that
could have served as critical evidence.

573
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:03,425
Assembly Yoo was loved
by the people for his upright image.

574
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,136
Jeong-hwan.

575
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,097
I'm craving some kimchi stew.

576
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,266
The four steps?

577
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,559
The three steps.

578
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,352
Right.

579
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,109
There will be no more
fighting dirty after this.

580
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,652
Do you understand?

581
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,114
As long as they keep
their end of the bargain.

582
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,994
I don't think you quite understood
what I meant.

583
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,708
You should never go
against the owner's wishes.

584
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,305
Sir.

585
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,685
Mr. Lee called several times.

586
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,689
Turn the car around.

587
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,249
I don't want to go there.

588
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,667
I'll see you soon.

589
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,294
Okay. I won't be long.

590
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,049
Be quick.

591
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,259
Okay.

592
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,540
Sir.

593
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:06,798
Sir.

594
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,258
Sir!

595
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,260
Sir!

596
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,636
Sir!

597
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,084
Call the police.

598
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,343
Ma'am, are you okay?

599
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,428
Yes, I'm fine.

600
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,305
Goodness.

601
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,723
Oh, no.

602
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,816
Can you stand up?

603
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,048
Goodness. Welcome.

604
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,633
It's nice to meet you.

605
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,093
Please.

606
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,776
The ones who murdered Kwon Hyuk-jang
will be…

607
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,913
Kim Jae-wook and Lee Jeong-hwan.

608
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,790
Both of them.

609
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,588
We will now proceed with the operation

610
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,007
to catch them.

611
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,225
WOOK'S GUKBAP

612
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,623
It's me, your friend.

613
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,626
You startled me.

614
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,006
I'll never be promoted

615
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,926
if I keep counting on you.

616
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,137
Do you want to hear your Miranda rights?

617
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,726
You know how to use them.

618
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,937
Cuff yourself.

619
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,166
Stop, Lee Jeong-hwan!

620
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,742
The first step in pulling a con…

621
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,243
There's something I want to do.

622
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,996
…is to understand your target's needs
as accurately as possible.

623
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,831
You need to know their wants,

624
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,625
their hopes,

625
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,503
and their desires.

626
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,214
I can't waste all of that because of you.

627
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,466
I guess your heyday is over.

628
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,552
-What about Cha Joo-eun?
-I think we're the same.

629
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,638
You ordered the hit and beat them up.
What are you trying to pull?

630
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,515
Who do you think is behind it?

631
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,644
It will be hard to live in Korea
as a fugitive.

632
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,812
I'm sorry.

633
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,106
We should both be punished.

634
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:02,653
