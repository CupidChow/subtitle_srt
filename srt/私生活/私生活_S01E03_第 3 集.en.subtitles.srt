1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,844
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS, AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,602
People all live their own private lives.

4
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,813
In the Constitution,
there's the Privacy Law.

5
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,899
It protects our secrecy and freedom.

6
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,568
But where does the boundary lie
between secrecy and freedom?

7
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,487
We live in a world
where we feel like losers

8
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,781
if we don't share our private lives.

9
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,200
What is legal

10
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,494
and what is illegal to share?

11
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,121
Is it legal to share
if it makes you feel good?

12
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,541
Is it illegal and should remain a secret
if it makes you feel like shit?

13
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,711
Be it a secret,
freedom, legal, or illegal,

14
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,464
people collect
other people's private lives regardless.

15
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,716
For their personal interest,

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,677
they collect and use
the private lives of others.

17
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,263
And some people fabricate them.

18
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,559
They share, steal, use,
and fabricate their private lives.

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,688
Right now, Korea is facing the era
of shared privacy while we are engaged

20
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,108
in a war of privacy.

21
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,656
And I chase other people's private lives.

22
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,536
WEDDING HALL

23
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,193
Damn it.

24
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,802
But now, I'm being chased.

25
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,555
Why today of all days?

26
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,909
Damn it.

27
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,042
EPISODE 3

28
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,377
This is nice.

29
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,381
It doesn't have
that new construction smell.

30
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,298
Right.

31
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,012
But isn't this a bit too big for us?

32
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,057
It's not that big.
There are only three rooms.

33
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,726
But it's too big for just two people.

34
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,686
"Two"?

35
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,939
There will be three or four of us soon.

36
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,571
Joo-eun.

37
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,199
Let's be patriots.

38
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,413
Having two kids won't be enough, then.

39
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,709
-Then, a four-bedroom house?
-Five.

40
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,629
I'll try my best.

41
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,842
All right.
Then, let's test this place out.

42
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
It's nice and clean.

43
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:43,968
Thank you.

44
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,763
-Then, be good to me.
-Okay.

45
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,444
I'd like to help you
with the house deposit.

46
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,285
CHA JOO-EUN

47
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,625
ACCOUNT BALANCE

48
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,960
Joo-eun, this is--

49
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,522
You're up.

50
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,566
What are you doing?

51
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
I'm making killer kimchi stew.

52
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,031
I love kimchi stew.

53
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,909
I had a feeling that you would.

54
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,662
But this isn't any ordinary kimchi stew.

55
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,707
Chuck flap.

56
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,917
This tastes amazing in the stew.

57
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,961
You add beef to kimchi stew?

58
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,714
It will taste amazing. It's fantastic.

59
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,770
It is different.

60
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,314
-Right?
-It's delicious.

61
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,400
All right. Let me show you
a three-step way of enjoying this.

62
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,735
Watch.

63
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,488
Get a spoonful of the rice.

64
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,366
Put kimchi from the stew
on top of the rice.

65
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,205
And put a piece of fried egg on it.

66
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,582
Then, the dried laver.

67
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,752
Oh, right.
It shouldn't be regular dried laver.

68
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,629
Make sure it's salted.

69
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,256
All right.

70
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,769
By the way,

71
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,896
wasn't it four steps?

72
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,732
Rice, kimchi, egg, and dried laver.

73
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,863
Rice doesn't count
because it's just the base.

74
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,575
Come on.

75
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,538
-I lost count.
-But it's so good.

76
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,540
It's not salty, right?

77
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,457
It's perfect.

78
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,153
YOUNG MAN'S PIZZA

79
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,196
Pizza and makgeolli?

80
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,577
You obviously haven't tried it.
It's actually not that bad.

81
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,621
Let's go. I know a good place.

82
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,959
Soju is the way to go with pizza.

83
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,355
What the heck happened?

84
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,318
Why me?

85
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,865
Why did this happen?

86
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,827
Hey, Lee Jeong-hwan.

87
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,666
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

88
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,379
Why did you do that?

89
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,671
Why?

90
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,798
Why should I be sad?

91
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,092
I'm not sad at all.

92
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,219
I'm fine.

93
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,070
It's dangerous

94
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,155
to be drinking alone in that state.

95
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,617
Someone should listen to her
and comfort her, too.

96
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,830
I guess it's up to me.

97
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,874
Fine. I have no choice.

98
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,167
I'll make the sacrifice.

99
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,588
You're aching for a beating, aren't you?

100
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,594
Get back before I beat you to a pulp.

101
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,639
Hold on.

102
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,599
Did I make the sauce?

103
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,268
"The sauce"?

104
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,457
As a friend,

105
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,963
I should say something nice
to comfort you at a time like this.

106
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,258
But nothing really comes to my mind.

107
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,138
What can we do?
The world is just a shitty place.

108
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,727
All we can do is
to keep on fighting until our last breath.

109
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,146
Don't worry about it.

110
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,357
When it comes to

111
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,486
comforting or complimenting someone,

112
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,698
no one can do it for you.
You must do it yourself.

113
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,661
I'm consoling myself.

114
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:13,083
So you can help out
by buying me soju and this meal.

115
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,294
Sure.

116
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,422
-Let me pour you one.
-Okay.

117
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,741
Tell me honestly.

118
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,788
Are you happy? Is this funny to you?

119
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,213
The last documentary I filmed,
what was it?

120
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,300
Was he also an actor like me?

121
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,720
-I don't know.
-You did the job without knowing anything?

122
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,557
When doing a job that's above your level,
it's better that way.

123
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:14,144
The higher it goes, the less people share.
If you ask them to share, you'll get hurt.

124
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,819
Fine. Then who directed it?

125
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,325
Even if you don't know the plot,
you must know where the order was from.

126
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,247
Come on,
we worked together for a long time.

127
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,958
How can you do this to me?

128
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,253
Lee Jeong-hwan.

129
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,256
-What?
-The team manager from GK.

130
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,234
Excuse me.

131
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,280
Well,

132
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:11,118
I'm here to meet a team manager.
His name is Lee Jeong-hwan.

133
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,787
-Which department is he in?
-Development Team Two.

134
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,959
Hello.
This is the security from the first floor.

135
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,462
Mr. Lee Jeong-hwan has a visitor here.

136
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,175
He'll come down.

137
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,665
-There he is.
-Where's my visitor?

138
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,752
Who are you?

139
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,172
-Mr. Lee Jeong-hwan?
-Yes, I am.

140
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,097
It's nothing. I'm sorry.
I got the wrong person.

141
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,432
Did you

142
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,853
meet a man who was impersonating me?

143
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,901
This has happened a few times before.

144
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,655
Did something bad happen to you?

145
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,575
I already reported this to the police.

146
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,537
You can tell me
if he harmed you in any way.

147
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,456
I can report it to the police for you.

148
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,546
I guess this isn't a good place.

149
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,008
Do you want some coffee?
Or do you want to have a meal?

150
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,552
You didn't call the police, did you?

151
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,304
After coffee, you'd offer drinks.

152
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,973
What comes

153
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,267
after drinks?

154
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,936
Men are all dogs.

155
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,904
DETECTIVE AGENCY

156
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,281
BEST DETECTIVE AGENCY

157
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,829
Hello. How can I help you?

158
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,459
I'd like to find someone.

159
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,045
-Where are you now?
-Pardon?

160
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,714
-I'd like to meet you in person.
-Why?

161
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,507
You said you wanted to find someone.

162
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,092
Aren't you giving us the case?

163
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,846
I can just go to your office.

164
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,265
We don't accept visits from our clients.

165
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,100
Where are you now?

166
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,561
All right. Bye, then.

167
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,397
What's wrong with him?

168
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,692
Why does he want to come here?
That's creepy.

SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

172
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,459
Gosh.

173
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,518
This is Spy Detective Agency.
We do anything for our clients.

174
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,938
Hello. I'm calling
because I want to find someone.

175
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,149
So you're looking for someone. So what?

176
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,444
I don't know where to start.

177
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,156
I'm sorry, but I don't think
we can find that person for you.

178
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:37,908
Pardon?

179
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:42,371
But just in case,
I'll call you back if we can take the job.

180
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,622
What's your name?

181
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,834
What is this now?

182
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,755
I do want to find
that person for you, too.

183
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,272
FRONT DOOR

184
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,587
Where did this bastard go? Seriously…

185
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,049
I barely know anything about him.

186
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,969
Marry him?

187
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,099
You were so brave, Cha Joo-eun.

188
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,102
You're insane, Cha Joo-eun.

00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:48,872
TEAM TWO

196
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,839
Yes, I'm heading out now.

197
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,007
-Why are you so late?
-Were you waiting for me?

198
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,435
WE ARE PREPARING TO UPLOAD THE FOOTAGE

199
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,437
This again?

200
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,023
You're being delusional.

201
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,941
Stop bullshitting us.

202
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,234
What? You little--

203
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,115
Do you want to be arrested for assault?

204
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,872
WE'RE SENDING THE FOOTAGE VIA EMAIL

205
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,880
I've just received an email.

206
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,433
I assume you'll want to sign
the agreement I've prepared.

207
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,106
OH HYUN-KYUNG SENT 20 MILLION WON

208
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,567
Thanks. Let's have a drink next time.

209
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,510
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

210
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,309
Get me some strong coffee.

211
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,937
Mr. Lee, it's been so long.

212
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,439
Don't look.

213
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,108
Then look at me.

214
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,445
With curvy hips, don't I look great?

215
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,364
Well, sure.

216
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,831
It feels like it's been years.

217
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,543
I believe we have so much
to say to each other.

218
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,963
Go ahead. I'll listen like a good puppy.

219
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,589
You haven't seen me for 17 days,

220
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,174
but I've called every day.

221
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,844
You're as cold as ice.
You make me want to melt you.

222
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,846
Before you make me melt away,

223
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,514
let me have a cup of coffee.

224
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,725
It's been ages
since the coffee machine broke.

225
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,228
But don't worry.

226
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,022
I can still go out
and grab some coffee to go.

227
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,190
Then, please.

228
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,411
Coffee only.

229
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,330
Can't you see that I work out?

230
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,499
I'd never let my hard work go to waste.

231
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,091
I'd like a vanilla affogato.

232
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,594
-And a large espresso, please.
-Sure.

233
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,805
Wait a second.

234
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,810
I'm feeling hungry
because I've been working out so hard.

235
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,521
This is why I like to exercise.

236
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,356
Give me this, too.

237
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,527
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

238
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,982
Yes, Ms. Ko. Did you get coffee?

239
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,777
You have a guest.

240
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,539
So, how can I help you?

241
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,457
I need to find someone.

242
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,670
Isn't that what you do?

243
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,380
That's our specialty.

244
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:52,676
There is a person I must find.

245
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,844
-Ms. Ko?
-Yes?

246
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,516
Oh, the price list?

247
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:03,979
Here you go.

248
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,981
REAL ESTATE CONTRACT

249
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,368
THE PROMISE OF SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

250
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,621
As you can see, we don't ask
about your relationship with the target.

251
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,624
Even if it's just an acquaintance,
and if you only know the phone number,

252
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,044
their registration number,
hometown, school, occupation, address,

253
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,298
or even if you don't have
any information--

254
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,761
It's possible, right?

255
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,475
Ms. Ko.

256
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,270
Book a VIP room for two
at the Chinese restaurant

257
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,396
by the intersection.

258
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,689
No Chinese food, thanks.

259
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,150
Continue with the business.

260
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,820
I'll keep my ears open.

261
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,124
"There isn't enough information.
I need more money and time."

262
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,542
Don't give me any of that.

263
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:12,297
I trust that you'll find this person
as soon as possible.

264
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,465
Of course.

265
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,594
By the way, may I ask you a question?

266
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,682
You're being nosy already.
This isn't good.

267
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,019
I'm sorry.

268
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,855
Finish what you started.

269
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,483
You've made me curious.

270
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,404
This is a shabby place. Why--

271
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,199
-Why did I come here?
-Yes.

272
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,533
Is it trustworthy?

273
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,206
Why do you need a detective agency?

274
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:50,710
Ms. Oh, you've gotten
much more nosy while I was away.

275
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,172
Let's just do business only.

276
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,008
I've asked around
since I returned to Korea.

277
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,594
Everyone says you're the best of the best,

278
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,720
"Spy Lee."

279
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,641
-So that's what they say.
-I can trust you, right?

280
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,226
Of course.

281
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,143
Then,

282
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,437
I'll wait for your call.

283
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,324
I don't think it'll take that long.

284
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,368
Fifteen days will be enough.

285
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,412
It won't be easy, though.

286
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,081
You can trust me.

287
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,334
Fine, then. Fifteen days it is.

288
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,795
Goodbye.

289
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,260
What will we have for staff dinner?

290
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,261
We can have

291
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,221
prime rib, can't we?

292
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,943
I'm sorry I lacked sincerity.

293
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,028
I'll make you a wrap.

294
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,282
No, thanks. I only eat meat.

295
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,325
That's bad for you.

296
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,244
You always have to eat meat

297
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,164
with vegetables like this.

298
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,416
It's okay.

299
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,209
I drink alcohol with it,

300
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,712
so all the bad stuff gets disinfected.

301
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,852
Do you want to do it?

302
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,566
Do what?

303
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,818
Drink.

304
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,321
No, I'm good.

305
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,037
Alcohol isn't good for your skin,
so I don't drink.

306
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,706
I need to protect myself.

307
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,919
I don't think there's much to protect.

308
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,879
That's a lie.

309
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,050
I thought you couldn't lie,
but you're pretty good at it.

310
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,011
Is that what people call a white lie?

311
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,388
What's with this weirdo?

312
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,437
Seriously, where did he go?

313
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,648
He said he'd be back soon.

314
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,651
Who? Jeong-hwan?

315
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,654
Yes. Mr. Lee, of course. Who else?

316
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,574
That's odd. Didn't you ask him?

317
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,118
-Ask him what?
-To leave us alone.

318
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,119
What?

319
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,039
Because you wanted to be alone with me.

320
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,792
No, I didn't. Never!

321
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,961
You're lying again.

322
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,629
Oh, gross.

323
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,931
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

324
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,267
Please try again later.

325
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,943
DEPARTURE DATE
ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE

326
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,987
What? Is this it?

327
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,991
She could've just said it.

328
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,577
All right, Edward.

329
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,621
Let me see your face.

330
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,174
Edward.

331
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,424
CONFIRMED

332
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,484
SECURITY ZONE
NO CELL PHONES

333
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,992
So you made Mr. Park
of One Line get divorced?

334
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:14,909
Yes, sir.

335
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,499
Turn it off.

336
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,003
So? What about the key technology?

337
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,213
He paid a lot of alimony,

338
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,757
but he won't be able to stop seeing her.

339
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,468
Now that he's divorced,
he'll make bolder moves.

340
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,511
So?

341
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,265
Mr. Park's lover,
Yoo Mi-young, will be a corporate spy.

342
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,353
She'll steal technologies
from his computer

343
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,689
and hand them over to China.

344
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,484
If Mr. Park reports her to the police,
they'll know it's a scam.

345
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,777
He won't be able to.

346
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,154
Because the moment he does,

347
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,657
he'll look like the one who stole
the technologies through Yoo Mi-young.

348
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,325
I see.

349
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,578
What's the next step?

350
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,123
As soon as they believe

351
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,250
that the technology has been sold to China

352
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,212
and their value has fallen,
we'll reach out to them. Indirectly.

353
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:12,133
You'll probably get what you want
if you just press him a little.

354
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,428
Why would you take a detour?

355
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,599
Mr. Lee, this plan looks overcomplicated.

356
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,559
Do you think so?

357
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,646
Then clearly,
you don't understand how it works.

358
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,274
No.

359
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,069
It's elegant. It's good.

360
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,948
This frames the government as incompetent
in stopping Chinese industrial espionage,

361
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:40,661
plus we'll be helping
a small company in crisis of bankruptcy.

362
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,081
We improve the company image
and steal their technology.

363
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,248
Good. Proceed with it.

364
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,167
Yes, sir.

365
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,169
Next.

366
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,130
There were no other civil matters
that'd make a stir.

367
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,343
There was a request
for a contract killing.

368
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,597
The client wanted
to kill someone for insurance money.

369
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,515
And?

370
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,434
The client withdrew halfway
due to financial reasons.

371
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,520
-Because of the fee?
-Yes.

372
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,689
The fee was much higher
than he'd expected.

373
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,529
He couldn't kill someone
because he didn't have enough money.

374
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,118
Working class economy
is in terrible shape.

375
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,744
What's the government doing?

376
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,169
Help him out.

377
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,630
-Pardon?
-Introduce him to a subcontractor.

378
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,134
The cheap ones
that get in by boat, they'd do the job.

379
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,011
They're ignorant, sloppy, and love money.

380
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,347
They kill, get caught,
and end up on the news.

381
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,850
"The collapse of the people's livelihood."

382
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,184
"The common people's pain."

383
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,895
We should let the world know.

384
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,693
Yes, sir.

385
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,575
-Well…
-What is it?

386
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,870
-I have something to tell you.
-Say it.

387
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,248
Mr. Woo doesn't need to hear it.

388
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,916
-What?
-Mr. Woo.

389
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,462
Yes, sir.

390
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,947
What are these?

391
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,283
Who is this?

392
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,369
I believe it's Kim Jae-wook.

393
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,538
Arsonist Kim?

394
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,963
His face has changed a bit,

395
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,965
but the body proportion

396
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,676
and posture are similar to Kim Jae-wook.

397
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:12,021
SUMMER, 2007

398
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,024
Hey, you came.

399
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,446
You came to the scene in a suit?

400
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,491
Is this your first time?

401
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,117
Yes.

402
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,959
These punks drink wherever they want.

403
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,463
They don't even clean up.

404
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,801
On a perfect day for a fire to start.

405
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,767
Let's go.

406
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,525
I said let's go. We're done here.

407
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,916
Gosh, I guess
there's a big fire somewhere.

408
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,921
-What is it?
-Oh, it's nothing.

409
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,676
Maybe it's because
the president didn't finish college,

410
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,636
but this country keeps getting worse.

411
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,228
A fire broke out at a mountain
in Euiri, Gyeonggi Province

412
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,273
due to unknown causes
and the fire has spread

413
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,816
to a nearby phone factory.

414
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,943
Fire authorities followed protocol

415
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,487
for Disaster Response Level 1
and are extinguishing the fire.

416
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,740
However,
the fire has yet to be contained.

417
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,201
Thankfully, there has been
no reported casualties for now--

418
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,417
Was the factory our target?

419
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,630
Another trustworthy small business
will bite the dust

420
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,924
during difficult times like now.

421
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,635
I think

422
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,515
a more competent president
will be elected this December.

423
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,690
The name, "Edward,"
was an alias that Kim Jae-wook used.

424
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,608
2019 AGAIN

425
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,569
Richard Gere's character
in Pretty Woman was named Edward.

426
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,115
He claimed
to have looked like Richard Gere.

427
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,493
He liked that name quite a bit.

428
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,370
Where did you get these?

429
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,541
There is a person I must find.

430
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,378
Do a background check
on your client first.

431
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,508
We'll find out if it's really Arsonist Kim
after that. Got it?

432
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,676
Yes, sir.

433
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,931
We haven't had sake in a while. Shall we?

434
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,477
-What is it?
-I'll escort you, sir.

435
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,404
It's good.

436
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,198
How did you find such a good restaurant?

437
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,159
-Did you come here on a date?
-No, sir.

438
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,372
Some of my clients were from law firms,
and I came here with them.

439
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,003
Look at how pretty this dish is.
I bet women love this place.

440
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,468
Are you seeing anyone?

441
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,262
No, right?

442
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,807
Actually, I am, sir.

443
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,436
Are you underestimating what I know?

444
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,109
Still, you should get married.

445
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,362
You know

446
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,615
that in this line of work,
we need to look normal.

447
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,701
Get married like everyone else.

448
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,536
Don't stand out.

449
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,247
The higher-ups aren't fond
of bachelors either.

450
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,001
Not having a family means being unstable.

451
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,589
Arsonist Kim was single
throughout all those years,

452
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,215
then he was kicked out.

453
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,094
Should I set you up?

454
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,767
Find yourself a woman before I do so.

455
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,228
You should at least pick your own wife.

456
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,032
MS. KO

457
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,868
Come on. You wanted to drink
for the first time in months,

458
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,036
then you stood me up?

459
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,289
This time,
I'm going to wait until you come.

460
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,124
I'm broke. Sad face.

461
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,375
Hurry up.

462
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,622
Congratulations.

463
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,335
Oh, my God! Are you crazy?

464
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,963
Sir, this isn't what it looks like.

465
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,131
No. It wasn't me…

466
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,759
The soju! It was the soju!

467
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,177
Darn soju!

468
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:50,943
Are you happy?

469
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,362
Yes, I am. I'm very happy.

470
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,284
-Then why are you still here?
-What?

471
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,327
Chase after her. Hurry.

472
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,079
Thanks.

473
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,667
Take that off. People may think
you really work for a conglomerate.

474
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,585
Bye.

475
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,605
You've been living alone, right?

476
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,692
Yes.

477
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,946
-Do you cook?
-Well, not much.

478
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,240
I can make a few side dishes.

479
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,451
I see. What do you put
in your kimchi stew?

480
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,870
Pork belly or neck?

481
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,872
Tuna.

482
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,791
Tuna…

483
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,044
-Raw tuna?
-No.

484
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,545
Oh, canned tuna.

485
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,756
Yes.

486
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,718
Have you tried this before?

487
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,642
Chuck flap tail.

488
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,187
Beef.

489
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,379
Since you received a scholarship,

490
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,965
I'm sure you had no choice.

491
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,928
But you do know
what the Innovative Vision Room is, right?

492
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,930
Yes, I do.

493
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,015
What is it?

494
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,017
I know that it serves as a foundation

495
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,020
that'll help lead
GK Technology down the right path.

496
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,106
That's right.

497
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:35,691
Then…

498
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,695
Who do you think owns this country?

499
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,866
BH? The National Assembly?

500
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,577
The prosecution? The judiciary?

501
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:47,953
The NIS?

502
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:50,956
No.

503
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,084
It's us, GK.

504
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,546
I'm saying what we do

505
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,842
leads this country down the right path.

506
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,681
Don't become too cocky, though.

507
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,143
Just do what you've been doing
and be humble.

508
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,146
Just like back in school.

509
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,484
I was a student when I first started.

510
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,237
Joined activist groups,

511
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,740
made a list and inspected them,

512
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,283
broke up organizations…

513
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,451
Influenced the students,

514
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,330
observed high-ranking officials' children,
and so on.

515
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,792
How was the stew?

516
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,878
It was amazing.

517
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,463
We should have wine.

518
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,225
Let's have soju instead.

519
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,437
You should drink wine with women.

520
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,069
There's soju at home

521
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,323
but no soju glasses.

522
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,325
Here.

523
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,539
Isn't this house nice?

524
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,583
Yes, it's incredible.

525
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,962
When will I be able to live
in a house like this one?

526
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,552
-Did you think this was my place?
-Is it not?

527
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,682
Whose house do you think this is?

528
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,981
This is President Choi
of UI Construction's second house.

529
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,483
You know him, right?

530
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,071
Didn't he commit suicide a week ago?

531
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:51,368
He controlled politics, the prosecution,
the police, and the judiciary.

532
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,788
Every single one of them was on the take.

533
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,793
From what I know, there was no solid proof
to prove anything.

534
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,420
Of course.

535
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:06,133
They all got away with it because he died.

536
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,347
What's your take on that?

537
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,691
Do you really think he committed suicide?

538
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,489
When he was found,

539
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,993
they couldn't find anything to stand on.

540
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,829
That means

541
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,000
he had put the noose
around his neck up there

542
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,127
and then jumped.

543
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,632
But you know what? His neck was fine.

544
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,264
He fell from up there,
but he died from asphyxiation.

545
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,394
Are you saying it wasn't suicide then?

546
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,813
Those bastards.

547
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,442
If they hung him up high,
they should've broken his neck.

548
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,778
Or they should've set up a chair at least.

549
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,498
Anyway,

550
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:24,294
since they couldn't go to the NFS
and break his neck,

551
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,881
they came back here to plant a chair.

552
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,510
But they foolishly overlooked
something important.

553
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,679
A witness.

554
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,685
Someone had witnessed

555
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,771
the murder.

556
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,590
Then

557
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,718
the witness' testimony
will settle everything.

558
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,478
But

559
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,773
the witness vanished into thin air.

560
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,371
I believe
this is where the witness vomited.

561
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,873
The prosecution, the police,

562
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,586
the NIS, several politicians,
and Civil Affairs…

563
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,257
Everyone's looking for the witness.

564
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,593
-Do you mean--
-That's right.

565
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,098
We need to find her
before anyone else does.

566
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:27,978
Do you know

567
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,356
who the witness is?

568
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:32,983
Of course.

569
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,404
She's the owner of this place
and President Choi's mistress,

570
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,242
Jeong Yoon-kyung.

571
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,869
DO NOT CROSS

572
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:14,024
PC GRAVEYARD

573
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,324
-How did it go?
-I lost her.

574
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,118
-Where?
-At the Gaemi Mart intersection.

575
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,162
What?

576
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,003
Are you talking about Ms. Ko?

577
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,672
Then who else?

578
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,634
This was my first miracle in 30 years.

579
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,767
Is she an olympic runner or something?

580
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,769
I couldn't catch up with her.

581
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,520
It was as if she was walking on air.

582
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,523
She must've really not wanted
to get caught.

583
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,067
By whom?

584
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,528
Is she being chased by some loan sharks?

585
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,656
How much does she owe?
Does she need my help?

586
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,200
I shouldn't lend her any money
before marriage.

587
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,326
Hey.

588
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,705
Anyway,

589
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,209
did you look into Sophia Chung?

590
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,002
Who?

591
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,296
She was using a burner phone.

592
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,258
I got this by tracking her fingerprints
from her business card.

593
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,760
Jeong Yoon-kyung. Died in 2007.

594
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,389
-What?
-She's dead.

595
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,520
Jeong Yoon-kyung.

596
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,147
JEONG YOON-KYUNG

597
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,532
Are you sure?

598
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,827
Her body was completely swollen
and bits of her were eaten by the fish.

599
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,997
But thankfully, we found her ID card.

600
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,346
What a shame. She was young and pretty.

601
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,059
Do you think it was an accident or--

602
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,019
Or what?

603
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,064
-Murder?
-Shouldn't we continue investigating?

604
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,234
Why do you think everyone was

605
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,112
so bent on finding her?

606
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,156
We need to uncover the truth.

607
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,034
There's no such thing as the truth.

608
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,036
There are only the facts

609
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,372
that President Choi
and Jeong Yoon-kyung are dead.

610
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,878
Are you saying they've done all this
to create these facts?

611
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,464
That's a dangerous thing to say.

612
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:46,468
You're making it sound like
she was murdered.

613
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,470
What I meant was--

614
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,599
This case has been closed with her death.

615
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,440
I'll leave the report up to you.

616
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,087
LOANS, EDWARD KIM
SUNSHINE FINANCE, TEN MINUTE LOANS

617
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,807
Look into car lease finance companies.

618
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,769
Find out if any of the cars were leased
under Edward Kim or Kim Jae-wook.

619
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,688
Jeong-hwan, we already looked into that.

620
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,402
The airports, the ports…
We've already combed through everywhere.

621
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,572
Whoever this Kim Jae-wook is,
he's as good as an NIS agent.

622
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,616
Okay. I got it.

623
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,328
Come back here and let's keep looking.

624
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,539
It's so difficult
to find information about him.

625
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,500
And I can't really go right now.

626
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,420
Where are you?

627
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,713
That's my privacy.

628
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,509
Tell me.

629
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,387
I said, where are you?

630
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,973
I'm on a stakeout near Gaemi Mart.

631
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:15,890
What?

632
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,977
Why are you there?

633
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:22,605
Because she'll be passing by here soon.

634
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:23,940
Who?

635
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,404
Don't tell me you're waiting for Ms. Ko.

636
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,866
Ms. Ko, come on in.

637
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,411
What's in that bag? Is it beer?

638
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,081
That's great. I was craving some.

639
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,541
CHOI YOON-SEOK

640
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,335
Hello?

641
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,005
Jeong-hwan! Damn it!

642
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,771
Hye-won!

643
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,691
She's not here, you bastard.

644
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,818
Jeong-hwan, how could you lie?

645
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,581
I believe
this is where the witness vomited.

646
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,466
Clean up that mess.

647
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,051
Wait.

648
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,078
Yes, what is it?

649
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,832
Hurry up. I'm in a rush.

650
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:08,086
I was wondering if the misunderstanding
had been cleared up.

651
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,003
What?

652
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,006
I mean, I think I created
a huge misunderstanding

653
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,841
at that pork belly restaurant.

654
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,471
Ms. Ko.

655
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,269
-He's a pretty decent guy.
-Who is?

656
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,482
Let's talk again when I return.
I'm in a rush.

657
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,568
Wait.

658
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,153
Sir!

659
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,884
NO ADMITTANCE TO OUTSIDERS

660
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,925
PRESENT DAY, 2020

661
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:04,303
Hey, who's going to make the call?

662
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:08,099
GYEONGGI ROUTE 37 ACCIDENT CASE REPORT

663
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,565
This accident
may not be that simple, okay?

664
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,275
We need to be thorough.

665
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,531
Who's going to take charge?

666
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,703
Gosh, these bastards.

667
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,206
Why are you looking at me?

668
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,711
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

669
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:40,256
Ready-or-not, rock-paper-scissors.

670
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,187
Yes?

671
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,815
I'm Detective Kim Myung-hyun
from Seoul Metropolitan police agency.

672
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,609
-I texted you earlier.
-And?

673
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,120
VIOLENT CRIMES DIVISION

674
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,217
-When did I hit you?
-Do you not remember?

675
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,177
Look at this bruise.

676
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,679
-It doesn't look too bad.
-She started it.

677
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:32,058
-I never hit him.
-You just said you did.

678
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,727
-I'm the victim here.
-Take a look, detective.

679
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,813
Excuse me.

680
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,106
How may I help you?

681
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,984
I received a call

682
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,654
from Detective Kim Myung-hyun.

683
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,280
That's me.

684
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,659
Who are you?

685
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:52,620
My name is Cha Joo-eun.

686
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,789
Oh, I see. Ms. Cha Joo-eun.

687
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,292
Gosh, I didn't even win 5,000 won.

688
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,008
She registered her marriage
just a month ago.

689
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,677
She's still a newlywed.

690
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,388
Life is so cruel.

691
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,140
What a pity.

692
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:14,725
Shall we go?

693
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:31,993
I'll be straightforward.

694
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,788
There was an accident ten days ago.

695
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,697
The car crashed into the guard rail
and plummeted down the cliff.

696
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,243
We have yet to find out
the cause of the accident.

697
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,455
The driver was the only one in the car,
and he passed away.

698
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,498
We couldn't find any DNA's to test,

699
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,668
so we weren't able to identify him.

700
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:32,386
Yesterday,

701
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,890
we found this
ten meters away from the scene.

702
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:41,145
We believe it was thrown
out the window during the accident.

703
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,149
Is this Jeong-hwan?

704
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,903
The ID card is his,

705
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,574
but we have yet to confirm the body.

706
01:05:57,578 --> 01:06:00,331
Are you telling me that Jeong-hwan's dead?

707
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,794
Is he?

708
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,963
As of now,

709
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,507
it's highly likely that he is.

710
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,077
You had no idea who he was.

711
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,622
Did Jeong-hwan know everything about you?

712
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,585
Did you hire Jeong-hwan as an actor
so I'd let down my guard?

713
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,963
Could he be a gangster?

714
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:51,924
You should be asking me
to spare your life, not questioning me.

715
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,343
-What are you doing?
-Spy Lee…

716
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,636
Did you kill him?

717
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,307
Kim Jae-wook. I'll meet him first

718
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,685
and ask if he remembers his student,

719
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,854
Jeong-hwan.

720
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,564
I'll uncover the truth

721
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:08,649
as to why you did it.

722
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:09,567
Edward.

723
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,949
