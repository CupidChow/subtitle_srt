Let me pour you a drink, sir.

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,906
Mr. Kim is out.

6
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,033
Damn it.

7
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,759
Excuse me.

8
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,025
What is this about?
Do you need to talk to me?

9
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,985
May I see your visitor's card?

10
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,112
My visitor's card?

11
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,824
Right, the card. You know,

12
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,369
I left it in the changing room.

13
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,457
You need to check on it, right?

14
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,628
Let's go, then.

15
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,965
Our club only has 300 VVIP clients
in total.

16
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,555
That means we know
the faces of all our 300 clients.

17
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,475
I see.

18
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,899
Lock the elevator after exactly a minute.

19
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,983
Okay.

20
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,321
No. Listen.

21
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,657
I was curious about
what these people do for fun,

22
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,325
so I came here to get some intel.

23
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,410
I should've led with this.

24
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,915
"We report nothing but the truth."
I'm Joo Sang-ho of Fact News.

25
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,002
I'll request for an interview
through proper channels next time.

26
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,382
So let's just treat this as an opportunity
to get to know each other.

27
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,804
Goodness.

28
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,809
Come on, don't be like that.
I'm just a journalist.

29
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,104
Get him!

30
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,014
Yes, that case--

31
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,560
Hey, what's wrong with you?

32
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,520
-I'm sorry.
-What's this about?

33
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,855
Unbelievable.

34
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,606
Close it!

35
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,616
First floor security team.

36
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,659
Hurry.

37
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,378
Use the fire exit on the second floor.

38
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,258
Check the back.

39
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,894
Hey, you. You!

40
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,145
Stop!

EPISODE 7

43
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,284
Who came in after Mr. Kim?

44
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,161
No one except for you.

45
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,622
What about other elevators?

46
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,333
No one.

47
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,922
There's a fire exit
anyone could have used to get in.

48
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,882
But why would a VVIP do that?

49
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,383
A fire exit…

50
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,324
Kim Jae-wook.

51
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,787
What sets ants and human beings apart?

52
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,039
Private lives.

53
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,542
People have so-called private lives.

54
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,170
Private lives no one else knows about.

55
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,880
No one else know about them…

56
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,674
Now, could that be true?

57
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,096
People can't even forge relationships
unless they share their private lives.

58
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,476
In order to connect with more people
and to live better lives,

59
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,397
people willingly share
and sell their private lives.

60
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,941
As we're the only ones with private lives,

61
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,778
our private lives are weakness and
commodity that only we humans can have.

62
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,197
So I

63
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:34,996
collect and exploit the commodity,
that is people's weakness.

64
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,081
Why, you ask?

65
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,058
VERIFIED

66
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,729
Look at me.
Doesn't it answer your question?

67
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,816
2019, 1 YEAR AGO

68
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,402
You wanted me to call you
if I saw Jeong Bok-gi.

69
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,072
I recommended Spy Lee to her.

70
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,851
MR. KIM

71
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,573
Gosh, those empty-headed fools.

72
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,242
I gave them a shot at a decent life.

73
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,829
They should be trying
to make their lives better.

74
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,998
What the heck are they doing?

75
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,334
They are total failures.

76
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,338
It's a pity that this country lacks
order and control now.

77
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,636
Our country must return
to its normal state as soon as possible

78
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,888
before it rots even more.

79
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,023
NEW MESSAGE

80
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,296
Yes.

81
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,798
I thought you'd died
in some other country.

82
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,303
Sorry to break it to you.
I'm alive and healthy.

83
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,264
Has it been ten years?

84
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,724
Time…

85
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,021
flies indeed.

86
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,233
The Fire Department dispatched
78 fire fighters

87
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,777
to put out the fire initially.

88
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,905
But due to the strong wind,
they failed to do so.

89
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,325
Blaming the bad weather for their failure
has caused the public

90
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,119
and the media to criticize their actions.

91
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,123
As a result, the opposition party is
strongly condemning the government.

92
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:10,503
The fire's been elevated to the third
grade, making it a national disaster.

93
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,505
And they evacuated 4,000 residents.

94
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,175
The damaged area of the forest
has hit 1,757ha so far,

95
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:20,179
and the fire has burnt down 916 houses
and buildings in total.

96
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,683
Mr. Kim.

97
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,269
The fire was too large, wasn't it?

98
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,106
It will cost a fortune to restore it.

99
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,400
It's a huge national disaster.

100
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,235
Take responsibility for it.

101
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,947
Of course.

102
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,741
Why did you do it?

103
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,832
You should've only focused on the target,
minimizing collateral damage.

104
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,129
You don't make mistakes. What happened?

105
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,588
I'll take responsibility.

106
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,268
ALL TOGETHER CHURCH

107
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,918
Come on, what's wrong?
Why are you sitting in the back?

108
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,046
Feeling shy?

109
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,884
Because the view is nice from here.

110
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,554
This spot has the perfect view of Jesus.

111
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,663
I believe the fire became the catalyst
to unify the conservative party,

112
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,541
and it helped them win the election
in the end.

113
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,711
Am I wrong?

114
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,837
What is this?

115
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,508
Are you fishing for a compliment now?

116
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,887
No. I want to reflect on it.
That's what adults do.

117
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,270
Yes. Let bygones be bygones now.

118
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,608
I guess I should ask you why.
Since I'm a gentleman.

119
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,236
After all, you came back after ten years.

120
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,198
Because I have a favor to ask you.

121
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,700
He's one of your subordinates,

122
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,287
so I couldn't just take care of him
without discussing with you.

123
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,289
What are these?

124
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,583
Who is this?

125
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,753
I believe it's Kim Jae-wook.

126
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,965
-Arsonist Kim?
-The body proportion and posture

127
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,759
are similar to Kim Jae-wook.

128
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,888
I'm sure you know well

129
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,308
that to ask for such a big favor,
you must show me some manners.

130
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,146
I will start taking orders from you again.

131
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,405
Let's think about what happened back then.

132
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,369
The person who took Jeong Yoon-kyung
and stole President Choi's assets

133
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,080
is you. That's my conclusion.

134
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,708
Am I wrong?

135
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,297
Where is President Choi's ledger?

136
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,730
You've been promoted to Director.
It's my congratulatory present.

137
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,653
It's President Choi's secret ledger.

138
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,869
CORRECTED BIBLE

139
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,205
It's a copy.

140
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,583
But then again,

141
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,711
this isn't a secret ledger anymore.

142
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,434
Lee Jeong-hwan…

143
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,068
Where are you, 0721?

144
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,071
-At the 13th block.
-Didn't you check your message?

145
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,907
The wind was diverted.
I told you to change the target point.

146
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,286
NEW TEXT MESSAGE

147
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,881
Kim Jae-wook…

148
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,009
This is one scary line of work.

149
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,428
Who's on whose side?

150
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,076
Thank you.

151
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,329
I was able to divert
Lee Jeong-hwan's attention.

152
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,622
Do a…

153
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,543
There is a person I must find.

154
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,461
background check on your client first.

155
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,256
We'll find out if it's really Arsonist Kim
after that.

156
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,341
What about Jeong Yoon-kyung?

157
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,847
You fooled the whole world including me.

158
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,932
Didn't you put a lot of effort into her?

159
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,936
-It's a pity.
-So what, then?

160
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,606
She can't seem to fix her old habit.

161
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,652
She must empty everything out,

162
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,655
accept new knowledge, and make it hers.

163
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,619
But she and Lee Jeong-hwan have
a similar inclination.

164
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,496
A sense of pity?

165
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,708
She has something like that.

166
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,463
Lee Jeong-hwan thinks her information
has been handed over to UI.

167
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,382
What are you planning to do
with Kim Jae-wook?

168
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,636
Do you think Arsonist Kim
could do something single-handedly?

169
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,472
He's not the type to stay put.

170
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,100
UI will take care of him for us.

171
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,227
That's why we gave them the files.

172
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,440
If UI doesn't make any moves,

173
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,484
he will find it suspicious.

174
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,447
I can take care of that.

175
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,492
No. No pressure.

176
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,828
I already hired muscle for the job.
They are on it.

177
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,387
So what about Yoon-kyung?

178
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,515
Shall I make her commit suicide?

179
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,816
I think we can use this opportunity
to make her shut up forever.

180
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,986
Do you pity her?

181
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,659
Of course not.

182
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,565
Okay. Keep an eye on her.

183
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,074
They missed her
right in front of their eyes.

184
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,207
That means someone is helping her.

185
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,259
After leaving the hotel,
she headed straight to the airport

186
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,386
and left the country in the evening.

187
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,057
Are they sleeping together or something?

188
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,644
I'm not sure. I couldn't figure it out.

189
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,313
There's something between them.

190
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,275
Otherwise, why would he help him?
Don't you agree?

191
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,446
Well, it's possible.

192
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,039
Vivian.

193
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,541
8 MONTHS LATER

194
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,667
Vivian.

195
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,632
Vivian.

196
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,539
Gosh.

197
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,208
Jeez.

198
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,023
So, did you look into it?

199
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,697
What were you up to?

200
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,158
I'm making bulgogi.

201
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,452
Gosh, that sounds tasty.

202
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,121
I will hurry.

203
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,832
By the way, is something wrong?

204
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,419
No. Nothing's wrong.

205
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,131
Did you hear that?

206
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,301
He called her using the company phone
near the mansion.

207
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,429
He trusted the company's security,

208
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,348
never thinking that
I'd hear the conversation.

209
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,227
So what do you want me to do with him now?

210
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,900
Haven't you decided already?

211
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,528
The ending of a subordinate
who continues to disobey instructions.

212
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,032
I'm sure he'll accept the consequences.

213
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,450
Speaking of which,

214
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,080
I'm thinking of setting the D-day
to his wedding day.

215
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,874
It will be a memorable
wedding present, right?

216
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,711
That's a good idea.

217
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,089
GROOM: LEE JEONG-HWAN
BRIDE: CHA JOO-EUN

218
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,508
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

219
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,395
Lee Jeong-hwan.

220
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,149
Are you really dead?

221
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,800
RESTRICTED AREA

222
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,729
Lee Jeong-hwan…

223
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,357
The bastard is alive.

224
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,240
You can stop. Go hit some balls.

225
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,909
Okay.

226
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,002
I'll bet on the left.
She looks like she has strong arms.

227
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,087
You need lower body strength to play golf.

228
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,298
I'll bet on the right.

229
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,008
CASHIER'S CHECK 10,000,000 WON

230
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,595
Thank you.

231
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,723
You can leave.

232
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,393
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

233
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,861
By the way,

234
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,323
are you accepting the result
of the police investigation?

235
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,534
About what? Lee Jeong-hwan?

236
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,827
Yes.

237
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,166
Is there a reason I shouldn't accept it?

238
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,377
No, there isn't.

239
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,048
Then why are Kim Jae-wook

240
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,467
and Director Kim meeting secretly?

241
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:39,472
They seem suspicious. It looks like
they're plotting a huge conspiracy.

242
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,266
Don't you think so?

243
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,103
Let's stop talking about the dead guy.

244
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,564
You can lay it on me.

245
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:52,485
The real reason you gave me
President Choi's secret ledger.

246
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,283
I'll give it to you straight.

247
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,828
Kingmaker.

248
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,288
What?

249
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,836
Kingmaker. Isn't GK…

250
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,798
I mean, aren't you thinking
of the same thing, Mr. Kim?

251
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,013
You sound like
you already have someone in mind.

252
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,723
Who could it be?

253
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,810
Who do you have in mind?

254
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,748
RESTRICTED AREA

255
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,820
WOOK'S GUKBAP RESTAURANT

256
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,578
20 YEARS AGO

257
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,789
I'll do it, Dad.

258
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,666
I told you to go study in the library.

259
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,710
-I'll go after I do this.
-He's so stubborn.

260
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,463
Why did you tell him to come?

261
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,173
I didn't. He insisted.

262
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,690
Hey.

263
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,526
Get me some cigarettes.

264
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,279
Yoo Byung-jun?

265
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,826
Jae-wook, you sure have a sharp eye.

266
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,913
You have a good eye for people.
I had the same person in mind.

267
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:14,711
Thank goodness.
I'm glad we're on the same page.

268
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:19,007
Yoo Byung-jun has been excellent at work
since he was a prosecutor.

269
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,553
He always finishes a picture
no matter what once he starts drawing,

270
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,637
like a bulldozer.

271
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,558
This happened more than 20 years ago.

272
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,562
There was a restaurant owner
who witnessed the secret meeting

273
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,732
of Yoo Byung-jun
and President Choi Kyung-hwan.

274
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,985
Anyway, Byung-jun completely
destroyed his family.

275
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:45,742
He made it look like the restaurant owner
and his wife stabbed each other to death,

276
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,870
so it wouldn't look like suicide.

277
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,914
Why?

278
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,959
Because of the insurance money
that their son would receive.

279
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,629
He's so meticulous.

280
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,382
He could've just trampled them
and moved on.

281
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,053
But he did everything he could
until the end

282
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,098
to make the couple dead.

283
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,266
Thanks for the food.

284
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,197
I never knew.

285
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,490
Really?

286
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,785
I didn't know
something like that happened.

287
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:57,206
Hasn't it been a long time
since you studied Yoo Byung-jun?

288
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,794
I'm embarrassed.

289
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,090
I didn't know
you were Yoo Byung-jun expert.

290
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,054
You can say I know almost everything.

291
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,516
What's important is that Yoo Byung-jun
needs to be our gentle lamb.

292
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,060
That's giving me a headache.

293
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:22,982
We can relax though because we have
President Choi's secret ledger.

294
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,318
We should make sure

295
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,197
we never need to use the ledger.

296
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,074
That's right.

297
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,201
You're quite stylish.

298
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,869
Thank you.

299
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,750
All right. Shall we have a seat?

300
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,752
I'll leave you to it.

301
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,094
Thanks for making time for me.
I'm honored.

302
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,971
No problem.

303
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,557
Thanks to the young,
hard-working party members,

304
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,852
this country still has hope.

305
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,479
I should make time even if I'm busy.

306
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,314
Thank you.

307
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,487
-Hello.
-Hello.

308
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,530
Hello.

309
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,532
Hello.

310
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,583
Let me pour you a drink, sir.

311
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,021
Aren't you going to leave?

312
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,815
Pardon?

313
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,777
It looks like all the dishes
have been served.

314
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,654
Is there more work for you to do?

315
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,545
All right. Shall we have a drink?

316
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,005
I'll pour you a drink, sir.

317
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,483
Son of a bitch.

318
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,080
Why is he hiding Kim Jae-wook from me?

319
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,625
And since when?

320
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,296
Perhaps from the beginning?

321
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,299
Why?

322
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,594
I need to find out why.

323
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,642
It might be

324
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,479
the reason that I had to die.

325
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,031
Eat first. The food's getting cold.

326
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,953
So he did have connections to GK.

327
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,957
I said, the food's getting cold.

328
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,962
-Did you know?
-What?

329
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,174
That Jeong-hwan had received a scholarship
from GK?

330
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,384
So?

331
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,011
I'm just saying.

332
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,972
And guess what?

333
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,974
What?

334
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,559
He's from Hankuk University.

335
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,687
So?

336
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,314
I'm just saying.

337
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,068
So what? He ended up running
a detective agency despite all that.

338
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,322
I told you, he's not just an ordinary
owner of a detective agency.

339
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,576
I'm certain he has

340
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,372
a secret connection to GK.

341
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,667
He just ran an errand for GK once.

342
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,879
Do you think a conglomerate like GK was
kind enough to explain everything to him?

343
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,966
Enough with your imagination.

344
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,551
Does doing that comfort you or something?

345
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,680
Why the hell are you even eating here?

346
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,056
What about the center?

347
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,809
-I'm not going.
-Why not?

348
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,602
It doesn't suit me.

349
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,356
Who works for fun?

350
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,024
We work because we have to.

351
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,651
I thought so too.

352
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,696
But spending time with you

353
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,739
makes me think otherwise.

354
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,659
It makes me truly feel alive, you know.

355
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:10,037
So I'd like to stay by your side
for the time being.

356
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,956
You've failed.

357
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,502
Ms. Jang Min-jeong has failed
the rooftop interview.

358
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:20,006
If you're done with your freaking food,
please leave.

359
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:20,923
Goodbye.

360
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,800
I'll do the dishes.

361
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,970
Fine. I'll clean your room as well.

362
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,558
I have more rice, so eat more.

363
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,771
You better keep your word.

364
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,814
Of course.

365
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,649
You do know I'm quite tidy, right?

366
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,821
You always eat like that.

367
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,989
Is it that good?

368
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,282
What?

369
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,367
I should try it too.

370
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,454
All right. Let me show you
a three-step way of enjoying this.

371
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:55,458
Get a spoonful of the rice.
Put kimchi from the stew on top of it.

372
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:00,296
And put a piece of fried egg on it.

373
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,673
Then, the dried laver.

374
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,191
Oh.

375
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,152
Hello, ma'am.

376
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,572
Who is he? What's going on?

377
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,698
Don't you need to work?

378
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,826
I am working right now. Please get in.

379
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,923
Aren't you busy
with the moneylending business?

380
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,509
I am. I'm very busy.

381
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,637
But I can't say no to this job.

382
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,724
By the way, why is he called "Han Son"?

383
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,476
I doubt it's his real name.

384
00:39:56,185 --> 00:40:00,606
Mr. Han Son? He always only uses one hand.

385
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,401
That's why we call him "Han Son."

386
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,444
Always? Is that even possible?

387
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,782
Legend has it that he has never used

388
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,536
both of his hands
even during all those fights

389
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,539
with the three major gangs.

390
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,425
Is he like
a legendary one-handed swordsman?

391
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,261
Like Yang Guo
from The Return of the Condor Heroes.

392
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,345
Han Son.

393
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,066
Would you like me to install the same one?

394
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,943
No. There's no need for that.

395
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,738
I'm going to sell the whole door.

396
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,114
What?

397
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,492
I'm going to get rid of the door.

398
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,870
Then you should've called a junkman,
not me.

399
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,289
Come on. You can sell it yourself.

400
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,460
It's too heavy. I'm too weak.

401
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,505
What? Sir.

402
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,797
Sir.

403
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,924
What's going on?

404
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,969
I'm getting rid of the door.
I don't even have the money to fix it.

405
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,308
All right. Let's keep this place open.

406
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,351
Why?

407
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,102
What do you mean?

408
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,104
What I mean is,

409
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,734
why does it sound like
you have the final say in this?

410
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,781
What do you say?
Should I take care of her?

411
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,497
I'm going to give it a try.

412
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,332
Give what a try?

413
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,751
Jeong-hwan's work.

414
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,547
I'm going to take it over.

415
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,382
Why?

416
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:36,220
Not just anyone can pull off
this kind of work.

417
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,889
That's exactly why I need your help.

418
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,101
You dare to ask me for help?

419
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,602
Why would I help you?

420
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,068
I'm sure the monthly rent is pricey.

421
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,071
Should I shut it down?

422
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,368
You'll become jobless then.

423
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,953
Are you threatening me?

424
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,581
Well, did it work?

425
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,173
I need a lot of time to think this over.

426
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,927
Sure.

427
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,931
I'm thinking.

428
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,104
Please fix that.

429
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,317
And

430
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,903
I want to be called a chief.

431
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,406
All right, Chief Ko.

432
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,492
Where should we begin?

433
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,078
-Please take that outside.
-Okay.

434
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,164
Can you put it over there?

435
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,832
-Okay.
-Place it over there.

436
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,336
Should I move this by myself?

437
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,097
Let's huddle.

438
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,600
-Cha Joo-eun.
-Park Tae-joo.

439
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,268
Jang Min-jeong.

440
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,354
Ko Hye-won.

441
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,938
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

442
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,523
Let's go, Spy detective agency!

443
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,276
All right.

444
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,779
Hold on.

445
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,907
Why am I here?

446
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,371
Receiving calls, signing contracts,
managing bank accounts…

447
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,748
I was in charge of a desk job.

448
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,459
Mr. Lee was in charge
of all practical affairs.

449
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,962
Physically demanding tasks such as
tailing or protecting people

450
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,464
were outsourced.

451
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,551
Did you major in engineering?

452
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,136
No.

453
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,805
You're pretty good.

454
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,099
Connecting the hardware is easy.

455
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:02,533
A news anchor
at a local broadcasting station?

456
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,826
ANCHOR JEONG YUN-KYEONG

457
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,452
JBC CHUNGNAM

458
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,580
Hello, everyone.

459
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,251
I'm Jeong Yoon-kyung from JBC 7 p.m. News.

460
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:46,577
SINBI RESTAURANT

461
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,711
Hello.

462
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,305
I told you to dress comfortably.

463
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,849
What? I did.

464
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,686
I didn't know a place like this
still existed.

465
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,646
Is this a nostalgic tour or something?

466
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,983
Why don't you stop looking around
and order something?

467
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,488
Oh, will it be difficult for you
to eat at a place like this?

468
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,744
I'd like one kimchi stew, please.

469
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,245
You have to order two servings.

470
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,373
Then I'll pay for two,
but just give me one serving.

471
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,251
And one bottle of soju too, please.

472
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,964
The hotel's kimchi stew isn't that great.

473
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,969
-What?
-What do you mean?

474
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,141
Why are you staring at my face in silence?

475
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,810
Did my beauty shock you?

476
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,147
"We've just received…

477
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,691
Received…"

478
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,195
We've just received…

479
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,447
Received…

480
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,698
JBC NEWS JEONG YOON-KYUNG

481
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,866
Received…

482
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,165
Damn it.

483
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,253
This is a nice car.

484
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,631
It's a gift from Jeong-hwan.

485
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,886
I bought it with the death benefit.

486
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,393
I see. It's a bit cruel,

487
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,228
but you're right.

488
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,314
A death benefit is a gift.

489
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,403
So I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

490
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,824
Anyway, where are we going
out of the blue?

491
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,410
Doesn't this road seem familiar?

492
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,871
You've probably been here many times.

493
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,754
So you're saying Edward's there?

494
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,384
I brought you here
so you can check for yourself.

495
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,680
That despicable bastard.

496
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,854
How dare you come back here?

497
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,536
Aren't you going to see him?

498
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,616
There's no one.

499
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,118
We'll have to check.

500
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,832
What is it this time?

501
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,133
Wait here. I'll go check
and be right back.

502
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,235
There's no one here.

503
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,570
You can come in.

504
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,908
Should I trust her?

505
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,341
I tracked the phone you told me about.

506
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,926
It's in Kim Jae-wook's mansion.

507
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,413
That crazy bastard!

508
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,999
Adios.

509
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,006
What happened?

510
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,049
Is it a gas explosion?

511
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,219
Could it have been that bastard?

512
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,973
Whatever. I should get out of here.

513
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,433
Let's run for now.

514
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:12,939
Whatever.

515
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,732
Hey.

516
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,910
Yes?

517
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,086
They trespassed on my territory
several times,

518
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,880
so I ought to pay them a visit.

519
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,509
Go escort them to me.

520
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,890
Hey.

521
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,109
Find them!

522
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,779
Find them!

523
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,281
Hey, wait!

524
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:52,826
Damn it.

525
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,035
Hurry up!

526
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,597
-Get them!
-Come here!

527
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,326
Take care of her.

528
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:38,830
What is that?

529
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,875
Hey!

530
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,753
Get her!

531
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:49,757
Get her!

532
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,347
Damn it.

533
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,727
Damn it.

534
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,250
Poong-yeon.

535
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,801
Where are his manners?

536
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,561
I'm okay. I'm fine.

537
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,614
What is that?

538
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,866
-Dongchimi.
-What?

539
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,868
This is the best remedy for gas poisoning.

540
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:43,955
Gosh, you're so tacky.

541
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,087
Have the radish too.

542
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,022
Anything for me?

543
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,690
I saved your life, you know.

544
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,907
You can be eternally grateful. Really.

545
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,037
What was that?

546
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,001
Did he just say, "Thank you"?

547
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,503
No. I didn't hear it.

548
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,936
The bike.

549
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,898
It's the helmet guy again?

550
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,232
I'm sorry.

551
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,193
What about the cameras?

552
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,030
-Who are you?
-You don't need to know.

553
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,990
Show me the emergency room footage.

554
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,496
I spent one big one.

555
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,835
I could've easily gotten that
by enticing them,

556
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,545
but you paid them 100 million won?

557
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,052
What? Was it not 100 million won?

558
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,345
He said one big one.

559
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,057
One billion, then?

560
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:29,936
Gosh.

561
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,563
I'm famished.

562
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:51,976
VERIFIED

563
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,838
That damn helmet guy.

564
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,883
Who the hell is he?

565
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,103
Lee Jeong-hwan…

566
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:39,899
Was it you?

567
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,885
Was it love?

568
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,178
Did you love him?

569
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,558
I want to kill that bastard.
That's how I feel at this moment.

570
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,309
You must pull off your role,

571
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,396
so that she fully trusts you.

572
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,480
So who was it?

573
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,650
Who used Lee Jeong-hwan's name?

574
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,319
Do you think you can penetrate UI?

575
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,279
Are you in?

576
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,533
-There's something I need to know.
-Know what?

577
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,035
I need evidence that UI tried to kill me.

578
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,455
I heard they have shadow agents
just like they do at the NIS.

579
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:41,335
Spy Lee could have been
a real GK employee.

580
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,171
What? He's…

581
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:50,678
