ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,477
Taekwondo.

4
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,981
Judo.

5
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,235
Systema?

6
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,198
Gosh, that's jiu-jitsu.

7
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,327
He's really good.

8
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,293
What are you doing in the dark?

9
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,048
Were you watching porn?

10
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,091
No.

11
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,594
-I know you were.
-No.

12
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,262
It's fine. You're still young.

13
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,639
No. I wasn'tâ€¦

14
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,229
How are things going?

15
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,941
-I'm not doing much.
-Not you.

16
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
What's Joo-eun up to?

17
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,530
I couldn't keep pestering her
to pay me back.

18
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,906
So I haven't talked to her.

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,617
And she's been pretty quiet lately.

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,869
What's she doing?

21
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,665
I heard she's running
the detective agency.

22
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,292
You make it sound like you're not sure.

23
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,590
It's not love, right?

24
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,052
Right.

25
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,180
Even if it's love, what can I do about it?

26
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,474
It's none of my business.

27
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,646
Even so, don't fall in love.

28
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,651
You know that it won't work out
for you anyway, don't you?

29
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,740
Let's stay true to who we really are.

30
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,578
I'll ask again. What's she up to nowadays?

31
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,042
I guess you can't tell me about it.

32
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,879
What could it be?

33
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,923
To be honest, I wasn't interested,

34
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,176
but all of a sudden, I've gotten curious.

35
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,845
I'll get going.

36
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,145
Where's the detective agency?

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,864
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

38
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,578
Gosh, this musty smell.

EPISODE 8

40
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,124
A leather sofa

41
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,006
and a tacky receptionist
who completes the picture.

42
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,803
My worries always turn out to be true
for some reason.

43
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,682
Who is this lanky woman?

44
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,559
My daughter is the CEO here.

45
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,520
-What?
-A cup of coffee, please.

46
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,067
What? That's Cha Joo-eun's mom?

47
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,612
What's wrong with her family?

48
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,156
Why do they keep invading my space?

49
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,953
Should I request a case, too?

50
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,375
I heard that my grandpa was taken
by the Japanese soldiers a long time ago.

51
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,837
Who knows? He could have survived
and became a wealthy man in Japan.

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,174
She's not even here. I think we should go.

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,468
I'll have that coffee before I go.

54
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,640
Where's the CEO?

55
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,183
I don't know.

56
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,064
She might be with Sophia Chung.
She said she'd meet her this afternoon.

57
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,237
Sophia Chung.

58
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,580
-Aren't you going to drink it?
-Sure. I will.

59
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,299
I finally feel alive.

60
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,177
You should feel indebted to me
for the rest of your life.

61
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,096
I even fed you a delicious meal.

62
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,932
Kim Jae-wook.

63
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,518
What is he to you?

64
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,190
Did you love him?

65
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,903
"Love"? That's so childish.

66
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,365
You did love him.

67
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,910
Stop delving into what happened yesterday.

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,996
Let's focus on tomorrow.

69
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,460
I want to kill that bastard.
That's how I feel at this moment.

70
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,842
I have to do everything I can
to do some damage to that bastard.

71
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,094
I like the attitude.

72
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,805
-Don't you regret it?
-Regret what?

73
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,724
You were a news anchor.

74
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,602
That's a pretty cool job.

75
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,325
What about you?

76
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,702
Do you regret it?

77
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,960
Anyway, thank you.

78
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,879
What? What did you say?

79
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,340
-You heard me.
-No, I didn't.

80
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,509
Goodness, look at this old woman.

81
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,678
If you're thankful, why don't you
address me with some respect?

82
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,639
"Old woman"? It's unacceptable

83
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,850
even if you're so jealous
that you can't think and speak properly.

84
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,268
Jealousy?

85
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,733
I kind of sensed it,
but you really have no conscience.

86
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,985
Why would I be jealous of an old lady?

87
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,614
There you go again.
If people hear you, they'll criticize you

88
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,407
for being so mean to your friend.

89
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,701
That won't help you get back
those years you lost

90
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,203
or stop you from getting old.

91
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,164
Jeez. You and your attitude.

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,458
You never let anything slide
out of politeness.

93
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,050
You really don't know

94
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,053
that man from earlier?

95
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,436
Unfortunately, I don't.

96
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,980
Then, who was that knight
in shining armor?

97
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,983
I want to know that too.

98

SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

99
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,198
CHIEF KO HYE-WON

100
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,425
This is so funny.

101
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,552
Drinking alone?

102
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,890
Don't you think about joining me
and stealing my drink.

103
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,641
I have my own.

104
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,731
Oh, right.

105
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,568
Were you able to get in touch
with Choi Yoon-seok?

106
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,737
No. He's unreachable.

107
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,533
Is it possible

108
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,536
he's dodging your calls?

109
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,208
Who? Yoon-seok?
He wouldn't dare dodge my calls.

110
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,126
Gosh, you're ridiculous.

111
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,672
So you obviously don't know
what he's like.

112
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,008
Right. I should be understanding.

113
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:34,889
Anyway, I guarantee you that
he'll never ignore any of my calls.

114
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,975
Oh, right. Your mother came by yesterday.

115
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,228
Your mother.

116
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,275
MOM

117
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,860
PORK RIBS APLENTY

118
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,077
It's like I'm watching The Godfather.

119
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,507
They might kill us
if we don't give them free food.

120
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,889
So what will you do?

121
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,268
I decided to work with her
to catch Kim Jae-wook.

122
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,144
Great.

123
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,938
Nicely done.

124
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,358
-What's your next step?
-What?

125
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,444
I'm sure you're planning a documentary
for Jeong Bok-gi.

126
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,154
What's the plot?

127
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,823
Well,

128
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,702
I'm still working on it.

129
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,828
I see.

130
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,871
Take your time,

131
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,584
and think carefully
in order to come up with a foolproof plan.

132
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,587
You're taking down Jeong Bok-gi after all.

133
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,172
Until then, you must pull off your role,

134
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,967
so that she fully trusts you.

135
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,553
Yes, I should.

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,725
And one more thing.
I want to be in it, too.

137
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,979
What? I can't be in it?

138
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,648
Mom, that's--

139
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,900
I know that
it's probably not the best idea.

140
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,945
It will be difficult for me
to work with her.

141
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,365
So I'll work behind the curtain.

142
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,744
I don't want to see
that bitch in person, either.

143
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,371
Fine.

144
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,750
Let's talk when the plot is ready.

145
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,084
Sure.

146
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,254
And most importantly,

147
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,215
pay me back soon.

148
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,260
Okay, fine. I'll pay you back.

149
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,055
Shall we?

150
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,975
Cheers.

151
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,237
Edward.

152
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,867
How will I find this bastard again?

153
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,956
How did it go?

154
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,420
Who is she? Why are you protecting her?

155
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,175
Jeong-hwan, are you listening?

156
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,771
I can't do this.

157
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,941
What? Can't do what?

158
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

159
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,620
What's this?

160
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,706
Didn't she turn off the lights
before going home?

161
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,210
This isn't a 24-hours convenience store.

162
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,755
Damn it. I should deduct this
from her pay.

163
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,565
Stop right there.

164
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,320
You better not try anything funny.

165
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,448
I already called the police.

166
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:31,495
You know that the police arrive
within five minutes in Korea, right?

167
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,184
What? He'sâ€¦

168
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,229
Hey!

169
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,666
Isn't he

170
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,004
that mysterious guy?

171
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,009
I'm sorry, Joo-eun.

172
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,511
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,404
Hello.

174
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,908
I'm Kim Eun-ji from the Traffic Division
of Seoul Police Agency.

175
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:55,120
There was a hit-and-run accident
in front of the building yesterday.

176
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,956
Could I watch the security footage?

177
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,792
Sure. Over there. Go ahead.

178
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,627
-Thank you.
-Sure.

179
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,450
It can't be.

180
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,705
He's dead. It can't be.

181
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,506
DON'T YOU EVER SHOW UP IN FRONT OF ME
I'LL REALLY KILL YOU NEXT TIME

182
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,261
Kim Jae-wook?

183
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,518
This isn't Edward.

184
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,770
Right?

185
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,439
I agree.

186
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:50,527
Edward doesn't have the decency
to give you a warning like this.

187
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,696
Right.

188
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,658
I figured that out
when he tried to kill me.

189
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,704
I could tell that he's a man of action.

190
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,955
That's right.

191
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,669
Then, who do you think did this?

192
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,255
Not sure.

193
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,382
What I need to take away from this

194
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,761
is that someone is watching me.

195
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,639
In my opinion,

196
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,393
you have nothing to be scared of.

197
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,895
What do you mean?

198
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,772
It's a warning.

199
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,900
They're nicely telling you
not to do anything dangerous.

200
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:35,531
And at the same time,
they know that Kim Jae-wook is dangerous.

201
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,492
That reminds me.

202
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,705
That mysterious guy from the hospital.

203
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,666
What?

204
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,876
What I'm saying isâ€¦

205
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,135
I know that this doesn't make any sense.

206
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,139
But when you think about it,

207
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,475
it has to be Jeong-hwan.

208
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,811
What? Who?

209
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,813
Don't you think

210
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,775
-Jeong-hwan wrote that warning?
-Spy Lee?

211
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,943
Yes.

212
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,535
Let me get this straight.
Spy Lee became a ghost

213
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,370
and scribbled a warning?

214
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,621
No.

215
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,582
Not a ghost.

216
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,385
So, are you saying

217
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:44,016
that Spy Lee is alive
and he's taking care of you

218
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,311
while in hiding. Is that it?

219
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,272
It doesn't make sense, does it?

220
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,608
Of course not.

221
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,113
He's not a zombie.
You can't resurrect the dead like that.

222
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,867
You already had his funeral
and got the DNA result.

223
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,745
But then,

224
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,791
you became a widow overnight.
You must have been shocked.

225
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,714
In any case, stop imagining things.

226
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,344
I'll tell you something
that could actually be helpful.

227
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,350
I analyzed the story you told me before
in detail.

228
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,185
So, a question.

229
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:34,691
It means that GK's Lee Jeong-hwan put the
detective agency's Lee Jeong-hwan to work.

230
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,071
Don't you think
that's one too many coincidences?

231
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,415
Why do they always meet without me? Why?

232
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,210
It's upsetting.

233
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,342
Yes, sir.

234
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,261
What is Kim Myung-hyun doing?

235
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,554
-Pardon?
-Did he take his hands off

236
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,390
Lee Jeong-hwan's car accident case?

237
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,518
PORK RIBS APLENTY

238
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,435
Didn't he?

239
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,189
Yes, he did because he had other cases.

240
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,191
CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL DIVISION
JEONG DAE-SANG

241
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,777
Sir, I wanted to ask you something.

242
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,696
What is it?

243
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,075
Well, why did you suddenly close
the investigation?

244
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,369
Right.

245
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,122
You're curious too, aren't you?

246
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,251
What should a curious detective do?

247
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,213
You should investigate.

248
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,313
Don't you dare butt in.

249
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,858
Butt in? Me?

250
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,193
I'm just trying to serve them instantly

251
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,988
before they even ring the bell.

252
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,243
Just go wipe the table over there.
It's really sticky.

253
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,871
We serve pork ribs. Of course it's--

254
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,831
Where's the dishcloth?

255
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,875
Here it is.

256
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,586
Gosh.

257
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,304
Go ahead.

258
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,016
Didn't you say
you had something to ask me?

259
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,355
About the person with the same nameâ€¦

260
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,445
I mean, there's a man named
Lee Jeong-hwan at GK technology.

261
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,698
-You know that, right?
-A man with the same name?

262
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,075
Yes.

263
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,829
A man with the same name?
I've never heard that.

264
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,915
Did you investigate properly?

265
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,796
CHALSEONG COFFEE SHOP

266
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,256
NATASHA COFFEE SHOP

267
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,970
Where should we begin?

268
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,558
It looks awful,
but it even has a bathroom.

269
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,270
Let's start.

270
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,606
-Start what?
-Cleaning.

271
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,109
You take the bathroom.

272
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,528
What? Why me?

273
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,827
I can't believe this.

274
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,080
You got married?

275
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,041
You said you were a groomsman.

276
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,963
I'm sorry.

277
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,800
No. Sorry is not going to cut it.

278
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,846
How could you keep it a secret from me?

279
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,682
I feel so betrayed.

280
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,853
Our friendship is broken,
and our partnership's ruined.

281
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,857
Can our relationship ever be mended?

282
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,983
Wellâ€¦

283
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,237
There's some premium beef in the fridge.

284
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,198
Are you kidding me?

285
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,286
Is it tenderloin?

286
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,415
It's working.

287
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,879
Is it ready?

288
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,053
It's delicious.
This is what I'm talking about.

289
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,431
Try some. Don't just stick to pork.

290
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,183
Here.

291
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,691
By the way, why did your wife
quit working for UI and start running

292
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,235
the detective agency? Did she get fired?

293
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,743
Do you think you can penetrate UI?

294
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,038
-Why do you ask?
-There's something I need to know.

295
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,248
Know what?

296
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,334
I need evidence that UI tried to kill me.

297
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,753
Cheers.

298
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,588
A conglomerate like UI is hard.

299
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,381
But,

300
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,841
if I get help from the inside,

301
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,053
-there could be a way.
-Fill your glasses!

302
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,680
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

303
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,474
Everyone, bottoms up!

304
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,142
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

305
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,645
-Drink up!
-Let's drink!

306
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,273
-Jeez. What are you doing?
-Be careful.

307
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,524
I'm sorry.

308
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,818
-It's fine. Just go.
-Sit down.

309
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,154
-Sit down.
-Drink up.

310
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,365
PC GRAVEYARD

311
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,160
Are you in?

312
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,748
Yes. I'm in. I'll go up.

313
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,558
RESTRICTED AREA

314
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,326
The server room has been infiltrated.
Please check the server room.

315
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,420
RESTRICTED AREA

316
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,132
Someone tried to break in.

317
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,344
Check the surveillance
and close the entrance.

318
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,480
He's wearing a navy suit.

319
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,069
Wait.

320
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:44,996
Jeez.

321
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,438
Damn it.

322
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,819
I'm chasing him on the third floor.

323
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,381
He's heading for the second floor.

324
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,153
You two, go that way!

325
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,247
He's over there!

326
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,416
He's on the fourth floor!

327
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,483
-How's it going?
-Within ten minutes,

328
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,276
the system will be updated.

329
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,820
They'll start tracking us then,

330
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,697
so I need to work as fast as I can.
Three minutes left.

331
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,787
Did you trace him?

332
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,209
It's almost done.
I just need authorization.

333
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,563
It crashed.

334
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,982
I can't find him.

335
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,290
Korean conglomerates are terrible.

336
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,085
They collected
all sorts of private information.

337
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,965
Jeez, they have all kinds of information.
It's like a tabloid.

338
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,551
A STAR COUPLE IS BORN

339
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,178
What? Were they going out?

340
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,015
Unbelievable. Did she do drugs, too?

341
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,561
What? They have lots of ordinary people's
information, too.

342
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,647
These bastards are ridiculous.

343
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,985
Stop looking up useless information.

344
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,862
Find the file on Jeong Yoon-kyung.

345
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,164
"JEONG YOON-KYUNG," NO RESULT FOUND

346
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,542
SOPHIA CHUNG

347
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,878
Nothing.

348
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,676
Didn't you say you gave
Jeong Yoon-kyung's file to your wife?

349
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,804
Wait.

350
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,641
Did she get fired because of this?

351
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,024
What? She's still with the company.

352
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,487
CHA JOO-EUN

353
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,698
Could she

354
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,202
be a spy sent by UI?

355
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,627
-It's spicy.
-It's good.

356
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,468
Jeong-hwan.

357
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,680
Say kimchi.

358
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,766
-Right now?
-Yes.

359
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,309
Say kimchi.

360
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,814
Kimchi.

361
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,736
What? Do I look weird?

362
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,156
You should take another one. Let me see.

363
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,576
I sent them to you.

364
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,707
JOO-EUN

365
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,879
Jeez, I look--

366
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,218
Delete them.

367
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,303
Why? You look cute.

368
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:35,972
Do I?

369
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,727
Give me that. Please delete them.

370
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,645
-No.
-Give me your phone.

371
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,855
No.

372
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,691
No. She's not.

373
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,738
A spy doesn't laugh at red pepper
stuck between your teeth.

374
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,033
What are you talking about?

375
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,786
What matters is that

376
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,582
UI doesn't have Jeong Yoon-kyung's file.

377
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,586
It means that the ones who were after
me and Jeong Yoon-kyung

378
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,755
weren't UI.

379
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,007
Then

380
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,010
who killed my brother?

381
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,514
Could it be GK?

382
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,211
Yes.

383
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,214
TRACE THE CALL

384
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,092
Did you look into the thing

385
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,136
I asked you the other day?

386
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,471
What?

387
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,682
-UI?
-Yes.

388
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,606
Yes.

389
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,275
You were right.

390
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,777
It was UI.

391
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,781
But the problem

392
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,533
isn't as simple as you think.

393
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,412
It looks like UI hired a contractor.

394
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,667
It's hard to find out which department

395
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,294
hired what contractor.

396
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,838
All right.

397
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,423
I will

398
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,136
find out the rest.

399
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,222
Wait.

400
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,855
Will you be okay alone?

401
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,150
Yes, I'll be fine.

402
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,319
Tell me if you need help.

403
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,238
I'll send my guys over.

404
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,616
No. Where are you?
I can send them over now.

405
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,287
Where are you?

406
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,788
It's okay.

407
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,835
I shouldn't cause any misunderstanding
between companies.

408
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,670
Fine.

409
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,590
Still, we should meet up.

410
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,426
I'll call you again.

411
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,727
Is this how you work?

412
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,104
Well,

413
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,149
he's using an older model,
so we can only trace the base station.

414
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,744
So,

415
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,123
the chief of the criminal division ordered
to end the investigation.

416
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,792
Yes, he did.

417
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,086
It began as a high-profile case.

418
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,131
I don't know why he did that.

419
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,393
Coercion?

420
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,438
If not, they wouldn't have closed
the case so quickly.

421
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,568
A detective agency owner died,
and there was a coercion.

422
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,737
Isn't it nonsensical?

423
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,961
So,

424
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,631
Choi Yoon-seok who killed himself
went missing.

425
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,674
No,

426
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,219
it was his twin brother to be exact.

427
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,890
And Lee Jeong-hwan who died
was raised from the dead like Jesus.

428
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,727
He resurrected

429
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,439
and showed up without a warning.

430
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,484
Then he calls me whenever he wants.

431
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,653
Right?

432
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,114
This is the result

433
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,908
of your performance, isn't it?

434
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,535
I'm sorry, sir.

435
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,309
Is that the best you can do?

436
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,729
How dare you trip?

437
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,858
-That hurt, didn't it?
-Yes, quite a bit.

438
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,033
So? What's your plan?

439
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,161
I'll find both Lee Jeong-hwan
and Choi Yoon-seok.

440
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,704
Then what?

441
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:55,124
As you ordered initially,
I'll get rid of them.

442
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,800
HWA CHINESE RESTAURANT

443
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,260
Wait here.

444
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,470
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,390
I decided to be audacious

446
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,601
and give you a warning.

447
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,524
Do not ask any questions from now on,
as always.

448
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,278
If you start asking questions,
we'll take it that you're picking a fight.

449
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,280
Then we'll have to clash.

450
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,369
Goodbye, then.

451
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,458
You should hear what I have to say.

452
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,010
You do know
that I like conglomerates, right?

453
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,639
So tell him not to worry.

454
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,976
I'm talking about Lee Jeong-hwan.

455
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,271
Right. One more thing.

456
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,776
I like to fight.

457
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,819
You know that.

458
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,405
So who was it?

459
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,699
Who used Lee Jeong-hwan's name?

460
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,744
It was GK.
Do you think you can handle them?

461
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,581
Who was it?

462
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,667
I definitely can't handle them.

463
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,836
So, I don't know anything like an idiot.

464
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,546
I just do what I'm told.

465
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,674
Fine.

466
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,052
Then let me ask one final question.

467
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,638
Was it the Innovative Vision Room?

468
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,388
My gosh.

469
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,141
Myung-hyun. Why are you here?

470
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,309
I have one question.

471
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,312
What's up with the Chief?

472
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,856
Wellâ€¦

473
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,069
You did well. You got on his good side.

474
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,197
Not everyone can get
on the chief's good side.

475
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,618
Look confident.

476
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,078
You're doing well.

477
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,916
Damn it. We have no choice but to obey.

478
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,920
So? What's Woo Seok-ho up to?

479
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,007
Why is he at a flower shop?

480
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,970
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

481
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,222
Well,

482
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,726
I'm looking for some flowers to give
to a woman in her late 30s.

483
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,562
Oh, is it your girlfriend's birthday?

484
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,023
It's her wedding.

485
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,376
What?

486
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,716
Thank you.

487
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,147
Excuse me.

488
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,693
It is you. Gosh.

489
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,195
It's so nice to see you.

490
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,281
I didn't expect to run into you here.

491
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,490
Who are you again?

492
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,825
I'm from GK.

493
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,287
I'm Lee Jeong-hwan.

494
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,457
Right.

495
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,220
I was too harsh on you back then.

496
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,764
I'm sorry.

497
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:05,100
Don't be. I understand.

498
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,062
You were scammed after all.

499
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,938
Heâ€¦

500
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,985
died.

501
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,490
On our wedding day.

502
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,205
I had no idea.

503
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,671
We shouldn't just stand here.

504
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:38,759
Would you like to go somewhere
and continue talking?

505
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,221
But don't you have something special
going on today?

506
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,098
Not at all.

507
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,310
I just like flowers,
so I buy them from time to time.

508
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,438
Boys Over Flowers, you know.

509
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,650
This is a gift for our reunion.

510
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,778
Are you sure I can take them?

511
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,279
Of course.

512
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,373
Then shall we go somewhere for a drink?

513
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,585
Well, let's go somewhere
that has tasty food.

514
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,587
I know of a great place.

515
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,162
They left.

516
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,165
-Start the car.
-Gosh.

517
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,959
We could've gotten caught.
Why didn't you hide?

518
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,961
Then we'll have to get down and dirty.

519
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,397
Let's have some hotel coffee.

520
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,608
Why is it so expensive?

521
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,235
Myung-hyun.

522
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,949
-Take a look.
-Okay.

523
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,335
-Yes, Chief.
-Where are you?

524
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,004
We followed Cha and Woo
into a hotel restaurant.

525
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,882
So why haven't you sent me the photos yet?

526
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,009
Wellâ€¦

527
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,096
Are you with someone right now?

528
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,350
I am.

529
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,186
It's Kim Myung-hyun, isn't it?

530
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,647
What is this?

531
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,776
This must mean he knows

532
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,612
that you're receiving orders from me.

533
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,697
He does.

534
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,199
Fine.

535
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,203
Anyway, why do you think

536
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,915
he's working so hard on this case?

537
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,710
I'm not sure either.

538
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,171
Is it because of that widow?

539
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,006
Cha Joo-eun.

540
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,720
There must be a reason
that he's digging into it like that.

541
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,436
Word has it that the two meet alone
regularly.

542
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,606
Don't you think

543
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,735
you should look into their relationship?

544
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,634
Do you know me?

545
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,262
No.

546
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,348
You've been staring at me.

547
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,350
-Have I?
-Yes, you have.

548
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,647
Actually,

549
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,984
you look very similar to someone I know.

550
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,738
His name is Lee Jeong-Hwan,
and he runs a detective agency.

551
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,159
But up-close,

552
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,994
you're not alike at all.

553
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,956
Gosh, do I need a pair of glasses?

554
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:39,916
Anyway,

555
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,419
sorry about that.

556
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,430
He knows Lee Jeong-hwan?

557
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,029
KIM MYUNG-HYUN
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 3

558
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,661
That lousy cop.

559
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:27,214
You should be grateful
that today is a special day for me.

560
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,424
That scumbagâ€¦

561
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,180
What happened in the bathroom?

562
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,974
He could've burned holes
through your back with that glare.

563
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,728
I provoked him a little.
Let's see how he reacts.

564
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,356
He just went into the room.

565
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,653
Darn it. He's more careful than he looks.

566
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,123
You must've been bored.

567
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,668
Yes, I was bored to death.

568
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:08,839
That's why I made sure to be quick
in the bathroom.

569
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,258
What a filthy bastard.

570
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:20,976
Wait.

571
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,020
This isâ€¦

572
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:34,990
One minute.

573
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,871
Excuse me.

574
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,667
Do you see this?

575
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,711
Do your job properly, will you?

576
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,171
I'm sorry, sir.

577
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,885
The glass was dirty.

578
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,261
I see.

579
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,139
All right.

580
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,349
A glass for you.

581
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,819
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

582
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,369
Why aren't you drinking?

583
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,332
I can't drink at all.

584
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,792
Come on.

585
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,835
Then I won't drink either.

586
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,504
I'm serious.

587
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,297
Me too.

588
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,969
Then I'll have a sip.

589
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,054
A sip?

590
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,826
I knew you could drink well.

591
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,995
By the way,
what kind of perfume do you wear?

592
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,166
Actually, this is
just how I naturally smell.

593
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,546
No wonder. Back at the flower shop,

594
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:16,508
I smelled something wonderful
among all those flowers.

595
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,552
When I turned my head,
you were right there.

596
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,099
Cheers to the most fragrant flower.

597
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,268
Cheers.

598
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,540
What? It's empty already. What a shame.

599
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,252
Let's have another bottle.

600
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,088
No.

601
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,716
We should go somewhere else now.

602
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,560
Wait.

603
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,729
How about

604
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:15,066
we just order room service upstairs?

605
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,359
What?

606
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,739
That was a joke.

607
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:21,781
A joke.

608
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:31,791
What's his deal? Why isn't he collapsing?

609
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,921
This is the tranquilizer
they use at safaris.

610
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,841
A few drops is enough to knock out a cow.

611
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,220
Give it to him when the time is right.
Got that?

612
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,557
What's wrong with him?

613
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,811
Is he stronger than a cow?

614
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,940
Is he a buffalo or something?

615
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,522
0718 is sleeping
at the Goryeo Hotel restaurant.

616
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,190
An emergency checkup is required.

617
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,276
HEART RATE, TEMPERATURE,
RESPIRATORY RATE

618
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:32,120
0411 and 0501? What the hell are these?

619
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,924
"0721,

620
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,469
investigation closed"?

621
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:58,021
"0721, gone missing
on the day of the wedding"?

622
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,860
Mr. Lee Jeong-hwan's case has been closed.

623
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,588
MY HUSBAND

624
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,964
It's Jeong-hwan.

625
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,220
Woo Seok-ho

626
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,722
knew Jeong-hwan.

627
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,810
Are you okay?

628
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,478
Sir.

629
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,521
Come out.

630
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,608
Who are you?

631
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,236
That's none of your business.
Please move aside.

632
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,262
Lee Jeong-hwan.

633
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,806
Who are you?

634
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,686
How did it go?

635
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,397
Cow, my foot.

636
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,651
He was finally knocked out
after three bottles of wine.

637
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,612
Gosh, it was agonizing.

638
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,322
He was despicable.

639
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,200
He was greasy and disgusting.

640
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,995
He pretty much molested me with his eyes.

641
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:39,456
Come on. You're a professional.

642
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,833
I'm sure you've had worse.

643
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,917
Exactly.

644
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,879
At times like this,

645
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,381
I have second thoughts about my job.

646
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,808
Here.

647
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,021
Have you heard of GK's
Innovative Vision Room?

648
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,814
Of course.

649
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,610
I'm sure everyone in this country
knows about it.

650
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:14,782
They created a nationwide scandal
a few years ago and were disbanded.

651
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,951
Disbanded?

652
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,039
Do you really believe that?

653
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,958
I beg to differ.

654
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,878
Anyway,

655
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:30,840
I heard they have shadow agents
just like they do at the NIS.

656
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,844
Simply put, they do dirty,

657
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,222
dark,

658
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:41,100
filthy, illegal things.

659
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,563
Like Spy Lee, they have different jobs
and blend in with ordinary people.

660
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,316
They're the Innovative Vision Room's
shadows.

661
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,445
Spy Lee

662
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,865
could have been a real GK employee.

663
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,675
Aren't you going to drink?

664
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:19,889
Hey.

665
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,891
Where have you been?

666
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,144
You didn't even tell me you were
going out. How suspicious.

667
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,105
-Min-jeong.
-Yes?

668
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,107
I need to speak with him in private.

669
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,943
Do you want me to leave?

670
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,361
I don't want to.

671
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,867
I was just kidding.

672
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,412
Sit down.

673
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,964
You know of GK Technology's
Innovative Vision Room, right?

674
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:57,010
Apparently, they have shadow agents.

675
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,680
-Jeong-hwan was--
-You're right.

676
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,516
-What?
-He was one of them.

677
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,727
He was one of their shadow agents.

678
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,108
Promise me one thing.

679
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,403
Just think about yourself.

680
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,282
Just like when you did the documentaries,

681
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,492
think only about yourself.

682
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,436
A shadow?

683
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,441
How could it have all been lies?

684
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,069
That bastard.

685
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,820
Jeong-hwan.

686
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:04,869
What is it?

687
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,706
I really thought a lot about this.

688
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,917
And I decided that you should know.

689
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,049
What is it? Tell me now.

690
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:19,801
Joo-eun

691
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:22,720
isn't an orphan.

692
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,099
What?

693
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,025
Her mother is a loan sharkâ€¦

694
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,033
What brings you all the way to my office?

695
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,410
Office, my foot.

696
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:58,464
Thanks to his insurance,
your documentary barely made it.

697
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,551
Technically, he was your son-in-law.

698
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,010
Show some respect.

699
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,889
Fine. They say a son-in-law
is still your son.

700
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,808
What a good son he was.

701
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,520
Mom.

702
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,021
Yes?

703
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,524
Why do you think
our family ended up like this?

704
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,360
Because of Dad?

705
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,863
No.

706
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,574
It was because of you.

707
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:30,079
He didn't leave us.
It was you who kicked him out.

708
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,957
You were never grateful

709
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,043
and always pessimistic.

710
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,296
Because of your despicable personalityâ€¦

711
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,964
Because you always put on airs,

712
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,593
blamed, and insulted others,

713
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,428
Dad ended up like that.

714
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,639
We'll never be able to live
under the same roof again.

715
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,559
You ruined everything.
Do you realize that?

716
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,605
I'm leaving.

717
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,489
She did not just say that.

718
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,492
Is that how she treats her mom?

719
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,744
And what about my personality?

720
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,289
She shouldn't have lied
no matter how furious she was.

721
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,999
You heard her, right?

722
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,667
I'm what?

723
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,796
I put on airs, am pessimistic,
and only blame others?

724
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,923
Am I really like that?

725
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,716
Someone as graceful as I am?

726
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,096
Why aren't you saying anything?

727
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,223
Why?

728
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,601
Joo-eun.

729
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:37,021
â€¦and her father is serving time for fraud.

730
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:41,901
I'm sorry, Dad.
I've been very busy lately.

731
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,990
Married life is so much different.

732
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:51,452
I have to clean, do laundry,

733
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:55,248
and cook breakfast for him every morning.

734
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,709
Anyway, it's been so hectic.

735
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,336
I'm sorry, Dad.

736
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,967
What is it?

737
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,429
Were you that sad?

738
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,391
You're making me feel terrible.

739
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,227
Joo-eun.

740
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:17,728
Yes?

741
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,274
You can cry in front of me.

742
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,448
My daughter.

743
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,618
My baby.

744
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,750
My baby.

745
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,504
It must have been hard for you.

746
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,136
I'mâ€¦

747
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,432
I'm sorry.

748
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,517
I'm sorry.

749
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,316
I'm so sorry.

750
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,486
I'm sorry.

751
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,074
I'm sorry.

752
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,874
I'm sorry.

753
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,713
Your mom visits from time to time.

754
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,467
She updates me on how you're doing.

755
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,179
She told me about him.
I saw his photo too.

756
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:37,683
He was handsome. No wonder you chose him.

757
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,853
He wasn't as good looking as I am, though.

758
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,981
He looked trustworthy.

759
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,359
I could see it in his face.

760
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,861
I'm sure

761
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:52,907
he had his reasons for doing such a thing.

762
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,241
FAMILY RELATION CERTIFICATE

763
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,785
FATHER, CHA HYUN-TAE
MOTHER, KIM MI-SOOK

764
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,458
-You--
-Also,

765
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,670
I really didn't want to
tell you this, butâ€¦

766
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,004
There's more?

767
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,591
What is it? Tell me.

768
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,010
Joo-eun

769
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,721
has a criminal record

770
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,349
for fraud.

771
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,653
AGGRAVATED PUNISHMENT
FOR FINANCIAL CRIME

772
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,571
Cheongpa Women's Correctional Institute.

773
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,573
We were cellmates.

774
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,326
We call prisons "schools."

775
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,495
She totally fooled you.

776
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,708
How could she lie
about something like that?

777
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:47,003
No. Of course, she had to. It was a fraud.

778
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,546
I would have done the same.

779
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,884
But how did she get into UI?
I'm sure she couldn't just fool them.

780
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,306
I should ask her myself.

781
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,767
What? You're going to see her right now?

782
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,729
Come on.

783
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,857
You can't just reveal yourself to her.
Jeong-hwan!

784
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:08,876
Who might be the most powerful
person here?

785
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:10,628
Do you want to work with me?

786
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,463
Find Cha Joo-eun and hand her over.

787
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,843
How dare she escape?

788
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,970
Did you even love me?

789
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:23,474
This is Deputy Chief Kim Jae-wook.
He's joining us as of today.

790
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:25,226
This is amusing to you, isn't it?

791
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,144
Can you tell?

792
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,272
You answer me first.

793
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,734
I know everything you told me
about yourself was a lie.

794
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,778
Let go of me, you bastard!

795
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,447
I'm sorry.

796
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:45,621
