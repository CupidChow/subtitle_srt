ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,724
TOMORROW INVESTMENT

4
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,537
My stomach hurts when I'm stressed out.

5
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,177
You bitch.

6
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,395
You psychotic bitch.

7
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,944
Don't just stand there. Go get her.

8
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:51,986
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,464
Let me go!

10
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,883
Come here. Come with us.

11
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,056
Who is this bastard?

12
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,471
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

13
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:01,890
Let's go.

14
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,552
Are you okay?

15
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,930
What about you?

16
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,140
I'm all right.

17
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,350
Okay.

18
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,770
Let's not meet for the time being.
That'd be better.

19
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,941
Mom.

20
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,734
What?

21
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,111
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,616
If you are, be nice to me more often.

23
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,079
So Lee Jeong-hwan is alive.

24
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,625
Let me give you a word of advice
as your mother because I'm worried.

25
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,503
Don't ever see him again in the future.

26
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,296
Okay?

27
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,383
It's dangerous.

28
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,761
And what if you have to return
the insurance payout?

29
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,015
Okay?

30
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,935
I can't see him

31
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,730
even if I want to.

32
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,274
Why is that?

33
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,776
He found out about my record.

34
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,153
He knows

35
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,322
everything about me.

36
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,621
Mom, I'll call you back
once things are settled.

37
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,862
Come to think of it,

38
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,156
I was the bait.

39
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,119
The bait to lure out Jeong-hwan
who faked his death.

40
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,209
In other words, because of me,

41
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,755
he's in danger again.

42
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,597
All of us, including you, me,
and Lee Jeong-hwan,

43
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,807
have crossed the line.

44
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,193
I wonder if she was able to escape
and is safe now.

45
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,821
And where is Uncle? Why isn't he here?

46
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,366
You know what?

47
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,535
That delivery guy.

48
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,206
I think I've seen him somewhere.

49
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,501
I wonder where you saw him.

50
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,256
So I tried really hard to recall where.

51
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,885
This one guy crossed my mind.

52
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,807
It was

53
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,020
the delivery boy from my favorite Chinese
restaurant. Seriously, I'm so sharp.

54
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,065
-But how does he know Joo-eun?
-Damn it.

55
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,399
No, that's not it.

56
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,486
Delivery boys don't ride
motorcycles like that.

57
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,198
You're so clueless.
Kids these days are into that stuff.

58
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,784
Damn it.

59
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,456
This is Spy Detective Agency.
We do anything for our clients.

60
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,295
Hi, this is Development Team 2
of the advancing GK Technology.

61
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,673
It's me, Ms. Ko.

62
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,634
Where are you now?

63
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,428
And how do you know this number?

64
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,099
I don't have my cell phone and
this is the only number I have memorized.

65
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,893
What are you talking about?

66
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,063
Anyway, how is it going?

67
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,149
That woman parked her car here.

68
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,234
She didn't even pay for parking.
So annoying.

69
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,829
Yoo Mi-young's car is still at the agency.

70
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,834
I have to go check her dashcam footage.

71
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,712
I have to find out who she's been seeing
and where she's been.

72
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,590
No. It's dangerous. I'll go alone.

73
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,425
I'm coming, too.

74
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,012
I don't even have anywhere to go.

75
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,808
Besides, it's my business.

76
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,743
Jeong-hwan.

77
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,955
You don't know
what your wife is up to, right?

78
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,597
By the way, Yoo Mi-young's car
was last seen at the agency.

79
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,141
Shouldn't we check the dashcam?

80
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,270
I mean, we might find evidence
that could clear her name.

81
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,860
What? Where are you going again?

82
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,119
What should I do with the man
who hurt you, Vivian?

83
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,288
Should I kill him?

84
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,920
Let's see if he shows up again
to save Cha Joo-eun.

85
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,047
He's definitely got my attention.

86
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,395
Just get the dashcam from the car.

87
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,648
Okay. I'm on it, sir.

88
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,242
Park Tae-joo.

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,001
Hey!

90
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,634
CALLING PARK TAE-JOO

91
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,470
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

92
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,806
-Your call will be directed to voicemail.
-Why isn't he answering?

93
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,641
Please leave a message after the beep.

94
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,312
Is it possible
that something's happened to Tae-joo?

95
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,556
What? How did he know?

96
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,185
How did he get here before Cha Joo-eun?

97
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,605
Well, the order was switched,
but this will do.

98
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,366
It's been a while.

99
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,707
Aren't you glad to see me?

100
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,543
Yes, I am.

101
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,631
It's been ten years,

102
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,385
but this isn't the place or the time
suited for our reunion.

103
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
Right?

104
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,640
Yes. There are better places than here.

105
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,104
It makes me wonder why you've
suddenly shown up at a place like this?

106
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,732
Now I can finally see

107
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:36,487
if what I did ten years ago was necessary

108
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,988
or a waste of my time.

109
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,952
Unfortunately, it was a waste of my time
because of you.

110
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,248
Had you stayed as
the Lee Jeong-hwan I knew,

111
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,460
we would be working
in the same office as secretaries now.

112
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,672
We could've even had soju together
after work.

113
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,674
But

114
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,554
you ruined everything.

115
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,722
How sad.

116
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,600
You should have stuck with
what you were good at

117
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,103
and followed the company's orders.

118
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,230
The Lee Jeong-hwan I knew

119
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,276
was a loyal dog who would have
never done such a thing.

120
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,321
I don't follow.

121
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,825
I believe I'm still serving GK.

122
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,038
You intercepted Jeong Yoon-kyung
and stole President Choi's secret ledger.

123
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,167
You put on quite a show.
We all took notice of you.

124
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,922
That's not something
a man who serves GK would do.

125
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,011
So you knew everything.

126
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,055
This is embarrassing.

127
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,059
It's all right.
You don't need to feel embarrassed.

128
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,978
Was that it?

129
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,648
Was that why I had to die?

130
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,486
This whole thing made me
question something.

131
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,574
You used to be a model student.
How did you undergo such a transformation?

132
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,286
What suddenly made you do the things
that you did?

133
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,168
So I did my best
to come up with an answer.

134
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,587
Are you interested?

135
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,592
Cha Joo-eun was born
into a family of con artists

136
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,512
and grew up to be a promising con artist.

137
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:30,559
And I think meeting her
became a turning point in your life.

138
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,526
After falling for her act,
you ended up marrying her.

139
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,280
Just like any other men, a sense of
responsibility and greed swept over you.

140
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,615
Why?

141
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,743
You wanted to make her happy at all costs.

142
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,747
It would have been better
had you stopped in moderation.

143
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,416
But greed knows no bounds.

144
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,962
You couldn't be satisfied.
Your ambition grew bigger and bigger,

145
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,964
and that's how you ended up here.

146
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,177
This is the answer I came up with.

147
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,179
What do you think?

148
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,348
Is this correct?

149
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,811
Wrong answer.

150
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,403
This suddenly crossed my mind.

151
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,448
"If people like you
could have that ledger.

152
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,993
Why can't I have it?

153
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,413
If I had it,

154
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:37,793
I would definitely be able
to use it for a much better cause."

155
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,545
That's what I thought.

156
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,340
You bastard.

157
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,343
Be honest with me.

158
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,972
After sending Jeong Yoon-kyung abroad

159
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,142
and obtaining President Choi's
secret ledger,

160
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,560
you acted all cool,

161
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,479
as if you were doing me a favor.

162
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,233
Didn't you leave the company,
expecting me to return the favor?

163
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,320
I see that we had

164
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,947
a lot of catching up to do.

165
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,826
Make a choice.

166
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,664
Return the ledger and live your life
as if you didn't exist in this world.

167
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,749
Or

168
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,711
you can move into the cinerarium
for real this time.

169
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,422
If I return the ledger,

170
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,426
will everything I did go away?

171
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,058
Of course, that's what I want, too.

172
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,851
But

173
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:42,024
if I do that, Vivian will be so furious.
So I don't think I can do that.

174
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,112
How about I break one of your legs?

175
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,449
Go ahead.

176
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,894
Get back in the car.

177
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,438
We're meeting at the tented bar.

178
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,752
Get in.

179
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,418
Goodness.

180
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,218
So which one is it?
Your leg or the cinerarium?

181
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,312
Jeez.

182
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,716
Are you using only one hand?

183
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,089
Damn it!

184
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,138
What a waste of money.

185
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,975
Damn it!

186
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,354
Spy Lee is really alive. He didn't die.

187
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,231
What happened?

188
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,773
He's become frail.

189
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,970
Can you

190
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,264
give me some water?

191
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,000
Well…

192
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,841
Joo-eun.

193
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,429
Did you

194
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,349
ever love me?

195
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,728
You know the answer,

196
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,356
Jeong-hwan.

197
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,826
Where's the jewelry?

198
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,703
Sorry?

199
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,456
Where's the jewelry I gave you?

200
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,086
That's…

201
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,922
-What's this?
-A gift.

202
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,803
It's for your stiff neck.

203
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,847
Sit down.

204
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,154
It feels good.

205
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,662
You can relax like this after work.

206
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,542
You hid it in the massage chair?

207
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,836
Because the chair is big,

208
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,798
there are a lot of places to hide it.

209
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,968
Are you crazy?
Why did you put it in there?

210
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,096
I almost sold it.

211
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,223
I never knew this would happen.

212
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,268
By the way,

213
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:57,978
you almost sold it?

214
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,273
How could I pay five million won for rent?

215
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,112
How could you lie about such a thing?

216
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,823
What did you do with my money?

217
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,159
It's in the bank.

218
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,954
Wait. Did you think I used it all
for myself?

219
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,206
You should've used it to lower the rent.

220
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,251
Why did you put that in the bank?
There's hardly any interest.

221
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,837
All GK shadows do that.

222
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,423
Because if something goes wrong,

223
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,093
I have to go back to running
a detective agency.

224
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,012
That makes no sense.

225
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,598
Can't a detective agency owner
lease a house?

226
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,396
You're right.

227
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,111
Why didn't I think of that?

228
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,696
So,

229
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,950
because you wanted to look normal,
you borrowed money

230
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,994
from a friend who's a loan shark?

231
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,664
Right.

232
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,724
What's this?

233
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,269
Can you tell me what happened

234
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,814
in detail?

235
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,026
I don't have

236
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,696
much to tell you.

237
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,073
Is that so?

238
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,453
Then I'll ask those punks
who took over my bed.

239
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,711
If I went in there and spoiled the mood,

240
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,839
that'd make you happy, wouldn’t it?

241
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,386
What? Are you that hopelessly in love?

242
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,685
You're up.

243
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,730
Long time no see, Spy Lee.

244
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,402
So that's why

245
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,489
you've been pretending to be dead
and living in hiding?

246
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,494
Then why are GK's Director Kim
and Kim Jae-wook

247
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:06,583
working together again?
What are they up to?

248
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,090
It can't be because of Spy Lee, can it?

249
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,052
They're up to something big, aren't they?

250
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,644
Kingmaker…

251
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,443
The president of Korea.

252
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,913
So what's the plan?

253
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,195
Do you want some water?

254
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,239
Yes.

255
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,636
What are you going to do from now on?

256
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,964
LEDGER

257
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,716
Yoo Byung-jun…

258
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,342
YOO BYUNG-JUN

259
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,303
WOOK'S GUKBAP

260
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,555
YOO BYUNG-JUN

261
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,937
UI CHAIRMAN CHOI KYUNG-HWAN
CHARGED WITH BRIBERY

262
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,774
PROSECUTOR YOO IS DETERMINED
TO INVESTIGATE THOROUGHLY

263
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,731
The first thing we need to do
is to clear your name.

264
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,277
If something happens to you…

265
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,870
Anyway, this is something

266
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,415
we have to do no matter what.

267
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,838
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

268
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,841
I'm sorry, honey.

269
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,011
You hate me, don't you?

270
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,598
Don't ever forgive me.

271
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,938
Did you do it for money?

272
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,774
Is that it?

273
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,694
Actually,

274
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,656
I was threatened.

275
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,034
What?

276
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,330
Cha Joo-eun

277
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,418
said she'd kill you if I refused,

278
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,504
so I had no choice.

279
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,424
Cha Joo-eun said she'd kill me?

280
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,637
He's the man Cha Joo-eun hired.

281
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,183
I took a picture secretly just in case.

282
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,730
Hold on.

283
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,193
MESSAGE

284
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,114
Answer my call
if you don't want it released.

285
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,743
Something urgent came up. Excuse me.

286
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,247
Honey, where are you going?

287
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,967
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

288
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,594
Meet me at the place I tell you.

289
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,681
Those pictures will go online
if you're even a minute late.

290
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,807
Hey!

291
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,643
Damn it!

292
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,360
Yes, he just left.

293
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,141
Hello.

294
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,061
Someone's tailing you.
Come out through the back door.

295
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,646
Don't look around!

296
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,024
As soon as you come out,

297
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,443
turn left and walk down the hallway.

298
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,451
Who are they?

299
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,082
Take the escalator going down.

300
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,632
-Jump to the side.
-What? Jump?

301
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:33,177
-Jump!
-Now? Darn it.

302
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,848
That way! There!

303
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,392
Get him!

304
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,561
Run to the main entrance.

305
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,448
-What now?
-Come out.

306
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,327
-Where is he?
-Where did he go?

307
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,288
-Gosh.
-Go that way.

308
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,456
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,920
-Hurry up and get in!
-Damn it.

310
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,348
So?

311
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,185
Search harder, you bastards.

312
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,192
What the hell are you doing?

313
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,152
Are you a philanthropist or something?

314
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,361
I'm sorry, sir.

315
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,749
Cha Joo-eun is acting all cute with me.

316
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,128
What about the Chinese spy?

317
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,756
We're still looking for him.

318
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,300
Find him as soon as you can.

319
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,888
Let's use him to have Cha Joo-eun
stand trial in China

320
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,099
for being a double agent.

321
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,896
That could get her a death sentence
in China, right?

322
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,149
Yes, sir.

323
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,955
How tacky.

324
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,040
Cigarettes in this day and age?

325
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,342
You son of a bitch!

326
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,155
Are you up?

327
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,450
Why are you doing this?
I don't even know you.

328
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,702
That's exactly why I did it.

329
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,330
I didn't think you'd want to talk
if I suddenly asked.

330
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,631
Do you feel like talking now?

331
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,425
Yes.

332
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,744
What happened?

333
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,329
What do you mean?

334
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,915
Why have I become an industrial spy?

335
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,085
Well, that's because…

336
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,586
You were coerced, weren't you?

337
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,339
Find Cha Joo-eun and hand her over.

338
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,716
That's the only way
you can clear your name.

339
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,218
Do you understand me?

340
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,055
I can arrest you

341
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,724
right here and now.

342
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,101
I know you won't.

343
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,688
Me? An industrial spy?

344
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,193
You and I both know
that's an absurd claim.

345
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,239
So

346
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,617
tell me everything you know.

347
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,202
Let's join hands.

348
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,162
Join hands?

349
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,833
How could a cop join hands
with a civilian?

350
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,002
God, I'm so frustrated.

351
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,378
You and your principles.

352
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:22,967
Listen carefully.

353
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,262
GK

354
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,390
is behind this case.

355
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,269
What do you say?

356
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,356
Don't you feel the urge to get
to the bottom of this as a cop?

357
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:43,321
If you can show me that you're willing
to investigate this properly,

358
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,031
I might consider helping you.

359
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,743
If you're so confident,

360
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,954
won't it be better to cooperate with me
and reveal the truth?

361
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,247
The truth?

362
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,917
Do you still think such a thing exists?

363
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:04,175
People only believe the things
they want to believe,

364
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,676
whether it's true or not.

365
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,347
You're a cop in Korea
but still don't know that?

366
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,559
So what's it going to be?
Are you in or not?

367
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,230
Aren't you embarrassed?

368
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,067
Aren't you?

369
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,235
To be coerced like that.

370
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,447
They told you to stop investigating

371
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,700
and turn a detective agency owner
into an industrial spy.

372
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,830
The police are pretty much powerless
in everything they do.

373
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,378
If I were you, I would have quit already
out of shame.

374
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,383
Don't you ever call me again.

375
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,845
I will arrest you the next time we meet

376
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,930
no matter what.

377
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,164
What do you think he'll do?

378
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,376
We'll have to make him do it.

379
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,969
PORK RIBS APLENTY

380
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,451
Dad.

381
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,955
Joo-eun.

382
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,542
Why are you…

383
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,294
What happened?

384
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,254
Well…

385
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,256
Could you bring the charcoal?

386
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,966
Okay.

387
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,009
One minute.

388
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,970
Oh, God. It's so hot!

389
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,889
Gosh! Are you okay?

390
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,475
Goodness, it's so hot.

391
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,602
-God, that's hot.
-Oh, no.

392
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,437
Let's go inside.

393
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,772
Gosh.

394
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,318
Seriously.

395
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,571
Gosh, you should've been more careful.

396
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,656
You're such a baby.

397
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:38,287
Can you make it less painful?
Like Florence Nightingale?

398
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,081
Why didn't you tell me?

399
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,293
You should've let me know
that you were released.

400
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,837
I did. But

401
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,131
you didn't answer my calls.

402
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,382
I didn't?

403
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:54,678
So I thought you were avoiding me.

404
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,013
Why would I?

405
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:02,561
Work hasn't been going well lately.
That's why I couldn't pick up.

406
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,271
It hasn't?

407
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,148
What are you doing these days?

408
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,108
Nothing much.

409
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,277
I'm working at a detective agency.

410
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,362
I see.

411
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,406
What about you?

412
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,575
What's your plan for the future?

413
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,245
Well, I…

414
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,790
Chief Yang has offered me a place to stay,

415
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,959
so I'll be working here.

416
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,211
Don't do that.

417
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,004
Where's your conscience?

418
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,508
Are you seriously going
to inconvenience her again?

419
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,428
Also,

420
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,765
I'd like you to find a job
that could help you grow.

421
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,600
Whatever it is.

422
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,565
Gosh.

423
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,358
I've finished disinfecting it.

424
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,029
What about Mom? Have you spoken with her?

425
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,782
Joo-eun.

426
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,994
Could you not tell her about this

427
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,913
for the time being?

428
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,415
Why?

429
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,417
Because…

430
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:12,256
How should I put this?
I just don't feel ready to tell her yet.

431
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,510
And like you said,

432
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,930
I should find a decent job.

433
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,641
Once I find one, let's meet up.

434
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,684
Us three.

435
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,109
Come here.

436
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,028
-Why?
-Hurry.

437
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,822
What is it? I already washed my face.

438
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,408
Gosh, what is all this?

439
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,951
But I already washed up.

440
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,746
Done.

441
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,748
Thanks.

442
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:54,256
So Mi-young was hired by you.

443
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,175
What does that mean exactly?

444
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,887
Are you trying to come between us
when we're deeply in love?

445
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,139
You're her stalker, aren't you?

446
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,729
In order to divorce me, my wife…

447
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,523
No, she's no longer my wife.

448
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,278
So she hired you?

449
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,447
No. To be exact,

450
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,742
that female attorney hired you.

451
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:25,704
And you hired Yoo Mi-young,
an actress, to seduce me.

452
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,206
Is that it?

453
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,707
That's correct.

454
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,335
You're one sly bastard, aren't you?

455
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,756
Do you know how much money
she took from me?

456
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,260
Half. She took half of my wealth.

457
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,517
Why did I have to divide
my father's inheritance with that bitch?

458
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,769
How dare you, you bastard?

459
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,691
Let me go! You asshole! Let go!

460
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,568
Hey! You son of a bitch! Let me go!

461
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,654
Jeez!

462
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,989
You son of a bitch!

463
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,409
This watch…

464
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,452
Where did you get it?

465
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,620
Why do you ask?

466
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,789
Is that important right now?

467
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,832
Yes, it is.

468
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,543
Who gave it to you?

469
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,838
Hey! Damn it. Well…

470
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,926
I got it when I became
Assemblyman Kwon's head supporter.

471
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,470
You know Kwon Hyuk-jang, right?

472
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,681
He personally gave it to me.

473
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,100
You've picked the wrong guy to mess with.

474
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,187
Now, I get it.

475
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,689
Get what?

476
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,275
Hey! Okay!

477
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,402
Let go of my arm! Gosh!

478
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,742
-Let me see.
-Yes, sir.

479
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,301
Okay.

480
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,178
Call them.

481
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,514
Who, sir?

482
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,643
The police.

483
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,854
Right. Yes, sir.

484
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,651
It's me, Deputy Chief.

485
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,162
Come in.

486
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,584
DEPUTY CHIEF'S OFFICE

487
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,960
Yes?

488
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,004
MEDICAL EXAMINER
KIM HYEON-JONG

489
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,088
Yes.

490
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,383
Lee Jeong-hwan's autopsy

491
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,636
was canceled when the DNA results came in.

492
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,014
Then you closed the case immediately,
despite my opinion.

493
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,391
Did we ignore your opinion?

494
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,559
What do you mean?

495
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,479
Chief Jeong called me himself,
so I told him.

496
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,438
Didn't you hear?

497
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,191
Right. You see,

498
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:03,362
I was busy investigating another case.

499
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,989
I'm sorry, but could you tell me about it?

500
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,700
Well, what I told him was…

501
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,249
I measured the body's legs

502
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,125
but not the upper body.

503
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,630
And it turned out
that the legs were only 70cm long

504
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,383
when Lee Jeong-hwan was 185cm.

505
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,510
Well…

506
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,721
He could've had short legs, right?

507
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:34,017
Come on, Detective.
Haven't you seen his photos?

508
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,603
I could tell at a glance
that his legs were over 100cm.

509
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,155
GYEONGGI ROUTE 37 ACCIDENT CASE REPORT

LEE JEONG HWAN
PERSONAL INFORMATION

511
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,211
Lee Jeong-hwan.

512
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,214
Are you still alive?

513
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,766
If I were you, I would have quit already
out of shame.

514
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,027
Birthdate…

515
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,661
-You punk.
-What is it this time?

516
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,746
Should we have soju?

517
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,123
What do you say to pork ribs? My treat.

518
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,918
Pork ribs?

519
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,254
Let's go.

520
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,298
Pork ribs?

521
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,008
Yes, pork ribs.

522
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,968
Okay. Pork ribs.

523
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,598
One of our former detectives
runs this place.

524
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,516
It tastes rather ordinary

525
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,977
but they give you a lot of meat.

526
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:03,065
I see. We do prefer
quantity over quality, right?

527
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,733
Anyway, you're paying for this.

528
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,984
Eat as much as you want.

529
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,402
All right.

530
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,988
Here you go.

531
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:14,076
How many servings? Two grown men
should have at least four servings.

532
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,037
-Right?
-No, just two will do.

533
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,664
And two cold buckwheat noodles.

534
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,374
Noodles? So soon?

535
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,835
Hey, the noodles are for dessert.

536
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:24,836
Exactly.

537
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,714
You bastard. You're trying to fill me up
with noodles.

538
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,508
I can see right through you.

539
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,928
God, you have such poor taste.
You don't know how to enjoy pork ribs.

540
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,098
You're supposed to wrap the meat
in the noodle.

541
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,265
Haven't you tried it?

542
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,975
Try it. It's really good.

543
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,602
That'll be all.

544
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,104
Okay.

545
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,981
Right, drinks.

546
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,567
You know, I used to drink like a fish
when I was young.

547
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,069
-That's right.
-Two grown men

548
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,529
should drink at least an entire box.

549
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,073
One soju and one beer.
We're not drinking much.

550
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:55,951
Okay.

551
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,371
Gosh, you're being so cheap.

552
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,997
-Sir.
-What?

553
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,375
You want extra meat?

554
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,085
In your dreams.

555
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,837
About Cha Joo…

556
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,046
Charge what?

557
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,008
It's nothing.
Please give us a lot of garlic.

558
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,510
You'll have to get it yourself.

559
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,137
-I see.
-Ma'am.

560
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,559
By the way, where's the restroom?

561
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,853
It's in the building to the right.

562
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,354
Get the key.

563
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,444
May I have the restroom key?

564
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,613
-It's 50,000 won.
-Pardon?

565
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,657
Just kidding.

566
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,200
I see.

567
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,869
I love your game plan.

568
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,163
You're emptying your bowels
before the meal.

569
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,414
That's the spirit!

570
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,125
Go flush everything down

571
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,210
then fill up your stomach with meat.

572
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,172
-Good luck.
-Right.

573
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,715
We don't have toilet paper.

574
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,341
Oh, I'm just going to pee.

575
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,468
I see.

576
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,360
You left your phone. Here.

577
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,029
Thank you.

578
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,041
Thank you.

579
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,544
Be careful.
The eye is quicker than the hand.

580
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,962
I'll remember that.

581
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,133
It's really good, isn't it?

582
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,511
Have some.

583
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,678
Eat up.

584
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,643
It's delicious.

585
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,941
DEPUTY CHIEF SEO MAN-HO

586
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,527
Give me a minute.

587
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,444
Sure.

588
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,326
Yes, sir.

589
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,164
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

590
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,457
Salute.

591
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,551
My God. What's wrong with you?

592
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,636
When did you come out?

593
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,180
Did you overhear the conversation?

594
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,974
No, I didn't.

595
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,475
I'm not Jaime Sommers.

596
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,396
Anyway, something urgent came up.

597
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,314
We'll have to take a rain check.

598
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,525
I haven't had my full share yet, okay?

599
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,943
I'll finish eating next time.

600
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,237
All right, you punk.

601
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,407
Tidy up your clothes, will you?

602
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,950
Bye.

603
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,493
We're going to do this again.

604
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,786
Just go.

605
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:20,864
Myung-hyun.

606
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,449
Hey.

607
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,159
What is it?

608
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,077
What are you doing here?

609
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,537
I was just…

610
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,497
-Well…
-What are you doing with a wiretap?

611
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,086
This is good.

612
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,048
Gosh, you're eating so well.

613
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,884
Where does all the cholesterol go?

614
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,093
DEPUTY CHIEF SEO MAN-HO

615
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,261
Give me a minute.

616
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,013
Sure.

617
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,526
Yes, sir.

618
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,571
A Chinese spy is going to turn himself in?

619
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,016
Yes?

620
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,018
Fine, let's join hands.

621
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,356
You've made the right decision.

622
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,069
I guess the Korean police
aren't completely hopeless.

623
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,905
But first, I have a question.

624
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,784
Who was that motorcycle guy?

625
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,954
I mean the accomplice
who helped you escape.

626
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,332
Was it Lee Jeong-hwan?

627
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,442
HANSANG HOT POT

628
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,405
-Poong-yeon.
-Yes?

629
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,240
Oh, sorry.

630
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,578
Rice soup, my foot.

631
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,230
Why does it smell like
the countryside in here?

632
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,525
Aren't you hungry?

633
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,611
Today,

634
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,614
we'll be having a special Korean dish.

635
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,532
Dried radish greens and rice soup.

636
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,411
I didn't know you could make that.

637
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,164
It's not like you.

638
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,547
Here.

639
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,224
It's good.

640
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,481
Where did you learn to make this?

641
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,192
My father taught me.

642
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,444
What?

643
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,447
My parents used to run
a rice soup restaurant.

644
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,619
I'm afraid I can't fall for your lies
anymore.

645
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,955
You make it so obvious.

646
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,587
Did you take cooking classes for me?

647
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,549
You don't have to be embarrassed.

648
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,926
Guys who can cook are popular nowadays.

649
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,233
HANSANG HOT POT

650
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,652
Rice soup…

651
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:36,828
Who might be the most powerful
person here?

652
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,288
YOO BYUNG-JUN

653
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,331
Yoo Byung-jun…

654
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,416
WOOK'S GUKBAP

655
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,126
Yoo Byung-jun.

656
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,087
Edward.

657
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,922
Kim Jae-wook.

658
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,552
Wook's Gukbap?

659
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,773
Oh, my! I'm sorry!

660
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,568
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

661
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,154
What the hell are you doing?

662
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,364
I'm truly sorry. I really am.

663
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,908
I'll pay for the laundry.

664
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,868
No, I should buy you a new suit, right?

665
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,953
I'm so sorry. I should, right?

666
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,705
No, it's okay.

-I'm sorry.
-It's tasty.

669
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,543
-Oh, dear.
-Are you okay?

670
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,046
-Goodness.
-What happened, ma'am?

671
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,965
It's okay. I'll take care of this.
Don't worry about it.

672
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,091
Oh, my!

673
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,468
What are you doing?

674
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,594
Mr. Cho.

675
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,263
What are you doing?

676
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,516
Where are your manners?

677
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,309
Apologize politely to him.

678
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,812
I'm sorry, sir.

679
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,234
Wait outside. I'll be there soon.

680
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,157
What should I do?

681
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,743
I'm kind of in a hurry right now.

682
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,120
Gosh, I have no cash on me either.

683
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,999
How about this? I'll give you my number.

684
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,084
Once you wash…

685
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:10,672
No, buy a new suit and give me a call.
I'll wire you the money immediately.

686
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,007
Would that be all right with you?

687
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,635
Do you mean your cell phone number?

688
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,637
Yes.

689
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,223
Sure, that'd be great.

Hello, Mr. Bae.

00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,376
Hello? Hello, Ms. Chung.

693
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,545
Yes, it's me.

694
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:54,382
It's about your childhood friend
you mentioned today

695
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,259
that you wanted to find.

696
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,136
The rice soup restaurant.

697
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,723
I've found a dried radish greens rice soup
place that fits your description.

698
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,101
I guess I'm quite skilled.

699
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,022
The business license was registered
under Kim U-jik.

700
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,649
I'll text you the address.

Yes?

704
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,961
We need to go somewhere else.

705
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,048
-I'll give you the address.
-Okay.

01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,521
Where is this place?

708
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,359
A friend's house.

709
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,778
An old friend of mine.

710
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,163
Should I go inside?

711
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,141
No.

712
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,143
I will.

713
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,983
He's my friend after all.

714
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,676
Investment? You, Ms. Cha?

715
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,594
Is it because I run a spy agency?

716
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,013
I was going to invest
about ten billion won.

717
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,307
Thanks for believing in me, Mom.

718
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,394
-How's it going with Cha Joo-eun?
-I'll prepare the news about her.

719
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,812
It's time to repay me.

720
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,731
These bastards.

721
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,024
-Let's go.
-This case is confidential,

722
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,444
so a special department has been set up.

723
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,362
If we can't send Cha Joo-eun to China…

724
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,072
There's not enough evidence.

725
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,491
If Lee Jeong-hwan's really alive,
I can charge you for fraud.

726
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,286
This is Lee Jeong-hwan
from GK Innovative Vision Room.

727
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,247
-Have you ever stowed away on a ship?
-So?

728
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:34,375
-Should I accept?
-I don't see why you shouldn't.

729
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,294
-Let her do it.
-Yoon-kyung…
