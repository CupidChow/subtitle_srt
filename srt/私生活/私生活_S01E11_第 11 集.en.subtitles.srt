1
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,886
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,693
WOOK'S GUKBAP

4
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,866
Did you know that Edward has a puppy?

5
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:42,162
Aren't you dying
to find out where Edward is now?

6
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,497
Edward.

7
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,041
Yoon-kyung…

8
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,945
WOOK'S GUKBAP

9
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,573
What about your friend?

10
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,909
Poong-yeon.

11
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,829
-Yes?
-Drive.

12
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,331
Okay.

13
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,480
BEWARE OF DOG

14
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,578
Yoon-kyung.

15
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,717
I'm sorry that
you couldn't find your friend.

16
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:50,516
We'll meet someday if we are meant to.

17
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,357
DIRTY DETECTIVE LEE MIN-KYU

18
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,200
It's me. I have a question.

19
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,284
What is it this time?

20
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,954
It's a simple question about the past.

21
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,500
The murder of a couple
who ran a gukbap place.

22
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,472
EPISODE 11

23
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,601
Fine, let's join hands.

24
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,103
You've made the right decision.

25
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,441
I guess the Korean police
aren't completely hopeless.

26
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,067
But first, I have a question.

27
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,903
Who was that motorcycle guy?

28
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,490
I mean the accomplice
who helped you escape.

29
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,784
Was it Lee Jeong-hwan?

30
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,745
Wasn't that him?

31
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
Who?

32
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,793
That's nonsense.

33
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,090
Why do you keep bringing up
my dead husband? You're hurting me.

34
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,971
Put your instincts aside
and investigate the case using reason.

35
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,140
Then, who was he?

36
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,850
Why would you…

37
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,561
Why do I have to answer that?

38
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,190
Okay. Then, I'll look into it myself.

39
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,983
He's my friend.

40
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,445
He's a new friend I made.

41
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,740
We became friends
when I was reading a book at a library.

42
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,577
Please understand that I cannot
disclose his identity to you.

43
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,497
All right.

44
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,082
Please keep one thing in mind.

45
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,753
If Lee Jeong-hwan's really alive,
I can charge you for fraud.

46
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,088
And try not to forget

47
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,217
that I'm still a cop.

48
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,565
So the whole thing
about the industrial spy

49
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,109
was to bring down Assemblyman Kwon?

50
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,321
Was it all a setup

51
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,365
to destroy Mr. Kwon?

52
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,868
So GK can make Yoo Byung-jun the king?

53
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,371
Just set up a meeting
with Assemblyman Kwon for me.

54
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,165
I will explain everything to him.

55
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,212
Okay. I will set it up.

56
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,798
But before I do that,

57
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,385
let me use the restroom.

58
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,972
I've been holding it for a while now.
But I can't hold it anymore.

59
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,062
Come on, it's urgent.

60
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,337
That con artist.

61
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,340
ENTER PASSCODE

62
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,389
Gosh, Mi-young.

63
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,352
Hey! What was that?

64
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,479
Hey, you! Give it back, you asshole!

65
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,482
Hey! Stop that!

66
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,737
Damn it. What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

67
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,488
Hey, don't do that.

68
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,574
What are you doing?

69
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,160
Stop it, you bastard! Let go of me first!

70
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,412
Hey. What do you think you are doing?

71
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:22,997
Stop it!

72
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:24,915
KWON HYUK-JANG

73
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,044
-Take one from this angle.
-Okay.

74
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,257
Hold on.

75
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,009
PARK CHUNG-SEOP

76
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,970
Ms. Eun, let's call it a day here.

77
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,182
Mr. Kwon, just one last photo.

78
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,851
I WILL CALL YOU LATER

79
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,069
Ma'am.

80
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,405
Put some on this side too.

81
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,912
KWON HYUK-JANG REACHES
NUMBER ONE IN THE POLLS

82
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,914
KWON HYUK-JANG MANIA SWEEPS THE NATION

83
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,291
CLOTHES WORN AND BOOKS READ
BY THE CANDIDATE BECOME SOLD OUT

84
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,752
I'LL FORM A CONSERVATIVE PARTY
PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF

85
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,592
Everyone!

86
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,346
Our candidate has overtaken
the opposing candidate by 2.1 percent!

87
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,185
-Kwon Hyuk-jang!
-Kwon Hyuk-jang!

88
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:31,148
-Kwon Hyuk-jang!
-Kwon Hyuk-jang!

89
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,900
Please?

90
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,528
Hey, buddy. Sir?

91
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,823
Can't you let me go first?

92
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,784
Come on, just let go of me.
Let's be civil about it.

93
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,580
Don't hang up and just listen.
It's about Assemblyman Yoo Byung-jun.

94
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,334
-Who is this?
-This is Lee Jeong-hwan

95
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,378
from GK Innovative Vision Room.

96
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,066
Sir, I'm sorry,
but I only have 10,000 won.

97
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,943
Don't you have a card?

98
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,154
What do I do?

99
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,703
I'll withdraw some money
at the convenience store. Could you wait?

100
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,791
Young lady, you just wait.
I'm going to call the police.

101
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,420
Goodness. I can't catch a break!

102
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,132
Young lady! Damn it.

103
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,689
It's not a crime to fall in love.

104
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,817
Yes, it is.

105
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,655
Mi-jeong. I miss you, Mi-jeong.

106
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,752
Joo-eun.

107
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,129
I was hungry, so I ate first.

108
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,510
What do you want to eat, Joo-eun?

109
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,639
I did buy a lot of stuff.

110
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,141
Cup noodles.

111
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,101
Gimbap.

112
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,396
I bought a variety of food.

113
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,700
Are you not hungry, Joo-eun?

114
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,871
I want to go to a crowded place.

115
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,626
So I can show you off.

116
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,108
Joo-eun.

117
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,860
Did something happen?

118
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,200
You must tell me for me to know.

119
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,036
I just don't like this.

120
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,917
I just keep getting angry.

121
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,301
I was told that you being alive

122
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,762
can be considered a fraud.

123
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,936
And I even received the death benefit.

124
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,232
With that money,

125
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,693
I bought a car,

126
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,279
paid off the debt,

127
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,616
and had meat.

128
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,581
I've been living off
the price of your life.

129
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,670
Our wedding,

130
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,131
our apartment,

131
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,508
our family plans…

132
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,137
Everything is over now.

133
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,893
We can't go back.

134
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,813
What do we do?

135
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,902
What are we going to do?

136
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,745
It's not over yet.

137
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,580
Okay?

138
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,960
It's not over.

139
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,805
It's going to be okay.

140
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,518
We can go back to our lives.

141
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,619
It's within the error range,
but we can't seem to narrow the gap.

142
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,997
You know what I mean, right?

143
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,041
We don't have much time left.

144
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,711
How's it going with Cha Joo-eun?

145
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,590
I'll prepare the news about her.

146
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,968
Then,

147
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,596
can I relax and watch the news
at home tomorrow?

148
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,723
Breaking news.

149
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,643
-Please look forward to it.
-Breaking news…

150
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,439
That's a good way to draw attention.

151
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,734
All right, then.

152
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,041
A lone wolf.

153
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,920
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

154
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,014
And the industrial technology team?
Have they made a move yet?

155
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,910
Shouldn't we report them to the police?

156
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,996
He says he doesn't know anything
about them.

157
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,665
We're living in the 21st century.
This is nonsense.

158
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,003
God! Forget it.
It's embarrassing to call the police.

159
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,466
That's not Park Tae-joo's style.

160
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,886
What's he saying?

161
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,682
Goodness, it's nice to see you again.

162
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,772
Park Tae-joo. Get up.

163
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,903
Stand up straight, loan shark.

164
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,489
I'm a finance specialist.

165
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,159
Take everything out of your pockets. Now.

166
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,788
I don't have a pocket.

167
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,168
What's this?

168
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,425
This is Cha Joo-eun's, right?

169
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:56,927
What?

170
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,720
-What?
-What?

171
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:34,047
I let you appreciate
how beautiful the world is.

172
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,467
Now it's time you repay me.

173
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,349
You've been in contact

174
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,144
with Cha Joo-eun using that phone.

175
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,607
I already saved the call history,
so don't worry.

176
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,068
Got it?

177
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,530
I don't even know who Cha Joo-eun is,

178
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,325
so how can I say
that we've been in contact?

179
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,743
Jeez.

180
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,622
Why are you acting so innocent
like you're a model citizen?

181
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,463
Whether you know her or not
isn't important, you bastard.

182
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,753
A NEW MESSAGE

183
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,631
The pawn is in place.
Prepare the news, sir.

184
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,427
-Let's get it started.
-Yes, sir.

185
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,180
JEONG DAE-SANG

186
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,143
PRESS ROOM

187
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,239
INDUSTRIAL SPY INVESTIGATION
OFFICIAL PRESS CONFERENCE

188
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,367
What? Did he get tangled up
with an industrial spy?

189
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,078
Kwon Hyuk-jang is finished.

190
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,998
It was odd that a small company
had obtained patented technology

191
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,332
ahead of a conglomerate.

192
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,793
That must have been when it all started.

193
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,299
Isn't it almost time?

194
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,636
DEPUTY CHIEF SEO MAN-HO

195
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,930
Yes, Mr. Seo.

196
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,808
Now?

197
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Yes, everything's set up here.

198
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,565
Yes, sir. Salute.

199
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,529
What?

200
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:08,493
I was just wondering why you answered
the call so secretly.

201
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,163
Was it your girlfriend?

202
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,124
How dare you eavesdrop
on a police phone call.

203
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,084
It's over, punk.

204
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,920
He'll be here soon,

205
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,507
so stop frowning
and just take the punishment.

206
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,385
Who's going to be here?

207
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,555
Who do you think?
Cha Joo-eun's accomplice.

208
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,933
What?

209
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,365
Are you here to turn yourself in?

210
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,961
3 HOURS AGO

211
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,296
Go in.

212
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,231
He'll turn himself in after an hour.

213
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,650
What will you do?

214
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,075
Hey, haven't you ever been
to a police station?

215
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,036
Put some half-eaten cup noodles here.

216
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,040
What's wrong with this document?
Didn't I tell you it has to be

217
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,626
as thick as an encyclopedia
to intimidate the bad guys?

218
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:43,505
When it's thick, it shows that
you worked hard on investigating me

219
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,632
to the point of finding out about

220
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,385
a friend of a friend,
and even about my first love.

221
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,428
Like you investigated everything about me.

222
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,265
Make them believe you know everything.

223
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,937
Look.

224
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,235
Look at his vintage outfit.

225
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,823
Anyone will think
that he's a chief investigator.

226
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,117
Do you get it?

227
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,119
-Do you?
-Yes, ma'am.

228
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,289
What do you think?

229
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,749
Do I look good?

230
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,132
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

231
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,843
JEONG DA-SOM
SUPREME PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

232
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,904
What are you doing?
This is the police agency.

233
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,238
So?

234
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,365
You're posing as a civil servant.

235
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,784
So what?

236
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,369
It's a crime.

237
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,290
Just turn a blind eye then.
Are we good now?

238
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,709
How can I turn a blind eye?

239
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,088
Don't you know why I'm doing this?

240
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,799
It's because of the police.

241
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,261
If the police didn't fabricate the case,

242
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,139
I wouldn't have to make this sacrifice.

243
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,558
Don't you agree?

244
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,602
Whatever the reason, this is wrong.

245
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,562
You can't do this.

246
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,564
You're so frustrating.

247
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,237
Listen carefully,
Lieutenant Kim Myung-hyun.

248
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,782
I'm not doing this just for me.

249
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,952
I'm a bait

250
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,537
to catch President Park of One Line.

251
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,623
Because President Park

252
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,417
is Assemblyman Kwon Hyuk-jang's
new head sponsor.

253
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,461
What do you mean?

254
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:48,797
Don't you get it?

255
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,843
GK planned this
to make Kwon Hyuk-jang fall.

256
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,553
Why?

257
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,225
Because GK chose Yoo Byung-jun.

258
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,185
This is

259
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,605
a game of kingmaker.

260
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,653
Are you here to turn yourself in?

261
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,325
To confess about
the industrial technology leakage, right?

262
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,077
Salute!

263
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,039
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

264
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,459
This case is confidential,
so a special department has been set up.

265
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,720
Hey! Excuse me.

266
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,388
Hey!

267
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,562
What are you guys doing?
Get out of the way.

268
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,938
Jeez.

269
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,148
Move it.

270
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,151
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Salute.

271
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,030
The violent crimes team lost the evidence.
It was a contact lens.

272
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,699
So we're conducting a search operation.

273
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,952
The violent crimes team lost
a contact lense?

274
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,746
-Yes.
-A lens for your eyes?

275
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,790
You stupid punk. I'll talk to you later.

276
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,377
Get out of the way!

277
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,963
-Make way!
-Sorry, sir.

278
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,924
-Okay. Stop.
-Excuse me, sir.

279
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,093
-Jeez.
-Move!

280
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,973
PRESS MATERIAL

281
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,114
-Salute.
-Salute.

282
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,116
Can I check the footage for the hallway?

283
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,912
Well, an error occurred 30 minutes ago.

284
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,915
-It hasn't been recording at all.
-What?

285
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,919
SECURITY ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

286
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,299
-Myung-hyun.
-Yes?

287
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,054
What are you doing here?

288
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,474
-Well, I…
-What will you do with that bug?

289
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,935
That's evidence of a crime.

290
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,688
You know that it can't leave the room.

291
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,486
If that stays here,

292
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,197
I'll pretend that
I was never in this room.

293
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,742
But you're already in here.

294
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,914
I don't want to make excuses or lie.
I won't.

295
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,835
Let's

296
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,712
just do what we think is right.

297
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,425
I'll go my way. You go yours.

298
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,136
Myung-hyun.

299
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,223
I'm sorry.

300
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,607
CHIEF JEONG DAE-SANG

301
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,823
Did you give orders
to the conscripted policemen?

302
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,616
Yes.

303
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,912
I heard that spectacle news

304
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,624
from An Se-jin
of the industrial technology team.

305
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,587
-Did you?
-It looks like

306
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,299
you're giving An Se-jin a hard time
on purpose.

307
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:23,845
I'm not.

308
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,099
What is it? Why are you doing that?

309
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,234
I found the contact lens.

310
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,528
It contains the fingerprint

311
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,740
and the DNA of a murder suspect,
which were collected at the scene.

312
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,535
I accidentally dropped it on the stairs,
but fortunately,

313
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,079
I found them before it was contaminated.

314
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,878
Have you been working
on a Violent Crimes case?

315
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,881
I told you not to be distracted.

316
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,259
I wanted you to thoroughly investigate
the Gyeonggi highway accident,

317
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,970
so I sent you to the Traffic Division.

318
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,766
It's obvious

319
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,228
that you're ignoring my generosity, right?

320
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,023
Captain Lee Min-kyu
has been asking me for help.

321
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,193
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,906
From now on, I'll say no to him at once.
I'm serious.

323
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,513
Yes?

324
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,975
Hey. Come in.

325
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,852
You have the video, right?

326
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,896
What is it?

327
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,150
Well, the surveillance camera is old,
so it hasn't been recording

328
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,279
for the past few hours.

329
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,321
What?

330
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,074
It's a total disaster.

331
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,618
This is a police agency,
not a supermarket.

332
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,413
Come in!

333
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,041
Okay. You can leave.

334
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,336
Hey, Captain Lee.

335
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,298
Don't you dare lie to me.

336
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,925
What's with the contacts?

337
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,721
Well, I asked Detective Kim for help
with the case

338
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,391
because he has a great hunch.

339
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,272
I'll leave you now.

340
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,446
Have some snacks too.

341
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,704
But that goes well with soju.
I'm drinking beer.

342
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:58,207
Didn't you say it goes well with both?

343
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,960
Did I?

344
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,807
-Thanks for the snack.
-Where's mine?

345
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,732
You're so clueless.

346
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,692
What?

347
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,195
I didn't say anything.

348
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,239
Do you want something to eat?

349
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,450
Yes, a big chocolate milk.

350
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,417
It doesn't smell like a police car.

351
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,587
Hey. Excuse me.

352
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,675
Are you guys trying to trick me?

353
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,761
Jeez. Fine.

354
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,392
KIM JUN-BEOM
POLICE AGENCY

355
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,862
Jin Gounam didn't show up.

356
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,627
The Chinese spy didn't turn himself in.

357
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,229
I'm sorry.

358
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:47,025
The announcement of
the industrial spy investigation results

359
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,737
has been delayed due to problems
in the investigation process.

360
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,240
I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

361
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,516
Where did it go wrong?

362
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,148
There's not enough evidence
with just Yoo Mi-young and the USB.

363
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,108
We can't send Cha Joo-eun to China!

364
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,778
If we can't send her to China,

365
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,280
we can't get Kwon Hyuk-jang.

366
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,199
Understood?

367
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,421
Focus.

368
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,756
Name.

369
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,175
Jin Gounam.

370
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,885
Jin Gounam.

371
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:05,686
So these dozens of phone calls

372
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,648
were with Cha Joo-eun?

373
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,233
Well…

374
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,860
I guess so.

375
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,823
Answer properly, you bastard.

376
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,242
Stop mumbling like a baby!

377
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,498
Listen carefully, Mr. Jin Gounam.

378
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:30,419
We're doing this to help you.

379
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,922
Tell me the truth.

380
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,133
You're a hired actor, right?

381
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,220
You're acting right now,

382
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,596
aren't you?

383
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,151
Let's live righteously

384
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,653
and create a world without lies.

385
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,824
I have absolutely no idea.

386
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:04,162
I mean, this all happened so fast,
out of the blue.

387
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,081
Was it him?

388
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,210
Take a good look.

389
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,671
This asshole

390
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,923
is a serial killer.

391
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,135
Do you know how many people he's killed?

392
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,304
Ten.

393
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,766
You're right.

394
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,521
Yes. That bastard put me up to this.

395
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,570
Get on a ship and leave this instant.

396
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,908
If you don't,
the serial killer might really kill you.

397
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,952
-Answer her.
-Yes, ma'am.

398
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:49,040
Yes, ma'am. I'll keep that in mind.

399
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,590
Kim Myung-hyun, that bastard.
I can't seem to control him.

400
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,887
Did I choose the wrong chess piece?

401
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,767
By the way, where the hell
did that Chinese spy disappear to?

402
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,310
Damn it.

403
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,272
Peel and mince them.

404
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,317
Gosh, this is too much.

405
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,320
Come on, this is way too much.

406
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,950
The rice soup isn't free.

407
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,287
Right. It isn't.

408
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,248
Of course, I should do this.

409
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,540
Is there more?

410
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,750
Yes, a lot.

411
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,379
Actually, never mind.
This is more than enough.

412
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,798
They'll rot if we prepare too many
at once.

413
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,656
Mr. Woo.

414
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,533
Did you catch him?

415
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,245
Our pursuit team looked
through all the CCTV footage

416
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,705
but failed to locate him.

417
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:15,334
I don't think he escaped
through an official route.

418
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,794
Then what could it be?

419
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,549
I believe he's stowing away on a ship.

420
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,633
Understand?

421
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,306
What do you think
about my outstanding inference?

422
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,557
Look, Mr. Woo.

423
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,184
Have you ever stowed away on a ship?

424
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,020
Why would I do such a thing?

425
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,815
It's not as simple
as purchasing an amusement park ticket.

426
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,694
It's not something you can do
on short notice.

427
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,029
And one more thing.

428
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,908
These days, it's easier to make
a fake passport than to find a stowaway.

429
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,786
So get comfy in your chair
and keep searching for him.

430
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,081
Even if you spot a fly,
don't get distracted.

431
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,416
If he gets away,

432
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,003
I'll make sure to look into
whose fault this is.

433
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,841
What the hell is he saying?

434
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,969
Does he think he can intimidate me?

435
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,475
Is he in a sauna or something?
Why was there so much echo?

436
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,174
-Get in line.
-Okay.

437
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,401
Aren't you with the police?
Do I really need to go this far?

438
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,362
I told you. This case is confidential.

439
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,532
And please stop talking.

440
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,704
Korea is a great country.

441
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,581
Do you speak Chinese?

442
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,003
Impressive.

443
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:37,977
Yes, sir.

444
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,813
I'll send you the locations
from the nearest to the farthest.

445
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,356
Check them in that order.

446
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:43,983
Yes, sir.

447
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,951
Step on it.

448
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:09,675
Yes?

449
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,052
They're here. You better hurry.

450
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,220
Got it.

451
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,931
You four, go that way. Let's go.

452
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,155
I'll give you this money.
Swap places with me.

453
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,865
-Sure.
-Thank you.

454
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,949
No problem.

455
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,543
Over there. And you come with me.

456
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,388
Where is he?

457
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,974
-Did you find him?
-No, sir.

458
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,236
Get them!

459
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,822
If you keep failing like this,

460
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,450
what am I supposed to do?

461
00:42:59,034 --> 00:42:59,952
I'm sorry, sir.

462
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,622
Do you want to lose your job?

463
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,429
I saw him get on the ship.

464
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,557
Well done.

465
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,434
By the way,

466
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:27,938
how did you know
that this was Kim Jae-wook's scheme?

467
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,860
Because he taught me this a long time ago.

468
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,991
Are you okay?

469
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,826
I'm fine.

470
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,538
Nothing happened. Really.

471
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,248
I'm fine.

472
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,709
I'm relieved.

473
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,587
I'll see you soon then.

474
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,504
Okay.

475
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,479
GK Technology Innovative Vision Room?

476
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,526
I thought it was disbanded.

477
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,989
I believe you called me over
because you knew it wasn't.

478
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,286
It seems

479
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,457
you deliberately approached Mr. Park.

480
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:55,836
What do you say?

481
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,964
May I hear your excuse?

482
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,646
GK chose Yoo Byung-jun?

483
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,356
Yes, Assemblyman Kwon.

484
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,067
I mean, Director Kwon.

485
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,780
In order to bring down Mr. Park,
your head sponsor,

486
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,950
they executed the industrial spy scheme.

487
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,163
They want to frame him as a traitor
who sold our technology to China,

488
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,374
so the media will chew you and him out
until the election is over.

489
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,211
Even if you replace him, feign ignorance,

490
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,795
and hold out until the end,

491
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,382
we all know how the election will end.

492
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,551
That's quite persuasive.

493
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,304
Then…

494
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,933
you must have an alternative.

495
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,019
You wouldn't have set up this meeting

496
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,563
if you didn't have one.

497
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,238
First,

498
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,407
Cha Joo-eun, the owner
of Spy detective agency,

499
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,701
needs to be proven innocent.

500
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:13,330
If the industrial technology leakage
is proven to be false,

501
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,915
their plan

502
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,044
won't be able to succeed.

503
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,672
So

504
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,383
how will you do that?

505
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,394
Let her in.

506
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,573
It's nice to meet you, sir.
I'm Cha Joo-eun.

507
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,825
Have a seat, please.

508
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,175
You used that phone to
communicate with Cha Joo-eun.

509
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:16,977
What is this?

510
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,689
That's the burner phone you used
to communicate with me.

511
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,363
And I'm an investor who was interested
in One Line's core technology,

512
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,198
flexible display.

513
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,452
I don't follow you.

514
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,038
I see.

515
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,708
Mr. Park was just trying to persuade you
to invest in us,

516
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,169
so all he did was explain
what the technology was.

517
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,087
Is that it?

518
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,048
Yes, that's exactly it.

519
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:47,799
Then

520
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,011
what about my Mi-young?

521
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,557
I'm sorry, sir.

522
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,352
About her…

523
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,525
Ms. Yoo Mi-young, you can come out.

524
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,404
Hurry up, will you?

525
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,824
You need to sue her

526
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,577
for conning you.

527
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,415
Ms. Yoo Mi-young, you're under arrest
without a warrant for fraud.

528
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,085
You have the right to an attorney
and to remain silent.

529
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,838
Whatever you say out of anger
may be used against you in a court of law.

530
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,803
Hey, Detective Kim. What are you doing?

531
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,681
Why the hell are you taking my suspect?

532
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,600
There's a new charge, buddy.

533
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,269
Mr. Park and his investor are coming
as we speak.

534
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,604
What?

535
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,411
Investment?

536
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,248
You were going to invest
in a company that makes

537
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,293
cutting-edge industrial products?
You, Ms. Cha?

538
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,379
What's that tone of voice?

539
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,340
Are you looking down on my job?

540
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,887
I'm not getting the wrong idea
right now, am I?

541
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,936
I'm awfully offended.

542
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,232
The police segregating, discriminating,
and looking down on the citizens?

543
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,154
Fine, then.

544
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,281
So, how much?

545
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,908
How much were you going to invest?

546
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,753
I was going to invest
about ten billion won.

547
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,130
I trust my daughter's judgment.

548
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,757
Thanks for believing in me, Mom.

549
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,176
I'm doing well, right?

550
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,470
Of course. You're my daughter, after all.

551
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,182
Fine. That's great.

552
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,268
However, you're still guilty
of running away.

553
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,228
Right.

554
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,606
LAWYER OH HYUN-KYUNG

555
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,901
You can talk to my lawyer about that.

556
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,573
It's been a long time.

557
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,534
You're right. What is this about?

558
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,953
What do you think?

559
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,749
Of course, it's business-related.

560
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:26,958
Is that so?

561
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,961
What? Don't you believe me?

562
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:34,591
Right. Our relationship
has always been business-related.

563
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,677
I want to hire you for a case.

564
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,059
What is this?

565
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,268
"Law firm"?

566
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,395
"Law firm"? Am I right?

567
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,290
What's this?

568
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,972
OH HYUN-KYUNG

569
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,310
Look at these two.

570
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,188
This is ridiculous.

571
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,535
Why did you do it?

572
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,787
What do you mean?

573
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,164
Why did you join GK?

574
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,965
It was my lifelong dream
to work for a conglomerate.

575
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,219
And I finally made it.

576
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:06,016
When will I finally get to know

577
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,936
your true face?

578
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,105
Gosh, I feel hurt.

579
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,609
I've always been truthful with you.

580
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:20,196
Oh, my. Then it all must have been
a misunderstanding.

581
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,619
Are you bored?

582
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,412
What?

583
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,831
You've been glancing at your watch.

584
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,878
I have an appointment.

585
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,256
All right, then.

586
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,676
Damn it.

587
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,270
Gosh.

588
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,538
It's me.

589
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,792
I'm afraid we'll have to look
for another lawyer.

590
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,670
I'll find you a better one.

591
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,380
It can't be helped then.

592
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,798
Okay.

593
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,763
I can change my lawyer, right?

594
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,238
Hello.

595
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,074
This is Oh Hyun-kyung from O&S Law Firm.

596
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,536
Are you really Ms. Cha Joo-eun's lawyer?

597
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,706
That's correct. She's my client.

598
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,917
Okay.

599
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,096
What's going on?

600
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,893
That bitch agreed to do it?

601
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,521
What do you say? Should I accept?

602
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,652
Why aren't you answering?

603
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,280
Fine.

604
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,532
I don't see why you shouldn't

605
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,285
when she's up for it.

606
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,204
Let her do it.

607
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,421
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

608
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,719
-Did he call?
-What?

609
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:52,057
Your dad. He was discharged last week.

610
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,018
I didn't want to seem tacky

611
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:59,230
by welcoming him with tofu so I didn't go.

612
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,233
But now, I can't seem to locate him.

613
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,780
He must've called you, though.

614
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,824
No, he didn't.

615
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,119
You know how I was recently.

616
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,540
I was a lonely fugitive
with a burner phone.

617
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,463
Mom.

618
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,342
Yes?

619
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,140
Do you think

620
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,976
we could live like we used to?

621
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,146
You, Dad, and me.

622
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,774
-Us three.
-That's not

623
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,071
-important right now.
-What?

624
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:52,617
We must stop this case from going to trial
no matter what.

625
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,287
You've already been to prison once.

626
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:11,052
It'd be nice if you could call them
and put an end to this.

627
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,765
To talk about the call you received
regarding the made-up investigation.

628
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:20,103
So you want me to tell the police

629
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,647
how to do their job?

630
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,984
Please, sir.

631
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,821
This case shouldn't be brought to trial.

632
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:37,996
Then don't you think
this deal would only be fair

633
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,584
if I set a condition as well?

634
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:49,174
I'd like you to work for me from now on.

635
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,136
I don't mean joining my camp.

636
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,763
I'd like you to be covert.

637
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,852
You know what "clandestine" means,

638
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:01,769
don't you?

639
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,496
You've already been to prison once.

640
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,374
Hello.

641
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,463
I won't say

642
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,341
that I lost a bet to my friends
or came to give you

643
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,634
the beauty you dropped.

644
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,136
But I'll make you smile in five minutes.

645
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,388
Are you a comedian?

646
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,390
What? You shouldn't be smiling so soon.

647
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,768
I smiled back then as well.

648
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,728
I knew you would.

649
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,773
Look at that confidence.

650
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,403
What is it?

651
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,948
Did it not work out?

652
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,826
That's not it. It went well.

653
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,499
I'm sorry you have to stay at motels.

654
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:09,128
Please be patient until the case
is closed completely.

655
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,257
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

656
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,384
I'm more worried about you.

657
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,723
What are you going to do
about Assemblyman Kwon's offer?

658
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,601
I'll have to take it

659
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,145
since your safety is on the line.

660
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,149
Don't worry.

661
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,985
It'll all work out.

662
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,736
Okay.

663
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,239
I trust you.

664
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,411
Go in first.
I need to see Yoon-seok first.

665
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,375
-Don't be too long.
-Okay.

666
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,426
Everyone who's involved right now.

667
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,303
Take care of them yourself.

668
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,681
And if I can't? Will you kill Cha Joo-eun?

669
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:28,434
Jeong-hwan. You can come back to GK.

670
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,561
I'm going to stay by your side.

671
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,232
It's a totally different world.
We'll suffocate there.

672
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,569
We're going to continue with our plan
to get back at Kim Jae-wook, right?

673
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,030
Of course.
That's what I live for every day.

674
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:44,951
I was going to leave,
but I seemed to have dropped something.

675
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,494
Who has it?

676
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:50,415
Can you show me President Choi's ledger?

677
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:56,587
