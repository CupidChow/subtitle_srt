1
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,886
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,561
Stop, Lee Jeong-hwan!

4
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,286
There's another important factor
to consider. My approval rating.

5
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,000
After Kwon Hyuk-jang's death,

6
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,212
his supporters won't find
a better alternative and will join you.

7
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,923
We expect you to achieve this rating.

8
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,302
After that, you will win sympathy votes
from your fiancée's death.

9
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,972
This approval rating reflects
the party's consensus.

10
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,310
And who will be my fiancée?

11
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,688
Sophia Chung, the PR Team Manager.

12
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,610
I've already prepared an article
about a private wedding ceremony.

13
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,904
After it gets published online,

14
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,990
it'll be handed off to TV stations
and media agencies.

15
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,702
We just need you to choose
the cause of death.

16
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,040
Number four.
Robbery resulted in murder sounds good.

17
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,878
Yes, sir. I'll set it up accordingly.

18
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,891
-Poong-yeon!
-Don't come in here. Don't.

19
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,484
What about Cha Joo-eun?

20
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,741
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

21
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,246
Can you stand up?

22
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,472
She will save multiple lives

23
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,058
by donating her organs.

24
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,896
What do you think?

25
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,189
It sounds perfect.

26
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,817
Good. Proceed.

27
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,112
-Good work.
-Thank you.

28
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,503
What? What are you doing?

29
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,053
Drop your gun.

30
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,653
Don't do this, Mr. Lee.

31
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,447
Cuff yourself to him.

32
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,543
-The key.
-What key?

33
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,211
For the handcuffs!

34
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,672
Damn it.

35
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,249
Assemblyman Kwon is dead?

36
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,211
To be precise, he was murdered.

37
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,393
As soon as Assemblyman Kwon was murdered,
I was kidnapped.

38
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,604
And the police pursued you.

39
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,066
How can all of this happen simultaneously?

40
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,650
It's scripted.

41
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,529
We are being forced into a scenario
that's already been set up.

42
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,908
How dare they pull us into a movie?

43
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,913
Who do you think is behind it?

44
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,542
GK?

45
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,963
Can't you reach it?
It's right there. Come on, try harder.

46
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,465
What's happening?

47
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,093
Hey. Uncuff us first. And talk later.

48
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,260
Damn it.

49
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,722
-What happened?
-Lee Jeong-hwan is wanted.

50
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,850
Guess what his charge is.

51
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,895
Murder of Kwon Hyuk-jang. Crazy, right?

52
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,314
I couldn't believe
a dead person was wanted.

53
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,899
But it turned out he's alive.

54
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,612
I guess the higher-ups already knew.
So that's the update.

55
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,907
It's shocking to find out he's alive,
but killing an assemblyman?

56
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,661
That man, Lee Jeong-hwan,
has a complicated life.

57
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,998
-Maybe he's a spy.
-Maybe he is.

58
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,043
Who ordered you to pursue him?

59
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,628
Who do you think? It was the chief.

60
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,924
Jeong-hwan.

61
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,135
You're being charged for

62
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,846
document forgery and insurance fraud.

63
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,516
Right now, you're a wanted man
for Kwon Hyuk-jang's murder.

64
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:18,354
Officers will be offered a promotion,
and the citizens will be offered a reward.

65
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,274
It will be hard to live in Korea
as a fugitive.

66
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,234
You must find another way.

67
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,486
My colleagues moved in on you

68
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,197
because Chief Jeong Dae-sang ordered them.

69
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,866
Okay.

70
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,953
And you have an accomplice.

71
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,582
Kim Jae-wook is also a wanted man

72
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,460
for Kwon Hyuk-jang's murder.

73
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,217
Please look into
Kwon Hyuk-jang's inner circle.

74
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,512
Okay.

75
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,560
Why Kim Jae-wook?

76
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,815
He's been betrayed, too.

77
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,819
Chief Jeong Dae-sang

78
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,656
used to be Kim Jae-wook's inside man.

79
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,408
Why would he do that?

80
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,786
-Are you sure?
-Her body was completely swollen

81
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,872
and bits of her were eaten by the fish.

82
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,083
But we found her ID card.

83
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,884
Jeong Dae-sang.

84
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,934
All right. Now,

85
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,186
it's time to negotiate.

86
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,567
If I take care of this case neatly,

87
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,487
I'll be working in the Blue House.

88
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,452
I see. Good for you.

89
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,413
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.

90
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,875
But the thing is,
now that I'm heading over there,

91
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,503
there are so many people
I have to go say hi to.

92
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,296
So…

93
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,299
since you're pretty much done for anyway,

94
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,346
can't you leave me
all the money that you've saved up?

95
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,184
You won't be able to spend it.
It's a waste, you know. Right?

96
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,645
Well,

97
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,732
that depends on your answer.

98
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,401
You know me. I would…

99
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,781
Can't you tell
that the tables have turned now?

100
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,910
I don't like the tone of your voice.

101
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,415
Fine. What is the question?

102
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,085
Who's behind this?

103
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,546
What are you talking about?

104
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:54,343
You are being arrested
for murdering an assemblyman.

105
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,929
Murder of Assemblyman Kwon Hyuk-jang.

106
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,016
Did you not know?

107
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,893
How? You killed him.

108
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,899
Is it the Vision Room?

109
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,988
The Vision Room must be

110
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,741
the ones who promised you a promotion.

111
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,952
If you know the answers, why ask?

112
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,537
Yes.

113
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,375
The Vision Room promised to send me
to the Blue House if I arrest you.

114
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,464
As you know,
I'm qualified for the position.

115
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,679
What have I been doing all this time?

116
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,725
Are you regretting
your life choices all of a sudden?

117
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,937
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and tell me where the money is.

118
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,066
You'll give it to me anyway.
Make it quick. Okay?

119
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,402
-Vivian, attack him.
-What?

120
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,476
Shit.

121
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,649
-Call.
-Who should I call?

122
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,234
Director Kim Sang-man.

123
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:37,780
I'll go back and get ready to mourn.

124
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,658
Okay. I won't see you off.

125
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,456
Pardon? Could you repeat that?

126
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,333
Who should I call?

127
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,878
Kim Sang-man.

128
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,296
Call him!

129
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey, Deputy Chief Kim.

130
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,184
Did you hear the news?

131
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,228
What news?

132
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,398
Assemblyman Kwon has passed away.

133
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,150
Oh, that?

134
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,360
I did hear that.

135
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,237
Who ordered the hit?

136
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,906
We'll have to see.

137
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,033
Did you order it?

138
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,787
Why did you do it?

139
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,003
They say that the ends justify the means.

140
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,630
Then, who killed him?

141
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,632
We'll know once we catch them.

142
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,551
Is it me and Jeong-hwan?

143
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,220
Do you think so?

144
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,891
Did you kill him with Lee Jeong-hwan?

145
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,228
Oh, my. Why would you do
something so reckless?

146
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,190
You just wait. I'll make you regret it.

147
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,610
Suit yourself.

148
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,413
Damn those stupid cops.

149
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,541
What about Jeong Yoon-kyung?

150
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,586
What is this?

151
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,130
Haven't we met before?

152
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,633
I see.

153
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,011
Yes, we have. You with the scar.

154
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,804
I definitely remember seeing you.

155
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,396
Where are you guys from?
You're not from UI.

156
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,399
I don't think you're from GK, either.

157
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,278
You must be subcontractors
that work for GK.

158
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,279
Am I right?

159
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,825
Wait. Hold on.

160
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,994
How much do you want?

161
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,997
How much money do you need
to smooth things out between us?

162
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,582
Stay right there.

163
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,168
I took it from the cinerarium
in case this would happen.

164
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,045
I guess I called it.

165
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,672
Come here, Poong-yeon.

166
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,715
Don't you move, asshole.

167
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,385
-Do you even know how to fire a gun?
-Come here.

168
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,220
Go ahead.

169
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,515
Do it.

170
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,393
Let's go.

171
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,819
Don't just stand there. Get them!

172
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,908
Are you okay?

173
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,291
You bastard!

174
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,495
What's going on?

175
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,415
Who sent the thugs to the hotel?

176
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,754
You ordered the hit,
then you beat them up.

177
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,130
What are you trying to pull?

178
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,257
Why would I do that?

179
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,927
I didn't order it.

180
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,970
Then, who?

181
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,225
Whose side are you on?

182
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,103
Edward, you…

183
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,275
Why do you keep switching sides?
What do you want?

184
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,612
Don't you know why?
It's because you're my weakness.

185
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,992
I can't do anything
when you're next to me.

186
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,828
I can't afford to be vulnerable.

187
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,747
You don't know

188
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,751
what I've been through to get this far.

189
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,712
I've put up with so much shit to get here.

190
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,759
I can't waste all of that because of you.

191
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,677
So why?

192
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,892
I kept showing you my destructive side
so you could take the hint,

193
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,018
but why?

194
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,689
I'm begging you.

195
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,859
Get away from me. Please.

196
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,611
You saved me.

197
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,116
I was truly grateful to you,
you son of bitch!

198
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,162
Is this that hard on you?

199
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,581
Fine.

200
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,626
I'll end it for you.

201
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,756
The end.

202
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,293
How did it go?

203
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,336
Well…

204
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,380
What is it?

205
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,925
Lee Jeong-hwan, Cha Joo-eun,
Kim Jae-wook, and Jeong Yoon-kyung.

206
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,011
We couldn't capture any of them.

207
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,183
Our men are still after them.

208
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,435
I'm sure they'll give us
the good news soon.

209
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,606
Put me through
to NSO's Counterterrorism Unit.

210
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,900
Pardon?

211
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,819
-One more bottle.
-We're closing for the day.

212
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,905
-Please leave.
-What?

213
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,406
Give me your cell phone and ID.

214
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,618
-Sir, please leave.
-Why do you need to see my ID?

215
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,166
Why are you doing this? This is crazy.

216
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,419
Do something.

217
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,379
Give us your cell phones.

218
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,095
Quickly.

219
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,516
What's going on?

220
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,187
What are you doing in my office?

221
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,611
What? Who are you?

222
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,989
Why are you taking that?

223
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,076
Mr. Choi Yoon-seok.
Turn in your cell phone.

224
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,254
Okay. Keep tracking the ones you missed

225
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,923
and keep the rest in custody
so they can't do anything.

226
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,728
I'm with the police.

227
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,491
Detective Kim?

228
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,914
So he passed away.

229
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,000
Do you know how he…

230
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,211
Did he suffer from a chronic illness?

231
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,297
I think

232
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,508
he was murdered.

233
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,554
How did they do it?

234
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,472
Pardon?

235
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,726
I mean, how was he murdered?

236
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,397
I don't know. I just found him dead.

237
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,530
Ms. Im Jeong-won?

238
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,575
-Yes, that's me.
-Please come with us.

239
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,797
Okay. Got it.

240
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,887
NSO is keeping it under control.

241
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,139
Our team also took control over the site.

242
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,244
What will you do?

243
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,206
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

244
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:53,502
I think a general who lost his horse
has two choices.

245
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,879
He either gets a new horse

246
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,841
or stays out of the battlefield.

247
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,096
So what will it be, Ms. Oh?

248
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,729
Long time no see.

249
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,691
-Yes, it's been a while.
-Please take a seat.

250
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,822
You're still here.
Would you please leave us?

251
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,792
First, let's get these two culprits,

252
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,961
Lee Jeong-hwan and Kim Jae-wook.

253
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,963
If, by any chance,

254
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,468
they're involved with the higher-up,
it'll cause a serious problem.

255
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,179
All right.

256
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,349
I'll inform the boss.

257
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,979
It's me, sir.

258
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:58,400
We could set it up as an espionage story.

259
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,121
So,

260
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,084
GK's Kim Sang-man plotted this
all by himself.

261
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,963
He probably thought he couldn't
win against Kwon Hyuk-jang.

262
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,799
Kim Sang-man.

263
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,678
What does he want?

264
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,224
If he wants to be a kingmaker…

265
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,103
What's good about being a kingmaker?

266
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,773
For GK, it's--

267
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,940
No,

268
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,819
not for GK, but for Kim Sang-man himself.

269
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,574
You see, the first step in pulling a con

270
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,036
is to understand your target's needs
as accurately as possible.

271
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,205
You need to know their wants,

272
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,708
their hopes, and their desires.

273
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,507
So?

274
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:11,348
So we need to find out
what exactly Kim Sang-man desires first.

275
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,368
What? Why did she bring him?

276
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,954
What the hell are you doing?

277
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,582
I killed the old Kim Jae-wook
and trashed him just now.

278
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,628
And this is the new and reformed
Edward Kim.

279
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,719
So you want to join us
because Kim Sang-man backstabbed you.

280
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,222
That I understand.

281
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,810
And I need someone like you
in this situation.

282
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,398
But I think we've come too far
to join hands.

283
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,984
Just leave.

284
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,862
This is the only kindness I can show you.

285
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,489
I can vouch for him.

286
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,615
No!

287
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,868
I don't trust you either.

288
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,746
Okay, fine.

289
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,040
Hear me out first.

290
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,377
I'll tell you something

291
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,171
very important.

292
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,974
Uncle.

293
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,441
All right.

294
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,860
Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone.

295
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,573
Why is that so important?

296
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,748
We got in this mess
after his phone came to light

297
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,671
because it contains pictures
of those who shouldn't be photographed.

298
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,342
Jeong-hwan and Joo-eun
should already know about it.

299
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,185
From the start,
that case was questionable.

300
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,105
Why did it have to be them?

301
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,775
Why did Yoo Byung-jun
indict President Choi?

302
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,320
He had an amicable relationship
with President Choi.

303
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,907
Why? Why did he have to
get rid of President Choi?

304
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,870
What if someone more powerful
was behind him?

305
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,756
President Choi.

306
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,759
I think you should get
your hands off this case.

307
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,512
FORMER PRESIDENT
LEE GEUN-HWAN

308
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,597
Something bad is going to happen.

309
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,353
Mr. President. Please spare me.

310
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,439
Please spare me, Mr. President.

311
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,567
That's right.
Jeong Hyeon-cheol took pictures

312
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,321
of former President Lee Geun-hwan.

313
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:19,077
In the end, they killed President Choi

314
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,957
and directed it
to make it look like a suicide.

315
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:29,629
And from him, from UI Construction,
they took the right to develop a new city.

316
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,673
Why?

317
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,553
In return for offering the proceeds
from the development of a new city…

318
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,557
Mr. President.

319
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,643
…he was promised
the future succession of GK.

320
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,564
This is my youngest son
who's like a firstborn.

321
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,940
Lee Geun-hwan.

322
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,651
I see. He's very handsome.

323
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,487
When he became the president, that year…

324
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,156
Thank you.

325
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,783
…GK achieved
a perfect succession of their management

326
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,245
through outrageous mergers
and stock price manipulation.

327
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,457
It was only possible
with the government's help.

328
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,670
Right?

329
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,527
Former President Lee Geun-hwan.

330
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,989
I was going to hand it over

331
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,617
to Kwon Hyuk-jang today.

332
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,620
They must've known that
and set today as the day.

333
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,499
So they killed Kwon Hyuk-jang
because of Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone.

334
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,126
But

335
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,088
how did they know in advance?

336
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,425
Only Kwon Hyuk-jang and we knew…

337
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,807
They must have a mole.

338
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,600
A mole.

339
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,394
By now…

340
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,896
If Kim Sang-man killed Kwon Hyuk-jang,

341
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,399
they're the ones in biggest danger.

342
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,239
BREAKING NEWS

343
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,825
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
KWON HYUK-JANG MURDERED

344
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,618
At around 9 p.m.,

345
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,246
we've reported the death
of Kwon Hyuk-jang,

346
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,748
the leader of the Reformed Conservative
Party and a presidential candidate.

347
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,919
Based on the news coming in now,
he seems to have been murdered.

348
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,088
We will listen to the spokesman's
announcement.

349
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:43,012
We deeply mourn the death
of Assemblyman Kwon Hyuk-jang,

350
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:47,475
who was our colleague, the leader of
our party, and a presidential candidate.

351
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,479
May he rest in peace.

352
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,814
CONSERVATIVE REFORM PARTY

353
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,276
Our party will not nominate
another candidate.

354
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,986
Without a primary election,

355
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,823
Candidate Yoo Byung-jun
will run for president alone.

356
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,454
Are the suspects Lee Jeong-hwan
and Kim Jae-wook

357
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,582
really North Korean spies
as the rumors say?

358
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,008
Where are you going?

359
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,100
Don't you have something to tell me?

360
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,945
All right.

361
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,123
Your mother's surgery went well.

362
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,086
It was difficult to get the kidney,
so you should always be grateful.

363
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,506
Thank you.

364
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,301
Now you should
keep your end of the bargain.

365
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,421
She's leaving now.

366
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,424
Okay.

367
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,756
Kim Sang-man…

368
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,718
Let's go. We got the evidence.

369
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,044
Five million was wired
to Im Jeong-won's husband's account.

370
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,965
It looks like she gave away
Kwon Hyuk-jang's planned route in return.

371
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,381
Myung-hyun!

372
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,093
I'm okay.

373
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,554
-Oh, no.
-Wait.

374
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,563
LEE JEONG-HWAN

375
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,317
He went in the direction
of 12-4 Gamasan-ro.

376
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,945
Okay. Is everything all right?

377
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,364
Okay.

378
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,408
What did he say?

379
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,453
12-4 Gamasan-ro.

380
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,583
It's that way.

381
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,762
This time it was me who didn't realize

382
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,972
that someone was tailing me.

383
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,892
I'm sorry.

384
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,605
Should I quit being a cop

385
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,399
and run a detective agency?

386
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,489
Do you want to join me?

387
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,961
What?

388
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,843
Ms. Im!

389
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,597
Ms. Im. Hang in there.

390
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,482
It's been 15 days now.

391
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,780
Where and what could he be doing?

392
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,291
They don't even bother
to disguise themselves.

393
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,210
They keep an eye on me in plain sight.

394
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,130
That's what drives me even crazier.

395
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,764
PORK RIBS APLENTY

396
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,788
If Jeong-hwan were
to ever reach out to me,

397
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,915
it would be…

398
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,834
here.

399
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,941
Are you awake?

400
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,193
One minute.

401
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,383
Do you recognize me?

402
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,972
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Choi Yong-jin from UI.

403
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,515
UI TELECOM
CHOI KYUNG-HWAN'S SECOND SON

404
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,644
I took the chopper here
when I heard you had woken up.

405
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,233
May I sit down?

406
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,447
I'm sorry for the rough greeting.

407
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,618
But you know, I'm not too fond of you.

408
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,828
I hope you understand.

409
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,126
I told him I didn't mind
if you ended up crippled,

410
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,712
but I guess Han Son is more softhearted
than I expected.

411
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,844
Right. I heard you married an employee
of ours, Ms. Cha Joo-eun.

412
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,471
You couldn't go on your honeymoon.

413
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,640
What a shame.

414
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,227
You should go.

415
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,147
Where would you like?

416
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,190
Puerto Escondido?

417
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,236
I'm just kidding.

418
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,825
Jeong-hwan.

419
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,162
I promise to send you off
on your honeymoon.

420
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,414
However,

421
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,835
there's one condition.

422
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,380
I want GK's Innovative Vision Room…

423
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,011
to be disbanded for good.

424
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,223
Come on in. It's here.

425
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,100
-Okay.
-Come on in.

426
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,936
You can all have some meat.

427
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,981
-Wait a minute. Come on in.
-This is nice.

428
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,776
Come in. This is for people from Mapo-gu.

429
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,943
Mapo-gu!

430
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,863
-Mapo-gu!
-Nowon-gu, go there.

431
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,074
-Here.
-Over here.

432
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,618
Aren't you famished?

433
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,496
It's on me today!

434
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,243
The NSO

435
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,995
lost track of Cha Joo-eun.

436
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,374
What should we do?

437
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,842
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

438
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,475
Lee Jeong-hwan.

439
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,401
Who the hell are you?

440
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,237
It's nice to meet you. I'm Cha Joo-eun.

441
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,708
Why would you come here?

442
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,668
Where's Jeong-hwan?

443
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,129
I'm not sure.

444
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,549
I wonder where my husband is.

445
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,468
I don't know either.

446
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,387
You're the one

447
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,849
who forced Jeong-hwan and me

448
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,352
to be apart.

449
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,732
A brat like you should watch
what she says.

450
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,069
You're nothing but a lowly conman.

451
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,695
Know your place.

452
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,988
A conman?

453
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:20,204
If you ask me, I think we're the same.

454
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:25,042
In fact, you're even worse
than I am in all aspects.

455
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,128
Unless you want your lips sewn shut,

456
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,381
I suggest you use your head
before talking.

457
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,383
But I am.

458
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,884
Very much so.

459
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,596
You're the only one
who refuses to accept the fact

460
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,265
that you're a two-bit conman.

461
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,145
Bring me Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone
this instant

462
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,606
if you don't want to die.

463
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,361
I'm barely keeping myself
from going batshit crazy

464
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,321
thanks to my virtuous character.

465
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,240
Got that?

466
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,951
Fine.

467
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,538
I should do that
since I don't want to die.

468
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,835
Here you go.

469
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,462
By the way,

470
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,300
you don't know what kinds of photos
are in here, do you?

471
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,015
You didn't know that
this phone has a photo of GK's chairman,

472
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,266
did you?

473
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,522
So I'm thinking about uploading
that photo on my online streaming channel.

474
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,901
Go ahead.

475
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,697
You should do as you please.

476
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,117
But you can't do that, can you?

477
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,160
Why?

478
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,080
Because such a photo doesn't exist.

479
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,214
So you're saying that GK's chairman
met with President Choi?

480
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,801
Well, isn't that just absurd?

481
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,555
How dare you try to trick me?

482
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:10,064
One phone call, and the NSO will arrive
in less than five minutes.

483
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:14,360
So hand over that phone
and get lost quietly.

484
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,237
How are you so confident?

485
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,907
How are you so sure?

486
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,744
Are you really sure
that this phone doesn't contain

487
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,955
a photo of GK's chairman?

488
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,958
Fine, then.

489
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,379
I'll upload this photo right away.

490
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,763
Do it.

491
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,099
Upload it.

492
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,735
Goodness.

493
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,946
You can't, can you?

494
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,619
How am I so sure, you asked?

495
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,295
Because our little chairman
can't do anything on his own.

496
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,465
He could only become the chairman
because of me.

497
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,927
Our young chairman can't do anything

498
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,804
on his own.

499
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,431
Understand?

500
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,182
I've built GK myself.

501
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,562
It was I, Kim Sang-man,
who made GK what it is today.

502
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,025
If it wasn't for me,
the merger and the succession

503
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,652
would have never happened.

504
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:44,074
What do you think would have happened
if I didn't kill President Choi?

505
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,953
He was one chatty geezer.

506
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,458
I protected GK! It was my work!

507
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,728
This is Jeong Hyeon-cheol's phone.

508
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,335
GK has welcomed a new president
and a vice-president today.

509
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,505
Aiming to develop the company more
in the future,

510
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,509
the former director, Oh Yeong-ju,
became the president of GK Technology.

511
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,512
The former vice-president
of GK Technology, Kim Sang-man,

512
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:51,141
became the managing director
of HIT Home Shopping, a subsidiary of GK.

513
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,185
He's practically been demoted.

514
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,489
Mr. Woo Seok-ho.

515
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,283
You are under arrest for violating

516
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,536
the Privacy Act,
assault, and other charges.

517
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,787
What?

518
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,581
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can

519
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,458
-be used against you in court.
-Hold on.

520
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,126
You have the right to an attorney.

521
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,670
Why would I need an attorney?

522
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,296
Hey, Mr. Lee.

523
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,423
Mr. Lee, I only did what I was told.

524
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,591
Mr. Lee!

525
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,510
What are you doing?

526
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,765
What a nice office,

527
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,601
Mr. Kim Sang-man.

528
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,399
How dare you cops set foot in here?

529
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,697
ARREST WARRANT

530
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,907
They issued the warrant
in the blink of an eye.

531
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,867
I guess your heyday is over.

532
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,164
"Inspection of civilians,
invasion of privacy,

533
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,749
contract killing…"

534
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,627
There are too many charges.

535
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,797
Take your time to read through it.

536
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,592
Hire an attorney
and remain quiet if you wish.

537
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,304
Anything blurted out in anger
can be used against you in court.

538
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,433
It's illegal to arrest someone
without any evidence.

539
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,895
The warrant wouldn't have been issued
without it.

540
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,612
It's all in here.

541
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,073
I've recorded every order you've given me

542
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,785
as a sort of insurance.

543
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,996
What are you doing?

544
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,874
Do you think you'll be safe

545
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,335
when they verify this?

546
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,881
We should both be punished.

547
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,635
How could you?

548
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,347
You can't do this to me.

549
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,059
I paid for your tuition and fed you.

550
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,853
Let's go.

551
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,831
Will the defendant please rise?

552
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:29,633
I will give out my ruling
for case 2020-HO-55446.

553
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,968
Defendant Kim Sang-man has been indicted

554
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,680
for invasion of privacy,
inspection of civilians, and more.

555
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:39,059
I sentence him to ten years in prison.

556
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,233
Will the defendant please rise?

557
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:56,076
I will give out my ruling
for case 2020-MA-33737.

558
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,372
Defendant Lee Jeong-hwan has been indicted
for the forgery of private documents,

559
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,334
obstruction of justice, and more.
I sentence him to five years in prison.

560
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,850
It has been revealed that GK has been

561
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,728
inspecting civilians
through their secret organization.

562
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,565
Through their secret organization called
GK Technology Innovative Vision Room,

563
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,901
GK has been collecting
personal information

564
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,987
of well-known individuals and civilians.

565
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,907
They have distorted and fabricated
the information they obtained illegally.

566
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,326
Once this came to light,
there was a public outcry

567
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,621
about this anti-democratic
infringement on personal rights.

568
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,584
The people are boycotting
all GK-related goods.

569
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,420
GK technology's shares
have decreased ten percent

570
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,464
and continue to plummet every day.

571
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,425
Detective Kim helped out a lot.

572
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,890
All right, then. I'll leave you to it.

573
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,622
I'm sorry.

574
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,292
Don't be.

575
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,797
You're the one who has it worse.

576
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,509
Joo-eun.

577
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,307
Thank you.

578
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,310
Me too.

579
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,985
I don't think I can leave you here.

580
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,476
3 YEARS LATER

581
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,861
This is Spy detective agency,
we do anything for our clients.

582
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,029
Yes, I'm listening.

583
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,616
We don't sell jajangmyeon!

584
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,828
Hey… They hung up.

585
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,123
Aren't you guys going to work?

586
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,543
This is so refreshing.

587
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,628
It feels as though
my soul is being massaged.

588
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,423
Stop hogging the chair.

589
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,675
You don't even help out
with the electricity bills.

590
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,720
What do you mean I don't help out?

591
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,180
I take care of most of the tasks
around here.

592
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,849
Don't you think so,

593
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,893
Tae-joo?

594
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,398
Don't you dare call me
with that creepy voice of yours.

595
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:16,359
Also, where's Ms. Cha?

596
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,986
Isn't it our payday?

597
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,573
Is Jeong-hwan being paroled today?

598
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,828
Delivery!

599
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,462
He came again.

600
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,007
I'm so sick of this.

601
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,762
I'm so sick of this as well. I really am.

602
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,266
It smells good.

603
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,976
How much was this?

604
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,186
It was 100,000 won.

605
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,773
Honey!

606
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,651
Goodness! Honey!

607
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,611
Sweetie…

608
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,862
I missed you.

609
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,989
-Goodness.
-You've grown a lot.

610
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,076
-Sweetie!
-Have you been well?

611
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,232
Jeong-hwan.

612
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,527
There's something I want to do.

613
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,570
What is it?

614
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,172
-You're here early.
-What took you so long?

615
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,717
Don't even get me started.
The traffic was terrible.

616
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,927
Was it? There were no cars.

617
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,804
Why am I so nervous?

618
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,264
It'll happen this time, right?

619
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,766
Of course. Don't be ridiculous.

620
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,645
We've been burned before.

621
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,106
No, I checked.

622
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,316
What a scaredy-cat. Smile.

623
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,484
Smile.

624
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,196
Breathe.

625
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,199
Don't be absurd.
Who has four kids in this day and age?

626
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,619
What? Four is the ideal number of kids
for a documentary.

627
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,957
-Is that so?
-Of course.

628
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,918
Right. It'll be more realistic that way.

629
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,128
Of course.

630
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,519
Hey.

631
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,355
Can I take one move back?

632
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,613
Inmate 4885, you have a visitor.

633
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,378
I was going to pay a lot of people

634
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,588
to go join you in prison.

635
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:11,052
But it turned out there were already
so many indebted to you in there.

636
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,139
So many that I couldn't even keep count.

637
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,726
Thanks to them,
I'm very lighthearted right now.

638
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,894
I'm exhilarated.

639
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,814
I'll be looking forward to your news,

640
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,650
though you won't get to read it
since it'll be an obituary.

641
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,485
All right, then.

642
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,176
Hello, sir.

643
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,594
How's it going?

644
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,512
You know I'm the best one out there.

645
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,729
What's wrong?

646
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,814
It's nothing.

647
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,815
Okay.

648
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,361
Ten-minute break!

649
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,704
Have some.

650
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:20,788
Yes.

651
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,920
President Choi sends his regards.

652
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,133
You…

653
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,895
You all know

654
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,606
that the center for the disabled
in Seongshim-dong

655
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,067
won't be built
due to the residents' disapproval.

656
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:53,363
They're such fools. They didn't consider
all the prospective infrastructures.

657
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:58,493
Seoul was a little annoyed by this
and is now determined to build

658
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:02,956
an independent city that contains
a center and a school for the disabled,

659
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,833
a retirement home, and a sanatorium.

660
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:11,047
All the ministry officials are determined
to find the perfect area for it now.

661
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:12,966
It's over there.

662
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,308
And they narrowed it down to two areas.

663
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,935
One of them

664
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:27,438
is right here where you're standing.

665
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,941
But the other area could
be selected, right?

666
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,694
Don't even bother to check that out.

667
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,862
The site isn't good enough
for construction.

668
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,198
Finally,

669
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:41,286
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

670
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:45,873
He's not interested in these affairs,
so he usually never shows up.

671
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:50,128
But I personally asked him,
and he has agreed to come.

672
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,464
He's a member of the committee
that'll decide which land to use

673
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,384
and the vice-president
of the Association of the Disabled.

674
00:59:56,467 --> 01:00:00,305
Please welcome Mr. Kim Jae-min.

675
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:25,288
ELECTED, 40.2 PERCENT
22ND PRESIDENT MO GYEONG-IL

676
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,503
-Mo Gyeong-il!
-Mo Gyeong-il!

677
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:37,467
-Mo Gyeong-il!
-Mo Gyeong-il!

678
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,637
-Mo Gyeong-il!
-Mo Gyeong-il!

679
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,680
-Mo Gyeong-il!
-Mo Gyeong-il!

680
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,360
Jeong-hwan.

681
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:39,779
Yes?

682
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,658
Ma'am, please get ready.

683
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,714
Joo-eun.

684
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,384
Yes?

685
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,558
THE END

686
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:55,646
