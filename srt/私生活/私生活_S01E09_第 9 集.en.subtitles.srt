1
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,886
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,644
You all know which animal is
the funniest in the world, right?

4
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,022
You're right.

5
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,649
It's humans.

6
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,403
They go on about secrets

7
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,115
and make laws to protect those
who deserve to be punished.

8
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,951
Think about it.

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,248
There's nothing more fun and exciting
than the private lives of others.

10
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,129
Everyone is always trying to
invade and enjoy

11
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,631
the private lives of others.

12
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,383
So, is it

13
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,180
even possible for
one's privacy to stay private?

14
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,607
So, I don't believe in

15
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,151
the private lives of others.

16
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,238
Why?

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,574
Because no one's lives are truly private.

18
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,788
They are all contaminated and fabricated.

19
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,632
But you know what?

20
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,468
THE LATE JEONG YOON-KYUNG

21
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,055
I stumbled upon the most uncontaminated
version of others' private lives.

22
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,307
Private lives in the raw.

23
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,648
How ironic. Isn't that entertaining?

24
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,362
So now,

25
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,448
I'm going to read them quietly.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,996
The pure private lives of others,
recorded by money.

27
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,675
14 YEARS AGO

28
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,602
EPISODE 9

29
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,119
What is that?

30
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,831
Oh, that. It's from your mother.

31
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,066
How could they say no to my daughter?
They must be blind to do that.

32
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,863
All of those anchorwomen

33
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,908
can't hold a candle to my daughter.

34
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,329
So don't even think about
coming back if you don't pass.

35
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,915
You know what I'm saying, right?

36
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,251
You have to pass no matter what.

37
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,169
It hasn't changed.

38
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,383
-Have you been maintaining it?
-What?

39
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,303
Yes.

40
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,181
What a waste of time.

41
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,317
Are we sleeping here?

42
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,193
No.

43
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,572
-What about your meal?
-I'm good.

44
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,459
Should I tear down the house
and build a new country house?

45
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,047
No. Forget it.

46
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,228
LEDGER

47
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,319
Why are you giving this to me?

48
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,282
Do you know what the purest commodity
in the world is?

49
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,786
It's money.

50
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,082
And this is a book of history
written by money.

51
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:30,014
Who might be the most powerful
person here?

52
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,480
I'm sorry.
Something urgent came up at work.

53
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,398
I'm really sorry.

54
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,369
It's been a while.

55
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,621
What a surprise.

56
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,414
You've been dodging my calls.

57
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,710
Today is an important day for you guys.
It's your wedding anniversary.

58
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,633
If you knew that, how could you
show up here so audaciously?

59
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,052
What if he sees you?

60
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,938
Sir, are you okay?

61
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:19,856
Come out.

62
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,360
-Who are you?
-That's none of your business.

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,570
Please move aside.

64
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,158
Mr. Woo Seok-ho.

65
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,243
Mr. Woo Seok-ho?

66
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,540
You can't take photos.

67
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,625
-No photos.
-Sorry.

68
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,423
CHIEF JEONG DAE-SANG

69
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,761
So Woo Seok-ho is in charge

70
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,181
of handling the police.

71
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,268
That prick.

72
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,147
He's ordering me around
because he works for GK.

73
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,859
Gosh, that bastard.

74
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,154
What should I do?

75
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,756
I can't believe he's doing this
on our wedding anniversary.

76
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,842
I guess I should thank him for it.

77
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,762
Shall we go upstairs?

78
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,766
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable
in a room? To talk, I mean.

79
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,685
Have you forgotten that I like shy women?

80
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,813
Let's just have a drink.

81
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,275
Are you seeing Jeong Bok-gi again?

82
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,154
Well, you tell me. What do you think?

83
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,032
Edward, you've become a coward.

84
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,326
You're dodging my question.

85
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,247
-Are you getting old?
-I've grown up.

86
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,209
To a grown man, women are
nothing more than just accessories.

87
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,087
You are utterly mistaken, Edward.

88
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,589
Women also grow up.

89
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,559
Oh, right. Did you hear the latest news
about the detective agency?

90
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,229
The widow launched
a very interesting project.

91
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,900
Lately, I have been

92
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,737
receiving way too much attention.

93
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,908
What do you mean?

94
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,577
Chief Jeong.

95
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,080
Chief Jeong Dae-sang.

96
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,249
Yes. I'm listening.

97
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,251
Are you sure it wasn't you?

98
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,878
I don't follow.

99
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,388
Fine.

100
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,851
I get that the police are very curious.
I can understand that.

101
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,768
However,

102
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,896
make yesterday the last.

103
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,149
If you keep showing interest in me,

104
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,943
I'll have to take interest in you, too.

105
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,324
Are we on the same page?

106
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,367
Yes, we are.

107
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:25,583
Then, don't forget to send my regards
to Kim Myung-hyun.

108
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,959
I got to go.

109
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,420
You're here, sir.

110
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,364
You know why, right?

111
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,408
-Yes, I do.
-Then, tell me.

112
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,243
Tell me why.

113
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,746
I told them to close the case.

114
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,499
But the Violent Crimes Three
keeps showing interest in me.

115
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,877
You don't need to worry.
I'll take care of it.

116
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,297
You have no idea. You're clueless.

117
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,551
Hey. Woo Seok-ho!

118
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,180
What do you do here?

119
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,725
What is it that you do here, you bastard?

120
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,774
What did you do with that bitch?

121
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,861
Did you go to our affiliated hotel or not?

122
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,531
You did, right?

123
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,034
You pretended to have the same name
as Lee Jeong-hwan.

124
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,124
This is no time to fool around
with a con woman because she's a looker!

125
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,625
I'm sorry.

126
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,671
Hey.

127
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,843
What do you think will happen
if Director Oh finds out about this?

128
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,389
He was against the reinstatement
of the Vision Room from the get-go.

129
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,809
He only shut up
because you married his daughter.

130
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,395
What if your lawyer wife

131
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,689
finds out about this?

132
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,732
What, then?

133
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,612
What are you going to do if she goes
to her daddy and whines about this?

134
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,991
Jeez.

135
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,875
And why did you fall asleep there?
You idiot!

136
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,879
I drank a lot yesterday. I drank too much.
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,840
Are you sure it was the alcohol?

138
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,508
Wasn't it something else?

139
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,011
Yes. I'm sure of it.

140
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,308
Move.

141
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,772
You are doing so much for our company
but not in a good way.

142
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,074
So what did the police do?

143
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,373
Come on in.

144
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,377
Have a seat.

145
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,802
I bet you're busy.

146
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,597
Yes. You know how it is.

147
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,807
But they aren't all secret cases.

148
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,979
You must be busy trying to close assigned
cases and digging into closed cases.

149
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,483
You're also tailing a conglomerate
employee. You must be really busy.

150
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,237
Though that doesn't mean
you get paid more for it.

151
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,115
Have we been coerced
regarding Lee Jeong-hwan's case?

152
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,036
I think you assigned us the case
because you had the mind to

153
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,621
close the case abruptly.

154
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,708
Am I way off base?

155
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,173
You're right.

156
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,426
-Yes, we've been coerced.
-Who was it?

157
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,555
Detective Kim.

158
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,892
Who do you think has the most power
in South Korea?

159
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,646
GK Innovative Vision Room.

160
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,234
Do you honestly believe it was disbanded?

161
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,319
I have been

162
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,281
a cop in Korea for over ten years.

163
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,324
I know that.

164
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,452
Despite that, you made a move.

165
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,170
Then, you must already know
how dangerous this case is.

166
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,172
You might

167
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,217
lose your badge for it.

168
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,762
Will you keep at it?

169
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,690
What do you want me to do, sir?

170
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,699
Hey, what's going on here? What is this?

171
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,285
We're sending our best cop
to a security center?

172
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,705
Did you get caught badmouthing
the Commissioner?

173
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,167
I knew it. So that's what happened.

174
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,919
What did you even say?

175
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,296
I wonder what made him
take action immediately.

176
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,342
Hey, rookie. Where do you
get all of those silly ideas?

177
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,553
Then what else could it be
given the circumstance?

178
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,479
All right, then.
I'll head to the security center.

179
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,481
Call me. You, too.

180
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,902
Goodness. What's going on?

181
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,866
-We're going out for lunch.
-Okay. Enjoy.

182
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,244
-Kimchi stew.
-I had that for breakfast.

183
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,788
Gosh. Again?

184
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,214
I'm here, Myung-hyun.

185
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,716
What?

186
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,594
The chief wanted me to back you up.

187
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,516
Who knew the Chief would be
willing to help us like this?

188
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,812
What should we eat for lunch?

189
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,982
You'll need to eat without me.
I have other plans.

190
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,694
What? What other plans?

191
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,904
-See you later.
-Wait.

192
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,864
Myung-hyun!

193
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,438
Hey.

194
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
Nice to meet you.

195
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,574
Say hello.

196
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,703
This is Deputy Chief Kim Jae-wook.
He's joining us as of today.

197
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,040
What? "Deputy Chief"?

198
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,666
I'm Kim Jae-wook.

199
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,752
Hi.

200
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,129
You're Team Manager Woo Seok-ho, right?

201
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,177
Given my age and rank,

202
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,389
I should drop the honorific,
right, Seok-ho?

203
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,231
This is the plan I came up with.

204
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,150
CHA JOO-EUN
LEE JEONG-HWAN

205
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,735
Cha Joo-eun.

206
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,405
She'll become an industrial spy
from China.

207
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,534
And Lee Jeong-hwan hired Yoo Mi-young.

208
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,702
YOO MI-YOUNG

209
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,246
And then the widow took over
her role and continued.

210
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,164
LEE JEONG-HWAN

211
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,999
The plan will be executed smoothly.

212
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,462
Why come up with such an elaborate scheme?
She's just a con woman.

213
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,884
Cha Joo-eun isn't our target.

214
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,637
Our target is Mr. Park of One Line

215
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,557
whom Jeong-hwan worked on.

216
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,227
YOO MI-YOUNG, MISTRESS,
PARK CHUNG-SEOP

217
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,316
-What took you so long?
-Were you waiting for me?

218
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,278
I'm divorcing my wife.

219
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,447
-I'm serious.
-Baby.

220
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,865
PARK CHUNG-SEOP
KWON HYUK-JANG

221
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,325
Mr. Park

222
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,495
is Kwon Hyuk-jang's new head sponsor.

223
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,082
So in March, I'll win back the government
no matter what.

224
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,252
-Yoo Byung-jun!
-Yoo Byung-jun!

225
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,675
Then, we'll have to proceed.

226
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,511
2020 CHINA INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY
LEAKAGE PLAN VERSION 2

227
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,390
What do I get?

228
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,642
Check your bank account.

229
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,606
DEPOSIT 20,000,000

230
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,486
This much money can't get me
more than a couple of new bags.

231
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,655
That's just a down payment.

232
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,449
If you succeed…

233
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,696
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

234
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
Wow, it's a customer.

235
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,202
That's surprising.

236
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,206
You know me, right?

237
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,083
Where have I seen her?

238
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,137
Who are you?

239
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,979
What are you doing?

240
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,190
Why do you act like you don't know?

241
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,985
How may I help…

242
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,656
We're the Industrial Technology
Leakage Investigation Unit.

243
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
Welcome.

244
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,409
Industrial technology?

245
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,620
Goodness.

246
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,413
Yoo Mi-young.

247
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,707
Cha Joo-eun.

248
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,004
Please understand that physical contact is
inevitable due to the urgency of arrest.

249
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,343
What's going on?

250
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,598
Take them. Let's go.

251
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,903
You're being arrested for violating
the Industrial Technology

252
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,072
Leakage Prevention and Protection Act.

253
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:07,951
Joo-eun.

254
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,499
Joo-eun, are you okay? Get out of the car.

255
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:17,961
Joo-eun.

256
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,756
Joo-eun.

257
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,095
Get out.

258
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,114
Cha Joo-eun ran away

259
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,910
with the help of two unidentified men.

260
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,164
One ran away
after crashing into a police car,

261
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,583
and the other ran away
on a motorcycle with her.

262
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,298
Do they want to end up dying in jail?

263
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,466
How dare they

264
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,803
attack police officers and escape?

265
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,850
-Do you have the video?
-Yes.

266
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,435
Play it.

267
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,857
Yes, it's me.

268
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,193
Send the video to the meeting room.

269
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,215
"Unidentified."

270
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,093
That's not in my vocabulary.

271
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,054
It's Lee Jeong-hwan.

272
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,186
Lee Jeong-hwan is definitely alive,

273
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,105
and there's no doubt that's him.

274
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,486
Lee Jeong-hwan is alive?

275
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,287
Don't they look kind of romantic?

276
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,669
Did Cha Joo-eun get a new boyfriend
or something?

277
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,216
Or maybe it's Lee Jeong-hwan's ghost.

278
00:26:55,905 --> 00:27:00,368
How long will you leave it to
the contractor thugs to do your work?

279
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,042
They've done nothing but make mistakes.

280
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,589
Then what?

281
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,426
Use the shadows.

282
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,056
Use shadows

283
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,433
to catch shadows?

284
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,145
I think that's what we need
the most right now.

285
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,690
What if the shadows get exposed?

286
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,987
Then we'll need to run
the elimination program, as always.

287
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,283
We're up against Lee Jeong-hwan.

288
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,869
And false rumors could spread.

289
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,465
Sir.

290
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,842
Go on.

291
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,803
Shouldn't you

292
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,973
make a decision now?

293
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,106
Will it be me or Lee Jeong-hwan?

294
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,738
We have Lee Jeong-hwan's location.

295
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,323
-What's this bike?
-Jeez.

296
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,325
-Isn't it awesome?
-Can I ride it?

297
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,284
-No.
-Me too.

298
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,662
-Come on. I'm your friend.
-No, it's mine.

299
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,330
-Let me ride it just once.
-No.

300
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,332
-I let you ride mine before.
-What?

301
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,876
-What's that?
-What's going on?

302
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,200
So,

303
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,204
he gave you this motorcycle
for your clothes?

304
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,709
I'm not lying. I didn't steal it.

305
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,921
This one's for after work.

306
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,133
Look. Here's what we should do.

307
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,385
-Look.
-What's that?

308
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,431
-Should I steal it?
-Shut up.

309
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,438
To use other shadows

310
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,399
is to publicize
Lee Jeong-hwan's resurrection.

311
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,111
The nicest way would be
to get rid of him quietly

312
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,323
while he's still officially dead.

313
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,576
So,

314
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,122
try to finish him off smoothly.

315
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,337
In the end,

316
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,841
he'll shake hands
with the one who survives.

317
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,008
-Joo-eun--
-What happened--

318
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,470
-You go--
-I'll go first.

319
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,475
Why didn't you come

320
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,435
to the wedding?

321
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,273
-It was because--
-No.

322
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,316
Never mind.

323
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,027
Did you even love me?

324
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,950
Did you just sigh?

325
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,661
Is that your answer?

326
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,083
Were you fooling around then?

327
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,836
What about you?

328
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,466
You answer me first.

329
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,720
Why did you lie to me?

330
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,763
Love?

331
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,684
Yes.

332
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,853
I loved you.

333
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,271
But…

334
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,401
I'm not sure anymore.

335
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,448
Because everything's fake.

336
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,118
I know everything you told me
about yourself

337
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,788
was a lie.

338
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,378
Why did you lie to me?

339
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,673
Answer me.

340
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,467
Well…

341
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,928
Because…

342
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,935
You're no different.

343
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,731
You lied to me about your parents
and the detective agency!

344
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,027
You even borrow money from a loan shark.

345
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,571
What about the apartment?

346
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,406
Five million won a month?

347
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,785
You're alive and well,

348
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,996
but you faked your death.

349
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,419
The body was completely burnt.

350
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,589
There were only bones left.

351
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,716
I…

352
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,387
I gave you a funeral.

353
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,058
Do you know what ran through my mind
when I was cremating you?

354
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,978
Do you know what that's like?

355
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,066
I thought maybe it happened because…

356
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,361
I thought maybe you were killed
because of me.

357
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,698
I still can't sleep without drinking.

358
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,993
So,

359
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,497
you should've been honest with me

360
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,251
and told me that you were alive.

361
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,297
Shouldn't you have told me that at least,

362
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,969
you crook?

363
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,347
Don't

364
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,350
call me that

365
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,896
when you have a record of fraud, Joo-eun.

366
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,403
Did you do a background check on me?

367
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,698
It wasn't a background check.

368
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,119
It was fact-checking.

369
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,331
Bastard.

370
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,126
You're not making excuses.

371
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,421
That means

372
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,841
it's all true.

373
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,556
Yes.

374
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,476
I'm an ex-con.

375
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,771
Yes.

376
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,065
It's clear now

377
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,234
that it's over.

378
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,907
It's really over

379
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,578
between us.

380
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,084
Good luck

381
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,920
with your life, wanker.

382
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,508
Joo-eun.

383
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,220
Never call my name again.

384
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,315
You have a record of fraud, Joo-eun.

385
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,485
You should just die,

386
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,529
Cha Joo-eun.

387
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,699
Should I just kill myself?

388
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,253
Let go of me, you bastard!

389
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,704
I'm sorry.

390
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,460
I'm sorry.

391
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,463
I really am.

392
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,020
Don't worry. I'll have a successful life.

393
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,671
So Lee Jeong-hwan is alive?

394
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:06,135
He really is like a ghost.

395
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,804
He's been hiding all this time.

396
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:14,435
I won't have to worry about Joo-eun
for the time being

397
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,562
since her groom took her.

398
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,775
Forget about Jeong-hwan.

399
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,444
What was with the police?

400
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,875
-What do you want?
-Sir, the fight will begin.

401
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,170
I'll make sure you regret
picking a fight with us.

402
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,558
You're being arrested for violating
the Industrial Technology

403
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,103
Leakage Prevention and Protection Act.

404
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,246
So are you saying you just drove
into the police car

405
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,498
without knowing what was going on?

406
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,090
Fine.

407
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,175
Let's do this.

408
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,510
First,

409
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,012
turn yourself in.

410
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,775
Pay attention, will you?

411
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,488
How many times do I need
to repeat myself? I don't know.

412
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,576
You saw it too. He suddenly appeared
then vanished into thin air.

413
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,704
How would we know?
And he's also wearing a helmet.

414
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,331
Detective, how could you call us
industrial spies?

415
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,376
We just run a detective agency
that tracks down cheaters.

416
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,420
We protect families' happiness.

417
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,464
And that woman, Yoo Mi-young,

418
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:11,260
is a hired mistress
that my boss used to work with.

419
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,511
Industrial spy?

420
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,598
That's totally absurd.

421
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,476
I have proof here.

422
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,478
Are you going to keep this up?

423
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,606
We don't give out awards for acting.

424
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:30,196
Hello, I'm Nam Wook from First Law Firm.

425
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,574
My client wants to turn himself in.

426
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,451
FIRST LAW FIRM
LAWYER NAM WOOK

427
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,957
I'm sorry, sir.

428
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,922
I was extremely exhausted
and dozed off while driving.

429
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,965
I was shocked and scared.

430
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:54,220
I've always been a scaredy-cat,
so I just left the scene for a bit.

431
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,014
I never had any intentions to run away.

432
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,432
I'm truly sorry.

433
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,559
I am.

434
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,191
My goodness.

435
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,699
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

436
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:17,826
Good work.

437
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,662
Goodbye.

438
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,792
God, those were
some top-notch acting skills.

439
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,628
It was terrible.

440
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,925
Gosh, I beg to differ.

441
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,885
Come here. You need to be scolded.

442
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,137
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

443
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,326
Who is she?

444
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,411
Who?

445
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,080
She followed you. Didn't you see her?

446
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,627
She must be interested in you.

447
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,344
Damn it. What was that?

448
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,430
How could he ignore me like that?

449
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,514
Am I invisible?

450
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,558
Damn it.

451
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,213
Hey, Detective Kim. What's up?

452
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,299
About Cha Joo-eun

453
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,677
from Spy detective agency yesterday…

454
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,846
Oh, her? What about it?

455
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,598
Who told you about it?

456
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,099
What?

457
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,517
Who gave you the order?

458
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,605
What do you mean?
I'm not appreciating this attitude.

459
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,399
Someone called and tipped us off. Why?

460
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,528
And who was that?

461
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,491
You want me to reveal their identity?

462
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,703
I'm sure you already know
the Whistleblower Protection Act.

463
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,372
What's with you?

464
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,875
This was a setup, right?

465
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,129
What? What did you say, you prick?

466
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,423
-Was it someone from the outside?
-You bastard.

467
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,094
Let me go!

468
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,221
She was an industrial spy?

469
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,847
It's obviously a setup.

470
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,808
Who was it? Who gave you the order?

471
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,394
Let him go.

472
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,647
Hey, Kim Myung-hyun!

473
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,859
Come with me.

474
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,968
How could you do that
to your fellow detective?

475
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,430
I'm sorry, sir.

476
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,391
Don't treat your family like that.

477
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,268
Even if you don't like him,

478
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,147
you'll need his help one day. Understand?

479
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,483
Yes, sir.

480
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,698
Cha Joo-eun is an industrial spy?

481
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,242
It doesn't suit her.

482
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,411
But since detective agencies

483
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,289
sometimes run errands for big companies,

484
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,957
it could be possible.

485
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,170
-Sir.
-What?

486
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,132
Even a little child would say

487
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,842
that this is a setup.

488
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,722
I mean, how could she be
an industrial spy?

489
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,519
I'll investigate and find out
who's behind this.

490
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,522
Don't. This isn't your department's case.

491
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,316
Don't give them the wrong impression.

492
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,067
-Sir--
-Detective Kim.

493
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,614
Tell me the truth.

494
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,618
Are you and Cha Joo-eun in love
or something?

495
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,330
The truth about her doesn't matter.

496
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,708
What matters is that you're giving them
the wrong impression.

497
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,879
So what should you do from now on?

498
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,639
Find Cha Joo-eun and hand her over.

499
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,682
That's the only way
you can clear your name.

500
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,272
If you make another mistake,

501
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,066
I won't be able to help you.

502
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,693
Do you understand me?

503
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,158
Also… Fine. Let's say
that this was all a setup.

504
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,370
Then who would do something like this?

505
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,832
What importance could an owner
of a detective agency have

506
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,209
for someone to set this up?

507
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,545
Don't you agree?

508
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,391
DEPUTY CHIEF'S OFFICE

509
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,111
Gosh, this is some great broth.

510
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,948
Mr. Kim, you could open
your own restaurant.

511
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,701
Do you want to work with me?

512
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,204
Sure.

513
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,207
But after I retire. I should receive
my severance pay.

514
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,962
By the way,

515
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,465
what's your plan?

516
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,802
What tricks do you have up your sleeve
for you to return to GK?

517
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,894
I want to make this world a bit cleaner.

518
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,071
Goodness, I didn't know
we shared the same goal.

519
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,575
So?

520
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,536
What should I do with Cha Joo-eun?

521
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,373
Catch her.

522
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:21,958
And Deputy Chief Seo?

523
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:29,174
Keep an eye on him.
You'll be taking his place one day.

524
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,226
This is what I'm the most curious about.

525
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,438
Are you positive

526
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,775
that Lee Jeong-hwan is alive?

527
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,877
Lee Jeong-hwan.

528
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,923
You came back on the scene
to save Joo-eun.

529
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,347
He's still so kindhearted.

530
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,476
Like that time.

531
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,231
No!

532
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:29,109
No! I said, no.

533
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,611
It's all over.

534
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,155
Go in there, and you'll die too.

535
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,532
No. We should extinguish it.

536
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,576
The flames haven't reached the center yet.

537
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,077
I need to stop it.

538
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,330
You bastard!

539
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,001
If something happens to you,
GK will be exposed.

540
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,377
Damn it.

541
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,440
Goodness.

542
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,779
Drowning yourself in alcohol

543
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,532
won't turn back the clock.

544
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,676
It was a bit troublesome,

545
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,887
but it was a complete success.

546
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,726
People are starting to talk.

547
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:50,857
They think the fire authorities are
incompetent and blame the government.

548
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,821
Is this fun?

549
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,074
This is amusing to you, isn't it?

550
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,701
You little prick.

551
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,079
Do you work for fun?

552
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,039
By any chance,

553
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,834
is this

554
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,087
what you wanted all along?

555
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,507
Is that why

556
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,135
instead of reaching me
through my receiver,

557
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,056
you messaged me,
knowing I wouldn't be able

558
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,101
to check while I was on duty?

559
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,562
You little…

560
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,526
Was it that obvious?

561
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,743
Hey, everyone is bound to die someday.

562
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,453
In that case,

563
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,874
it's better to die for a cause, isn't it?

564
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,754
If they knew they helped
improve their country,

565
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,466
I'm sure they would be happy.

566
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,346
Who gives you the right?
They should decide for themselves!

567
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,973
You bastard.

568
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,399
Look at you.

569
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,944
If you're going to challenge me…

570
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,617
Do it when you're sober.

571
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,288
Where are you going?

572
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,001
Don't run away, you bastard!

573
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:47,098
As a result, the opposition party is
strongly condemning the government.

574
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,351
The fire's been elevated
to the third grade,

575
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,603
-making it a national disaster.
-Mr. Kim.

576
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,606
It's a huge national disaster.

577
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,024
Take responsibility for it.

578
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,359
Of course.

579
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,569
You don't make mistakes. What happened?

580
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,196
I'll take responsibility.

581
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,212
When will I find out

582
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,173
if I'm doing a good job

583
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,009
or just wasting my time?

584
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,305
As of now, I'm not sure.

585
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,226
Bye.

586
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:05,427
Goddess, wake up!

587
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:10,932
It's another great day!

588
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,892
Shut up!

589
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,980
Ko Hye-won. 28 years old.

590
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,024
She wakes up at 6 a.m.

591
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,277
She spends three hours getting ready
to go to work.

592
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,447
What? Three hours?

593
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,335
Jang Min-jeong. 31 years old.

594
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,755
As a former hostess,
she ran a gambling house

595
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,466
for other hostesses
and was caught by the police.

596
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,719
She was sentenced to two years
and served her time

597
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,721
in Cheongpa Women's
Correctional Institution.

598
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,183
She and Cha Joo-eun were cellmates.

599
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,449
She collects underwear as a hobby?

600
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,623
It's a dud.

601
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,375
He and Lee Jeong-hwan are
from the same orphanage.

602
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,503
He was a former waiter at a bar.

603
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,464
He's running a small
money-lending business at the moment.

604
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,927
Again?

605
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:42,565
After he lost the Asian Championships,
his alcoholic father's liver was ruined.

606
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:47,112
Ironically, he donated his liver
to his father and quit boxing.

607
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,657
After retiring, he joined a gang.

608
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,659
Then he was scammed by someone he trusted.

609
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,746
He became a con man himself
to take revenge.

610
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,878
CHA HYUN-TAE
CHA JOO-EUN'S DAD

611
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,797
SERVING 8 YEARS FOR FRAUD
CONNED AS A PASTOR

612
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,925
They've spent their entire lives
scamming people.

613
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,262
Yet her father was caught once,

614
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,847
and her mother, zero.

615
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,600
Are they lucky or just that competent?

616
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,615
Pastor Cha.

617
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,258
Eat slowly.

618
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,809
This isn't who you are.

619
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,770
Since when did you become so warmhearted?

620
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,732
You're always as cold
as the South Pole to me.

621
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,901
Is it because of global warming?

622
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,862
You know that he's innocent.

623
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,575
That bitch, Jeong Bok-gi, took everything.

624
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,119
I invested 20 million won back then.

625
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,455
I saved that money by starving myself

626
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,999
and by only eating the cheapest meals
for ten years.

627
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,044
He served eight years in prison
for what he did.

628
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,464
We're in heaven compared to him.

629
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,597
This must be his first time having ribs.

630
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,690
He was released after eight years,

631
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,694
but no one's come to see him.
Not even his wife or daughter.

632
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,488
This is a complete mess.

633
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,325
Like what Kim Mi-sook said,

634
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,577
is this the liberal
Northern European lifestyle?

635
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,084
They've never even been there before.

636
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,420
They're like parasites.

637
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,715
Call Mr. Park.

638
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,633
Yes, sir.

639
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,309
How did it go?

640
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,852
And what are you wearing?

641
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,025
What did she say?

642
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,820
Did you not ask her?

643
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,115
That's enough.

644
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,996
Read my face before asking such questions.

645
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,372
Do you think

646
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,625
I'm having a great time working?

647
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,088
Why are you

648
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,091
so dull-witted?

649
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,178
Just finish your meal.

650
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,898
He looks shocked.

651
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,984
He's badly damaged.

652
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,659
Yes.

653
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,621
I'm an ex-con.

654
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,084
Yes. It's clear now

655
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,503
that it's over.

656
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:34,922
It really is.

657
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,053
It's really over.

658
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,612
Hey.

659
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,529
Yes?

660
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,368
May I borrow your phone?

661
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,828
Did you lose yours?

662
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,333
Here.

663
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,501
Thank you.

664
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,679
Oh, you're in front of the office?

665
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,725
Why don't you come in then?

666
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,853
Here?

667
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,774
Everything's fine here.

668
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,151
Okay. I'll head up now.

669
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,322
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

670
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,620
Hey.

671
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,664
Yes? What is it?

672
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,335
Don't lend your phone to others so easily.

673
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,215
Bad people could steal
your private information.

674
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,275
What do you think he'll do?

675
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,401
I will arrest you

676
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,403
the next time we meet.

677
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,905
We'll have to make him do it.

678
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,448
So

679
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,866
what's the plan?

680
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,288
Oh my gosh.

681
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,624
This suddenly crossed my mind.

682
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,001
That ledger…

683
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,421
Why can't I have it?

684
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,339
Find him

685
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:22,840
as soon as you can.

686
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,593
-If something happens to you…
-I was their bait.

687
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,136
Let me go!

688
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,765
The bait to lure out Jeong-hwan
who faked his death.

689
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:36,938
