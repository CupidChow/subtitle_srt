1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,886
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS, AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,315
What? What's going on here?

4
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,487
Why isn't it working?

5
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,282
WE'RE SORRY

6
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,744
THE PASSWORD IS INCORRECT

7
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,288
What happened? What went wrong?

8
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,332
Han Son, what's going on here?

9
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,352
Why didn't I do anything
when I knew all along?

10
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,022
It was cute
you guys were investing so much into this.

11
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,066
It was quite entertaining to watch.

12
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,486
A fake bank and a gold bar.

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,366
You really don't have
an ounce of conscience left.

14
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,955
I heard your documentary was a success
because of my dad's performance,

15
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,165
and you bought a building in Gangnam.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,002
Shouldn't you return everything to me?

17
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,717
It's obvious
that you're recording this conversation.

18
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,388
If you're recording
our conversation to get what you want,

19
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,517
it means that you really haven't found
any evidence at all. Right?

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm the living proof.

21
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,939
On top of what you did to my dad,

22
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,901
I know that you're running
a ridiculous pyramid scheme here.

23
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,029
I'm the living proof for it.

24
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,407
Ms. Cha Joo-eun of the Diamond Level.

25
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,286
You've already been sued.

26
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,455
All of the members
that you have been handling

27
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,040
just filed a lawsuit against you.

28
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,752
For extortion,
unwanted labor, inertia selling,

29
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,547
and violating the law
for door-to-door sales.

30
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,633
I won't be going down alone.

31
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,802
Suit yourself.

32
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,892
Kindly escort her to the police station.

33
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,809
Hey!

34
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,317
-Oh, right.
-Hey!

35
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,736
I'm going to China in an hour.

36
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,407
-And I'm never coming back this time.
-Hey!

37
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,078
Don't let this discourage you.
Have a diligent life.

38
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,873
Your life isn't over yet. Okay?

39
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,125
All right. Good luck.

40
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,793
Hey!

41
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,960
She already packed everything and left.

42
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,137
EPISODE 2

43
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,560
Ms. Cha Joo-eun.

44
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,252
Make it quick.
She'll be processed in two hours.

45
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,679
Who are you?

46
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,480
You're not even a violent offender.
This is too much, isn't it?

47
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,405
Sit down.

48
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,079
Let's begin right away.

49
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,748
YANG IN-SUK
POLICE AGENCY

50
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,586
I looked into the statements
made against you.

51
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,796
It's obvious you're not the ringleader.

52
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,799
I couldn't have said it better myself.

53
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,635
Yes. They're putting the blame on me.

54
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,057
This is so unfair.

55
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,563
It's like the detectives here are zombies.
They won't listen to me.

56
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,691
I think they might've been greased.

57
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,109
Cha Joo-eun.

58
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,612
Choose your words carefully.

59
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,407
Words like "grease" make you
sound like a real con artist.

60
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,284
Let's start over.

61
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,578
Why was it you, of all people?

62
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,499
You have nothing to do with the company.

63
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,668
You're only a member.
Why did they turn on you?

64
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,630
Well,

65
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,592
you have to ask those people.

66
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,261
-I already did.
-You met those people?

67
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,222
What did they say?

68
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,267
It was exactly what they wrote
in their statements, as expected.

69
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,895
They were just repeating
the lines they got.

70
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,940
What was odd is
that they didn't seem resentful.

71
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,151
I didn't see any frustration
victims usually have.

72
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,695
Exactly.
Obviously, they aren't frustrated.

73
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,030
They were paid to do it.

74
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,408
And who do you think paid them?

75
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,955
Jeong Bok-gi.

76
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,249
How do I know her?

77
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,421
It wasn't much,

78
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,840
but I was an investor too.

79
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,468
In Pastor Cha's scheme.

80
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,098
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

81
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,766
Did you look into me?

82
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,226
Is that important right now?

83
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,353
You did good police work.

84
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,189
Anyway, I was looking for Jeong Bok-gi,

85
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,732
and this is where I ended up.

86
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,069
It's funny running into you here.

87
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,073
Were you trying to take revenge on her?

88
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,618
Well, I guess you can say that.

89
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,624
So what did you find out
and what did she catch you with

90
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,418
to get you where you are now?

91
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,313
I have a question.

92
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,819
Why did you do it?

93
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,571
Are we talking about work already?

94
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
You could have kicked her out
when she joined.

95
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,201
You know, Cha Joo-eun.

96
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,289
Because it was cute. Her trying
to get a taste of the real world.

97
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,375
And it's not like
we're complete strangers.

98
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,004
I couldn't just pass up the opportunity.

99
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,674
So I taught her a lesson.
Since I'm such a nice person.

100
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,802
Yes, I know.

101
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,015
Teaching is more rewarding
and brings more happiness than learning.

102
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,519
That's why people keep giving lectures.

103
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,397
But you have to think about the students.

104
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,608
Who would want to learn?

105
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,568
The path of learning is just awful.

106
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,779
That's just being cruel.

107
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,448
That's why I did it.

108
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,408
I wanted to uproot her desire to learn.

109
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,078
Now, she'll drop out for sure.

110
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,372
I'm happy to know
you're feeling charitable,

111
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,624
but let's refrain
from giving free lectures.

112
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,293
You see, I'm hooked on philanthropy.

113
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,920
But I'll try.

114
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,172
And one more thing.

115
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,010
Since Cha Joo-eun joined the company,

116
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,388
we've suffered some damages.

117
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,104
I'll make it up to you.

118
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,366
Oh, right. What about Mr. Park?

119
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,952
Mr. Park?

120
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,290
So you managed to make a move on Mr. Park.

121
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,501
Your enemies can become
your friends overnight in this field.

122
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,171
You've done your research. Go on.

123
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,092
Our friendship was just beginning to bud.

124
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,470
But this is what happened.

125
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,515
Mr. Park.

126
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,853
Should I say
that I used him for my lectures?

127
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,148
Wait.

128
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,531
Listen, Cha Joo-eun.

129
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,077
You should know
who your allies and enemies are.

130
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,829
I'm doing that just fine.

131
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,374
You know, I can be quite nosy.

132
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,960
I couldn't pass up the chance
to teach someone a lesson.

133
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,964
Well,

134
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,176
if he's learned his lesson,

135
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,888
I would feel
at least a little compensated.

136
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,098
Didn't you check the list of complainants?

137
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,645
Mr. Park is one of the complainants.

138
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,079
That is just so admirable.

139
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,971
This isn't looking good for you.

140
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,849
One of the victims committed suicide.

141
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,653
Defendant.

142
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,572
If you want to make
a final statement, go ahead.

143
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,533
Cry.

144
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,911
Cry and tell the judge
that you're sorry and ask for his mercy.

145
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,832
You're young.
This is your first conviction.

146
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,711
You might be able to get out on probation.

147
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:57,967
I am…

148
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,973
not guilty.

149
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,645
But…

150
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,359
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,280
I am so sorry.

152
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,662
Because of me…

153
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,793
Because of me, a person…

154
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,428
I'm so sorry.

155
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,269
I, the independent panel, will rule
for the case number, 2018978.

156
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,482
I sentence the defendant to 18 months
in jail and 100 million won fine.

157
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,580
Ms. Cha Joo-eun?
Let's not see each other again.

158
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,673
Oh Hyun-kyung,
a lawyer from a big law firm.

159
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,929
A low-ranking cop like me
can't even talk to her.

160
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,931
Jeong Bok-gi.

161
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,809
It looks like
she greased them before she was left.

162
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,769
You're a first-time offender.

163
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,522
And you've settled
with the remaining victims.

164
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,899
I can't believe you'll be serving time.

165
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,151
But a man died.

166
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,737
Forget it.

167
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,906
Let's

168
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,117
just not give up

169
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,371
on catching Jeong Bok-gi.

170
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,875
SUMMER 2019

171
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,043
I told you, I wasn't released from jail.

172
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,839
It's embarrassing for both of us.

173
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,758
Let's forget about the past.
There's a long future ahead of us.

174
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,305
Right. Tomorrow,
we'll have a new prey to target.

175
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,813
-What's that?
-A car key.

176
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,356
I don't need it.

177
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,527
-I drank.
-You want me to be your chauffeur?

178
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,468
Do you have a place to go?

179
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,095
If you're still not sober,
call a real chauffeur.

180
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,483
Let's eat.

181
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,078
-A steak for breakfast?
-You can have it for dinner, too.

182
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,330
That's not what I meant.

183
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,423
Are you sure
you can handle my living expenses?

184
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,676
Anything less than a gold card won't do.

185
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,636
-It's a keycard.
-For what?

186
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,721
For a house.

187
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,370
Where are we?

188
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,316
Isn't this cool?

189
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,028
It's not like those old rooftop houses.

190
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,449
A killer night view.
And drinks taste better.

191
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,867
You can have a barbecue here.

192
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,578
Did you get this place for me?

193
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,376
Stay here for a while,
until we hit it big.

194
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:49,962
Rest up.

195
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,775
HANGERS BOUGHT ONLINE

196
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,318
ABANDONED VANITY TABLE

197
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,444
FROM THE GYM

198
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,613
USED DINING TABLE SET

199
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,990
EXPENSIVE MICROWAVE

200
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
THIS ONE IS BRAND-NEW

201
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,641
Apparently, I have a good credit score.

202
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,019
It looks great on you.

203
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,021
Would you like to take a look?

204
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,439
Where are the accessories?

205
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,669
CHIEF YANG

206
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,882
PORK RIBS APLENTY

207
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,266
Hello. How many people?

208
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,738
Gosh, you suck at grilling meat.

209
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,907
Give me that. Let me do it.

210
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,626
Try it. I bet it tastes better.

211
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,179
Well, it tastes about the same.

212
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,931
You're in trouble.

213
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,683
How are you going to run this place
if you can't tell the difference?

214
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,312
Gosh, if you think you're that good,

215
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,855
why don't you work here?

216
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,440
Me?

217
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,150
No way.

218
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,988
Everything I've been through
is flashing through my head.

219
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,034
I would never work here.
I can't work here. I'd feel wronged.

220
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,369
What will you do then?

221
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,246
Are you looking down on me?

222
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,373
No, I'm just curious.

223
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:41,878
Well,

224
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,299
have you got any news on Jeong Bok-gi?

225
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,593
No.

226
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,888
As you can see, I'm retired.
Of course, I don't.

227
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,435
Just imagine that she got struck
by lightning and died somewhere.

228
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,563
If you don't forget her,
your mind will be troubled,

229
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,273
and you'll lose your wits.

230
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,694
Every day, again and again,

231
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,073
I kill that bitch in my mind.

232
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,541
Eat some meat.

233
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,010
This is on the house.

234
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,267
May I ask who you are?
I don't think we've met before.

235
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,354
-Did you light the coal?
-Of course.

236
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,442
Light more.
We have a group reservation later.

237
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,736
I don't think we do.

238
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,989
But all right.

239
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,867
Well, goodbye, then.

240
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,170
Who is that?

241
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,382
Is he your man?

242
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,929
So you've met a younger man.

243
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,432
You got it going, girl. Excellent.

244
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,978
"Excellent"?
That punk thinks I'm his mom now.

245
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,486
Here. Eat some meat.

246
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,282
It's good.

247
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,867
-Who grilled it?
-You did.

248
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,035
Yes, I did.

249
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,041
HAPPY EMPLOYMENT WELFARE CENTER

250
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,379
There's so much to do.

251
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,050
-You go ahead.
-Sure.

252
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,894
What's going on? When did you come out?

253
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,354
Just a little while ago.

254
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,898
You should've come to me sooner.

255
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,443
Where do you want to go?

256
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,658
What? You already had a drink.

257
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,369
-Does it matter?
-No, it doesn't.

258
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,870
-Let's go, then.
-Go!

259
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,414
Cheers.

260
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,711
How's the center?

261
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,713
It's boring.

262
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,339
But what can I do?

263
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,217
They're giving me a fresh start,
so I should take it.

264
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,845
Isn't it really weird?

265
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,389
Whatever I do, it's boring.

266
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,976
There's nothing I want to do,
but they keep forcing me to do stuff.

267
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,396
I can't eat delicious food
or go travelling

268
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,982
if I don't work, so I work.

269
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,568
Is this what life is all about?

270
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:55,447
"Do what you want to do."
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

271
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,866
But I don't have anything I want to do.

272
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,412
Excuse me.

273
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:11,212
I won't say any nonsense like, "I'm here
because I made a bet with my friends"

274
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,881
or "I'm here to help a fallen angel."

275
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,342
But if you don't mind,

276
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,677
could you spare me five minutes?

277
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,637
Why should I?

278
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,056
I'll make you laugh in five minutes.

279
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,850
-Are you a comedian?
-No.

280
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,439
It's every man's wish
to see a beautiful smile.

281
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,027
It's been only a minute
and you already sound so cheesy.

282
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,445
But you want five minutes?

283
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,115
If you laugh in five minutes,
give me another five minutes.

284
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,079
Can you guess how we became friends?

285
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,378
Through college?

286
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,758
-Colleagues at work?
-We're school friends.

287
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,637
High school friends?

288
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,056
Cheongpa Women's Correctional Institute.

289
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,849
We were cellmates.

290
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,561
We call prisons "schools."

291
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,444
Usually, people don't react this way.
This is new.

292
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,574
I took the courage to come here
despite the embarrassment.

293
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,952
Whining isn't my style.

294
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,621
I'll retreat for now,

295
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,708
but I'll be back
with a brilliant line in five minutes.

296
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,879
He's cool.

297
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,550
Why did you reject him so frankly?

298
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,218
Oh, well.

299
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,013
Don't be like that.
He said he'd be back in five minutes.

300
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,933
-Shall we play with him?
-I'm tired.

301
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,602
I'm going to retire

302
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,313
from being a documentary actor.

303
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,316
-What?
-Let's leave before he comes back.

304
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,738
Hey, we'll never get the chance
to meet someone who looks like that again.

305
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,907
The types of guys
we can meet are all shitty.

306
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,617
You know that, right?

307
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,663
He had a nice mug.

308
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,665
Jeez.

309
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,713
If you get drunk
and slip here by mistake, you'd be dead.

310
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,717
-Are we climbing Mount Everest?
-You better get it together.

311
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,470
If you fail to climb,
I'll leave you behind.

312
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,358
Who is that?

313
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,072
-Min-jeong, it's…
-I'm sorry. I'll just leave.

314
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,995
Min-jeong.

315
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,463
Min-jeong.

316
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,382
It's not what you think.

317
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,093
What? It's exactly what I think it is.

318
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,971
-Bye.
-No, it's not.

319
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:08,848
Hey!

320
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:10,850
Darn it.

321
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,860
Don't peek
if you don't want to end up blind.

322
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,786
-It's done.
-What did you change it to?

323
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,038
Call me before you come from now on.

324
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,173
I'm not going to do it, okay?

325
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,342
I won't do it ever again.

326
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,053
Do me a favor.

327
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,060
Stop treating me like a lowlife.

328
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,275
Rest up. See you in a few days.

329
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,082
Gosh, it hurts.

330
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,877
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

331
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,795
-I can't believe this.
-Oh, goodness.

332
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,841
I shouldn't be here doing this.

333
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,889
I was Miss Cheongyang Pepper 20 years ago.

334
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,225
Back in the day,

335
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,602
I couldn't even go out.

336
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,395
-I know.
-You know?

337
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,814
Because men were all over me.

338
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,982
Min-jeong, I'm sorry.

339
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,412
Hey, rehab center beautician.

340
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,623
What? What about it?

341
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,008
What's wrong with a beautician?

342
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,606
Joo-eun, have some--

343
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,322
-It got cold.
-Heat it up.

344
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,699
It'll get burnt.
Burnt meat isn't good for you.

345
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,101
Fine. What is it this time?

346
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,645
UI telecom.

347
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,065
You'll be a conglomerate employee
like you always wanted.

348
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,655
You'll deal with GK technology.

349
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,241
How many? Do you have company here?

350
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,455
-A gray suit.
-Yes.

351
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,379
And a navy striped tie.

352
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,548
Good choice. Pajeon is the best.

353
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:32,969
What?

354
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,765
We met in the pub in Cheongdam-dong.

355
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,476
Right?

356
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,229
This is interesting.

357
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,981
What are the odds?

358
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,317
You know, pajeon

359
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,112
tastes the best with chilli.

360
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,373
I'm sorry about that night.

361
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,626
My friend has androphobia.

362
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,712
I kind of guessed.

363
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,507
Otherwise, you wouldn't have done that.

364
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,551
Still,

365
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,681
Cheongpa Women's Correctional Institute

366
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,435
was really brilliant.

367
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,897
Just get the documents.

368
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,566
Just give me what you need to give me.

369
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,360
Well, okay.

370
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,417
Bye, then.

371
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,559
I know I'm being rude,

372
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,937
but can I know the plot
of this documentary?

373
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,858
Work there for a month.

374
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,279
Go to work, have lunch,
and get off work like a real employee.

375
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,034
So what's the story?

376
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,329
The story
where your debt gets paid off at once.

377
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,000
Get some rest.
When I call, pick up right away.

378
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,885
-Hey.
-Hello.

379
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,974
-This is important, so give it your best.
-Yes, sir.

380
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,156
EMPLOYEE CHA JOO-EUN

381
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,140
They're working really hard.

382
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,730
What do you want to eat?

383
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,192
I saw a newly opened restaurant
this morning.

384
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,318
-Really?
-Yes.

385
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,487
-We have to go quickly.
-Let's hurry.

386
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,044
I didn't do anything, but I'm hungry.

387
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,675
Hello.

388
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,097
Do you mind sharing the table?

389
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,100
-Have a seat. One sundaeguk, right?
-Yes.

390
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,561
Thank you.

391
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,648
LEE JEONG-HWAN

392
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,244
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

393
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,005
All right.

394
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,277
Excuse me.

395
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,780
Yes?

396
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,285
If you aren't going to eat the rice,
can I have it?

397
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,291
Thank you.

398
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,425
In return, I'll buy you coffee.

399
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,812
Please wait for me until I finish eating.

400
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,495
By the way,

401
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,082
isn't GK in Yeoksa-dong?

402
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,919
Yes. I came here
to meet with an affiliate.

403
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,129
That sundaeguk place is famous, so…

404
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,964
I see.

405
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,843
Anyway, do you usually eat lunch alone?

406
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,762
No. Just today.

407
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,848
I usually eat in the company cafeteria,

408
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,892
but I felt like having sundaeguk today.

409
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,560
That place is famous, you know.

410
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,903
Well,

411
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,824
that day…

412
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,953
Never mind.

413
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,247
-You don't know either, do you?
-Pardon?

414
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,289
About that day.

415
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:21,669
My superior ordered me to do it,
so I don't know what I was delivering.

416
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,298
I even signed a confidentiality agreement.

417
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,426
Right.

418
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,845
Joo-eun, did you also?

419
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,348
Of course. I signed it, too.
I don't know what it was either.

420
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,602
By the way, how do you know my name?

421
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,729
There.

422
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,985
Anyway,

423
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,989
we met while running an errand
for our companies.

424
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,535
Well,

425
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,456
do you like meat?

426
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,000
-Out of the blue?
-Out of the blue.

427
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,544
I like it all right.

428
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,839
Good. Let's have meat for dinner then.

429
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,883
-Sounds good, right?
-What?

430
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,094
Give me your phone.

431
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,061
Is he also in the same field as I am?

432
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,149
Sir!

433
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,237
I see you're with someone. Hello.

434
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,991
You need to check
the revised sample design.

435
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,036
Oh, right. I should.
Hold this for a second.

436
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,418
Meet me at the cafe
we went to earlier at 7 p.m.

437
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,175
See you later.

438
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,427
Let's go.

439
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,981
TEAM MANAGER LEE JEONG-HWAN

440
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,413
TEAM MANAGER LEE JEONG-HWAN
DEVELOPMENT TEAM TWO

441
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:24,959
What?

442
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,253
Why isn't he picking up?

443
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,633
Hi, this is Development Team Two
of GK technology.

444
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,801
Hi.

445
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,263
May I speak
with Team Manager Lee Jeong-hwan?

446
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:41,225
Team Manager Lee Jeong-hwan.
Could you please hold?

447
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,727
By the way, who should I say is calling?

448
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,314
It's real.

449
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,025
Did they get my phone number?

450
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,778
What if they did?

451
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,155
He gave me his business card.

452
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:30,983
Excuse me.

453
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,111
My friend has an umbrella.
You can take this.

454
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,573
-Thank you.
-Sure.

455
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,539
Joo-eun.

456
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,458
Jeong-hwan.

457
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,627
Why are you so late? I got soaked.

458
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,712
I'll buy you dinner.

459
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,423
Aren't I the lucky one?
I'm glad I got soaked.

460
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,969
For your information,
that place is quite expensive.

461
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,392
My purse! I was in a hurry,

462
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,561
so I forgot to bring it.

463
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,772
You have it in your hand.

464
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:17,363
Well, this is my friend's.

465
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,616
Since it's our first date,
let's go Dutch. Okay?

466
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,326
Let's go.

467
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,553
What's wrong?

468
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,516
It's just that there aren't
that many people here today.

469
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,353
Usually, this place is crowded. It's odd.

470
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,942
I like it because it's quiet.

471
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,612
I don't like crowded and noisy places.

472
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,905
That's not what I meant.

473
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,867
-I wanted to show off.
-Show off what?

474
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,577
You.

475
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,081
I wanted to show you to other people.

476
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,501
-Jeong-hwan.
-Yes.

477
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,378
You've never dated, right?

478
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,176
Yes, I have.

479
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,970
What made you think that?

480
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,180
What do you take me for?

481
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,434
Well,

482
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,522
I've been busy with work.
I've been working hard,

483
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,192
so I had no time to date.

484
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:39,778
"Never dated…"

485
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,120
Let's get out of here.

486
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,590
Isn't this better?

487
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,175
It is.

488
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,720
-I like that it's crowded.
-Me too.

489
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,641
They're busking.

490
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,019
-Shall we watch?
-Shall we?

491
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,438
Whenever it starts to rain

492
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:18,400
I wake up

493
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,654
Your words

494
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:27,534
Have magical powers

495
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,916
They're heartwarming and lovely

496
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,050
-Shall we go that way?
-Sure.

497
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,637
Gosh, there are so many people.

498
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,222
I got what I wished for.

499
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,556
Really?

500
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,183
-Why don't you try these?
-Me?

501
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,817
-How do I look?
-You look smart.

502
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,734
It suits you.

503
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,504
He's so funny.

504
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,508
Hello. You two look great together.

505
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,801
-It's okay.
-No, really.

506
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,178
Okay, then.

507
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:32,850
Joo-eun?

508
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,604
It's me, Miss Cheongyang Pepper!

509
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,114
-What's wrong?
-What?

510
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,992
I suddenly remembered a good restaurant.

511
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,160
The food there is amazing.

512
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,370
I see.

513
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,175
By the way, where is the restaurant?

514
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,135
Right.

515
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,805
The restaurant. Right.

516
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,557
Well…

517
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,144
Oh, no. It's no longer here.

518
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,354
I wonder why.

519
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,444
Maybe there weren't many customers
since it was located in an alley.

520
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,572
This is bad. What should--

521
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,541
Please wait a minute.

522
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,253
Good night.

523
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,339
Good night.

524
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,676
Gosh, I don't want to leave.

525
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,057
We ate so much
so I can't invite you for some noodles.

526
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,144
You can always offer me a cup of coffee.

527
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:42,980
Next time.

528
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,565
Is it because

529
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,820
you live with your parents?

530
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,825
A family has a home and lives together.

531
00:49:55,325 --> 00:50:00,372
Your dad, that bastard,
gave all the money away to that bitch.

532
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,207
I don't regret it.

533
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,834
This isn't a family!

534
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,337
Actually…

535
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,258
I'm an orphan.

536
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:12,718
Oh…

537
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,595
They're not my parents,

538
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:20,058
but I live with a guardian couple.

539
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,561
I see.

540
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,105
Good night, then.

541
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,024
Sure. Good night.

542
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,990
Why did I tell such a serious lie?

543
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,619
"An orphan"? That was so tacky.

544
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,788
Darn it.

545
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,646
-Tell me.
-What?

546
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,106
I know you have a favor.

547
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,487
Why would you turn
an innocent girl into a despicable wench?

548
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:19,159
Do I need a specific reason
to have a drink with you?

549
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:25,373
I'm craving a drink tonight

550
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:30,462
It feels like we're together

551
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:36,426
I look back at our happy days

552
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:43,266
All that I can do now is sigh

553
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,811
Once

554
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,107
a month passes by,

555
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,568
what will happen then?

556
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,821
What do you mean?

557
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,282
Will I still be able to remain
as an employee there?

558
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,160
What I'm trying to say is,

559
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,331
I'd like to work there for about a year.

560
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,672
We're dealing with a conglomerate here.

561
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,508
I'm aware of that. But--

562
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,761
You can't con repeatedly
as an employee there. You should never.

563
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,390
-That's not what I meant.
-Then you should quit soon.

564
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,281
Can you

565
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,492
just help me out?

566
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,330
Please?

567
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,669
Well…

568
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,213
No, I can't.

569
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,758
I really can't.

570
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,887
You can't do that there. Absolutely not.

571
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,473
You have one year.

572
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,143
You'll get paid through your salary.

573
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,774
CALL HISTORY

574
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,448
This is really good.

575
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,382
NEW COMMENT

576
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,777
-Oh, my.
-I bet you're happy.

577
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,488
-He's so cool.
-Lucky you.

578
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,323
-Wow.
-How amazing.

579
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,577
-Accept him!
-Accept him!

580
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,084
Wait.

581
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:18,505
It took me some time
because I bought this in the Netherlands.

582
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,717
I'm sorry. I really am.

583
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,053
-Who are you?
-I…

584
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,140
Joo-eun.

585
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,893
I'm starving, so hurry up.

586
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,573
6 MONTHS LATER

587
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:47,784
All right, then.

588
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:48,785
Wait.

589
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,123
-Are you going to grill it?
-Do you want to do it yourself?

590
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,459
That's not what I meant.
I'm talking about the other woman.

591
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,592
My gosh.

592
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,054
Goodness.

593
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,245
This is pork neck.

594
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,540
Check out this marbling.
It's as good as prime beef.

595
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,043
"Marbling" is just another word for "fat."

596
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,796
You're more knowledgeable than I thought.

597
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,383
Anyway,
do you have any plans this weekend,

598
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,385
Ms. Knowledgeable?

599
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,803
Why do you ask?

600
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,391
You startled me.

601
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,687
You should come to church.

602
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,522
I'm spreading the Word of God here.

603
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,735
Did you think I'd fall for that?
You little…

604
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,237
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

605
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,874
-Get out.
-Are you firing me?

606
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,959
Serve the dishes and grill the meat.

607
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,923
I told you I'm not comfortable with that.

608
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,926
I'll raise your pay.

609
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,303
By how much?

610
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,016
-Nice.
-This is the golden ratio.

611
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,143
-It's perfect.
-You're right.

612
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,103
Thank you.

613
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,783
Excuse me.

614
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,451
-Have a drink.
-Sure.

615
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,453
JEONG-HWAN

616
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,919
This is good. It tastes so sweet.

617
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,130
I'm still at work.

618
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,426
My boss hasn't left yet, so…

619
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,345
You're in front of the company?

620
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,854
I'm sorry!

621
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,247
Sir, you're going to crash the car.

622
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:44,294
If that happens, I will murder you.

623
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,754
If you don't want that to happen,

624
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,340
remind yourself of the time
you first got your license

625
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,550
and drive properly, okay?

626
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,052
Look straight ahead, and let's go.

627
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,439
-Sir.
-Yes?

628
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,400
Wanna make money
while you relieve your stress?

629
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,333
You bastard. Is this your house?
Why are you parked here?

630
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,502
You're interfering with the traffic.

631
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,462
Move aside, you bastard!

632
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,215
What a selfish, little bastard.

633
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,888
Did you wait for a long time? I'm sorry.

634
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,015
My boss just left the office.

635
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,101
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

636
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:47,357
It must've been tough for you, though.
I think they're making you work too much.

637
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:52,820
Put on your seatbelt.

638
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,666
Where are we going?

639
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,084
You'll see.

640
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,045
You're making me excited.

641
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,008
Don't you smell something?

642
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:15,927
Like what?

643
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,556
It smells like burnt food.
Maybe it's meat.

644
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,809
I suddenly caught a whiff. Is it the car?

645
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,481
I'm sorry.

646
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:34,529
My boss really loves meat,

647
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,739
so we had pork ribs for lunch.

648
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,367
Pork ribs.

649
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,744
That's what it was.

650
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,162
I see.

651
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,416
I can't believe
he wanted a barbecue for lunch.

652
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,629
I bet you didn't even get to eat properly.

653
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,923
Let's have something delicious.

654
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,935
-Shall we go inside?
-Sure.

655
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,692
Hello.

656
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,904
These are my parents.

657
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,824
You're very beautiful.

658
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:23,369
Jeong-hwan told us
so much about you. Have a seat.

659
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,373
Have a seat, Joo-eun.

660
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,544
I'm sorry. I need to go to the restroom.

661
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,389
Can't we just date?

662
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,437
Why do you keep making me
shoot a documentary?

663
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:29,519
It's nice to meet you, Father and Mother.

664
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,731
-My name is Cha Joo-eun.
-Hello. Have a seat, please.

665
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,492
You see, I'm an orphan.

666
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,787
I'm sorry, Father and Mother.

667
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:53,376
Don't be.
Jeong-hwan already told us about that.

668
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,044
Please think of her

669
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,297
as your daughter.

670
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,717
Then instead of calling us
Father and Mother,

671
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,428
call us Mom and Dad.

672
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,431
That means I have a daughter now.

673
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,890
You're right.

674
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,521
Eat up. Enjoy. Here.

675
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,606
Here.

676
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,191
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the food.

677
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,528
Thank you.

678
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,321
For what?

679
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,825
For meeting with my parents.
You must have been flustered.

680
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:30,580
And thank you for being honest
and telling me that you're an orphan.

681
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,916
How could I lie about that?

682
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,502
Why not?
You can even hire people these days

683
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,922
to act as your friends,
family members, and your parents.

684
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,175
People use services like that
to con people.

685
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,385
Really?

686
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,638
How could they lie about such a thing?

687
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:49,474
Right?

688
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,687
-Why don't we drink some more?
-What?

689
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,982
It seemed like
you couldn't drink comfortably back there.

690
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,068
What should we have?

691
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,197
Pizza and makgeolli?

692
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,618
Don't you think
that's a strange combination?

693
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,621
You obviously haven't tried it.
It's actually not that bad.

694
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,003
How is it?

695
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,424
It's much tastier than I thought.

696
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,098
I'm learning magic tricks
as a hobby these days.

697
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,685
-Would you like to see?
-Really? Sure.

698
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,563
Can you give me your hand?

699
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,902
No, the other hand.

700
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,616
Why?

701
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,159
Just give me your hand.

702
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,871
Jeong-hwan, you're about to do

703
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,585
what I think you're going to do, right?

704
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:08,636
Jeong-hwan.

705
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,681
I'll be frank.

706
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,559
I'm not ready yet.

707
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:16,727
-And--
-You're right.

708
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,981
I was going to propose.

709
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,567
But couldn't you just

710
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,070
have humored me and played along?

711
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,199
Who refuses a proposal

712
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,619
even before receiving it?

713
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,705
That's not it.

714
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,958
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

715
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:46,007
Let me go outside
and get some fresh air for a bit.

716
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:47,633
I'm sorry.

717
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,529
This is…

718
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,492
my favorite dish here.

719
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,870
Isn't it tasty? I told you.

720
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,056
Aren't you going to

721
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,518
show me your magic trick?

722
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,277
All right.

723
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,834
Give me your hand.

724
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:54,343
Look. There's nothing in my hand, right?

725
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:03,269
I'm going to put my hand over yours.

726
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,312
There's nothing in between, right?

727
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,316
Okay.

728
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:14,905
Now, I'm going to flip it twice.

729
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,075
Look carefully.
It happened in the blink of an eye, right?

730
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:20,911
Ta-da.

731
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,126
Just a second.

732
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,549
Ta-da.

733
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:39,972
Joo-eun.

734
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,809
Will you marry me?

735
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,920
Remember this one thing.

736
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,257
Don't tell him first. Got it?

737
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,635
Make sure you don't,

738
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,763
and everything will be okay.

739
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,308
Do you think so?

740
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,060
Of course.

741
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,521
There's nothing wrong with us.

742
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,524
We're all the same.

743
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,600
-Dad.
-Yes?

744
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,812
I'm getting married.

745
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,817
Is there anything you want to say?

746
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:18,445
Is it a documentary?

747
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,368
Is it real?

748
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:25,995
I'll live

749
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,498
happily.

750
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,478
Thank you.

751
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,735
What's his job?

752
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,330
Answer me.

753
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,668
He's just an office worker
at GK technology, a conglomerate.

754
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,754
So?

755
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:21,258
You don't need to attend our wedding.
I already told him that I'm an orphan.

756
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,512
So?

757
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,684
As for the wedding gifts,

758
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:34,355
I've managed to buy them
with my own money.

759
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,150
-But the problem is the house deposit.
-How much?

760
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,069
Around 50 million won.

761
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,113
And how exactly will you pay me back?

762
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,282
What?

763
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:50,204
Don't tell me you expected me
to just give you that money.

764
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,918
If you need me to write a contract
or a promissory note, I'll do that.

765
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,337
So how will you pay me back?

766
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,381
I will. Don't worry.

767
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,841
I'll pay you back. I can.

768
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,388
You're obviously filming
another documentary.

769
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,265
A marriage documentary.

770
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:16,480
But is a man who can't even afford
an apartment worth it?

771
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,441
You won't be getting your money's worth.

772
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,569
Know your place and fish a wealthier guy.

773
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,363
That's not it.

774
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,866
Of course, he can afford an apartment.

775
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,702
He has a nice job,
and his family's wealthy.

776
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:35,708
It's just that I feel sorry.

777
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,297
A documentary with some truth to it.

778
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:44,675
It's a flop.

779
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,971
End it. It's for the best.

780
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,640
Can't you just help me out?

781
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:53,475
You're my mom.

782
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,227
You said you're an orphan.

783
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,229
My gosh.

784
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,023
I don't want to hear it.

785
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:04,069
After all the documentaries
we've filmed, do you still not get it?

786
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:06,947
Look at your dad.

787
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,576
He's in jail because he confused
a documentary for reality.

788
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,665
I'll forgive you for disappearing

789
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,752
when that bitch caught me
and never visiting me once in prison.

790
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,253
So help me.

791
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:22,880
Don't forgive me.

792
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,600
The interest rate will be high. Got it?

793
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:51,510
What is it?

794
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,262
Let me have a drink.

795
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,169
Have some food too.

796
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,843
-I heard you're getting married.
-Yes.

797
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,097
With who?

798
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:41,935
Should I find out on my own?

799
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,061
Uncle.

800
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,482
Do you have feelings for me?

801
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,487
Damn it. I don't know anymore.

802
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:03,957
A marriage documentary

803
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:10,047
won't be easy.

804
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,060
I'm going to become happy

805
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:07,646
no matter what.

806
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,398
-You look happy.
-Hello.

807
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:12,985
Don't make any mistakes.

808
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:17,823
I can't believe I'm Ms. Cha's guardian.
Don't I look like her older brother?

809
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,746
-Hello.
-Hello.

810
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,373
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

811
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:27,749
Thank you.

812
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:47,019
Let me take a photo.

813
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:50,188
Please smile for the camera.
One, two, three.

814
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,609
Smile. One, two, three.

815
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:55,652
I'll take one more.

816
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,905
Relax. One, two, three.

817
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,575
Joo-eun.

818
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:03,201
Hey.

819
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:05,412
Min-jeong.

820
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,584
Congratulations.

821
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:11,752
Thanks.

822
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,837
I'm truly happy for you.

823
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:16,006
One, two, three.

824
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,425
I don't catch bouquets, ma'am.

825
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:21,011
That's not how you talk
to your friends, is it?

826
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,139
-I don't do bouquets.
-That's fine by me.

827
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:25,849
Who wants to catch it?

828
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:31,772
Whoever catches it
usually gets an extra 50,000 won.

829
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,649
Then I'll catch it. Free of charge.

830
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,876
I'm nervous.

831
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,795
Right? Me too.

832
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:58,298
It's good.

833
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:13,897
It's been over an hour.

834
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,108
Something's wrong for sure.

835
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:19,736
Hold on.

836
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:30,122
Excuse me, but have you gotten
in touch with Jeong-hwan?

837
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,128
It's a flop.

838
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,255
Sorry?

839
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,757
Gosh, it's another flop.

840
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,593
Where are you going? What's going on?

841
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,345
Didn't you hear him? It's a flop.

842
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,056
What?

843
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:50,517
Gosh.

844
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:55,981
Why isn't he picking up?

845
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,569
What's going on, Jeong-hwan?

846
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:03,613
Is he here?

847
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,080
Joo-eun, they're all hired actors.

848
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:13,790
What?

849
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,460
They're all fake like us.

850
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,838
What do you mean?

851
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,258
Darn it. They even ate before leaving.

852
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:25,969
This is driving me crazy.

853
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,346
What are you talking about?

854
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:30,515
They're all fake.

855
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,311
This was a marriage scam.

856
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,758
-Are you seeing someone?
-It's delicious.

857
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:07,511
No, I'm not.

858
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,305
Keep your cool. Don't get all emotional.

859
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:13,099
The last documentary I filmed,
what was it?

860
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,395
There's a request for a contract killing.
Do you want the job?

861
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:19,773
I'm Cha Joo-eun.

862
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:20,982
Hey, you came.

863
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,984
This plan looks overcomplicated.

864
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:26,863
We've combed through everywhere.
He's as good as an intelligent agent.

865
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,073
Who directed it?

866
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,492
-Lee Jeong-hwan.
-What?

867
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:32,160
The team manager from GK.

868
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,956
Everyone says you're the best of the best,
"Spy Lee."

869
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,416
You were so brave, Cha Joo-eun.

870
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,670
I trust that you'll find it
as soon as possible.

871
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:45,257
You're insane, Cha Joo-eun.

872
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,762
