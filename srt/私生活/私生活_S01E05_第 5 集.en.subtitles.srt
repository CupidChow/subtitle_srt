1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,886
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS, AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:02,270
People still believe
that they each have their own privacy.

4
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,649
Along with a preposterous belief
that it will be protected by the law.

5
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,985
But is that really true?

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,987
We live in a world
where we feel like losers

7
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,823
if we don't share our private lives.

8
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,661
So we share and sometimes steal
people's private lives.

9
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,457
For our personal interest,

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,920
we collect, analyze,
and use the private lives of others.

11
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,842
Right now, Korea is facing the era
of shared privacy while we are engaged

12
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,552
in a war of privacy.

13
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,183
The worst are the people who take
advantage of the private lives of others.

14
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,395
So I'm going to find out
who those bastards are.

15
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,984
That tenacious dog.

16
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,375
But why did the dog suddenly
stop chasing me and disappear?

17
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,276
Why

18
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,778
and when did it start to go wrong?

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,699
Was it because of President Choi's ledger?

20
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,919
Do you admit to the charges?

21
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,715
Did you embezzle over 100 billion won?
Please answer my question.

22
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,427
I will fully cooperate
with the investigation.

23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,137
Prosecution summoned President Choi

24
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,306
of UI Construction for embezzlement,

25
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,309
professional negligence,
fraudulent accounting, and so on.

26
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,978
-He showed up at 9:30 a.m.
-It's not like you to watch the news.

27
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,148
Hey, how many times must I tell you?

28
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,360
Documentary producers like us
must stay on top of current events.

29
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,695
This is good information.

30
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,364
Okay.
I just need to check out my favorite band.

31
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,616
-You brat.
-No.

32
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,577
-This means war.
-Mom, are you mad?

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,913
-Come over here.
-Stop it!

34
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,664
-Honey, help me out!
-Stop it!

35
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,583
-Count me out.
-I told you to stop.

36
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,211
-Hey!
-Goodness.

37
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,420
-Hey.
-Let go of me.

38
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,965
At a press conference yesterday,

39
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,425
he insisted his innocence.

40
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,801
I'm innocent.

41
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,054
I did not embezzle any money.

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,184
And I did not use any illegal means
such as fraudulent accounting

43
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,812
or cash advance loans
for personal monetary gain.

44
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:57,028
How much can you offer for each project?

45
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,615
I'm sure you already heard

46
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,076
I'm the best in this industry.

47
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,581
Previously, President Choi claimed
he fell victim to political revenge.

48
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,668
However, President Choi was suspected
to keep a secret ledger for bribesâ€¦

49
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,127
This is from the prosecution.

50
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,089
Do they have it then?

51
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,006
No.

52
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,176
If the prosecution had the ledger,

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,387
they wouldn't use
a scare tactic like that.

54
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,764
They'd just use the evidence.

55
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,561
They want you to think
they have it like you assumed.

56
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,773
They're warning
the people on the list to play nice.

57
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,859
That they'd better not think about

58
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,363
reforming the prosecution
and stay quiet unless they want to die.

59
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,166
PRESENT DAY, 2020

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,459
So what happened?

61
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,046
What is Joo-eun doing now?

62
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,047
Is she okay?

63
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,342
So you have

64
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,054
no interest in how I'm doing at all,
do you?

65
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,266
Why would you say that?

66
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,852
Of course, I'd like to know
how you're doing.

67
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,479
But this is pretty serious.

68
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,481
Joo-eun isn't answering her phone.

69
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm just worried about her.

70
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,739
The guy who almost became
your son-in-law is dead.

71
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,449
-What?
-It was a car accident.

72
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,326
On the day of the wedding.

73
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,578
What--

74
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,081
So we don't know if this bastard
had set our daughter up on purpose

75
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,043
or if he had been forced
to con our daughter.

76
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,004
Oh, Lord.

77
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,382
Another unfortunate soul has joined you.

78
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,301
Please take good care--

79
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,219
Drop your act when you're with me.

80
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,684
Please take care of him. Amen.

81
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:58,983
I'm here again to tell you
how messed up her life has become.

82
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,152
Because this is all your fault.

83
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,532
On the other hand, I am very happy.

84
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,701
My business is getting bigger day by day.

85
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,454
You're awful.

86
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,082
If you feel that way,
my goal has been fulfilled.

87
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,585
Oh, Father.

88
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,781
Any calls for me?

89
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,458
I want a cup of coffee, too.

90
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,298
Is she going to pay my wages or what?

91
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,927
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

92
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,474
You're here. Have some coffee.

93
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,353
I have such a big heart.
I couldn't show up empty-handed.

94
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,772
I've brought a cake, too.

95
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,618
Seriously?

96
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,038
Is ignoring me
your way of getting back at me?

97
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,334
I noticed the hard drive was gone.

98
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,756
Oh, my. Who is this?

99
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,259
I almost didn't recognize you.

100
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,762
You've aged so much since I last saw you.

101
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,847
It makes me happy.

102
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,850
Are your eyes already going bad already?

103
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,605
Gosh. Look at your dirty clothes.

104
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,150
Did you build a sandcastle
with your friends at the playground?

105
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,237
I planted trees
to lower the micro-dust level.

106
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,949
But then again, people like you

107
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,287
won't be able to understand
the noble value of community service.

108
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,877
You must be desperate.
You came back pretty quickly.

109
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,255
They say that bad relationships
can get better over time.

110
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,967
I'm starting to find
your rudeness adorable as time goes by.

111
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,552
I'm a saint, you know.

112
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,639
Old lady, you'd better speak nicely to me,

113
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,516
so that I can be nice to you.

114
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,685
When will you grow up?
I'm mature, not old.

115
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,483
Just now, I wasted my time ditching
a college kid who was chasing after me.

116
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,818
Why? Is his father a widower?

117
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,779
What a good son.

118
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,822
You're so immature.

119
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,785
Do you think you can make me feel
like a loser if you mock me like that?

120
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,038
I already did.
I can feel a loser vibe from you.

121
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,832
Gosh, I should ventilate the place.

122
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:13,094
You know,
I was at a very important place just now.

123
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,848
Did you know that Edward has a puppy?

124
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,188
Aren't you dying
to find out where Edward is now?

125
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,862
Fine. If you want to brag, make it quick.

126
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,031
I'll listen.

127
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,784
You should ask me politely.

128
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,997
Gosh, what a piece of work
you've grown up to become.

129
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,164
It's all thanks to you.

130
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,878
Fine.

131
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,882
It's no big deal, and I'm sure
you've been dreaming about this moment.

132
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,050
Please, do tell.

133
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,686
Please, tell me.

134
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,361
What's your relationship with him?

135
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,991
DANGER

136
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,369
This secret ledger had personally been
filled out by President Choi.

137
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,079
Along with a list of politicians

138
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,790
and high-ranking public officials
he had sponsored,

139
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,586
there's also a list of the dates,
places, and amounts of bribes he gave out.

140
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,862
-Police. How can I help you?
-Someone's died.

141
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,780
The killer is here.

142
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,199
The killer is here!

143
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,303
Who are you?

144
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,888
Are you up?

145
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,349
Who am I?

146
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,188
Let's just say I saved your life.

147
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,026
You can thank me with all your heart.
You can mean it.

148
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,715
What do you want?

149
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,932
You should beg me, not ask questions.

150
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,351
Beg for your life.

151
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
Beg me to tell you how to save yourself.

152
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,276
Someone's been calling you. Answer it.

153
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,866
You called the police.

154
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,161
The call got cut off.
They'll want to follow up.

155
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,956
It's fine. You can answer it.

156
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,085
Answer it and tell them the truth
and everything you witnessed.

157
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,923
You can just leave me out of it
as I saved your life.

158
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:02,925
Oh, right.

159
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,599
I need you to do something before that.

160
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,068
You're ridiculous.

161
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,025
What do you want? Who are you?

162
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,611
Don't move.

163
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,156
Do you watch the news?

164
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,702
Even if you don't,
I'm sure you heard about President Choi.

165
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,787
I used to be a news anchor.

166
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,874
At which TV station?
I don't remember seeing you on TV.

167
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,459
It was local.

168
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,960
Then, you must know

169
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,880
what this is.

170
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,344
What will happen
if people find out about this?

171
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,513
Is that why

172
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,017
President Choi was killed?

173
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,268
Bingo.

174
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,895
And right now,

175
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,482
you're in danger for witnessing the scene.

176
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,777
The whole world will be looking for you.

177
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,112
So put it down.

178
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,531
I know you won't shoot me.

179
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,118
Don't come near me. Stop.

180
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,871
Stop right there, you bastard!

181
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,449
Think about it.

182
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,829
Who do you think is trying
to lend you a helping hand right now?

183
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,624
Who do you think
you should join hands with?

184
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,347
Isn't there a backdoor?

185
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,281
You will leave the country
as Gil Heum-mi, a Korean Chinese woman.

186
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,956
But you will return

187
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,375
as Sophia Chung.

188
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,763
Do you have any cold beer or something?

189
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,264
No, I don't.

190
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,558
There's a lot.

191
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,479
Don't drink it. It's mine.

192
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,414
You have one too. You must be frustrated.
It'll make you feel better.

193
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,582
Forget it.

194
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,126
I won't drink with you.

195
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,507
What's my relationship with him?

196
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,137
I told you. He was my student teacher.

197
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,182
Come on. Don't act like a rookie.

198
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,812
I'm the one who has the intel you want.

199
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,273
What?

200
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,734
You're not desperate enough?

201
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,183
No way.

202
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,444
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

203
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,088
Goodbye.

204
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,762
Edward, you son of a bitch.

205
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,358
Does the reason matter?

206
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,653
What's important is finding him.

207
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,032
I'm going to find Edward,

208
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,035
and ask him myself.

209
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:08,582
I guess many things have made you
furious and hurt your pride.

210
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,792
Aren't you the same?

211
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,922
You have a lot to ask Spy Lee.

212
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,299
That makes me wonder

213
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,720
why Spy Lee died

214
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,433
on his wedding day, of all days.

215
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,106
I know quite a few police officers.

216
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,322
Don't you think we should drink together?

217
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,866
I do.

218
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,121
I feel like our target
is being narrowed down to one man.

219
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,708
It looks like

220
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,920
he's the only one
who'd do that to Spy Lee.

221
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,880
Kim Jae-wook?

222
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,799
Who else?

223
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,640
Look, old lady.
Stop trying to make up weird stories,

224
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,767
and weaving them together.

225
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,812
Talk like a nun
if you want the information I have.

226
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,523
Talk nicely and honestly.

227
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,945
I'm practically a nun and a bhikkhuni.

228
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,364
You can probably make a rosary
with my sarira.

229
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,199
You know

230
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,078
what Spy Lee's last mission was.

231
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,502
I can't eat delicious food
or go travelling if I don't work,

232
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,628
so I work.

233
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,973
I don't understand.

234
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,599
-Life is boring.
-Excuse me.

235
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,896
If you don't mind,
could you spare me five minutes?

236
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,856
Why should I?

237
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,526
If you laugh in five minutes,
give me another five minutes.

238
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,449
-Can you guess how we became friends?
-Through college?

239
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,784
Cheongpa Women's Correctional Institute.

240
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,536
We were cellmates.

241
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,579
This is new.

242
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,628
I took the courage to come here
despite the embarrassment.

243
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,465
I'll retreat for now, but I'll be back.

244
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,303
He's cool.

245
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,389
Why did you reject him so frankly?

246
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,435
"Cheongpa Women's Correctional Institute."

247
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,439
What a way to reject someone.

248
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,402
Am I that unattractive?

249
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,083
Let me see it first.

250
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,509
All right.

251
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,680
-How's it going?
-Yes, it is.

252
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,141
If you're stuck
or if you feel you're incapable,

253
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,893
ask for help anytime.

254
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,312
I'll cover for you.

255
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,982
Just keep stalking celebrities.

256
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,278
Didn't you know?
I transferred to the Yeouido Team.

257
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,701
You punk. You're terribly uninformed.

258
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,119
The Civil Team.

259
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,706
You know
why you guys are called shadows, right?

260
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,458
To put it simply,

261
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,211
it means you're my shadow.

262
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,088
So follow along,

263
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,756
okay?

264
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,595
Anyway,
call me whenever you're in trouble.

265
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,934
-Seok-ho.
-What?

266
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,527
Actually,

267
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,947
I need your help.

268
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,325
Really?

269
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,201
What is it?

270
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,165
Go ahead. Tell me.

271
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,958
Please lend me 10 million won.

272
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,128
-What?
-Look at your face, jerk.

273
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,007
Go check yourself in the mirror.

274
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,302
That's who you are.

275
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,516
That son of a bitchâ€¦

276
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,938
So, Jeong Yoon-kyung,
who we thought died, is actually alive,

277
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,483
and Arsonist Kim
was the one who helped her?

278
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,400
Yes.

279
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,820
They've been partners since then,

280
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,782
but it seems like
they recently had a falling-out.

281
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,910
That's why she went
to the detective agency.

282
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,578
Yes.

283
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,373
Why did Arsonist Kim

284
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,876
do such a thing
without telling the company?

285
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,963
I wasn't able to find out why yet.

286
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,132
Fine.

287
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,135
Hand the case over to UI
and get your hands off it.

288
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,514
You don't want to be tangled up

289
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,557
with President Choi's suicide.

290
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,476
It could cause a misunderstanding.

291
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,561
Let's stop here.

292
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,522
I'll contact UI.

293
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,898
Hand it over yourself.

294
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,654
-Sir.
-Go on.

295
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,989
I'll take it until the end.

296
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,826
GK should know about every information,

297
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,703
and sharing information

298
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,997
with other companies
isn't what GK should do.

299
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,460
Even if we keep the case,

300
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,089
the Yeouido Team, not the Civil Team,
will be in charge of the case.

301
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,300
Plus, we'll make a move after UI does.

302
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,218
Got it?

303
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,932
Don't you know I'm doing this
because I care about you?

304
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,853
The report was made under your name.

305
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,189
I'll leave the report up to you.

306
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,444
CAUSE OF DEATH: DROWNING

307
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,822
You're doing this
because you're in denial.

308
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,409
That report will become fake.

309
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,161
JEONG YOON-KYUNG

310
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,330
If you understood,
go hand over the file, okay?

311
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,999
Yes, sir.

312
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,555
UI will send over a female employee

313
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,348
wearing a yellow hairpin.

314
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,776
Good choice. Pajeon is the best.

315
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,362
We met in the pub in Cheongdam-dong.

316
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,493
Bye, then.

317
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:31,204
NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE WEDDING

318
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,775
SOPHIA CHUNG

319
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,426
-Poong-yeon.
-Yes?

320
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,886
Can you play the dashcam?

321
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,982
SPY LEE

322
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,085
Why aren't you picking up?

323
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,712
Men in suits are tailing me.

324
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,631
Can you look into it for me?

325
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,550
I'm the type who enjoys solitude,

326
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,970
so you're the only one I can count on.

327
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,180
You'll help me, right?

328
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,558
-This is Spy Lee.
-Did you look into it?

329
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,150
Your information

330
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,112
has been handed over to UI.

331
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,535
What?

332
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,870
I'm saying Jeong Yoon-kyung's information

333
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,623
is in the hands of

334
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,919
President Choi's second son
Choi Yong-jin, the president of UI.

335
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,214
Who the hell are you?

336
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,591
As you well know,

337
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,677
you have to be careful

338
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,889
who you choose to side with to survive.

339
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,102
Why has UI entered
the picture all of a sudden?

340
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,563
I found out about you and Kim Jae-wook

341
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,107
while I was investigating.

342
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,900
Kim Jae-wook?

343
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:52,947
Edward Kim.
Kim Jae-wook is his Korean name.

344
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,659
Kim Jae-wookâ€¦

345
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,245
KIM JAE-WOOK

346
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,664
Did you work at GK?

347
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,294
I used to.

348
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,131
Before that, I was with the NIS.

349
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,300
And before that,

350
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,888
I worked at the Office of Civil Affairs.

351
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,725
What a colorful life.

352
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:24,937
You'll end up

353
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,815
like me soon.

354
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,326
So,

355
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,287
you sold my information?

356
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,122
I'm sorry about that.

357
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,791
Then, Edward,

358
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,459
no,

359
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,588
what about Kim Jae-wook?
Did you give them his information?

360
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,547
No.

361
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,301
Because I haven't found him.

362
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,012
You're such a scumbag!

363
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,597
Listen carefully, Ms. Jeong.

364
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,059
Forget about Kim Jae-wook

365
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,479
if you want to live.

366
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:10,983
So

367
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,487
pack your bag and leave the hotel now.

368
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,710
Leave right now.

369
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,363
-Get the door!
-Okay.

370
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,374
-Push.
-Hurry and push.

371
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,840
-Push!
-Push harder!

372
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,977
-Move back.
-Pull it back!

373
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:14,857
Hey!

374
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,110
Catch them!

375
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,906
Damn it.

376
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,164
You don't just own
a detective agency, do you?

377
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,459
You do something else, don't you?

378
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,754
I'm just highly interested
in conglomerate matters.

379
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:43,552
Fine. I didn't think
you'd spill that easily anyway.

380
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,681
Then who are you?

381
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,935
Are you a witch or a prince charming?

382
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,437
Which one are you?

383
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,939
Consider me a genie.

384
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,067
I just help those in need.

385
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,235
"In need"?

386
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:02,989
Fine.

387
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,950
Since we've come this far,

388
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,620
I guess I should listen to your story.

389
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,749
How much do you know about me?

390
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,085
Answer this first.

391
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,297
Why are you so important?

392
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,216
What do you mean?

393
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,719
Why does UI need you?

394
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,222
That's becauseâ€¦

395
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,476
Don't you know?

396
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,396
That I'm the witness?

397
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,614
If that's what this was about,

398
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,036
then they wouldn't have sent those men.

399
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,040
They would've sent a hospitable attorney

400
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,668
and would've escorted you out.

401
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,964
They only send those men

402
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,383
when they're after something.

403
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,553
The men who won't hesitate
to torture you a bit

404
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,307
to make you spill
about something they want.

405
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,560
That's what they do.

406
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,362
Is it the ledger?

407
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,739
President Choi's ledger.

408
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,575
Do you have it?

409
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,993
No.

410
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,162
I don't.

411
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,706
Kim Jae-wook has it?

412
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,460
Did you hand it over to him?

413
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,338
That means

414
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,133
you have no more cards to play.

415
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,305
Leave this country right now

416
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,141
if you want to live.

417
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,202
Honey, are we going swimming today?

418
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,037
Yes, we are.

419
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,163
Excuse me.

420
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,334
What are youâ€¦

421
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,670
doing?

422
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,132
-What is this? Let's go.
-Okay.

423
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,466
Goodbye.

424
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,511
Were you hiding behind me?

425
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,637
No, I wasn't.

426
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,515
-That upset me a little.
-What were you craving again?

427
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,892
-Jjamppong.
-All right.

428
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,519
Their tangsuyuk tasted the best.

429
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,979
Where's the key?

430
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,648
-It's right here.
-Come on. You startled me.

431
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,568
All right.

432
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,076
How could you do this to me?

433
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,871
Honey, let me explain.

434
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,832
Forget it. I can't believe
I trusted you all this time.

435
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,916
No, let me explain.

436
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,835
I want to be alone! Don't follow me!

437
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,088
Honey, wait up! Honey!

438
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,674
Hold up, honey! Wait for me!

439
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,686
-Honey, I said I was sorry.
-Whatever.

440
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,022
Gosh.

441
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,957
FULL

442
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,547
Take the next one.

443
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,807
-It's over there. The red one.
-Okay.

444
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,409
Where are we headed?

445
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,796
So you're saying

446
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:34,093
that Kim Jae-wook is the one
who sent those men to the hotel?

447
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,762
Then who else?

448
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,518
I was planning to spend some time

449
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,564
in Puerto Rico meditating
and doing some thinking.

450
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,777
But it all felt slightly unfair.

451
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,488
That's why I came back,

452
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,702
but Spy Lee had already passed away.

453
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,333
You also think he was murdered, don't you?

454
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,546
If not, how could you explain

455
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,217
why he went so far away
on his wedding day?

456
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,346
Unless someone dragged him there.

457
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,724
Kim Jae-wook.

458
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,104
Hey, sit down.

459
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,026
I heard

460
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,696
that UI made a move yesterday.

461
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,533
Is that so?

462
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,368
What do you think happened?

463
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,497
Do you think
they caught Jeong Yoon-kyung or not?

464
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,666
I'm not sure.

465
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,878
They failed.

466
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,298
Someone must've told her.

467
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,634
She got on a plane and left the country.

468
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,807
I got intel that UI's pondering
whether to fly out or not.

469
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,227
That's not our business anymore,
so I couldn't care less.

470
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,271
It's all done.

471
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,150
-Sir.
-What is it?

472
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,278
What are you planning to do
with Kim Jae-wook?

473
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,696
What do you mean?

474
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,949
Are you going to let him be?

475
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:25,245
Do you think Arsonist Kim
could do something single-handedly?

476
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,665
He's not the type to stay put.

477
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,959
I don't know what you're thinking,

478
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,295
but don't worry.

479
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,049
UI will take care of him for us.

480
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,385
That's why we gave them the files.

481
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,807
Yes, sir.

482
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,352
It's tough, isn't it?

483
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:50,771
Is it for you?

484
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,315
I'm having a blast.
I always enjoy what I do.

485
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,651
Then continue living that way.

486
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,362
You're the only one
among the team managers.

487
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,491
The only bachelor.

488
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:03,951
Right.

489
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,122
What if they find someone for you?

490
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,126
They don't care about the face,
personality, or preferences.

491
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,504
They'll set you up as long as
you have similar backgrounds.

492
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,923
You know where you came from.

493
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,175
You grew up in an orphanage.

494
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,011
In addition, you're a scholarship student.

495
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,973
You'll meet a headstrong woman like you.

496
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,308
And I'm pretty sure

497
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,436
she'll be hideous.

498
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,733
I have a girlfriend.

499
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,153
I'm meeting her parents
and getting married soon.

500
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,196
So prepare a good gift for me.

501
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,701
Hey.

502
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,203
Does she know?

503
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,208
About your detective agency?

504
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,174
You better not get caught.

505
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,762
Don't ruin GK's reputation.

506
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,358
What should we eat?

507
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:20,986
Jeong-hwan?

508
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,823
-Jeong-hwan.
-Yes?

509
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,825
What do you want?

510
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,327
Right.

511
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,457
Why are we here?

512
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,251
-What?
-Why did we come here?

513
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,253
We could've just ordered in.
This is troublesome.

514
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:49,306
Yoon-seok,
I'm afraid you'll have to eat alone today.

515
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,224
What?

516
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,394
Fine. Hold on.

517
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,773
May I sit with her?

518
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:08,927
Excuse me.

519
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,598
My friend has an umbrella.
You can take this.

520
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,141
-Thank you.
-Sure.

521
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,063
-Joo-eun.
-Jeong-hwan.

522
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,732
Why are you so late? I got soaked.

523
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,374
GROOM: LEE JEONG-HWAN
BRIDE: CHA JOO-EUN

524
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,543
Congratulations.

525
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:42,961
Thank you.

526
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,143
Darn it. She's really pretty.

527
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,854
And she's young.

528
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,485
Yes. Mocha, please.

529
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:07,861
Yes.

530
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:31,718
He controlled politics, the prosecution,
the police, and the judiciary.

531
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,596
Every single one of them was on the take.

532
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,183
From what I know, there was no solid proof
to prove anything.

533
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,601
Of course.

534
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,605
They all got away with it because he died.

535
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,281
MY HUSBAND

536
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,825
Yes, Jeong-hwan.

537
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,910
What were you up to?

538
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,538
Preparing dinner, of course.

539
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,206
I'm making bulgogi.

540
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,042
Gosh, that sounds tasty.

541
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,169
I forgot to buy some drinks.

542
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,714
Pick up some soju on your way home

543
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,465
if you want to eat this.

544
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,011
Okay. I will hurry.

545
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,723
By the way, is something wrong?

546
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,266
No.

547
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,268
Nothing's wrong.

548
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,188
Come home quickly. I miss you.

549
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,149
Okay.

550
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,909
-He's calling for us!
-Okay, I'm on my way.

551
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,506
Vivian, hand.

552
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,716
Okay. Turn around.

553
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,511
Bang!

554
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,854
Vivian.

555
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:20,734
Vivian.

556
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,617
I'm hungry.

557
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,496
Welcome home.

558
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,261
Hey, you're here.

559
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:31,679
Hey.

560
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,391
What's with the outfit?

561
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,059
Do you sing?

562
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,478
Are you a tenor? Or was it a soprano?

563
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,400
I'm a groomsman at my friend's wedding.

564
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,318
They do that in Korea?

565
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,903
Yes, quite often.

566
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,614
The file's safe, right?

567
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,324
-Of course.
-Where is it?

568
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,869
Here. Good?

569
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,454
Good.

570
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,791
I'll be away
on a business trip for a few days.

571
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,835
Keep it safe, okay?

572
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,877
I got it.

573
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,212
Bye.

574
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,423
Jeong-hwan.

575
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,758
You look quite good in a tux.

576
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,430
I'm sick of people
telling me that I look good.

577
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:18,226
Cut the crap. It's making me sick.

578
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,021
Bye.

579
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,758
Yoon-seok!

580
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,022
Yoon-seok.

581
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,237
Yoon-seok! No!

582
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,696
No!

583
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,791
Yoon-seok.

584
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,417
Yoon-seok.

585
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,045
Yoon-seok, wake up.

586
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,547
Wake up.

587
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,341
Open your eyes, you son of a bitch!

588
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,759
Yoon-seok.

589
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,844
Yoon-seok!

590
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,894
The file's safe, right?

591
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,187
-Of course.
-Where is it?

592
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,791
Yoon-seok.

593
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,335
Yoon-seok.

594
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,254
I'm sorry.

595
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,593
Yoon-seokâ€¦

596
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,023
PC GRAVEYARD

597
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,248
Fine.

598
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,543
I'll die.

599
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,564
I'm sorry.

600
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,357
I really am.

601
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,362
Vivian.

602
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,072
Vivian!

603
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,618
Vivian.

604
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,288
Vivian.

605
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,832
Find her!

606
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,378
I found her!

607
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,338
Where?

608
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,298
Over here, sir.

609
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,597
Vivian.

610
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:03,858
No!

611
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,429
If Spy Lee had gotten greedy

612
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:36,432
and tried to take the ledger from himâ€¦

613
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,438
The person
who helped Jeong Yoon-kyungÂ was me.

614
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,023
So you were her prince charming?

615
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,610
-What kind of person was Jeong-hwan?
-He was a beast.

616
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,778
Where is that bastard?

617
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,822
Sir. I'll be born again.

618
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:55,326
I thought you wanted me to forget him.

619
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,994
Don't force yourself.

620
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,622
If forgetting him is hard,
you can't, then.

621
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,460
