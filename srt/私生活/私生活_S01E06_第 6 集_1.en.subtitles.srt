1
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,886
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,460
Talk.

4
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,422
A woman who seemed to be
in her 20s broke in.

5
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,758
I started to chase her with Vivian.

6
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,345
Vivian went ahead of me,
so I was chasing her behind Vivian.

7
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,806
I'm telling the truth.

8
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,600
Vivian was faster than me.
I couldn't help it.

9
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,144
-Go on.
-And

10
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:48,149
a man wearing a helmet
appeared out of the forest and…

11
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,027
Who are you?

12
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,579
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,583
So did you

14
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,794
get a look at the girl's face?

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,964
-No.
-Not even the helmet guy?

16
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,298
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,096
It sounds like you failed
to do what I'm paying you to do.

18
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,430
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,767
Yes, that's what I think, too.

20
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,313
Please spare me. I'm sorry.

21
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,579
A mysterious woman and a helmet guy.

22
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,958
Are they filming a movie or what?

23
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,336
EPISODE 6

24
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,808
-What are you doing?
-You're back.

25
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,104
Were you digging for ginseng or something?
Did you slip and fall?

26
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,023
-What are you doing?
-What do you think?

27
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,985
-It's all good. Thank you.
-Sure.

28
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,614
-Hey!
-I told you I'd get rid of everything.

29
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,407
You said you'll move back to the rooftop.

30
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,950
When did I say that?

31
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,744
You did say that.

32
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,828
I did?

33
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,997
When we were eating chicken feet and soju.

34
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,376
-Gosh, that was--
-The rent is five million won.

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,544
Can you even afford it?

36
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,588
I can't believe this.

37
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,465
How could he lie about the rent?

38
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,176
Stop it. Don't rub it in.
This is painful for me.

39
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,726
Wait! Sir!

40
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,229
Sir! Hold on.

41
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,314
Stop!

42
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,567
I told you to stop. Sir!

43
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,449
What is it?

44
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,494
What do you want?

45
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,043
Darn it.

46
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,831
That bastard.

47
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,111
Looks good.

48
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,841
Who is it?

49
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,425
It's me.

50
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,678
Who's "me"?

51
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,680
Han Son.

52
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,641
I'm a new tenant here.

53
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,900
Did you forget that you gave me
the passcode when you left?

54
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,328
I've brought meat.

55
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,914
Don't eat cup noodles. Come out.

56
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,261
I thought you wanted me to forget him.

57
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,556
If you put everything back here,

58
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,767
I won't be able to forget him.

59
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,853
Don't force yourself.

60
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,147
If forgetting him is hard,

61
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,483
you can't, then.

62
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,180
I lingered

63
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,559
And cried in secret

64
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,647
Because of the past

65
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,983
I have buried deep inside

66
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,029
The lights go on

67
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,116
Under the empty sky

68
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,496
I yearningly call

69
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,165
My old lover’s name

70
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,041
You have soju, right?

71
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,319
I'm so confused right now.

72
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,739
I don't know what's going on

73
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,825
or what I'm doing right now.

74
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,288
What about you?

75
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,794
Do you think you're doing well?

76
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,591
You eventually
get used to certain things in life.

77
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,052
But I don't want that to happen.

78
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,849
I don't want to get used to this world.

79
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,493
I met her.

80
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,788
That bitch, Jeong Bok-gi.

81
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,420
Things keep getting messier
for some reason.

82
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,714
I need to get back at her,

83
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,300
but I'm all out of ideas.

84
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,389
She wants me to be her partner.

85
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,350
But the funny thing is,

86
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,602
I said yes.

87
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,814
Isn't that ridiculous?

88
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,883
Think about it.

89
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,759
I'll find Edward,

90
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,513
and you'll get to the bottom
of Spy Lee's death.

91
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,309
One more thing.

92
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,981
Edward produced and directed
the documentary on All Together Church.

93
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,486
I just played a supporting role.
I just helped him out with my acting.

94
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,321
Guess what that means.

95
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:07,286
All the investment money your father
raised went into Edward's pocket.

96
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,788
I'm intending to get that money back.

97
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,960
I get the feeling
you'll feel the same way.

98
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,009
Try to picture it. We can catch Edward,

99
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,845
pin everything on him,
and discard him like trash.

100
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,933
And we will split the profits reasonably
like good people.

101
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,314
Doesn't the plot get you excited?

102
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,862
Let's go 50-50.

103
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,908
This is my story.
I'll give you 20 percent.

104
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,034
Goodbye, then.

105
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,286
Okay. 30 percent.

106
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,876
-I want 40 percent.
-Fine.

107
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,046
Where is that bastard?

108
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,306
Do you really think

109
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,017
Jeong-hwan was murdered?

110
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,479
If Kim Jae-wook really killed him…

111
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,064
But why?

112
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,108
Just because he found him?

113
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,443
Is that enough to kill a man?

114
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,843
-What is this?
-A copy.

115
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,929
The file you got from the fake Jeong-hwan.

116
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,913
JEONG YOON-KYUNG

117
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,043
"Jeong Yoon-kyung, JBC news anchor."

118
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,296
"Faked her death"?

119
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,467
"Jeong Yoon-kyung has
President Choi's secret ledger"?

120
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,637
POSSIBLY THE ONLY WITNESS TO HIS MURDER
AND HAS HIS LEDGER

121
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,434
So he handed over her information

122
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,771
to President Choi's son,
the president of UI.

123
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,867
So Jeong-hwan was ordered by GK
to hand this over to me.

124
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,703
And you handed this over to UI, right?

125
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,375
Then, those who came to the hotel
to take Bok-gi might've been sent by UI

126
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,794
to find the ledger, not by Kim Jae-wook.

127
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,847
Come on, say something.
You're frustrating me.

128
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,182
UI never

129
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,435
got their hands on that file.

130
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,437
What are you talking about?

131
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,483
GK retrieved it.

132
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,912
Uncle.

133
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,831
I'm not a kid anymore.

134
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,207
I never treated you as such.

135
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,252
That makes no sense.
Why would GK take it back?

136
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,295
Joo-eun, I don't like where this is going.

137
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,131
Let's stop here.

138
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,298
If you don't,

139
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,052
you might end up like Lee Jeong-hwan.

140
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,462
PC GRAVEYARD

141
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,472
According to Ms. Ko Hye-won,
they were like brothers.

142
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,391
I hope we can get a lead from him.

143
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,643
Hopefully.

144
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,730
I don't think he's here.

145
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,745
Mr. Choi Yoon-seok?

146
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,666
Are you in there?

147
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,006
I'm Detective Kim Myung-hyun
from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

148
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,428
Mr. Choi Yoon-seok?

149
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,390
-Are you in there?
-It's the police.

150
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,248
We're with the police.
You're Choi Yoon-seok, right?

151
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,583
Choi Yoon-seok!

152
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,797
Call the transportation division for help.

153
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,091
It's probably forged,
but run the license plate.

154
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,468
Okay.

155
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,303
Seoul, Jongno, KA 9952.

156
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,018
This is Detective Kang Soo-jin
from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

157
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,187
I need you to run a license plate.

158
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,023
Seoul, Jongno, KA 9952.

159
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,068
It's "Seoul, Jongno, KA 9952."

160
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,278
Yes, thank you.

161
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,135
It was Choi Yoon-seok, right?

162
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,305
Probably.

163
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,766
Why did he run away?

164
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,519
I'm not sure.

165
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,356
Do you think he's related to
Lee Jeong-hwan's death?

166
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,692
He does look suspicious.

167
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,152
He ran away so desperately.

168
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,780
Do you have Choi Yoon-seok's profile?

169
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,864
Yes.

170
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,741
Let's take a look at it.

171
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,207
PERSONAL INFORMATION
CHOI YOON-SEOK

172
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,045
Should we take this and go through it?

173
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,049
We'll get in trouble if we do that
without a warrant.

174
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,177
And that's been degaussed anyway.

175
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,096
Degaussed?

176
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,767
It's becoming more mysterious.

177
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,310
Gosh.

178
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,589
Don't kill me! Please!

179
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,425
I'm sorry!

180
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,678
Spare me! I'm sorry!

181
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,432
What? Who are you?

182
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,275
Jeong-hwan?

183
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,862
-Jeong-hwan!
-Don't move!

184
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,781
Don't come near me.

185
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,492
Who are you?

186
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,163
I'm Yoon-seok.

187
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,082
You…

188
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,459
I clearly saw you…

189
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,753
That was my brother.

190
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,883
What?

191
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,184
So,

192
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,355
the person I saw

193
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,525
wasn't you,

194
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,363
but it was your brother Min-seok?

195
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,907
Yes.

196
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,659
You…

197
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,413
Why didn't you tell me you had a twin?

198
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,292
Do I need to tell people that?

199
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,004
I just let them find out naturally.

200
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,137
I'm glad.

201
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,016
Yoon-seok, I'm glad you're alive.

202
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,231
But…

203
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,526
my brother died.

204
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,573
What are you saying?

205
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,328
What you just said means that
Jeong-hwan wasn't killed in an accident.

206
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,040
That's what you think too, isn't it?

207
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,667
What?

208
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,962
Are you keeping quiet
because it's Jeong-hwan?

209
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,714
Because he was my fiancé?

210
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,468
Fine.

211
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,678
I'll do it alone.

212
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,848
An accident or not,

213
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,644
there's nothing we can do or find out.

214
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,647
A conglomerate is involved.

215
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,107
We can't do anything.

216
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,069
Even if we manage to,
no one's going to know about it.

217
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,655
-Let's drop it.
-No.

218
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,907
I need to find out what happened to him.

219
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,326
The Lee Jeong-hwan you knew never existed.

220
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,703
It was all a dream that he lured you with.

221
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,997
So from the beginning, this documentary

222
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,000
was a flop.

223
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,169
You were his target.

224
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,300
Why?

225
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,971
Why me?

226
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,306
What could he have gotten from me?

227
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,809
Some jewelry and 50 million won?

228
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,520
That doesn't make sense.

229
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,398
Would you film a documentary like this?

230
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,357
With me?

231
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,734
I would.

232
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,821
Because it's you.

233
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,344
I'm sorry, Min-seok.

234
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,238
You don't need a condom, right?

235
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,949
It's not like that.

236
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,421
What are you going to do?

237
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,472
I'm leaving the country.

238
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,182
Don't ask where I'm going

239
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,225
because I won't tell you.

240
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,105
Okay. Do as you please.

241
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,066
What about you?

242
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,904
You should leave, too.
You can go anywhere with your skills.

243
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,411
It's because of this, right?

244
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,539
Don't you do anything with this.

245
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,376
You'll get killed.

246
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,461
Like Min-seok.

247
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,010
Anyway, where did you get this?

248
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,971
It looked like a secret ledger.

249
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,474
I recognize the names on that--

250
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,853
Wait.

251
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,356
Everyone in Korea would, too.

252
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,236
Where did you get this?

253
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,488
You don't want to know.

254
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,073
No, I need to know

255
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,575
who killed my brother.

256
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,161
You said you were going to leave.

257
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,748
-Just leave.
-I will.

258
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,252
I will, but I need to know.

259
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,003
You know who did it.

260
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,007
Min-seok died instead of me
because of this!

261
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,470
Yoon-seok.

262
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,556
I'm really sorry.

263
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,767
But I really don't know.

264
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,563
Are you doing this for me?

265
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,733
Because you think I'd try
to get back at them?

266
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,319
No. You know me. I'm too timid to do that.

267
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,448
I'm going to leave right away.
But I want to know,

268
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,326
so I can pray my heart out

269
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,246
for them to die as soon as possible.

270
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,749
Jeong-hwan!

271
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,962
Yoon-seok.

272
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm being honest.

273
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,387
I really don't know

274
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,307
why I ended up like this

275
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,018
and who they are.

276
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,481
I really don't know anything.

277
00:29:55,627 --> 00:30:00,298
"The current government is old-fashioned
and is unwilling to change.

278
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,383
The conservatives are always the same."

279
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,385
How long will we put up with that?

280
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,472
I'll reform. I'll innovate.

281
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,934
If not me, Yoo Byung-jun,
nobody else can do it!

282
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,521
So in March, I'll win back the government
no matter what.

283
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,856
-Yoo Byung-jun!
-Yoo Byung-jun!

284
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,442
-Yoo Byung-jun!
-Conservative Yoo Byung-jun!

285
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,071
-Yoo Byung-jun!
-Yoo Byung-jun!

286
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,199
-Yoo Byung-jun!
-Yoo Byung-jun!

287
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,620
You used to work at GK Vision Room, right?

288
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,957
That's a long time ago.

289
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,500
It's been more than ten years.

290
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,835
Were you there

291
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,255
when UI's President Choi died?

292
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,217
UI's President Choi…

293
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,719
Oh, the one who made a bad choice.

294
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,887
That was

295
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,266
not a suicide, was it?

296
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,851
I don't know.

297
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,564
I just ran errands for my superiors.

298
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,399
There is a rumor

299
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,319
that UI is digging into the case again.

300
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,781
The mysterious death
of the former president,

301
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,285
revenge, the content of the ledger,
and so on.

302
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,206
They have more than enough
reasons to do so.

303
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,378
So…

304
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,132
is there a way

305
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,760
to look into it using your connections?

306
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,306
It would be helpful for my boss.

307
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,230
I'll do my best.

308
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,065
Thank you.

309
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,042
Who are you?

310
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,961
Hey! Who are you?

311
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,505
Hey!

312
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,842
Hey, the car key! Bring the car key!

313
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,835
The helmet…

314
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,295
Who is that bastard?

315
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,053
It must be money

316
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,222
in that suitcase, right?

317
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,266
It must be.

318
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,145
Then, is Kim Jae-wook

319
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,731
trying to get into politics?

320
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,051
NEW TEXT MESSAGE

321
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,697
Yes. I knew you'd still be alive.

322
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,825
Thank you.

323
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,703
So, when will you return?

324
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,165
How can I return when I'm dead?

325
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,752
First,

326
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,296
I'll be born again.

327
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,841
Yes, of course.

328
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,551
Sir.

329
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,637
Please help me.

330
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,808
Could you find out

331
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,353
why I had to die?

332
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,980
Please.

333
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,400
Shouldn't you know best
since it was you who died?

334
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,613
I need you to give me
something to work with

335
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,992
so I can connect the dots.
Don't you agree?

336
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,619
Yes, sir.

337
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,913
I'll

338
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,707
talk to you in person soon.

339
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,752
All right. Got it.

340
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,963
Thank you.

341
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,926
What happened to Lee Jeong-hwan's case?

342
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,846
It's assigned to Violent Crimes Team 3.
They're trying to get to the truth.

343
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,433
And of course,
I've erased all records related to GK.

344
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,101
It's clean.

345
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,315
Conclude it as an accidental death.

346
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,650
Pardon?

347
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,985
They haven't found out the truth.

348
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,615
Do you actually want them
to find out the truth?

349
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,701
Forget it.

350
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,621
Rumors will start if this drags on,

351
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,998
and rumors eventually turn into facts.

352
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,584
The police may not be competent enough,

353
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,379
but it's not wise to give them
any information.

354
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,631
Especially for our agents undercover.

355
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,842
Being in the spotlight
won't be good for them.

356
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,053
Understood, sir.

357
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,471
We'll be

358
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,976
the ones who'll find out the truth.
Got it?

359
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,519
Yes, sir.

360
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,212
Jeong-hwan's dead?

361
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,591
Really?

362
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,640
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

JEONG DAE-SANG
CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL DIVISION

364
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,938
PUBLIC SERVICE CENTER

365
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,483
Hello?

366
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,819
I'd like to deliver a new complaint.

367
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,195
Yes, I'm listening.

368
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,906
Recently, there was a car accident.

369
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,659
On the national highway
in Gyeonggi Province?

370
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,952
That's correct.

371
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,415
The case needs to be settled
for the road to reopen.

372
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,001
The locals are inconvenienced.

373
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,295
Right. I understand.

374
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,838
Goodbye, then.

375
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,465
Thank you for calling.

376
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,563
So, Choi Yoon-seok is involved
in Lee Jeong-hwan's death?

377
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,190
Correct.

378
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,608
And that's why he ran away?

379
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,651
Who knows?

380
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,987
How could you even say that?

381
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,787
CHIEF JEONG DAE-SANG

382
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,000
Hello, sir.

383
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,170
Right now?

384
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,089
Yes, sir.

385
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,052
Damn it. This case was a dead end
to begin with.

386
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,767
Good work. Treat the boys to some meat.

387
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,269
Thank you, sir.

388
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,479
Okay. You may leave.

389
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,232
But are you sure we can just close this?

390
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,193
Did you find anything? You didn't.

391
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,738
We have so many cases to work on.
You're wasting your time.

392
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,906
Am I wrong?

393
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,409
That's true.

394
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,844
You don't know either, do you?

395
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,348
My superior ordered me to do it,
so I don't know what I was delivering.

396
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,394
I even signed a confidentiality agreement.

397
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,189
Lee Jeong-hwan…

398
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,443
You knew what's in the file, didn't you?

399
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,530
That's why you helped Jeong Bok-gi
at the hotel.

400
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,367
Why did he help her, though?

401
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,078
It can't be…

402
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,728
Thanks to you, I got to hike today

403
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,814
although I prefer oceans to mountains.

404
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,985
Did you really think
we'd never be able to find you

405
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,029
if you moved to the top of a mountain?

406
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,780
I told you I'll pay you back.

407
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,577
How are you so confident
when you owe us money?

408
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,996
But then again, it's admirable.

409
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,666
From now on, as the creditor,

410
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,963
I'll show you my boxing and jujitsu skills
that I've been honing.

411
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,632
As the debtor,

412
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,592
you just need to endure the pain.

413
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,302
That's all you need to do.

414
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,845
Grab her.

415
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,809
Are you okay?

416
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,068
God, you useless idiots.

417
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,196
Joo-eun, I didn't know
you were quite the rascal.

418
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,115
Where did you learn to be so rough?

419
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,161
You're making this
very interesting and exciting.

420
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,208
What's going on?

421
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,710
Did you already get yourself a new man?

422
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,088
Jeong-hwan died not too long ago.

423
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,882
Gosh, you must be so popular. It's great.

424
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,884
You're quite impressive.

425
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,887
By the way, you seem familiar…

426
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,103
Mr. Han Son.

427
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,730
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

428
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,863
-What's going on?
-Nothing--

429
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,990
-Not you.
-Yes, sir.

430
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,159
It's my business. I'll take care of it.

431
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,080
No, don't.

432
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,165
-No, don't do that.
-You little…

433
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,626
-How dare you kick my balls?
-You rude bastards!

434
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,169
No!

435
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,982
The Civil Code says

436
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,818
that the heritor has the right
to forgo their inheritance.

437
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,361
Correct?

438
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,865
Yes, sir.

439
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:42,286
As of this moment, Cha Joo-eun will forgo
Lee Jeong-hwan's inheritance.

440
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,038
Got that?

441
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,501
Yes. Yes, I understand.

442
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,509
Drink up.

443
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,969
-I'm leaving.
-Spit it out.

444
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,512
Yes, sir.

445
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,930
You need to drive.

446
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,225
I have a Class Two driver's license.

447
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,519
Yes, sir.

448
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,025
I have a question.

449
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,320
Yes, ma'am.
Feel free to ask any questions, please.

450
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,781
What kind of person was Jeong-hwan?

451
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,202
Well, he was a beast.

452
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,206
The first time I met him
was in middle school.

453
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,292
Gosh, all he did was study. Literally.

454
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,127
So he was always the top student.

455
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,964
But on top of that,
he was extremely athletic.

456
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,926
He was really unbelievable. Gosh.

457
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,844
He was just perfect.

458
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,348
A conglomerate even paid
for his college tuitions.

459
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,392
-A conglomerate?
-Yes.

460
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,938
"Technolagy."

461
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,524
He was like that.

462
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,907
Please go to Platz Hotel.

463
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,786
Hotel? Why all of a sudden?

464
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,625
I'm not that easy.

465
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,462
But fine, then. The weather's nice.
Let's go.

466
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,302
What is it this time?

467
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,725
Do you have President Choi's
secret ledger?

468
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,523
-No.
-Then who?

469
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:38,152
I don't know how you found out about that,

470
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,029
but it'd be better for you
if you just forget about it.

471
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:46,452
Spy Lee might've been killed
because of the ledger.

472
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,454
What are you on about?

473
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,248
You see, I told Spy Lee

474
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,960
that Edward had the ledger.

475
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,716
If Spy Lee had gotten greedy

476
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,594
and tried to take the ledger from him…

477
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,471
So you're saying

478
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,475
that Jae-wook killed him because of that?

479
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,854
Doesn't that make the most sense?

480
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,983
That's what I think.

481
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,780
Now, aren't you dying to tell me

482
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,075
where that son of a bitch is?

483
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,458
ACADEMIC BACKGROUND

484
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,128
He was the top student throughout
high school and went to Hankuk University.

485
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,214
Why did he run a detective agency?

486
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,883
What? Are you looking down
on detective agencies?

487
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,968
You just belittled them.

488
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,304
You're awfully ethical for a cop.

489
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:51,433
You should look at the world as it is.
Don't you think?

490
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,643
Are you a politician?

491
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,520
Belittle, my foot.

492
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,231
Does a snack bar sell prime beef?

493
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,483
What? You just belittled--

494
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:00,943
Good job.

495
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,113
Sir, I'm sorry.

496
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,158
I'll make sure to find a lead,
so cheer up.

497
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,744
Let's have a team dinner.

498
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,706
It's been concluded
that it was an accidental death.

499
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,291
The chief said good work.

500
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,135
What's with you?

501
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,263
Isn't it funny?

502
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,975
Goodness.

503
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,810
We haven't come here for so long.

504
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,145
-I'm sorry. We've been busy.
-That's okay.

505
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,772
-Say hi.
-Hello.

506
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,274
Welcome.

507
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,608
Cheers.

508
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,618
By the way, why was the case closed
out of the blue?

509
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,620
What did the chief say?

510
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,247
Nothing much.

511
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,542
Come on. It's only natural.

512
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,336
We shouldn't have investigated it
from the get-go.

513
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,882
Still, I smelled something fishy.

514
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,095
What about the smell of burnt meat?

515
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,346
Flip them over.

516
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:15,058
It must be really hot.
It's already cooked.

517
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,061
PORK RIBS APLENTY

518
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,692
I'm fine. You can leave now.

519
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,695
It's okay. You can go eat.
I'll wait in the car.

520
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,405
I said I'm fine.

521
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,908
If he finds out, I'll be in trouble.
I'll take you home safely.

522
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,164
Then come inside and have some food.

523
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,562
Isn't that Cha Joo-eun?

524
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,064
What?

525
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,649
Is she here alone?

526
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,402
Should we tell her
that the case has been closed now?

527
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,863
What should we do?

528
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,373
Why do you look so down?

529
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,833
Because I have a lot on my mind.

530
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,502
Do you want a drink?

531
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,463
I'll get it myself.

532
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,215
Just get me some food.

533
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:29,925
Meat?

534
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,135
That's a bit too much.

535
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,357
They seem to know each other.

536
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,858
I think so.

537
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,819
But how do they know each other?

538
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,792
Was Chief Yang in charge
of her fraud case?

539
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,335
No, she wasn't.

540
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,010
What is that?

541
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,345
What are you doing?

542
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,980
Do you mind if I join you?

543
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,107
Suit yourself.

544
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,278
Here.

545
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,784
I was going to call you tomorrow.

546
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,077
What for?

547
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,412
Well…

548
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,251
Mr. Lee Jeong-hwan's case has been closed.

549
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,841
Hold on.

550
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,094
Didn't you say there was something odd
about this case?

551
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,810
This is unbelievable.

552
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,939
Then why did he go all the way there
on his wedding day and had an accident--

553
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,276
You also said

554
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,530
that it didn't feel natural. That there
was something off about the case.

555
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,909
There needs to be new evidence to argue
that it wasn't just an accident…

556
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:25,749
We couldn't continue the investigation
solely based on our speculation.

557
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,125
So…

558
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,588
You've talked to everyone about the case
and even interrogated

559
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,131
and suspected me.

560
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,760
You made me feel like shit.

561
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,721
But in the end, you found nothing?

562
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,733
You should eat something.

563
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,322
What if

564
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,408
he was murdered?

565
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,204
Did you find out something new?

566
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:10,168
The secret ledger… A few years ago…

567
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,755
No, more than a decade ago…

568
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:18,969
The secret ledger?

569
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,471
-No, forget it.
-If there's anything you want--

570
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,098
No, there isn't.

571
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,603
Do you guys know each other?

572
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,523
Yes, a little. Goodbye, then.

573
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:37,112
In any case, I'm sorry.

574
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,536
What was that?

575
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,498
He's in charge of Jeong-hwan's case.

576
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,918
Really? So Captain Lee's team
is in charge of it.

577
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:53,837
Do you know him?

578
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,797
Yes, we used to work together.

579
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,757
What a small world.

580
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,426
You're right.

581
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,142
But why is the Violent Crimes Team
in charge of the case?

582
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,227
The accident occurred
in Gyeonggi Province.

583
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,771
Did you even love me?

584
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,565
Jeong-hwan.

585
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,818
Are you really dead?

586
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,852
Consider me

587
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,314
dead, Joo-eun.

588
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,193
That's the only way you'll be safe.

589
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,624
CONCERNS DUE TO FOREST FIRE

590
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,377
What's this?

591
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,006
Only two people died?

592
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,219
Gosh.

593
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,140
That's not a forest fire.
It's more like a campfire.

594
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:15,186
An entire town should have been
burnt to dust at the least

595
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,356
so that the common people blame the king.

596
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,485
That way, the king would reflect
on himself.

597
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,821
Don't you think so?

598
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,656
Pardon?

599
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,074
Yes, sir.

600
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,995
In that sense, there's no one
as good as Arsonist Kim.

601
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,653
You startled me.

602
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,198
It's been a while, sir.

603
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,744
This is a surprise.

604
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,704
It's like you.

605
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,624
I'm living a different life now.

606
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,834
Please be understanding.

607
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,921
Sure.

608
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,256
Of course, I will.

609
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,008
So?

610
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,636
Did you find anything?

611
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,221
I believe it was UI's doing.

612
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,431
UI?

613
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,267
Why would they do that?

614
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,814
The person who helped Jeong Yoon-kyung

615
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,316
was me.

616
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,074
Didn't I tell you
not to get involved with her?

617
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,952
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't ignore
the urge to help her.

618
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,079
So you were her prince charming?

619
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,042
Let's see…

620
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,255
UI was enraged

621
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:09,259
that you, a mere private detective,
had helped her for no specific reason,

622
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,219
so they targeted you?

623
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,763
I believe so.

624
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,434
Then you brought this upon yourself.

625
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,983
How could I help you this time around?

626
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,612
UI would have found out
that I was a part of the Vision Room.

627
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,573
Despite that, they attacked me.

628
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,784
I believe that's the same
as attacking GK itself.

629
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,081
Could you look into UI, sir?

630
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,044
So you think they did this
despite knowing who you were?

631
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,425
Sure, I'll look into it.

632
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,760
Thank you, sir.

633
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,473
By the way,

634
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,562
I was wondering if you knew
what Kim Jae-wook is up to.

635
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,064
Is it because he was your mentor?

636
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,652
Are you still concerned about him
even in this state?

637
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,865
I heard there was nothing special.

638
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,700
Don't worry about it.

639
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,953
-Yes, sir.
-I'll treat you well today, sir.

640
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,288
All right, then.

641
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,831
-This is a famous place.
-Really?

642
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,166
They must have tasty food.

643
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,126
-They do.
-I'm looking forward to it.

644
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,127
This way.

645
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,337
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

646
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,756
Also…

647
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:53,279
PC GRAVEYARD

648
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,033
You suspect UI

649
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,995
but you attached a tracker
to Mr. Kim's vehicle.

650
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,040
How am I supposed to interpret this?

651
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,375
I don't know.

652
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,587
But as of now, I can't trust anyone.

653
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,631
They're all suspicious.

654
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,757
You're right.

655
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:17,679
I was surprised to find out
that you worked for a conglomerate.

656
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:21,558
But it's even more shocking that they were
monitoring people's private lives.

657
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,477
How is that possible? It's so creepy.

658
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,772
It must have been tough for you.

659
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:34,362
Jeong-hwan, Mr. Kim isn't taking
his usual route.

660
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,795
This hotel is run using an intranet,
so we can't hack into it.

661
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,796
So…

662
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,300
RESTRICTED AREA

663
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,019
Hello.

664
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,605
I'm from
the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

665
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,273
Hello, how may I help you?

666
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,609
It's nothing serious.

667
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,694
I received a report, so I'm here to check.

668
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,448
Someone was pickpocketed
in the hotel lobby yesterday.

669
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,367
May I check the CCTV footage?

670
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,077
Well, sure.

671
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,764
-What's wrong?
-What are you doing?

672
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,558
I have no time
to go through everything here.

673
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,852
Please move it here.
I'll take it to the station.

674
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,440
I can't do that.
It's a matter of privacy for our clients.

675
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,109
Please help me out.

676
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,654
It's because I don't have the time.

677
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,906
Bring a warrant, then.

678
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,452
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

679
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,329
-Let me go.
-It takes a minute

680
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,123
-to infiltrate their network.
-You're not a cop, are you?

681
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,374
Come on.

682
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:54,085
You're so inflexible.

683
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,254
I'm working really hard
to catch criminals.

684
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,172
How could you treat me like this?

685
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,633
Then bring a warrant.

686
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,719
-Wait! Hold on!
-Get out.

687
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,138
-Get out.
-Fine, I'll go. Give that back.

688
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,098
Here. Take it and leave.

689
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,683
Bring a warrant.

690
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:11,978
Please cooperate with me next time
when I bring my warrant.

691
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,062
Okay, so get out.

692
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,565
Gosh.

693
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,495
How did it go?

694
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,548
What's next?

695
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:41,966
Nothing.

696
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,176
What?

697
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,343
There isn't a next step.

698
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,179
Also…

699
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,224
The 20th floor is under construction.

700
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,310
VVIP room.

701
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,939
Play it from 30 minutes ago.

702
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,865
He wouldn't have

703
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,993
gone there by himself.

704
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,706
I'm certain he went there to meet someone.

705
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,292
Why don't you go up there yourself?

706
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,763
Turn left and go straight,
and you'll see a door.

707
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,700
"We report nothing but the truth."
I'm Joo Sang-ho of Fact News.

708
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:16,329
So let's just treat this as an opportunity
to get to know each other.

709
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,040
Who could it be?

710
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:22,126
Who do you have in mind?

711
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,630
I brought you here
so you can check for yourself.

712
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,798
Didn't you put a lot of effort into her?

713
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:28,883
It's a pity.

714
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,010
Shall I make her commit suicide?

715
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,931
Anything for me?

716
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,224
I saved your life, you know.

717
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,477
It's a gift from Jeong-hwan.

718
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:44,231
So I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

719
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,524
Adios.

720
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:51,822
