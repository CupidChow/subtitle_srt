EPISODE 4

4
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,081
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

5
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,801
Are you sure?

6
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,345
You don't have to see it.

7
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,390
No, I will.

8
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,189
JOHN DOE

9
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,229
It's not him.

10
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,440
That's not Jeong-hwan.

11
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,817
How do you know that?

12
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,654
Even if he has
a distinct physical feature--

13
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,905
I just know.

14
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,909
How long will it take?

15
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,953
They are already handling a lot of cases.

16
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,876
They are already handling a lot of cases.

17
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,711
So I can't give you a date yet,

18
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,088
but I think it'll take about 20 days.

19
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,307
Be careful with the evidence.

20
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:45,892
Okay.

21
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,937
Can you call me once you get the results?

22
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,648
Of course, I will.
I will call you right away.

23
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,483
Okay.

24
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,210
If you're really dead,

25
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm never going to forgive you.

26
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,823
This is a nice apartment.

27
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,244
It's mostly furnished, right?

28
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,875
Newly built apartments these days
are really nice.

29
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,172
In a way,
everything worked out, didn't it?

30
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,342
You already registered your marriage.

31
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,886
If he disappears like this,
this will all be yours.

32
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,808
He could have gotten a better place
given that he worked at a conglomerate.

33
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,476
This is a pretty hefty deposit.

34
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,811
Not bad.

35
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,147
Mom.

36
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,025
-Ms. Kim Mi-sook.
-What?

37
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,193
I bet you're trying
to pick a fight with me.

38
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,195
No, I want us to get along.

39
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,033
I'm about to go crazy right now.
Just leave me be.

40
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm begging you.

41
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,412
Fine. Take your time and think it over.

42
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,582
You'll agree with what I just said later.

43
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,958
Come on.

44
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,711
So make sure to find that jerk. Okay?

45
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,797
Find him
and make him pay double for what he did.

46
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,883
Mom!

47
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,728
CORRECTION

48
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,071
You look good. It suits you well.

49
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,990
-Thanks.
-You're pathetic.

50
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,287
Joo-eun's wedding was canceled.

51
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,040
Why?

52
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,584
You should ask her about the details

53
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,879
since it might cause
a misunderstanding if I tell you.

54
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,756
What? What happened?

55
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,134
Why do you think
Joo-eun's turned out that way?

56
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,930
It's all your fault.

57
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,558
Oh, right. One more thing.

58
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,102
You know something?

59
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,230
Your daughter Joo-eun…

60
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,109
Our daughter Joo-eun went to prison

61
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,195
for a year and a half.

62
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,741
She tried to con Jeong Bok-gi
to take revenge for you

63
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,576
but was conned instead.

64
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,539
Anyway, everything that's happened

65
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,959
is all your fault.

66
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,546
I came to tell you that.

67
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,676
Oh, my Lord.

68
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,887
Please listen to this poor soul,

69
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,014
punish me for my sin,

70
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,809
forgive me,
and guide me to the right path--

71
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,310
Knock it off!

72
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,276
You're using two hands to jump rope.

73
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,782
I don't care how it happened,

74
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,495
but shouldn't we find him for her?

75
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,625
You know, Lee Jeong-hwan.

76
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,843
You will

77
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,430
help my daughter, right?

78
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,684
Gosh, it's so infuriating.

79
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,479
What is Lee Jeong-hwan after?

80
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,320
I thought Ms. Cha Joo-eun
was a little off. Don't you agree?

81
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,404
What is it this time?

82
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,784
Stop eating snacks and have a proper meal.

83
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,330
The husband she registered to marry
only a month ago passed away.

84
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,748
Shouldn't she be weeping now?

85
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,210
But this poor woman
doesn't seem sad at all.

86
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,339
That's why I have a reasonable doubt
about her. You know what I mean?

87
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,799
Here's the smoking gun.

88
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,051
She was convicted of fraud before.

89
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,722
We haven't confirmed
that the dead body is Lee Jeong-hwan.

90
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,183
Weeping over a John Doe is weirder.

91
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,521
Besides, she was at the wedding
when the incident took place.

92
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,730
What could she have done?

93
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,108
She could have cut
the brake lines in advance.

94
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,485
Do you even know
where the brake lines are?

95
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,072
Well, she could've made
a specific plan and studied hard for it.

96
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,657
That's not as easy as it sounds.

97
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:40,454
Besides, making that far
without brake lines makes no sense.

98
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,165
I guess not.

99
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,459
Do you think this was an accident?

100
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,547
We'll have to investigate.

101
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,049
Hey, anyone can say that.

102
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,345
Here's what I find odd.
Why are we taking over this case?

103
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,514
Because the higher-ups told us to.

104
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,891
It's not our jurisdiction.
It's the traffic team's job.

105
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,020
Exactly.
This case is going to give us a headache.

106
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,855
Lee Jeong-hwan is the key.

107
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,275
It was transferred to us
after his wallet was found.

108
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,781
NFS DNA TESTING CENTER

109
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,658
This is Kim Myung-hyun.

110
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,578
-The DNA analysis results are out.
-Okay.

111
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,898
Ms. Cha.

112
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,866
I didn't want to break the news
on the phone.

113
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,662
I received the DNA test result.

114
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,063
Drinking in broad daylight?

115
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,525
Have some food too,
or you'll regret it when you get old.

116
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,072
How can you buy food
that goes well with soju?

117
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,408
I'm trying to make do with beer.

118
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,494
That's not true. Kimchi and dumplings
are good with any drinks.

119
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,210
Don't give me an excuse. Just eat.

120
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,837
What a nice day.

121
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,469
I don't like my job on days like this.

122
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,972
Doctors make a lot of money at least.

123
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,600
Talking to the bereaved family…

124
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,111
It doesn't go well with beer.

125
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,699
Damn it.

126
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,538
LEE JEONG-HWAN

127
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,041
LATE LEE JEONG-HWAN

128
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,390
-Min-jeong.
-Yes?

129
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,475
Go ahead without me.

130
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,019
Sure.

131
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,198
You cremated someone
who'd been burned to death?

132
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,910
Then should I have buried him
in that state?

133
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,830
Right. Suit yourself.

134
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,415
Pull out the deposit now.

135
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,501
It really makes me wonder

136
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,586
why you never got wealthy.

137
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,423
Well, Dad's sentimental side
got in the way for him.

138
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,051
But what got in the way for you?

139
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,222
You have a clear philosophy about money.
Why are you still not rich?

140
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,015
Did you forget you owe me money?

141
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,394
Pull out the deposit
and pay me back with interest.

142
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,564
Remember.
You have the highest legal interest rate.

143
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,744
ULLIM REAL ESTATE AGENCY

144
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,704
What did you say?

145
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,457
It's a monthly rent?

146
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,127
It's 5 million per month
with a 30-million-won deposit.

147
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,380
Gosh, your rent is due pretty soon.

148
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,841
Please pay on time.

149
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,968
The landlord can be a bit grumpy.

150
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,401
Any news for me?

151
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,654
A monthly rent.

152
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,533
That jerk, Lee Jeong-hwan.

153
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,994
The more I dig, the more impressive he is.

154
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,167
The deposit is 30 million won.

155
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,628
It won't even cover the principal.

156
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,421
I'll pay you back.

157
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,673
I'm going to pay you back.

158
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,091
Right. But how?

159
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,176
Mom.

160
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,804
Even you don't always succeed
with your documentaries.

161
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,850
Sometimes it's a hit, and sometimes
it's a flop. Isn't that how it is?

162
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,021
How can you, of all people, do this to me?

163
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,232
Keep your cool. Don't get all emotional.

164
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,359
Fine.

165
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,444
Give me three months.

166
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,072
I'll do anything to pay you back.

167
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,786
Fine.

168
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,413
Come to your senses quickly.

169
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,707
The principal is due in three months.

170
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,877
But pay the interest on time.

171
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,609
What did they say?
Will they give it back right away?

172
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,030
They want us to pay
the realtor fee, right?

173
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,782
I did some calculations.

174
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,952
You spent 50 million
for the wedding venue and the deposit.

175
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,162
The wedding presents…

176
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,416
If you can get them back,
you can save 20 million.

177
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,376
But we don't know where they are now.

178
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,838
You spent five million won
for the funeral service.

179
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,132
That comes out to 105 million won.

180
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,967
The deposit was 400 million, right?

181
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,013
You still made 295 million won. Not bad.

182
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,725
-Min-jeong.
-What?

183
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,686
I'll step out for a moment.

184
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,410
I wanted to wait until you answered.
I apologize for my bad manners.

185
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,332
Finding someone
isn't hard for people like us.

186
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,044
You really are bad-mannered.

187
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,921
I heard it was a documentary.

188
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,673
But you're acting
as if you were really into him.

189
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,391
What about the death registration?

190
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,604
If you report it late, you'll pay a fine.

191
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,106
You shouldn't violate the law.

192
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,860
Is this fun for you?

193
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,696
I bet you're really enjoying this.

194
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,495
Is my sham marriage
an entertainment for you guys?

195
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,957
Whether it was a con or not, a man died.

196
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,545
How can you be so heartless? How?

197
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,591
Don't you dare follow me.

198
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,456
JANG MIN-JEONG

199
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,002
Yes.

200
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,422
-Where are they?
-This way.

201
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,471
Seok-jin told us a lot about you.

202
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,020
Long time no see, Father, Mother.

203
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,606
Yes. Hi, Joo-eun.

204
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,318
Let's go talk outside.

205
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,696
No. I'll just ask you
simple questions since you're working.

206
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,031
Who are you people?

207
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,201
Get a clue.
Can't you tell what's going on?

208
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,621
Mother.

209
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,417
What did you do
with the wedding gifts I gave you?

210
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,835
Well,

211
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,922
the groom took them all.
We only get the daily wage.

212
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,180
Then what were the terms after that?

213
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,599
What do you mean?

214
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,559
Were you hired until the wedding day

215
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,271
or was it going to continue afterwards?

216
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,443
It was only until the wedding.

217
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,702
What's going on?

218
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,081
Mother, who was that?

219
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,041
-Who was it?
-We don't know.

220
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,543
Hey! What was that? Hey!

221
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,763
Detective Kang.

222
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,769
-Yes?
-You should stay in the car.

223
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,562
Why?

224
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,690
She'd feel uncomfortable
if we both went in.

225
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,943
It hasn't been long since the funeral.

226
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,196
Get in.

227
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,600
Hello.

228
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,771
Would you like coffee?

229
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,565
I'll have fruit juice.

230
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,696
Grapefruit, please.

231
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,033
GRAPEFRUIT JUICE: 10,500 WON

232
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,494
Grapefruit juice

233
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,082
and cold water, please.

234
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,960
I apologize

235
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,795
for the delay in the investigation.

236
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,672
Apology accepted.

237
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,384
Well…

238
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,471
Then I'll go straight to asking questions.

239
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,266
What was Lee Jeong-hwan's occupation?

240
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:41,354
He was employed
at a conglomerate, GK Technology.

241
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,233
A conglomerate? GK?

242
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,735
Is that important right now?

243
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,778
Yes, it is.

244
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,659
Am I the only one
who thinks this case is strange?

245
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,995
You said

246
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,040
there was no problem
until the wedding day.

247
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,419
But why didn't Jeong-hwan
go to the wedding hall and end up

248
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,381
having an accident
in the middle of nowhere?

249
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,262
I mean, I need to know
which pieces are missing

250
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,556
and which pieces
don't fit in with the story.

251
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,809
I need to find all the pieces
to complete the puzzle.

252
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,646
That's why I need your help.

253
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,732
Lying to salvage your pride
will only interfere

254
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,983
with the investigation.

255
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,863
So what do you want to hear from me?

256
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,240
Everything.

257
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,534
Everything you know.

258
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,546
Did you know
that Jeong-hwan was an orphan?

259
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,713
For your information,

260
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,967
I have the surveillance video
and statements from the staff.

261
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,054
They showed
that Jeong-hwan's parents were there.

262
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,100
But he was from Hyeongje Orphanage

263
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,769
and he was never adopted.

264
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,647
Did you know all this?

265
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,982
Give me a break.

266
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,277
I'm offended
that you're invading my privacy.

267
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,946
I'm a police officer.

268
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,574
I was given the right
to invade your privacy

269
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,118
because criminal acts
are private by nature.

270
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,537
Then is it a crime
if I don't share my personal life?

271
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,165
I'm asking you to cooperate with me
just like an ordinary citizen.

272
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,876
I am, aren't I?

273
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:35,969
Fine.

274
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,806
-What about you?
-What about me?

275
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,934
Did Jeong-hwan know everything about you?

276
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,688
-What do you mean?
-You know what I mean.

277
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,281
Whatever.

278
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,493
Are you married?

279
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,872
Are you married?

280
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,629
I'm not married.

281
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,297
Do you have a girlfriend, then?

282
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,760
Then you must know
every little thing about your girlfriend.

283
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,472
Like whether her legs are naturally smooth
or if she has them waxed regularly.

284
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,515
I don't have a girlfriend.

285
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,352
That's not the point.

286
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,271
If I did?

287
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,107
If I had one,

288
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,361
I would have known all about her.

289
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,323
When you love someone,
don't you want to know everything?

290
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,826
I think that's how you marry someone.

291
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,831
You really don't know love.
You've never dated anyone, right?

292
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,335
No.

293
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,795
You haven't.

294
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,633
Just grab anyone on the street and ask

295
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,886
if they know 100%
about the person they love,

296
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,722
and if they told their lover
everything about themselves.

297
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,601
Love can only last
when there are secrets between the two.

298
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,773
Don't you think he scammed you?

299
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,318
He lied about his job,
family, school, and everything.

300
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,197
It looks like
he wasn't going to show up at the wedding.

301
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,992
Stop interrogating me,

302
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,453
and go find the cause of the accident.

303
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,928
Joo-eun.

304
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,183
Why do you think the fake in-laws
were contracted until the wedding?

305
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,854
-How was he going to fool you after that?
-It's obvious.

306
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,983
He would've told me he's sent them abroad
to a made-up relative.

307
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,654
And they would have sent us
fake regards occasionally.

308
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,908
He could have bought
at least ten years that way.

309
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,493
Right.

310
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,663
I didn't need fake parents-in-law.

311
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,333
You didn't? But you were happy
to have rich parents-in-law.

312
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,004
They're nice to have,
but I'm fine without them.

313
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,298
-I don't think so.
-Hey.

314
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:22,218
Do you really have to make me
look like a tramp at this point?

315
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,053
Sorry.

316
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,639
But you were filming a documentary, too.

317
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,933
You lied about your parents,
job, and friends.

318
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,643
Then you got scammed.

319
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:33,897
Joo-eun.

320
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,442
Were you really into him?

321
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,112
What? Are you crazy?

322
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,281
We're out of soju, right?

323
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,159
I'll go get some.

324
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,477
-What floor is it?
-Twelfth floor.

325
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,730
I pressed the wrong floor.

326
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,401
I think we get out this way.

327
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,825
-It's a nice building.
-It is.

328
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,995
-Who is it?
-Lee Jeong-hwan lives here, right?

329
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,415
CHA JOO-EUN

330
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,332
Who are you?

331
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,418
FRONT DOOR

332
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:24,883
Who are you?

333
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,843
We're the police.

334
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,305
Please wait a minute.

335
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,458
Show me your ID.

336
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,046
Did you bring the ID?

337
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,589
-Of course.
-Take it out.

338
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,304
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

339
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,643
-What about you?
-Here.

340
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,437
You idiots.

341
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,940
Are you kidding me?

342
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,652
Damn it.

343
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,154
I'm sorry.

344
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,248
You might get the wrong idea,

345
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,709
but I'm just working out

346
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,462
because I like rock climbing.

347
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,133
Should we get her?

348
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,635
I think so.

349
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,597
Then go get her, you idiot.

350
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,265
Me? I'm sorry, I didn't know.

351
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,226
Let's go.

352
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,081
What?

353
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,499
Are you in apartment 1203?

354
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,959
No, I'm not.

355
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,337
We'll see about that.

356
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,257
Take her.

357
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,467
Hey. What? Why?

358
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,804
-What are you doing?
-Be careful.

359
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,741
We could have talked over
a cup of coffee like civilized people,

360
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,535
but you made me waste energy.

361
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,457
I've hated wasting energy for nothing

362
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,418
since I was a little kid.

363
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,336
If I lay still,

364
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,173
I could last two days
on one pack of ramyeon.

365
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,632
What's he blabbering about?

366
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,093
I once lasted three days
on a single red bean bun.

367
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,679
Jeong-hwan and I shared it.

368
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,144
Let me introduce myself properly.
I'm Jeong-hwan's friend, Park Tae-joo.

369
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,189
We've been friends since the orphanage.

370
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,233
Jeong-hwan, this punk…

371
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,111
He got married without telling me.

372
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,239
You're Jeong-hwan's friend?

373
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,912
Now I get why he kept it a secret from me.

374
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,001
He was afraid of losing you to me.

375
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,882
Don't you think so?

376
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,343
I'm irresistibly charming, aren't I?

377
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,595
How can you call yourself his friend?

378
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,139
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

379
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,727
No, you're the one who crossed the line.

380
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,313
Why didn't you invite me in?

381
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,485
You know, a trivial thing like that
can make people upset.

382
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,571
I think that's enough introduction.

383
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,658
Let me hear about your payment plan.

384
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,959
It's 63 million won
including the principal as of today.

385
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,299
LOAN AGREEMENT

386
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,219
But the principal is five million.

387
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,721
Yes, it is.

388
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,433
But over the past six months,
he's never paid back the interest.

389
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,520
You know we deal in
compound interests, right?

390
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,189
You can find the interest rates
for private loans online.

391
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,692
I'll give you a week to pay it back.

392
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,903
Including a week's worth of interest,

393
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,866
just pay me back
70 million won. Thank you.

394
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,742
I'll see you next week.

395
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,953
This is it for us today.

396
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,249
The maximum legal interest rate
is 24 percent per year.

397
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,085
How can it be seven million in a week?

398
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,088
The monthly interest is 100,000.

399
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,383
Including the principal,
it's 5,600,000 for six months.

400
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,221
You're funny. I'll give you that.

401
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,309
I guess I didn't know much about you.

402
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,560
That's my bad.

403
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,104
Legality.

404
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,191
So you're into the law.

405
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,486
Fine. Follow the law all you want.

406
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,740
I'll also

407
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,201
follow my own law.

408
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,748
This is it for us today.

409
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,462
Wait.

410
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,925
I paid for Jeong-hwan's insurance

411
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,593
just in case.

412
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,678
You get what I'm saying, right?

413
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,308
But he changed the beneficiary to you

414
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,143
without discussing it with me.

415
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,562
Friends shouldn't do that, right?

416
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,522
A trivial thing like that

417
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,485
can make people upset.

418
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,745
What was that?

419
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,081
What's going on?

420
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,336
I get the private loan part.
You said he wasn't insured.

421
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,298
COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

422
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,054
Excuse me.

423
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,349
I'm here to register a death.

424
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,643
Did you bring the form?

425
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,902
DEATH REGISTRATION FORM
LEE JEONG-HWAN

426
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,450
Would you like to sign up
for a one-stop service?

427
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:07,868
Pardon?

428
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,037
You can search for financial assets,

429
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,499
real estate, automobile, taxes,
and pension information all at once.

430
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,877
I see. Sign me up, please.

431
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:22,967
PROPERTY INQUIRY OF THE DEAD
SERVICE APPLICATION

432
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,053
He has a business license?

433
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,070
What a shabby building.

434
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,197
Won't it collapse?

435
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:54,206
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

436
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,926
Hello?

437
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,393
Is anyone here?

438
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,273
Anyone?

439
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:45,966
What the…

440
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:11,700
You should only use a pencil
when you're expressing your love on paper,

441
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,369
not for something like this.

442
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:19,542
Why? Because you can erase it
if you make a mistake while writing.

443
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,293
Didn't Pastor Cha teach you that?

444
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,549
IF YOU WANT TO WRITE LOVE
WRITE IT WITH A PENCIL

445
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,480
Doing this will only
make you lose to me once again.

446
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,733
It doesn't matter whether I win or lose.

447
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,028
What matters is that I do my best.

448
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:49,947
You see,

449
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,659
I want to give it my all to the end.

450
00:40:55,953 --> 00:41:00,666
Does Pastor Cha know
that you've failed to get married?

451
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,293
What did you say?

452
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,421
How did you know that?

453
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,131
Do you think I'm the only one?

454
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,550
Everyone knows
that you have a despicable temper.

455
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,553
Don't tell me

456
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,765
that you hired Jeong-hwan as an actor
so that I'd let down my guard.

457
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,644
What is it that you're trying to do?

458
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,440
There's clearly a misunderstanding here

459
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,610
because I didn't get
a single thing you just said.

460
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,903
I hired who as an actor?

461
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,196
Don't lie to me.

462
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,656
Then why are you here?

463
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,117
What are you doing here?

464
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,952
Who are you people?

465
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,830
There's nothing to steal here,
so what are you guys…

466
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,500
Ma'am.

467
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,221
Instead of getting physical,

468
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,057
let's act like sophisticated women.

469
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,392
This is the 21st Century, after all.

470
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,979
But then again,
you'll never measure up to me.

471
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,272
Lately,

472
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,567
my life has been quite sour.

473
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,487
But thanks to you, I see some hope.

474
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,447
You wait and see.

475
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,034
I'll put you
in a supporting role in a documentary.

476
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,456
So you're a client here?

477
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:28,170
I'm glad that I could be of help
to someone in need.

478
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,923
But you'll never be able to con me.

479
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,092
I'll find a way.

480
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,510
By the way,

481
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,888
are you here looking for your first love?

482
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,611
It seems Spy Lee isn't in at the moment.

483
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,530
Tell him I came by.

484
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,699
Tell him to call me
since he's not answering my calls.

485
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,076
Also, she broke the window.

486
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,869
-Hey!
-Goodness!

487
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,663
-How dare you run away?
-Come on.

488
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,040
-Move!
-What a ridiculous woman!

489
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,084
Wait there.

490
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,504
The window!

491
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,097
What is her deal?

492
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,099
Why did I run into her here?

493
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,810
What is she doing here?

494
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,755
Are they not picking up?

495
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,635
The phone belongs to someone
without a resident registration.

496
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,471
This means that it's a burner phone.

497
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,932
But the ring tone is set to
posh classical music.

498
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,811
Could it be a gangster?

499
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,273
Everyone around Lee Jeong-hwan is shady.

500
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,236
-Everyone?
-Take Cha Joo-eun for example.

501
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,864
It's strange.

502
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,909
She had no idea
what the groom did for a living

503
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,703
when they were registered to marry
and had a wedding soon.

504
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,208
Do you think he knew everything about her?

505
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,759
Look here. I can't believe this.

506
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,929
What in the world are you doing here?

507
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:46,308
Why did you break
our office window like that?

508
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,893
That woman who just left…

509
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,438
What kind of client is she?

510
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,401
Is she looking for someone?

511
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,779
Does she want her money back?

512
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,074
No.

513
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,160
Does she want someone killed?

514
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,455
You have no right to ask about our client.

515
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,750
Should I call the repairman?

516
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,628
I really don't want to call the police
over something like this.

517
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,592
Who's the boss here?

518
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,594
Why do you...

519
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,806
I see. You're here to make a request.

520
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,642
Right. That's why you're here.

521
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,854
Bad news. We won't be able to help you.

522
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,315
Our boss is extremely busy these days.

523
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,068
He disappeared all of a sudden, didn't he?

524
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,114
Who are you?

525
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,325
Are you in the same line of work?

526
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,375
I think it's that one.

527
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:15,063
Is your boss' name Lee Jeong-hwan?

528
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,399
How do you know his name?

529
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,486
You really are suspicious.

530
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,530
Who are you, really?

531
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,285
Why is Jeong-hwan working here?

532
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,831
-At a place like this?
-"A place like this"?

533
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,085
Hold on. "Jeong-hwan"?

534
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,173
Why does it sound like you two are close?
Was that intentional?

535
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,467
Are you positive

536
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,263
that Jeong-hwan's been running
a detective agency here?

537
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,726
What is this?
I thought you knew everything,

538
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,021
but it turns out you didn't.
I really wonder who you are.

539
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,524
I'm someone who needs to know the truth.

540
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,195
I should call the cops, not the repairman.

541
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,865
Fine, I'll pay for it.

542
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,701
You already lost your chance.

543
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:13,288
You may be linked to his disappearance.

544
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,666
You just stay put.

545
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,588
Damn it.

546
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,300
Gosh, you're so lucky.

547
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,555

Hi, this is Development Team Two

549
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,227
Hi, this is Development Team Two

550

FACT NEWS

551
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,483
Hello, this is Fact News,
where we only tell the truth.

552
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,028
Reporter Joo Sang-ho isn't in.
Could you tell me your name?

553
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,615
Gosh, they have no manners.

554
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,286
It was you?
You picked up the phone that time?

555
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,537
"That time"?

556
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,082
Why do you keep trying to link us?

557
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,668
Is anyone in?

558
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,213
Who are you?

559
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,345
-What are you doing with that phone?
-Gosh, she startled me.

560
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,806
I got caught up in the moment.
Who are you?

561
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,936
We're investigating a car accident.

562
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,438
"A car accident"?

563
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,941
You're not here to arrest
this suspicious woman?

564
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,069
Why are you here?

565
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,989
-What business do you have here?
-And you?

566
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,491
We're just investigating.

567
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,751
-Did you find out?
-About what?

568
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,922
Would you like some coffee?

569
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,342
I mean, not here.

570
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:54,973
Here.

571
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,034
Why are they having coffee?

572
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,786
And just the two of them?

573
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,246
Are you sure you can vouch for her?

574
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,540
Don't worry about that.

575
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,044
She and Mr. Lee Jeong-hwan
registered their marriage.

576
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,630
What on earth are you talking about?

577
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,590
They registered their marriage?

578
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,802
Was it illegal?

579
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,555
Didn't she tell you anything?

580
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,723
About what?

581
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,601
Who's Cha Joo-eun?

582
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,772
Her?

583
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,441
Aren't you curious

584
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,194
about Lee Jeong-hwan?

585
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,282
I believe that you had no idea who he was.

586
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:56,868
Am I wrong?

587
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,710
I was embarrassed

588
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,506
about the detective agency.

589
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,552
That's why I lied and said he worked

590
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,095
for a conglomerate.

591
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,598
I'm sorry.

592
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,603
That's what I told everyone around me.

593
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,522
So…

594
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,236
Don't you know the passcode?

595
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,824
Excuse me. Ms. Ko.

596
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,995
Are you sure

597
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,206
that he's dead?

598
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,210
Yes, I am.

599
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,964
Don't lie!

600
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,467
That's impossible!

601
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,635
Why?

602
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,185
That's the photo of the scene.

603
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,562
Do you see the skid marks?

604
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,607
The insurance company
is trying to buy time with that.

605
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:13,278
The car stopped abruptly
and then accelerated at the hairpin curve.

606
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,991
Then it went at full throttle

607
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,911
towards the guard rail, and then…

608
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,747
The collision.

609
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:26,875
Isn't it strange?

610
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,961
Why

611
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,798
did the car stop and then accelerate?

612
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,927
I'm not sure. It's either
the driver's mistake or the car's defect.

613
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,888
The insurance company
will try to blame the driver.

614
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,266
It's not easy to prove a defect,
and the car even caught on fire.

615
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:44,893
So?

616
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,480
They're going to keep blaming the driver
and try to pay the least amount.

617
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,234
They'll drag on
and blame it on the investigation.

618
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,236
Well,

619
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,072
if we close the case quickly,

620
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,533
they'll be affected by it as well.

621
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,037
But since the case smells fishy,

622
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,581
I want to look into it thoroughly.

623
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,461
-What should I do?
-Please investigate it thoroughly.

624
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,630
I need to know

625
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,508
the reason

626
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,094
he died.

627
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,221
Good.

628
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,641
This is Detective Kim Myung-hyun
from Seoul Metropolitan police.

629
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,935
I called regarding a case
I'm investigating.

630
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,728
I'll be waiting for your call.

631
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,988
You're already drinking
before we even say hi.

632
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,534
Did you feel anxious
because you hadn't seen me in a long time?

633
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,996
Why did you come back?
I thought you left for good.

634
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,998
That was my original plan,

635
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,958
but things didn't go my way.

636
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,211
So what could I do?
I had to change the plan.

637
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,547
Come up with a new plan.

638
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,924
Make sure you leave
and never come back this time.

639
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,719
Gosh, quit frowning.

640
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,139
I guess you still haven't won the lottery.

641
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:11,563
Don't you think hanging out with me
would make your life easier?

642
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,899
You'll find yourself smiling
for no reason.

643
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,736
Isn't that what life is all about?

644
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,739
So? Are you all smiles these days?

645
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,367
Have you ever smiled for no reason?

646
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,119
I'm smiling as we speak.

647
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,205
You're only smiling
to get on my good side.

648
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,625
You caught me.

649
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:36,880
You're right.
I'm feeling miserable these days.

650
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,719
Anyway, I'm here
because of a friend of mine.

651
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,639
She got a call regarding an investigation.

652
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,725
He's a colleague of yours.
Detective Kim Myung-hyun.

653
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,479
Can you look into it?

654
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,481
What did you do? You only just got back.

655
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,192
This is about my friend, not me.

656
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,199
Your friend had called someone
who died in a car accident.

657
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,370
The driver's name was Lee Jeong-hwan.

658
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,831
Male, 35 years old.

659
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,793
He used to run a detective agency.

660
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,128
Oddly enough,
he had a car accident and died

661
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,005
on the day of his wedding.

662
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,972
Did you kill him, Edward?

663
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,189
Let's go.

664

24-HOUR FREE CONSULTATION
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

665
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,708
My birthday?

666
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,501
MY BIRTHDAY 920330

667
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,547
That's not it.

668
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:47,218
Could it be the first day we met?

669
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,304
FIRST ENCOUNTER 190803

670
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,308
WRONG PASSWORD, TRY AGAIN

671
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,102
Damn it, what is it then?

672
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,360
Could it be…

673
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:05,904
They're so hilarious.

674
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,448
This is so funny.

675
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,036
Don't you think they're pretty?

676
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,957
Come on.
You're much prettier than they are.

677
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,210
Don't lie.

678
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,755
It's best to be young and beautiful.

679
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,466
You know what?

680
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,552
I think Sana is the prettiest.

681
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,179
What about you?

682
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,473
Do you know all of their names?

683
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,558
I don't know any of them.

684
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,227
Look.

685
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,646
Is it the second girl from the right?

686
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,064
No.

687
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,192
Then the one on the far left?

688
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,110
No.

689
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,279
The one in the center.

690
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,744
Well, If I have to pick one…

691
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,168
TZUYU

692
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,129
Could it be Tzuyu's date of birth?

693
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,930
What an asshole.

694
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,198
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

695
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,646
Excuse me.

696
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,116
I'm lost for words right now.

697
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,494
What are you doing here

698
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,454
all by yourself?

699
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,916
Didn't the cops tell you yesterday

700
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,044
that I inherited everything?

701
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:30,507
Good for you,
although I refuse to believe it.

702
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,346
What is it?

703
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,181
Did you have

704
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,601
a crush on him?

705
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,023
Yes, I did. So what?

706
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,825
He may have not said it,
but I bet he liked me too.

707
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,205
I heard he didn't show up for the wedding.

708
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,706
Don't you get it?

709
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,087
It was all because of me.

710
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,383
He was tormented
because he couldn't tell me the truth.

711
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,093
And…

712
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,596
He must have been in so much pain that he…

713
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,976
Mr. Lee…

714
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,814
Fine, then.

715
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,650
Lee Jeong-hwan.

716
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,237
You can have that bastard.

717
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:43,079
Fine! I will!
Even his spirit will be mine!

718
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,170
Are you here, Mr. Lee?

719
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,966
To see me? As a ghost?

720
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,476
Why, that woman.

721
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,394
Damn it.

722
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,091
CASES IN PROGRESS
SOLVED CASES

723
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,428
THE MURDER OF LEE HYEON-HUI

724
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,750
CLIENT: SOPHIA CHUNG
TARGET: EDWARD KIM

725
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,876
"Jeong Yoon-kyung"?

726
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,925
Is that Jeong Bok-gi's real name?

727
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,469
EDWARD KIM, KIM JAE-WOOK

728
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,221
"Edward Kim."

729
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,225
She's looking for Kim Jae-wook.

730
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,774
When did you come?

731
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,110
What's going on?
You didn't even answer my call.

732
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,986
-Let me borrow your car.
-My car?

733
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,296
DO NOT CROSS

734
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,883
Jeong-hwan.

735
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,679
Did you get yourself involved
in something dangerous?

736
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,598
That better be the case.

737
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,185
Because if you did this to me
for no particular reason,

738
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,521
then you'd really be an asshole.

739
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,357
So

740
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,026
I'll uncover the truth

741
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:21,070
as to why you did it.

742
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,032
CLIENT: SOPHIA CHUNG

743
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,652
What is it?
Are you here to sell me pencils?

744
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,070
Aren't you looking for someone?

745
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:07,992
I'm coming in.

746
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,454
What is it?

747
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,332
Fine.

748
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,127
We're not that close for small talk,
so I'll cut to the chase.

749
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,338
Kim Jae-wook.

750
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,257
You're looking for him, right?

751
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,885
That's why you visited
Spy Detective Agency.

752
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,014
I guess you don't want to find him.

753
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,357
-He was a student teacher.
-What?

754
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,862
He was my high school student teacher.

755
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,865
I wanted to see him once again.

756
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:48,950
Fine, then.

757
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:52,245
I'll meet him first and ask him

758
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,831
if he remembers his old student,

759
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,666
Jeong Yoon-kyung.

760
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,545
That face.

761
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,589
You just acknowledged
the fact that it's your name.

762
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,055
Pastor Cha.

763
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,893
I can help him get out of prison.

764
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,813
My dad…

765
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,733
will be released next month.

766
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,237
Thanks to you,

767
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,865
he served his full sentence
with no parole.

768
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,117
I won't wait too long.

769
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,787
Contact the Spy Detective Agency
if you want to find Kim Jae-wook.

770
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,464
The mansion is the last place he visited.

771
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:47,842
I should start there.

772
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,031
PRIVATE PROPERTY
NO TRESPASSING

773
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,279
Kim Jae-wook?

774
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:53,574
Edward?

775
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,458
Hey.

776
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,701
My gosh.

777
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:45,895
Bang!

778
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,359
Who are you?

779
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,514
Yes, Jeong-hwan.

780
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,267
Come home quickly. I miss you.

781
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,060
Okay.

782
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:10,938
I will hurry.

783
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,732
I wonder why Spy Lee died.

784
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,277
As you well know,

785
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,155
you have to be careful
who you choose to side with to survive.

786
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,198
You'll end up like me soon.

787
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,743
Do you really think
Jeong-hwan was murdered?

788
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,913
But why? Just because he found him?

789
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,082
Let's stop here.

790
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,792
Why are you so important?

791
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,462
Jeong Bok-gi wants me to be her partner.

792
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,841
You might end up like Lee Jeong-hwan.

793
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,676
I intend to get that money back.

794
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:43,137
I'll try and go all the way.

795
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,264
I'm not a kid anymore.

796
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,104
