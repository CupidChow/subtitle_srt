EPISODE 12

4
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,165
You punk. Are you Hong Gil-dong or what?
You're everywhere.

5
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,250
Do I remind you of him?

6
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,128
What an honor. I respect him a lot.

7
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,672
Fine.

8
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,259
How have you been?
You haven't been in touch.

9
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,677
Thanks to you,

10
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,013
I've been well.

11
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,561
I have something to ask you.

12
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,315
Fire away.

13
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:53,363
Are you the one who got Cha Joo-eun
a job at UI?

14
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,702
CHA JOO-EUN

15
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,670
I was informed that
we were hiring a pretty good actress.

16
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,214
And I did give a green light on that.

17
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,675
Why?

18
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,802
What do you mean?

19
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,139
Why did you set up such a play?

20
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,643
Bye, then.

21
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,272
A play?

22
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,983
A play, I see.

23
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,113
Fine. Hand the case over to UI
and get your hands off it.

24
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,535
Don't you know I'm doing this
because I care about you?

25
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,289
Didn't I tell you
not to get involved with her?

26
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,290
I'm sorry, sir.

27
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,168
Then you brought this upon yourself.

28
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,878
Sir.

29
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,008
Please help me.

30
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,806
How could I help you this time around?

31
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,685
I need you to give me
something to work with

32
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,646
so I can connect the dots.

33
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,691
Sure. It was a play.

34
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,738
Then, why did I make sure
you fell for that?

35
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,198
You know, it's such a hassle.

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,746
It was for you.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,251
Here's a thing about food.

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,671
We can put up with bland food.

39
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,841
But we can't eat it if it's too salty.

40
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,638
It's the same with people.
Plain is the best.

41
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,434
In our world, there's a way we do things.

42
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,605
But some people go overboard
and start sprinkling spices on everything.

43
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,067
Things get too salty,
and the food becomes inedible.

44
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,402
What choice do I have?

45
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,448
I ought to take the spice away from them

46
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,951
before they spoil the food.

47
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,829
Are you saying I used my spices too much?

48
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,916
-You did have a heavy hand.
-Then,

49
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,211
where should I have stopped?

50
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,505
My instructions and my orders

51
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,926
Didn't you know
that they make the best recipe?

52
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,804
Let me ask you something too.

53
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,722
Why did you do it?

54
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,684
Why did you disobey my order?

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,895
You took Jeong Yoon-kyung

56
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,525
and promised Cha Joo-eun a future
when she could betray you any minute.

57
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,611
On top of that, you stole the ledger,
the best spice of all.

58
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,210
This is definitely worth my time because
we're having an honest conversation.

59
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,713
So, what can I do for you?

60
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:03,428
And what should you do
for you to be forgiven for what you did?

61
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,972
Fine.

62
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,976
Despite everything that's happened,
since I like you…

63
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,731
Since I care about you,
I will give you one last chance.

64
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,026
Listen carefully.

65
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:22,822
Get rid of everyone who's involved
in this incident, including Cha Joo-eun.

66
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,408
Take care of them yourself.

67
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:31,289
If you do that, you can come back to GK.

68
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,715
Won't it be a shame if it all ends here?

69
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,135
Jeong-hwan.

70
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,181
Think about how hard
you've tried to endure

71
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,602
and stay in the game since I saw you
for the first time at the orphanage.

72
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,563
Just think about it.

73
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,192
This is my last gift for you.

74
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,614
Tae-joo, come eat.

75
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,115
Okay, ma'am!

76
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,792
It's pork cutlet today!

77
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,520
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV

78
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,158
If I can't…

79
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,203
If I miss this chance,

80
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,081
will you kill me again?

81
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,668
Let me ask you one last time.

82
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,547
Was it you who gave the orders

83
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,717
to kill me?

84
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,145
I was only following the rules of GK.

85
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,578
I see.

86
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,339
Take care

87
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,927
of yourself, mister.

88
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,721
-You two go that way. The rest, with me.
-Yes, sir.

89
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,061
SPECIAL DISCOUNT

90
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,280
This one's on special, right?

91
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,244
Not this one.

92
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,912
Why not?

93
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,832
-It said so there.
-No idea.

94
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,500
Go check again.

95
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,964
-Can't you just do it?
-Sorry.

96
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,842
That's what it said. You should go look.
I'm serious.

97
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,802
Can't I take one more?

98
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,387
No.

99
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,435
Then, how much is it without this?

100
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,399
It's 11,400 won.

101
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,667
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,213
Joo-eun.

103
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,308
I'm sorry. Please take them.

104
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,731
-Shall we go eat?
-No.

105
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,359
How about soju, then?

106
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,861
Shall we?

107
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
Thank you.

108
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,745
-Then, be good to me.
-Okay.

109
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,385
Jeong-hwan.

110
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,056
Did the meeting go well?

111
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,474
Yes.

112
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,646
-Joo-eun.
-Yes?

113
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,107
There's a place I want to go with you.

114
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,942
Now?

115
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,486
Yes. Now.

116
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,281
Where?

117
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,956
It looked so big when I was young.

118
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,667
But it looks so small now.

119
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,841
I'm sorry I lied to you.

120
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,511
I want to see how you looked

121
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,641
when you were young.

122
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,395
I bet you never listened to your teachers,

123
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:14,066
always goofed around, told lies,
and put your teachers through hell.

124
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,862
No. I was a nice kid.

125
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,864
Gosh, you can't fool me.

126
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,866
I bet you made everyone mad.

127
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,577
-Wait, that was--
-But I bet you were still cute.

128
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,248
I bet you cried when you got spanked.

129
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,460
and smiled like an innocent boy
when people gave you treats.

130
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,715
I would like to meet the boy Jeong-hwan.

131
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,385
In retrospect, it was ridiculous,
but when I was young,

132
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,096
I wished for a little sister.

133
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,934
I'd pray for a little sister
before going to bed every night.

134
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:53,147
Your prayer did come true.
Gosh, what a lucky prayer.

135
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,859
You have a cute little sister right here.

136
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,863
A good wife who even acts like
your big sister at times.

137
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,909
I can be three things at once.
You hit the jackpot.

138
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,704
I've never considered you my big sister.

139
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,082
We're close, see eye to eye,
and rely on each other.

140
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,961
If I buy you meals every now and then,
I'd be a pretty good older sister.

141
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,924
Age doesn't matter. It's how
mentally mature you are that counts.

142
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,052
Is your brain in your 40s or something?

143
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,679
Gosh, I'm hungry.

144
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,517
Buy me a meal, big brother. Please?

145
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,604
Jeong-hwan, please buy me a meal.

146
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,152
Well, what do you want to eat, Joo-eun?

147
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,114
Gosh, let's go. I'm really getting hungry.

148
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,493
What should we eat?

149
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,080
Pizza and makgeolli?

150
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,343
-This is it.
-Gosh, it's been so long.

151
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,803
-Right?
-Yes.

152
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,181
Shall we go inside?

153
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,979
Hello.

154
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,566
Do you remember that table?

155
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,817
Of course.

156
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,118
I really wanted to come back here.

157
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,871
It feels great to be back here.

158
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,546
Is something wrong?

159
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,843
-Joo-eun.
-Yes?

160
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,762
Why don't you go abroad for a while?

161
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,473
What? All of a sudden? Why?

162
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,934
I'll work on finding a ticket.

163
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,770
Come back after the dust settles.

164
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,690
No. I won't leave.

165
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,110
It's dangerous here.
And things might go wrong, too.

166
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,946
I've given it some thought,

167
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,991
and I don't think this is right.

168
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,746
-You don't want me by your side?
-No, it's not that.

169
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,664
I'm going to stay by your side.

170
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,878
We went through a lot to be reunited.
I don't want to leave your side again.

171
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,507
Don't worry.

172
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,303
I'm an ex-con, you know.

173
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,600
You know that my life has never been easy.

174
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,896
Jeong-hwan.

175
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,274
You have the ledger, right?

176
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,402
President Choi's secret ledger.

177
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,990
Joo-eun.

178
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,826
How do you know that?

179
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,204
That's what got you into this mess.

180
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,958
Can you show it to me?

181
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,835
No.

182
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,255
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

183
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,091
Once you see the ledger,

184
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:11,136
those whose names are in it
will also want to see you.

185
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,265
I can't let that happen.

186
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,936
It doesn't matter if I see it or not.
As long as I stay with you,

187
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,397
they will assume that I did.

188
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,200
And I am going to stay by your side.

189
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,008
How about some chili with pajeon?

190
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,511
Good choice. Pajeon is the best.

191
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,265
You know, pajeon tastes

192
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,726
the best with chilli.

193
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,406
Pajeon is the best, isn't it?

194
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,661
-Ma'am, pajeon, please.
-Sure.

195
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,998
-And makgeolli, too.
-You got it.

196
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,291
KWON HYUK-JANG

197
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,063
LEDGER

198
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,042
I see.
Then let's schedule it for the 25th.

199
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,586
Yes, I got it. Okay.

200
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,844
Sir.

201
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,866
It's been a long time, sir.

202
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,742
Indeed, Commissioner Choi.

203
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,037
I'm calling because I received
a piece of information.

204
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,874
So I'd like to have a talk with you.

205
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,210
Have you eaten yet?

206
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,349
Salute.

207
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,188
Hello, sir.

208
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,149
What happened?

209
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,239
Tell me what happened!

210
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,202
Damn it!

211
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,539
Yes.

212
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,916
Come in.

213
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,003
Have a seat.

214
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,763
Have you heard about Cha Joo-eun's case?

215
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,849
She was cleared of suspicion,
so the case is closed.

216
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,646
What's with that look?

217
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,732
Shouldn't you be shouting with joy?

218
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,067
It was only natural.

219
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,860
Natural?

220
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,239
But I find it a little odd.

221
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,701
You looked into it on your own,
disobeying my order,

222
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,538
so you must know who planned it.

223
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,670
So I'm telling you

224
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,342
that Cha Joo-eun's case isn't that simple.

225
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,846
Someone killed the deputy chief's plan
with a single shot.

226
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,933
Who did that? And why?

227
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,894
I'm not sure.

228
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,941
Hey, do you really have no idea?

229
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,486
Not even an inkling?

230
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,532
This is a game of kingmaker.

231
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,326
Do you think you'll be able to handle it?

232
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,454
-What?
-You'd have to cross the line.

233
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,041
If you're willing to do that,
I'll tell you.

234
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,350
This is An Se-jin from
the industrial technology team.

235
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,311
Please retrieve your vehicle.

236
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,859
It's all good now, then.

237
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,111
Thanks.

238
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,238
Well, it all happened because of me.

239
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,906
Still.

240
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,993
All right. I'll see you later.

241
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,246
-Come home soon.
-See you.

242
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,760
Congratulations
on getting your name cleared.

243
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,346
What's this?

244
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,681
It's so pretty.

245
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,725
Thanks.

246
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,561
Let's go.

247
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,646
Let's get the car and go out to eat.

248
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,525
Oh, it's at the police agency.

249
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,403
I'm an idiot.

250
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,947
It's okay. We can eat later.

251
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,450
Let's go. I'll call you a cab.

252
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,167
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

253
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,425
Jeez, they're so rude.

254
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,387
They confiscated it,
so they should return it to me.

255
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,556
Why do I have to pick it up myself?

256
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,587
-Myung-hyun.
-Yes.

257
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,798
What?

258
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,717
What are you staring at?

259
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,387
It's nothing. What is it?

260
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,056
-What do you want for lunch?
-I'm going to skip it.

261
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,769
The hallway surveillance footage
and Cha Joo-eun.

262
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,605
I think I have the right
to hear the full story.

263
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,443
It looks good.

264
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,367
It's good.

265
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,453
Why aren't you eating?

266
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,914
Try it. It's really good.

267
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,251
Fine.

268
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,712
You're a sensible person,

269
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,756
so you probably know what's going on.

270
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,260
That the police force isn't healthy.

271
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,388
It's bruised, broken,
and infected everywhere.

272
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,599
It has a lot of sore spots.

273
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:40,145
And because it wasn't treated quickly,
it's gotten sicker.

274
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:45,775
So I thought
I should find medicine for it.

275
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,325
Don't you think we should stop it
from becoming incurable?

276
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,665
I know.

277
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,585
But Myung-hyun,

278
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,172
will you promise me one thing?

279
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,843
Don't get ill.

280
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,139
I mean, sometimes you fall sick
while taking care

281
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,766
of a sick person.

282
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,519
I like it when you're healthy.

283
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,855
So…

284
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,237
you pay for this meal, like a healthy man.

285
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,864
Thanks.

286
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,710
What's wrong?

287
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,504
Are you crying?

288
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,424
Jeez, what's wrong with me?

289
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,845
This is too delicious, so…

290
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,975
I must be crazy.

291
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,439
Excuse me for a minute.

292
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,669
Why so many candles?
Is it someone's birthday?

293
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,546
There are 2, 4, 6, 8 big candles.

294
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,798
Is someone turning 80? What's going on?

295
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,176
This is from me to Joo-eun.

296
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,554
Isn't it nice?

297
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,024
Congratulations! Congratulations!

298
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,735
We're happy to have you back!

299
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,906
I was scared that you'd go to jail again.

300
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,491
I thought I'd lose my buddy.

301
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,831
Don't worry.
I'll hang out with you forever.

302
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,794
Joo-eun. There's something
I really want to ask you.

303
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,922
The motorcycle guy. It's him, right?

304
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,800
Did you know?

305
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,056
You knew, Tae-joo.

306
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,769
Right? That Chinese food delivery guy.

307
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,937
See? I was right.

308
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,230
-See?
-What?

309
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,067
Then will he give us free dumplings
from now on?

310
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,778
A free sweet and sour pork
for three jajangmyeon?

311
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,821
Food is all you think about, isn't it?

312
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,243
-What?
-Stand up.

313
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,996
Why? Do you want a piece of me?

314
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,332
I don't need freebies.

315
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,774
Was the massage chair a genie?

316
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,445
Wrap it up if you're done partying.

317
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,115
Come in and let's talk business
between adults.

318
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,411
You want me to help you?

319
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,288
Again? No questions asked?

320
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,583
But you asked me to recruit you first.

321
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,710
That was to get back at Jeong Bok-gi.

322
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,921
But this is for Kim Jae-wook.

323
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,591
It's the same thing. The budget
got a little bigger, but that's all.

324
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,718
So the budget got a little bigger,

325
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,846
but now we're playing kingmaker?

326
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,808
Politics?

327
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,853
I thought it was a love affair.

328
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,564
What I think is simple.

329
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,609
Money's the only thing I want to
put my time and energy into.

330
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,111
And

331
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,199
what am I getting out of this?

332
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,536
Mom, if you wait just a little more--

333
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,746
It's not just me.

334
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,623
What are we all getting out of this?

335
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,959
Han Son,

336
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,669
-are you getting anything?
-Well…

337
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,130
How about you?

338
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,090
What?

339
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,344
What will you get?

340
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,638
Love?

341
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,310
You're asking us to sacrifice ourselves
for your love.

342
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,812
Rewrite the scenario.

343
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,608
I won't give you much time.

344
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:41,654
I can go to the police
and tell them about Jeong Bok-gi.

345
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,865
But before that,

346
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,243
how will In-suk react if she finds out
about you and Jeong Bok-gi?

347
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,664
Take your time if you want to find out.

348
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,262
-Joo-eun.
-Don't say no.

349
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,097
I know. I'm sorry.

350
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,058
I'm not forcing…

351
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,395
I know. I know it all too well,

352
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,524
but I have no other choice.

353
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,863
You said we all crossed the line.

354
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,074
This isn't just any line.

355
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,452
It's a totally different world.
We'll suffocate there.

356
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,995
What about now?

357
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,459
Does it look like I'm living contently
and breathing freely right now?

358
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,463
I haven't been able to breathe properly
for quite a while.

359
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,279
So I have no choice but to do it.

360
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,658
I will do this.

361
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,773
You can use those from now on.

362
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,693
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
RESIDENT REGISTRATION, PARK GEON-IL

363
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,486
Thank you.

364
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,740
All right. Now,

365
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,409
what are you planning to do first?

366
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,286
May I see your plan?

367
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,665
Before that,
there's something I need to ask you.

368
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,255
You remember President Choi Kyung-hwan
of UI construction, don't you?

369
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,885
He left a secret ledger.

370
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,804
Is your name in the ledger?

371
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,811
I'm trying to be someone
who needs to know the truth.

372
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,401
I wouldn't know that

373
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,820
because I didn't write it.

374
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,079
Ledgers, notebooks, memos,

375
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,582
all of these things,
aren't they just personal opinions?

376
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:45,713
Just like a diary that is written
solely from the writer's perspective.

377
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,679
If you're curious about my relationship
with President Choi,

378
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,974
viewing the trial records

379
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:02,271
will help you understand faster.

380
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,694
Okay.

381
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,906
I'll report to you
as soon as I devise a plan.

382
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,367
I'll promise you this.

383
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,121
If I win this war,

384
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,416
I will restore

385
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,127
your identity.

386
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,052
So you better come up with a good plan.

387
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,005
That bastard.

388
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,425
LOST

389
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,261
What did you do with that bitch?

390
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,765
This is no time to fool around
with a con woman because she's a looker!

391
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,187
What do you think will happen
if Director Oh finds out about this?

392
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,815
He was against the reinstatement
of the Vision Room from the get-go.

393
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,735
He only shut up
because you married his daughter.

394
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:39,989
What are you going to do if she goes
to her daddy and whines about this?

395
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,109
Excuse me. Hey! Wait!

396
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,243
Hey!

397
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,001
-Detective Kim!
-Yes?

398
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,962
-Where are you going?
-I have to go.

399
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,672
-Where to?
-I can't explain.

400
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,548
-Where--
-Come on.

401
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,218
Damn it.

402
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,811
Are you okay?

403
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,690
Darn it.

404
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,296
That was Lee Jeong-hwan, wasn't it?

405
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,590
Can't you see that I'm hurt?

406
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,634
I mean, what kind of cop

407
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:28,180
injures a civilian and interrogates them
without an apology?

408
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,726
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

409
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,936
Did I tear my ligaments?

410
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,274
This won't do.
I need to go to the hospital.

411
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,609
I just don't get this.

412
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,905
Why not? I could go to the hospital.

413
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,533
Why are you on Lee Jeong-hwan's side?

414
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,701
He scammed you.

415
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,914
You're being quite harsh.

416
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,460
Who are you to judge our relationship?

417
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,627
You have no right to.

418
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,254
This is my last warning.

419
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,675
If this ever happens again,
I'll arrest you first

420
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,761
for concealing and helping him escape.

421
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:07,928
What?

422
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,020
I'm Lee Jeong-hwan.

423
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,315
I've heard a lot about you.
You're Detective Kim Myung-hyun, right?

424
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,072
It's nice to meet you.

425
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,334
God, you startled me.

426
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,355
All you had to do is sit back and watch.

427
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,857
How could you fail at that?

428
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,944
You bastard.

429
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:09,824
Even kids can sit still for 30 minutes
to watch a cartoon.

430
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,035
So what's your problem?

431
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,540
Hey, open your eyes. Open them.

432
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,667
Okay.

433
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,961
Your eyes are still good as new.
It'd be a waste.

434
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,547
Let's donate them. You don't need them.

435
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,055
That's enough. It's not a pretty sight.

436
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,699
Aren't you going to introduce us, Mr. Kim?

437
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,705
Say hello to Lawyer Oh Hyun-kyung.

438
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,166
She's the new team manager
of Development Team Two

439
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,750
that's been vacant for some time.

440
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,921
This is Deputy Chief Kim Jae-wook
from Innovative Vision Room.

441
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,132
What are you doing here, honey?

442
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,179
I don't think this is a happy situation.

443
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,160
I heard you like to have a beer
at a convenience store.

444
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,582
Are you blatantly bragging
that you did a background check on me?

445
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,835
I wasn't bragging.
I was just showing you who I am

446
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,587
since you seemed to be curious.

447
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,549
GK Technology
Innovative Vision Room's shadows.

448
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,177
You know them, right?

449
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,514
I do.

450
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:02,269
They're the reason that this country is
tainted, reeking, and rotting.

451
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:08,526
Since the team was formed, they've been
successful for several decades.

452
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,154
Thanks to the team,
there's been no justice in this country,

453
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,823
and our salaries have kept rising.

454
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:21,121
I heard you don't go to bars
to avoid misunderstandings.

455
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,000
And that's why you drink beers
at a convenience store.

456
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,627
Am I right?

457
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,133
So let me ask you this.

458
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,970
Is it possible for righteous cops

459
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,224
to exist in a world that has no justice?

460
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,393
How much do you have?

461
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,561
Five thousand won.

462
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,734
Gosh.

463
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,116
WOOK'S GUKBAP

464
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,371
-Hey.
-Hey.

465
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,455
Have a seat.

466
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,887
Bye.

467
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,767
LOTTERY TICKET

468
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,613
What are you trying to say?

469
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,574
Don't focus your justice on me.

470
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,411
Instead, shouldn't you strive
to make a world where cops

471
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,622
can enter bars without worries?

472
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,002
It's an unsolved case about a man
named Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

473
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,884
Why are you so startled?

474
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,137
I'm your partner, not a stalker.

475
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,931
Aren't you glad to see me?

476
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,267
You can't go through all that by yourself.

477
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,064
Now, what are we looking for?

478
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,610
Gosh.

479
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,238
-You scared me to death.
-Jeez.

480
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,532
KWON HYUK-JANG
REQUEST FOR NON INDICTMENT

481
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,994
Why do you think
Kwon Hyuk-jang lied to you?

482
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,914
He must know that it's not easy
to prove he was on the take.

483
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,708
Does that mean Kim Jae-wook also--

484
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,503
I'm sure he's not going to take action
until he has complete proof.

485
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,048
But Yoo Byung-jun is also in this ledger.

486
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,634
That's what we need to prove.

487
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,639
Then who's Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

488
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,935
He was President Choi's driver
at that time.

489
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,122
JEONG HYEON-CHEOL
SELF-IMMOLATION CASE

490
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,082
I found it.

491
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,757
INVESTIGATION REPORT

492
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,091
It was suicide.

493
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,800
He's here.

494
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,845
Okay, good job. Thanks.

495
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,725
GYEONGGI BUCHON GUKBAP MURDER CASE

496
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,435
As you can see,

497
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,939
they stabbed each other to death
due to financial difficulties,

498
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,148
for insurance money.

499
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,817
Isn't that crazy?

500
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,530
But what was even crazier
was what happened afterwards.

501
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,242
The insurance company refused to pay,
stating that they died while fighting.

502
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:54,830
However, their son, the beneficiary,
sued them.

503
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,040
And he won.

504
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,709
He was a senior in high school.

505
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:03,130
In the end, he received
a sum of 500 million won.

506
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,299
That kid's name

507
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,259
is Kim Jae-wook.

508
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,268
I shouldn't have looked into this.

509
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,312
What?

510
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,689
Nothing. Thanks.

511
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,234
Wait.

512
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:31,783
My eldest kid wants to go
to one more cram school these days.

513
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,996
Mr. Lee Min-kyu.

514
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,247
Yes?

515
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,083
Do you want to get fired
for being a corrupt cop?

516
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,085
I've handed over a few crooks to you.

517
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,213
You shouldn't be too greedy.
Don't you think so?

518
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,986
Thanks.

519
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,159
Bad students always
blame their cram schools.

520
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:17,008
ADIOS

521
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,477
It's unlike you to drink soju.

522
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,858
Congratulations.
I heard you cleared your name.

523
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,861
It was bound to happen anyway.

524
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,741
-What will you do now?
-What do you mean?

525
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,287
Are you going to run your detective agency
and live happily ever after?

526
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,874
What about Spy Lee?

527
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,334
I was about to ask you.

528
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,131
We're going to continue with our plan
to get back at Kim Jae-wook, right?

529
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:02,178
Of course.
That's what I live for every day.

530
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,892
Then I guess I have no choice
but to keep working with you.

531
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,310
What?

532
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,813
We're going to become kingmakers

533
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,648
for Kwon Hyuk-jang.

534
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,863
He promised to give Jeong-hwan
his identity back.

535
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,450
So

536
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:28,371
you want me to sabotage Edward's plan
to become a kingmaker with you?

537
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:29,956
Exactly.

538
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,544
This is just a continuation
of the documentary

539
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,379
you proposed to me before.

540
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,842
That'll be fun.

541
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,721
I want everything he's ever wanted

542
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,725
and dreamed of to go down the drain.

543
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,187
Cheers.

544
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,959
We're ready.

545
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,976
Please change into those clothes.

546
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,019
This way, please.

547
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,149
Yoo Byung-jun needs to step down!

548
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,901
-Step down!
-Step down!

549
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,945
Hanjong Chemical needs to wake up!

550
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,780
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

551
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,075
Hanjong Chemical sponsored Yoo Byung-jun.
He needs to step down!

552
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,743
-Step down!
-Step down!

553
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,578
Hanjong Chemical needs to wake up!

554
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,372
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

555
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,874
Yoo Byung-jun needs to step down!

556
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,543
So one of the employees got cancer?

557
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,545
Yes, sir.

558
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,173
Let's meet them
before Hanjong makes their move.

559
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:03,967
Pardon?

560
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,013
A victimized civilian has been shunned
by a corporation.

561
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,266
I, an assemblyman
and the people's servant,

562
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,309
ought to give them a warm embrace,
don't you think?

563
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,562
Yes, sir.

564
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,149
An environmental organization
is behind this?

565
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,609
Yes, it's called

566
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,280
La Na… La Natura?

567
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,033
It was first formed in Paris.

568
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,661
Now, they have
around 30 branches worldwide.

569
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,372
Do you know what the most popular topic
in this century is?

570
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,418
Is it privacy?

571
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,712
It's the environment.

572
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,880
I see.

573
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:45,383
As soon as this ends,
schedule a photo session with the patient.

574
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,385
I want to see
the environmentalist as well.

575
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,220
Yes, sir.

576
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,743
Come in.

577
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,582
Thank you, Sophia. Good work today.

578
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,835
It was my pleasure.
You did wonderful today, Anchor Ko.

579
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,005
I'll give you a call
once the air date is decided.

580
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,133
Okay. Environmental destruction
caused by Korean corporations

581
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,552
is a very serious issue.

582
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,305
Please emphasize that point
during the editing.

583
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,599
Okay. Get home safely.

584
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,734
Who is this?

585
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,530
I'm Shin Jong-yun. We spoke on the phone.

586
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,452
I don't think I saw your name
in today's schedule.

587
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,287
What time was our meeting again?

588
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,207
It's at 2 p.m.

589
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,459
Mr. Park, is that right?

590
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,294
Your schedule is packed today.

591
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:07,132
I've made an appointment
with your secretary in advance.

592
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,217
He's right. 2 p.m.

593
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,594
Mr. Shin Jong-yun,
the chief of staff, right?

594
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,096
Yes, that's me.

595
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,021
It wasn't easy,

596
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,734
but I met with
the Korean branch manager myself.

597
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,406
And she said she wanted
to meet with you in person.

598
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,826
-Mr. Shin.
-Yes?

599
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,787
Was I ever the type of person

600
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:42,417
that anyone could meet
just because they wanted to?

601
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,128
No, sir. Of course not.

602
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,964
I believe you can take care of it
on your own.

603
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,716
But sir.

604
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,429
She made a strange offer.

605
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,681
Well…

606
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:01,060
She claimed that she knew
Assemblyman Kwon Hyuk-jang's weakness.

607
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,360
-Why can't you set the position?
-I'm the star, right?

608
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,905
Wait. I'm the star, so she should film me.

609
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,492
Didn't you see me? "Mr. Shin Jong-yun,
the chief of staff, right?"

610
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,035
Who are you?

611
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,537
It's me.

612
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,332
Park Tae-joo, the man of the streets.

613
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,503
What do you think? Doesn't it suit me?

614
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,213
What's going on here?

615
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,714
A part-time job.

616
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,466
What kind?

617
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:35,720
Ms. Chung was hugely impressed
by my awesome acting skills,

618
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,223
so she paid me a hefty sum to hire me.

619
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,767
These two were just extras.

620
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,520
-Extras?
-Elaborate on that.

621
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,525
I think Bok-gi's up to something.

622
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,425
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

623
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,469
I'm Sophia Chung.

624
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:21,015
I'm not the type who enjoys chatting.

625
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,893
So I'd like you to cut to the chase.

626
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:29,232
All right. I didn't come here
for a date either.

627
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,858
So I'll get to the point.

628
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,041
Hello?

629
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,086
Ms. Cha, what is this regarding?

630
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,671
Where are you right now?

631
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,549
I'm in a meeting. If it's not urgent,
call me later.

632
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,552
Are you with Yoo Byung-jun?

633
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,054
No.

634
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,307
Why?

635
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,560
I heard. You're working on him,
aren't you?

636
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:10,940
I got it. Let's take
the North Pole issue one step at a time.

637
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,984
I'll call you back later.

638
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,578
At times like this,
I wish I had ten bodies.

639
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,747
I'm sorry. Where were we again?

640
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,915
Right.

641
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,293
You wanted me
to stop beating around the bush.

642
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,380
You've heard
of President Choi Kyung-hwan's ledger,

643
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,424
haven't you?

644
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:45,016
I know whose hands it's in right now.

645
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,354
Aren't you curious?

646
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,620
Yes?

647
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,332
Gosh.

648
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,794
Whose number do I need to track this time?

649
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,337
I'll tell you that later.

650
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,005
Track it first.

651
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,341
Damn it.

652
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,848
President Choi's ledger?

653
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:30,353
Why don't you tell me who you really are?

654
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,317
I believe I've already introduced myself.

655
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,945
You and I both know

656
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,115
that's not who you really are.

657
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,659
Let's not deceive each other from now on.

658
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,080
You created a fake
environmental organization.

659
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,166
I have to say, that was

660
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,669
quite original.

661
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,130
I must applaud you for that.

662
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,551
Clap, clap, clap.

663
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,681
I just wanted

664
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:11,811
to become close friends with you.

665
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,273
You're intimidating me a bit too much
when we've just met.

666
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:19,360
You see, I'm not the type who easily

667
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,114
befriends just about anyone,

668
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,660
especially someone who refuses
to tell me who they are.

669
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,789
Is that so?

670
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,583
All right, then.

671
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:38,087
Due to my thoughtlessness,
I must've made a mistake.

672
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,047
I apologize.

673
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,425
Thank you for the valuable lesson.

674
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:47,388
I have an appointment
with Assemblyman Kwon Hyuk-jang soon.

675
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,514
So goodbye.

676
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,985
-Yes, sir.
-Bring her back here.

677
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:04,864
But make it look like
it was your own decision to do so.

678
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,619
Ma'am.

679
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,373
Where are you going?

680
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,171
I guess my arrogant boss
got smart with you, as usual.

681
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,508
God, that geezer…

682
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,387
Please reconsider.

683
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,016
He may seem difficult,

684
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,768
but deep down,

685
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,270
he's even more of an asshole.

686
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,527
I'm a bit of a philanthropist at heart,

687
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,364
so I guess I have no other choice
but to help you out.

688
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:03,965
I was going to leave,
but I seemed to have dropped something.

689
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,765
I have such bad eyesight,

690
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,935
so I'd appreciate it
if you could help me look for it.

691
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,524
Get in.

692
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:30,491
Your time is in safe hands,

693
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,742
so hop in.

694
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,247
If you insist…

695
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,466
I'm touched that you would do that for me.

696
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,219
I'll remember that kindness.

697
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,025
Who has it?

698
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,862
The secret ledger, that is.

699
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,471
Hello, sir.

700
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,931
It's been a while.

701
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:38,601
I'm sorry.
I should've visited you more often.

702
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,438
You're right. My feelings were quite hurt.

703
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,025
That was a joke.

704
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,529
I see.

705
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,574
I didn't know you were witty as well.

706
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:57,203
I guess you could say I've got everything.

707
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,205
I see.

708
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,957
What an obnoxious son of a bitch.

709
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,750
Before we sit down,

710
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,671
I have someone special
I'd like to introduce you to.

711
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,673
Come in.

712
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,642
LOCATION SENT

713
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,560
I've sent you the location.

714
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,605
She's at One Hotel.

715
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,693
One Hotel. Gentleman's club.

716
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,654
She must be with Yoo Byung-jun.

717
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:08,065
Yoon-kyung.
What the hell are you doing here?

718
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,233
Are you scared?

719
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:13,320
You'll never understand what
GK shadows have to bear.

720
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,613
Why did Jeong-hwan…

721
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:18,159
Did you really think there's
only one copy of President Choi's ledger?

722
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:20,244
Lee Jeong-hwan knew all along.

723
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,121
She must be confused.

724
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,707
She won't be sure
if she should trust Jeong-hwan.

725
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,085
What happened?

726
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,879
Tell me the truth.

727
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:33,924
Did you kill him?

728
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:40,931
