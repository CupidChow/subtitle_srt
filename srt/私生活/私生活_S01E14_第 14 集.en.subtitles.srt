DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,392
Joo-eun! Joo-eun.

4
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,146
Joo-eun.

5
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,149
Joo-eun?

6
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,029
-Jeong-hwan.
-Joo-eun.

7
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,573
What happened?

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,409
Jeong-hwan.

9
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,370
Tell me the truth.

10
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,705
About what?

11
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,542
Did you kill him?

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,171
Did you kill Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

13
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:39,265
YEAR 2012

14
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,956
Jeong Hyeon-gu was

15
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,209
President Choi's last driver
before his death.

16
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,172
Jeong Hyeon-gu disappeared
right before President Choi's death.

17
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,175
In 2010, 3 years later,

18
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,636
he changed his name to Hyeon-cheol
and founded the Haneul Foundation.

19
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,138
As of now, he's the director.

20
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,391
And he's the one who makes
decisions for the foundation.

21
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,268
As of now, in 2012,

22
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,146
it's been reported
that he might be laundering money

23
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,231
through All Together Church.

24
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,399
Jeong Hyeon-gu?

25
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,777
The one who recanted his testimony
at Choi's retrial?

26
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,445
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,823
In 2007,

28
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,118
there was a 10-trillion-won plan
to develop Songnam into a new city.

29
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,411
And

30
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,790
UI Construction signed an exclusive
contract with the Ministry of Land.

31
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,876
President Choi Kyung-hwan.

32
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,838
President Choi Kyung-hwan
of UI Construction

33
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,548
and Minister of Land Lee Dong-ju

34
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,967
had a private meeting
which cannot be allowed.

35
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,762
Chief Prosecutor of Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office, Yoo Byung-jun,

36
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,432
indicted President Choi for bribery.

37
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,685
Based on the report we received,

38
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,937
the team has launched
an internal investigation.

39
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,692
Right before getting indicted, Lee
resigned not to burden the administration.

40
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,780
Later on,
President Choi's death cleared his name.

41
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,909
The arrest warrant was denied.

42
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,745
President Choi was questioned
without being detained.

43
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,998
I will fully cooperate
with the investigation.

44
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,583
I hereby declare…

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,670
Choi's driver, Jeong Hyeon-cheol's
testimony held the key to the trial.

46
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,714
…under penalty of perjury that…

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,799
DRIVER, JEONG HYEON-CHEOL
FORMERLY JEONG HYEON-GU

48
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,551
Witness,

49
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,513
please tell us what you saw that day.

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,728
That day, President Choi told me
to park the car in the basement

51
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,731
parking lot of the company
which was unusual.

52
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:57,820
And he was wearing a hiking outfit
and had a big hiking backpack.

53
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,906
No. You don't have to.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,330
He told me to drive to a kalguksu
restaurant we'd never been to.

55
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,474
And he met a man at the restaurant.

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,938
I have a busy schedule today,
so I'll get going first.

57
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,481
I won't see you off.

58
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,066
But

59
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,485
that man…

60
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,198
I don't remember who he was.

61
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
-Is he serious?
-That's bullshit!

62
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,119
The judge at his retrial

63
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,080
overturned the original verdict
due to a lack of evidence

64
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,791
and found President Choi not guilty.

65
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,712
The prosecution failed to establish
the bribery charge on the defendant.

66
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,799
Therefore,
I find the defendant not guilty.

67
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,926
Back then, the judge who led the retrial

68
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,053
was Chief Prosecutor Kwon Hyuk-jang.

69
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,140
Right before the Supreme Court's ruling,

70
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,934
President Choi passed away unexpectedly.

71
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,187
Someone had murdered him.

72
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,966
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

73
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,613
Director Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

74
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,617
What? What is it?

75
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,077
Where's Jeong Bok-gi?

76
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,413
Who are you?

77
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,165
Pastor Cha Hyun-tae is my father.

78
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,965
You know where Jeong Bok-gi is, don't you?

79
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,760
What's your problem? Move.

80
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,303
Are you in on it, too?

81
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,890
Are you serious right now?
I was scammed, too.

82
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,601
-Jeong Yoon-kyung deceived me, too.
-Who?

83
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,438
I'm telling you this
because you're Pastor Cha's daughter.

84
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,484
Just cry it out and drop it.
Don't look for the truth.

85
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,029
If you try anything stupid,
it'll be the end of everyone.

86
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,156
We're up against GK's shadows.

87
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,455
GK shadows?

88
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,966
EVERYONE IS TOGETHER
AT ALL TOGETHER CHURCH

89
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,724
Jeong-hwan.

90
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,272
You

91
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,399
really

92
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,153
had nothing to do
with Jeong Hyeon-cheol's death,

93
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,822
right?

94
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,452
Of course, I had nothing to do with it.

95
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,539
Joo-eun? Joo-eun.

96
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,709
Joo-eun!

97
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,384
Joo-eun.

98
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,517
I won't say no to that.

99
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,437
-Right?
-Right. Exactly. We can.

100
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,939
Hey. Who are you?

101
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,445
I need an ambulance. Call 911.

102
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,071
-Lee Jeong-hwan?
-Mr. Lee!

103
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,948
Call 911!

104
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,994
EPISODE 14

105
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,433
Ms. Cha Joo-eun's MRI scan looks fine.

106
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,769
Luckily, it's a minor contusion.

107
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,272
She had a 4cm-cut on her scalp
in the back of her head.

108
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,568
I stapled it. It'll be barely visible.
You don't have to worry.

109
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:58,412
Although it was a minor injury,
she may experience vomiting or headaches.

110
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:03,292
She's quite fatigued right now,
so we must observe her for a few days.

111
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,013
How much deeper will you drag her?

112
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,479
You've been using Joo-eun
for all these years.

113
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,315
I will not resent you for it.

114
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,401
Bye, then.

115
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,825
Stop now.

116
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,036
Pull the plug on your project
and leave her quietly.

117
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,128
That's why I'm doing all this. To end it.

118
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,963
To make them stop.

119
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,384
And I will not leave Joo-eun.

120
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,816
What are you doing? This is a hospital.

121
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,244
I don't trust a GK shadow like you.

122
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,916
I'm only helping you because of Joo-eun.

123
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,974
Gosh, my baby.

124
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,977
Joo-eun.

125
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,772
Please tell me what happened.

126
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,358
Well, a thief…

127
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,151
Jeong-hwan…

128
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,698
I don't know what happened.

129
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,079
Even her friend doesn't know
what happened.

130
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,415
I'm sorry, my daughter.
I'm such a bad father.

131
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,167
I'm glad you know.

132
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,671
What?

133
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,174
Knowledge is power.

134
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,802
Protect our daughter with that power.

135
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,345
Gosh.

136
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,724
Lord,

137
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,895
please look after
my helpless and weak daughter.

138
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,397
-Let's go. Okay?
-Oh, Lord…

139
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,233
She needs to get some rest.
Let's just go. Please.

140
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,026
Come on out. You're unbelievable.

141
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,075
-Please take care of her.
-Sure.

142
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,328
Oh, Lord.

143
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,751
You! Lee Jeong-hwan…

144
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,629
What? You said he was dead.

145
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,172
Yes.

146
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,466
He came back to life.

147
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,350
It's nice to meet you.

148
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,643
I'm Lee Jeong-hwan.

149
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,606
You bastard.

150
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,611
What were you doing
when Joo-eun was attacked?

151
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,115
Come on.
Don't resort to violence like that.

152
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:26,162
So tell me. You'll make sure
to catch the culprit, right?

153
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,958
I will catch the culprit no matter what.

154
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,460
You better.

155
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,050
I'm sorry to do this now,

156
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,346
but let me officially greet you
as your son-in-law.

157
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,197
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,244
I am truly sorry.

159
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,660
You do know

160
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,998
that Joo-eun was for real, right?

161
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,379
The feelings she has toward you are real.

162
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,530
Joo-eun.

163
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,534
I'm scared.

164
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,833
I don't know if I can do this.

165
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,017
Are you awake?

166
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,604
Sleep some more.

167
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,239
I believe you.

168
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,408
I do.

169
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,328
Jeong-hwan.

170
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,671
Jeong-hwan?

171
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,608
Good job.

172
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,486
Did Jeong Hyeon-cheol

173
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,780
really commit suicide?

174
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,535
Soo-jin.

175
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,536
Yes, sir.

176
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,038
Just do what you're told.

177
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:47,876
Do it well. Neatly and quietly.

178
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,172
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. You may leave.

179
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,207
YEAR 2012

180
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,807
Scrap the Jeong Hyeon-cheol case.

181
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,354
The Haneul Foundation,
All Together Church, and everything.

182
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
Yes, sir.

183
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:56,088
I hear the police are looking into
the Jeong Hyeon-cheol case again.

184
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,757
Why do you think that is?

185
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,388
Someone must've let them catch a whiff.

186
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,390
Who could that be?

187
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,686
Lee Jeong-hwan.

188
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,277
How much does he know?

189
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,988
At the time, there was a tip-off

190
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,242
that someone had been laundering money
through the Haneul Foundation.

191
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,329
But we were forced to scrap the plan
at an early stage.

192
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,415
Did a VIP give the order?

193
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,170
Because it was Director Oh Yeong-ju
who laundered money

194
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,548
through the Haneul Foundation at the time.

195
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,426
That's why you were stopped.

196
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,512
You knew that, so you worked on

197
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:49,141
the All Together Church project
to steal Director's Oh's funds.

198
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,061
You knew.

199
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,982
We're here together like this

200
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,401
because you and Director Oh
are on bad terms.

201
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,530
The problem is Lee Jeong-hwan.

202
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,701
He took secret lessons on the quiet.

203

JEONG HYEON-CHEOL 24 HOUR REPORT

JEONG HYEON-CHEOL, FORMERLY JEONG HYEON-GU

205
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,225
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

206
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,562
All right.

207
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,149
Let's try crossing the line.

208
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,068
What you're saying is

209
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:45,447
that this case is connected
to the political sphere, right?

210
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,285
And GK is playing a game of kingmaker.

211
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,286
Yes, sir.

212
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,458
Then,

213
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,879
what should we do now?

214
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,675
From now on, you need to tell me.

215
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,386
-Tell you what?
-The orders from GK.

216
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,724
-One more thing.
-What is it?

217
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,895
You need to spill a little
when you're dining with reporters.

218
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,815
Spill what? Food?

219
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,277
Tell them it'll be reinvestigated.

220
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,488
JEONG HYEON-CHEOL SELF-IMMOLATION CASE

221
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,031
"Jeong Hyeon-cheol' self-immolation…"

222
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,993
Hey, why would you reinvestigate this now?

223
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,830
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a minute.

224
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,333
-Hi.
-Hello?

225
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,130
I thought I should report this to you.

226
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,675
A burglar broke into our office.

227
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,260
Okay.

228
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,443
Here. Drink this.

229
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,280
Thank you.

230
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,122
What's wrong with this?

231
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,458
It's been like that since yesterday.
I think it's broken.

232
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,586
It was after a female detective came by.

233
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,756
Come to think of it, why do
so many incidents happen in that building?

234
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,855
Was it this person?

235
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,030
She only took the hard drive
from my boss' computer.

236
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,710
What's going on?

237
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,589
Yes, it's her.

238
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,300
She's the one who came by.

239
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,057
What happened?

240
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,937
Did you really do that to the CCTV
in front of the detective agency?

241
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,816
Why did you do it?

242
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,240
-Myung-hyun.
-Go ahead.

243
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,499
The surveillance camera caught you
and the dead Lee Jeong-hwan together.

244
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,669
It seemed like you'd continue to meet him,

245
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,255
so I crashed the CCTV.

246
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,637
Why didn't you tell me
that Lee Jeong-hwan was alive?

247
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,975
You're helping a criminal right now.

248
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,313
Make a decision.

249
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,108
What do you want me to do?

250
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,468
Well, I couldn't help it.

251
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,471
I finally got to meet you.

252
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,183
Nice to meet you.
I'm Corporal Kang Soo-jin.

253
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,105
I'm Lee Jeong-hwan.

254
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,651
All right, then. What should we do first?

255
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,992
With his warmhearted farmer image,
economic and housing stabilization policy,

256
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,495
Kwon Hyuk-jang's
approval rating is still rising.

257
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,710
Okay. You may leave.

258
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,842
APPROVAL RATINGS
KWON HYUK-JANG, YOO BYUNG-JUN

259
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,516
-What about Jeong Hyeon-cheol?
-I'm working on it.

260
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,353
Okay. Let's set the debut date.

261
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,607
KWON HYUK-JANG

262

JEONG HYEON-CHEOL SELF-IMMOLATION CASE

263
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,553
Kim Myung-hyun asked you about this?

264
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,055
What should I do?

265
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,561
So you want to create
a fake Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

266
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,564
The world won't believe us
with only the ledger.

267
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,733
Won't they notice?

268
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,779
He just has to give testimony that aligns
with President Choi's secret ledger

269
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,906
because we have the ledger.

270
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,826
Lee Jeong-hwan has it too,

271
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,121
but that'll make them believe us more.

272
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,165
Since it'll match the ledger.

273
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,919
-Fine. Proceed.
-Okay.

274
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,047
JEONG HYEON-CHEOL SELF-IMMOLATION CASE

275
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,215
Do what he asked.

276
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,970
What? Is there really
something about this case?

277
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,932
Kim Myung-hyun. What an interesting guy.

278
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,605
Can't you see?

279
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,775
He joined hands with Lee Jeong-hwan.

280
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,694
What?

281
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,531
Why… That crazy…

282
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,074
Lee Jeong-hwan

283
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,703
is finally using the ledger.

284
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,893
Wait outside.

285
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,520
She can stay.

286
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,191
Why did you want to see me?

287
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,737
It's about

288
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,824
something unexpected
that Mr. Lee Jeong-hwan told me.

289
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,163
He mentioned President Choi's
secret ledger

290
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,416
in front of me.

291
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,672
Did he?

292
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,345
Does he really know
about the secret ledger?

293
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,848
Does it matter
if he knows about it or not?

294
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,942
Don't worry.

295
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,737
Without other evidence
to back up the ledger,

296
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,906
he won't be able to use it.

297
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,536
Of course, he won't be.

298
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,884
I'm sure GK has

299
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,762
President Choi's secret ledger now. Right?

300
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,141
I don't know where you heard that rumor,

301
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,226
but it's fake news.

302
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,689
It was me. I was the one
who delivered the malicious news.

303
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,942
Someone who claims to have been close

304
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,695
to President Choi Kyung-hwan in the past.

305
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,532
Jeong Bok-gi is Jeong Yoon-kyung.

306
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,745
Then she must know the truth.

307
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,672
She's here.

308
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,507
Okay.

309
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,804
Hello, I'm Sophia Chung.

310
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,431
Hello.

311
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,601
I hear you're the best in this field.

312
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,769
Well, yes.

313
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,689
I'd like to ask you for private lessons.

314
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,649
I don't give private lessons.

315
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,776
You can sign up at an academy.

316
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,153
Mr. Cho.

317
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,720
This is the student you'll teach.

318
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,987
Would you like to go to a concert with me?

319
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,178
Is there a concert hall
in a small building like this?

320
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,390
I'm sure you'll like it. This way, please.

321
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,837
Min-seo dances so well.
She must take after you.

322
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,339
What the hell are you trying to do?

323
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,549
Sir.

324
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,760
Politics is all about stories.

325
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,804
You know that.

326
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,273
Let's go.

327
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,191
No!

328
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,527
Let go!

329
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,451
You're so handsome.

330
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,453
He's so cool.

331
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,954
I'm so jealous, Min-seo.

332
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,123
He's so tall.

333
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,000
This is unbelievable.

334
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,669
He's so good-looking.

335
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,171
He looks even better in person.

336
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,257
-Awesome.
-This is so cool.

337
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,217
Seriously?

338
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,096
Thanks for approving of this, Dad.

339
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,183
Please take good care of Min-seo.

340
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,602
You should say that to the director.

341
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,026
Min-seo looks so pretty.

342
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,944
Look here.

343
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,280
She looks so lovely.

344
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,122
KWON HYUK-JANG
YOO BYUNG-JUN

345
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,583
2.3% INCREASE

346
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,494
I know you meant well,

347
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,996
but I assume you made a mistake

348
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,207
because you didn't know me well.

349
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:31,254
They say politicians
would do anything to be the president.

350
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,257
Are you not the case?

351
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,051
If you keep pressing her,

352
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,720
she might explode like a typical teenager.

353
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,431
If she's talked about on the news,

354
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,810
then the race will be over right there.

355
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,563
You just need to give her

356
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,566
an hour a day.

357
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,746
Would you like to dance?

358
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,666
Pardon?

359
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,377
I think Min-seo takes after her dad.

360
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,963
No?

361
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,409
It's a beach town in southeastern Mexico.

362
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,038
The beach there is amazing.

363
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,206
You didn't think

364
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,670
we'd really build a church, did you?

365
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,130
Pack light.

366
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,593
We can buy what we need there.

367
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,763
Edward?

368
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,813
It's fine. You can answer it.

369
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,024
Tell them the truth
and everything you witnessed.

370
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,445
You can just leave me out of it
as I saved your life.

371
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,160
Quit it here and now.

372
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,665
I don't want to save your life twice.
Got it?

373
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,586
-Yoon-kyung--
-Don't.

374
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,506
I've matured too much.

375
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,527
May I

376
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,989
do something that's out of character?

377
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,786
I'm sorry.

378
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,915
Let's stop here for today.

379
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:26,614
PORK RIBS APLENTY

380
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,032
Hey.

381
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,493
Do you want a drink already?

382
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:31,952
Where's Dad?

383
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,790
Pastor Cha is preaching right now.

384
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,458
What?

385
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,085
Did you know

386
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,797
that the great King David
was the eighth son

387
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,258
and that only eight individuals
got on Noah's ark?

388
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,971
The Lord created this world
for seven days.

389
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:55,684
Then on the eighth day,
the entire world moved as planned.

390
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,563
Hence, the number eight
symbolizes "completion."

391
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,691
I've gone through and endured

392
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,569
those painful days

393
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,905
and have now become complete.

394
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,240
-Amen.
-I believe you.

395
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,741
-Hallelujah.
-I believe you.

396
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,410
-Amen.
-I believe you.

397
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,162
I would like to share

398
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,082
my blessings with you.

399
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,792
-Hallelujah!
-Amen!

400
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,127
-Hallelujah!
-Amen!

401
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,295
Hallelujah!

402
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,173
Think hard. You remember
Jeong Hyeon-cheol, don't you?

403
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,384
Of course, I knew Director Jeong.

404
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,513
I heard the terrible news
while I was incarcerated.

405
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,225
Oh, Father. Please pity

406
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,018
-his poor soul--
-Dad.

407
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,646
Right.

408
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,316
Did Jeong Bok-gi
and Jeong Hyeon-cheol know each other?

409
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,068
Of course.

410
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,821
The deaconess introduced me to him.

411
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,782
Deaconess, my foot.
Just call her by her name.

412
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,284
Okay.

413
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,247
Did you only make his acquaintance?
Or do you know anything?

414
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,625
Well, I don't know much
about the foundation.

415
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,170
You were so thoughtless.

416
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,297
How could you trust him
when you knew nothing?

417
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,259
It's just like how you married Jeong-hwan.
Like father, like daughter.

418
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,553
Why would you bring that up right now?

419
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,597
I'm sorry, my daughter.

420
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,100
Anyway, I don't know anything
about the foundation.

421
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,352
I only had my eyes on Jesus.

422
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,526
What about you?
How much did you investigate?

423
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,197
Since he had committed suicide,
I couldn't find out much.

424
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,157
He had no one around him.

425
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,535
Other than his parents who were farming,

426
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,497
he had absolutely no one,
not even friends.

427
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,124
The director of a church foundation

428
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,044
was caught sexually assaulting
the female followers.

429
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,254
No wonder he killed himself.

430
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,802
Joo-eun, how's your head by the way?

431
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,263
Oh, it's okay.

432
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,308
Still, shouldn't you be at home resting?

433
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,228
It does hurt a bit.

434
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,355
See?

435
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,856
Maybe some money would help.

436
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,984
Money? Sure.
Where did I put my 1,000 won bill?

437
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,363
-Gosh.
-Gosh, forget it. You can use it.

438
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,280
Should I?

439
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,868
Right. My son-in-law is quite a looker.

440
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,663
-You met him?
-I sure did.

441
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,040
He's tall and handsome.

442
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,960
He looks exactly like me when I was young.

443
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,002
That's not true.

444
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,421
Of course, it is.
I thought I was looking at a mirror.

445
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,799
He could've been my doppelgänger.

446
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,300
I can't believe you.

447
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,498
What do you think you're doing?

448
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,666
What do you mean?

449
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,128
Is this…

450
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,216
Is this your way of getting revenge?

451
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,634
"Revenge"?

452
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,264
Did you wrong me in any way?

453
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,767
Didn't you tell me?

454
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,354
That the word "revenge" is reserved
for people who have been wronged.

455
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,402
What am I doing, you asked?

456
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,784
I'm trying

457
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,829
to become happy.

458
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,583
There's someone who needs to see that.

459
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,628
So go sit down and watch

460
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,963
how happy I can become.

461
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,799
Yoo Byung-jun.

462
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:00,137
He will never be able to make you happy!

463
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,934
Why didn't you pick up?

464
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,561
Did you call? Sorry, I was a bit busy.

465
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,230
With what?

466
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,358
Do I need to report everything to you?

467
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,610
We're a team.

468
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:01,490
I've been pondering
how to disappoint Edward.

469
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,908
And?

470
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,203
It's still at its early stages
to be put into action.

471
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,664
Can you at least let me in on the summary?

472
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,583
I'm too embarrassed to tell you.
It's not ready.

473
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,419
Once it's complete,

474
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,129
you'll tell me, right?

475
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,256
Of course. We're a team.

476
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,425
I'll brag about it.

477
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,594
-Want a glass?
-No, thanks.

478
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,972
What is it this time?

479
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,223
Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

480
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,309
-You know him, right?
-What?

481
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,937
Director Jeong Hyeon-cheol
of the Haneul Foundation.

482
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:36,733
I'm not interrogating you
about how you duped my dad,

483
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,402
so don't get the wrong idea.

484
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,323
Right. You must be more familiar
with Jeong Hyeon-gu.

485
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,828
President Choi Kyung-hwan's driver,
Jeong Hyeon-gu. Right?

486
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,456
I'd like to know

487
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,627
if your encounter with him was
coincidental or fated.

488
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,755
It was ill-fated.

489
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,549
Is that it?

490
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,050
What else do you want to know?

491
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,094
I was wondering if you were the reason

492
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,388
he died.

493
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,227
You're a terrible detective.

494
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,355
Listen carefully

495
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,608
because this is quite deep.

496
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:26,200
The Hyeon-gu I knew
would never sexually assault any women.

497
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,454
And he didn't have the balls

498
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,414
to set himself on fire.

499
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:34,917
Do you not get it?

500
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,670
It means someone concocted a story

501
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,424
in order to kill Jeong Hyeon-cheol
of the Haneul Foundation.

502
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,135
And they're powerful enough

503
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,305
to fabricate people's private lives
and create victims.

504
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,023
CHANGED NAME AND WORKED
AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HANEUL FOUNDATION

505
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,983
ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN MONEY LAUNDERING

506
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,401
Then…

507
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:07,574
what if that powerful individual
used Jeong Hyeon-cheol and the foundation

508
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,077
for money laundering?

509
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,830
Are you serious right now?
I was scammed, too.

510
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,707
Jeong Yoon-kyung deceived me, too.

511
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,750
Who?

512
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:20,712
And what if you and Kim Jae-wook
made another bank account

513
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,506
and stole that money from him?

514
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,760
And as a consequence,
Jeong Hyeon-cheol was killed

515
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,220
for not doing his job.

516
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,847
What do you say?

517
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,975
Am I a good detective now?

518
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,274
So in conclusion, you were the one
who got him killed.

519
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,276
I didn't know.

520
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,486
I found out about it later on.

521
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,907
Edward. He was the mastermind.

522
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,704
No. Jeong Hyeon-cheol said
that Jeong Yoon-kyung had deceived him.

523
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,207
But I didn't know who that was back then.

524
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,213
How can we keep working together

525
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,842
when you have so many secrets?

526
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,762
It's all in the past.
Why are you bringing it up now?

527
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,389
I want to know

528
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,685
who was behind Jeong Hyeon-cheol
and the Haneul Foundation.

529
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,604
You know who it was, right?

530
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,606
Fine.

531
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,736
I guess you should know that much
if you're to help me.

532
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,740
Director Oh Yeong-ju.

533
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,953
Director Oh Yeong-ju of GK Construction.

534
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,709
He took everything
from President Choi Kyung-hwan.

535
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,503
What I want to know is,

536
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,547
if Jeong Bok-gi didn't know

537
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,091
who I am like you didn't.

538
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,594
I mean, who my dad is.

539
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,930
How is Mr. Oh?

540
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,351
I should've visited him to say hello.

541
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:35,263
PORK RIBS APLENTY

542
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,980
Welcome.

543
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:49,861
Jeong-hwan.

544
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,824
I'm sorry. You can scold me later.

545
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,841
I made you come here on purpose.

546
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,053
So that they'd scold you.

547
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,019
Be honest with me.

548
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,983
When did you join hands with Director Oh?

549
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,155
Director Oh

550
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,658
was never part
of the Innovative Vision Room.

551
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,788
But he always kept an eye on us.

552
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,749
The VIPs gave him that power.

553
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,880
Fine, I admit it.

554
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,801
I wanted to become successful.
That was why

555
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,262
I intentionally approached

556
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,557
Lawyer Oh's law firm,
with an ulterior motive.

557
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,980
There was no way for me

558
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,778
to find success within GK.

559
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,868
I'm sorry,

560
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,370
Joo-eun.

561
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,334
For living this kind of life.

562
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,560
I've always wanted to come up here.

563
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,729
What?

564
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,190
You knew I lived here?

565
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,150
Of course.

566
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,402
I came here every time I missed you.

567
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,906
Then you should've come up.

568
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,245
Why couldn't you have told me
that you were still alive?

569
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,750
Do you know how painful it is
to keep a secret?

570
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,303
This is nice.

571
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,794
Nothing has changed.

572
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,129
I know.

573
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,799
Now, we just need to work hard

574
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,051
and save enough money
to get a house on lease.

575
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,495
WOOK'S GUKBAP

576
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,102
Hello, Mr. Kim.

577
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,979
You should begin.

578
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,325
What? Is something wrong?

579
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,619
No, sir.

580
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,020
What am I doing, you asked?

581
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,983
I'm trying

582
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,610
to become happy.

583
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,575
Damn it.

584
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,918
Thank you for the meal.

585
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,520
Hello, everyone.
I'm Assemblyman Yoo Byung-jun.

586
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,524
Do you remember
President Choi Kyung-hwan of UI

587
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,985
who suddenly committed suicide
13 years ago?

588
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:27,365
Today, I will reveal a record
written by President Choi himself

589
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:31,745
of all the illegal transactions he made
with powerful politicians.

590
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,623
I have a question!

591
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,798
Breaking news.

592
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,010
Today at 1 p.m., Assemblyman Yoo
from the Conservative Reform Party

593
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,887
had an emergency press conference

594
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,557
where he revealed the secret ledger
of President Choi Kyung-hwan from UI.

595
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,352
The ledger owned by President Choi,
who passed away in 2007,

596
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,481
contains all the details
regarding all the bribes

597
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,400
he had offered to politicians.

598
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,569
It's expected to have great repercussions.

599
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,197
This ledger which President Choi
had recorded himself

600
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,533
shows that Assemblyman Kwon
from the Conservative Reform Party

601
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,912
had received two billion won in cash
from him.

602
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,705
In 2007,

603
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,541
regarding the Songnam
New Town Development Bribery Case,

604
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,711
Assemblyman Kwon acquitted
President Choi during the second trial.

605
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,755
He will inevitably be suspected

606
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,801
of taking bribes
in return for an acquittal.

607
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,553
The prosecution believes
that this ledger will serve

608
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,597
as important evidence to…

609
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,225
-Do you feel guilty?
-Will you withdraw the candidacy?

610
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,060
-How do you feel?
-Will you apologize?

611
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,354
-Are you sorry?
-Please say something.

612
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,064
Do you admit to taking a bribe?

613
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,775
-There was another case--
-Do you feel guilty?

614
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,318
Do you admit to the charges?

615
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,986
Would you like to apologize?

616
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,156
YOO BYUNG-JUN 50.1%
KWON HYUK-JANG 6.5%

617
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,580
Jeong-hwan.

618
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,386
It'll all work out.

619
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,681
It's not over yet.

620
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,893
If we think hard…

621
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,355
If we think long and hard,

622
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,691
we'll find a way.

623
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,650
I'm positive.

624
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,072
I met your parents.

625
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,285
They're a bit feisty, aren't they?

626
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,828
I'm sorry.

627
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,916
I'd be in huge trouble
if I ever mistreated you.

628
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,504
Someone who was loved so dearly

629
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,258
chose to be with me.

630
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,511
You're such a precious person.

631
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,101
But I…

632
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,023
I'm sorry.

633
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,650
No, don't be.

634
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,652
I had a tough childhood.

635
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,113
It's okay.

636
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:14,908
That's why

637
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,245
I'm going to act selfishly for your sake.

638
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,582
Although I feel bad for him.

639
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,793
What do you mean?

640
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:31,966
Where are we going?

641
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,969
I want to introduce you to someone.

642
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,562
SEOUL EMPLOYMENT CONSULTING

643
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,399
Wait here.

644
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,317
Okay.

645

SEOUL EMPLOYMENT CONSULTING

647
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,010
He's very shy of strangers,

648
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,762
so it may take a few days.

649
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,061
This is the final blow.

650
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,938
APPROVAL RATINGS

651
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,023
Here comes the finishing blow.

652
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,070
Having drinks won't cut it.

653
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,280
You should also

654
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,241
-stand in front of the camera.
-I'm Chief Jeong Dae-sang.

655
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,451
Our Cold Case Team

656
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,288
has decided to reinvestigate
the self-immolation case

657
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,708
that occurred eight years ago
on the rooftop of the Haneul Foundation.

658
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,169
If it wasn't suicide,
have you found proof that it was homicide?

659
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,589
-Have you found the suspect?
-Please elaborate.

660
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,558
You're Reporter Kim Gi-cheol, right?

661
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,769
Mr. Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

662
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,104
I came on his behalf.

663
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,356
As you already know,

664
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,235
my client can't show himself
to the world just yet.

665
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,782
But I can videotape him.

666
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,243
The Haneul Foundation Case
happened eight years ago

667
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,495
when a man self-immolated

668
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,831
in order to clear his name.

669
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,250
He was under investigation
for sexually assaulting

670
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,461
two female members of a congregation.

671
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,380
Director Jeong Hyeon-cheol
of the Haneul Foundation

672
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,299
had claimed innocence

673
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,302
and ultimately committed self-immolation

674
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,971
on the rooftop of the Haneul Foundation.

675
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,682
Do you remember him?

676
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,735
Hello, Lee Jeong-hwan speaking.

677
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,196
A few days ago, our JBC newsroom

678
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,948
received a call.

679
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:05,203
And the caller was an unidentified male.

680
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:10,792
He claimed that he was Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

681
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,753
How is this possible?

682
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,465
I clearly saw him meeting
with President Choi.

683
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,718
I'm positive it was Judge Kwon Hyuk-jang.

684
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,179
I even remember the date.

685
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,559
Adios, Kwon Hyuk-jang.

686
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,189
It really is you.

687
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,109
It's been a long time.

688
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,279
Who is she?

689
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,782
Don't worry. She's my wife.

690
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,996
Say hi, Joo-eun.
This is Mr. Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

691
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,210
Director Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

692
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,755
Pastor Cha Hyun-tae is my father.

693
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,591
How is he alive?

694
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:50,475
YEAR 2012

695
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:04,906
SUICIDE NOTE

696
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,966
We burned a John Doe's corpse.

697
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,303
I should've been careful
not to hurt my lips.

698
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,890
-You're a GK shadow?
-You've been exposed.

699
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,766
I like the sound of that.

700
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:01,230
Are you doing this
to make Kim Jae-wook jealous?

701
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,567
You're only ruining yourself.

702
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,277
You're no different.

703
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,197
Don't get the wrong idea.
Remove all traces.

704
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,366
What happened? What about Jeong-hwan?

705
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:17,538
I'll be there in 30 minutes.
Don't lay a finger on him until then.

706
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:23,794
