1
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,886
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,810
Why do people need privacy?

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,354
To enjoy their freedom
without having to wear

5
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,899
a mask in front of other people?

6
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,652
Or is it to wear a different mask?

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,531
With or without a mask,
people need privacy because…

8
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,659
…they want to be a tiny bit happier?

9
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,788
As time passes by, understanding others

10
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,833
and making others understand you
is getting harder in this world.

11
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,544
So people make friends
without involving any emotion.

12
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,506
That is why people chose
a tertiary mode of life

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,676
over the public and private lives
in order to be happier.

14
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:39,849
Through this new way of networking,
we willingly share…

15
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:44,646
…our private information
for the sake of convenience and happiness.

16
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,024
Just like this guy.

17
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:57,534
Mr. Jeong, what are you doing?
Make it quick. The president is leaving.

18
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,341
No. You don't have to.

19
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,599
President Choi's personal driver,
Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

20
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,228
DRIVER, JEONG HYEON-CHEOL
FORMERLY JEONG HYEON-GU

21
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,731
Why did he have to die?

22
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:34,154
Who wanted him dead? And why?

23
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:40,368
In the end, people started to die
because of their private lives.

24
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,455
Because they rigged their private lives.
Because their lives were fabricated.

25
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,875
I'll get to that later.

26
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,877
What matters now is…

27
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,549
What do you think Jeong Bok-gi's plan is?

28
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,843
Why meet Yoo Byung-jun?

29
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,158
It's me.

30
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,412
I want you to fire all of the cleaners
for the section, C-7, immediately.

31
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,433
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Kim Jae-wook.

32
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,353
Do you not have a business card?

33
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,192
I'm having a lot of meetings lately.

34
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,070
I might not be able to remember you.

35
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,574
That's all right with me.

36
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,452
All right, then.

37
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,462
Come on up.

38
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,775
GK TECHNOLOGY, KIM JAE-WOOK

39
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,861
I see. You work for GK.

40
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,574
"La Nature"?

41
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,368
La Natura.

42
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,997
But that was for yesterday.

43
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,082
Starting now, my position is…

44
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,043
You want to join my election campaign

45
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,504
and assist me?

46
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,716
I would like to help you by your side.

47
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,218
So that is your condition?

48
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,262
According to the election law,

49
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,348
foreigners can't join election campaigns.

50
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,893
My name must have given you
the wrong idea.

51
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,856
I've been naturalized
with my original name.

52
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,151
Let me introduce myself properly.

53
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,238
I'm in charge of Assemblyman Yoo's
Social Media PR Team Two.

54
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,198
I'm Sophia Chung.

55
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,924
I'll look forward to your help.

56
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,595
I should be the one asking for help.

57
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,513
I heard, with GK's intelligence,

58
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,434
I could find out the number of
food items stored in my neighbor's fridge.

59
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,021
I hope you'll share your intel.

60
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,647
You're walking a fine line.

61
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,900
That might be considered
an invasion of privacy.

62
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,860
My gosh. I'm sorry.

63
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,196
I didn't know you were worried about that.

64
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,739
My apologies.

65
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,325
I'm not a fan of apologies,
but I'll take it.

66
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,952
I was getting hot in here.

67
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,456
Thanks to your dad joke,
I just got the chills.

68
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,002
I am looking forward to your teamwork.

69
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,341
People might think you've known each other

70
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,551
for a long time.

71
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,777
Can you get into Gentleman's Club again?

72
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,321
The security system was updated.
It's a high-end hotel.

73
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,866
You have to do what you did before
for me to get in. Can you do it?

74
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,202
What are you doing? Who are you?

75
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,287
You're so inflexible.

76
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,082
-Then bring a warrant.
-Wait! Hold on!

77
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,668
-Hold on! Gosh.
-Get out.

78
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:07,343
Why don't we ask for
Assemblyman Kwon's help?

79
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:12,181
Then he'll ask why and we'll have to
tell him about Jeong Bok-gi.

80
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,278
I want you to look into subcontractors
hired by One Hotel.

81
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,989
-Subcontractors?
-We don't have time. Hurry.

82
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,912
They're hiring golfers,

83
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,039
but there is an NDA clause
in the contract.

84
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,000
Isn't that ridiculous?

85
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,294
That's for Gentleman's Club, then.

86
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,046
Find someone that I might
be able to get close to.

87
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,893
YUNI
#INFLUENCER #MODEL #WORKOUT #PILATES

88
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,919
Hello,
I'm the manager of the club, Ji Min-hui.

89
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,047
Our VIP clients like to have close games.

90
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,466
They prefer to win by a close call.

91
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,843
At times, they love to coach you

92
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,472
for making small, innocent mistakes.

93
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,974
Golf is a sport of manners.

94
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,228
I am sure you all know what that means.

95
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,312
-Yes.
-Yes.

96
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,397
And this doesn't happen often,

97
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,983
but sometimes,

98
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,864
some unwelcome guests brazenly
sneak in here as if they have been invited

99
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,536
even when they are always caught

100
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,496
by our club in the end.

101
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,041
Since they flout the law
and sneak in here,

102
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,420
we return the favor and take measures
above the law just like they did.

103
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,385
It will be very painful.

104
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,186
Ms. Lee.

105
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,731
What a shame.

106
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,234
I've been enjoying your TV shows.

107
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,615
Let go! Let go of me, you bastards.

108
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,075
Let go!

109
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,287
Let go of me. Let me go, you bastards!

110
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,837
Room Eight in Section D is occupied.
Attention. Enter in three minutes.

111
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,350
I'm ready.

112
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,979
She's probably not in a fitness, leisure,
entertainment, or a banquet room.

113
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,648
She's probably in a tearoom
or a dining room.

114
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:07,958
Damn it.

115
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,920
What are you doing, Mr. Kim?

116
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,254
Where are your manners?

117
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,263
Yoon-kyung.

118
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,769
What?

119
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,232
Mr. Kim Jae-wook from GK.

120
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,359
What the hell

121
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,611
are you doing here?

122
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,739
What does it look like I'm doing here?

123
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,868
Right now,

124
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,747
I'm taking my revenge on you.

125
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,460
What? Isn't this what it looks like?

126
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,847
If that's the impression you got,
this was a successful introduction.

127
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,350
What?

128
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,480
Are you scared?

129
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,192
You have GK's intelligence

130
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,737
and President Choi's ledger.
You have everything.

131
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,531
Why would you be?

132
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,120
You have changed a lot

133
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,039
since I last saw you.

134
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,168
Revenge?

135
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,381
Are you trying to show me
that revenge makes people mature?

136
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,052
But here's a thing. The word "revenge"

137
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,848
is reserved for people
who have been wronged.

138
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,311
So tell me, Ms. Jeong Yoon-kyung.

139
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,772
What did I do that was so wrong?

140
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,985
Be honest with me.

141
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,740
I'm the one who saved your life.

142
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,701
In conclusion,

143
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,706
you can't call this a revenge.

144
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,961
So stop victimizing yourself

145
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,838
and walk away while you still can.

146
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,718
Go back and help your friend from
the detective agency like a commoner.

147
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,723
Today will be the last day
I'm nice enough to use words.

148
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,894
I am sure you understand
what I mean by that.

149
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,148
Do you honestly believe

150
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,736
you have not done me any wrong?

151
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,407
If you say no,

152
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,870
I will only pay you back
for what you have done to me.

153
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,081
If you say yes,

154
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,961
I might end up killing you.

155
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,982
Can't you tell that I am trying very hard
to control myself for old times' sake?

156
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,862
You should quit here and now,

157
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,534
so that I won't have to
save your life a second time.

158
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,291
Son of a bitch.

159
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,182
Food is ready. Where have you been?

160
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,101
I went to the restroom.

161
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,394
There's one here.

162
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,337
Joo-eun?

163
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,924
-Yes, Jeong-hwan.
-What happened?

164
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,884
Jeong Bok-gi

165
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,304
met Kim Jae-wook.

166
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,183
What were you talking about?

167
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:20,020
I hope I didn't commit a grave crime
of interrupting an important conversation.

168
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,355
No.

169
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,025
I was just about to bring that thing up.

170
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,404
I'm all ears, sir.

171
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,197
Well, it's about

172
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,326
President Choi Kyung-hwan's secret ledger.

173
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,372
I need to undermine Assemblyman Kwon.

174
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,543
I think I will be able to do that
if I get my hands on that ledger.

175
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,048
I'm sure GK has

176
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,467
President Choi's secret ledger now. Right?

177
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,223
I would like to take a look at it.

178
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,325
What are you doing here?

179
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,289
Oh, no. I got lost.

180
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,835
This place is so complicated.
It's like a maze.

181
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,754
Come with me.

182
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,174
I'll help you find your way.

183
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,991
That outfit suits you well.

184
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,287
You should've told me, Cha Joo-eun.

185
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,292
Take out what's in your ear gently,
and give it to me.

186
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,629
Joo-eun!

187
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,674
Damn it.

188
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,497
-Jeong-hwan.
-Joo-eun.

189
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,416
Are you okay?

190
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,877
I'm okay.

191
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,546
I'm fine,

192
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,507
but what's going on?

193
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,724
President Choi's secret ledger?

194
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,684
I'd like to see it too.

195
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,647
I don't know where you heard that rumor,

196
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,025
but it's fake news.

197
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,945
GK has it?

198
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,740
I've never heard that.

199
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,203
I won't ask you where you got

200
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,663
the malicious false rumor.

201
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:11,251
Instead, I'll trust that you'll take
the appropriate action yourself.

202
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,591
It's an important time.

203
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,435
It's bad for you to keep such fake sources

204
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,313
around you.

205
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,859
It'll steer the primary race
towards the wrong direction.

206
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,530
It was me.

207
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,286
I was the one
who delivered that fake news.

208
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,628
Because someone informed me
of the secret ledger.

209
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,672
Someone who claims

210
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:02,094
to have been close
to President Choi Kyung-hwan in the past.

211
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,267
I can't tell you everything I heard,

212
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,104
but the information seemed very real.

213
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,815
I trust my source, of course.

214
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,900
Which means

215
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,946
that one of them is lying.

216
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,700
Either the informant

217
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,368
or…

218
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,540
Mr. Kim Jae-wook.

219
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,546
Good. I like that both of you are
enthusiastic. It's excellent.

220
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,049
So the conclusion
of our conversation today

221
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,386
is clear.

222
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,472
You two will make sure

223
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,852
that I'll get my hands
on President Choi's secret ledger

224
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,687
as soon as possible.

225
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,608
Isn't that right?

226
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,865
Am I dreaming in vain?

227
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,080
No. I'll find the ledger.

228
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,874
Good.

229
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,670
Then let's toast for our victory.

230
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,859
Long time no see, Spy Lee.

231
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,611
You're really alive.

232
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,113
It's good to see you, Ms. Cha.

233
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,868
Ms. Cha Joo-eun?

234
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,914
Let's not see each other again.

235
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,123
Please sit down.

236
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,138
Aren't you going to work?

237
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,360
My dad sent his regards to you,

238
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,779
Team Manager Lee Jeong-hwan.

239
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,375
GK's big shot.

240
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,503
He's the one who survived

241
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,464
the war of the princes.
He's the hero of the victory.

242
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,633
Director Oh Yeong-ju.

243
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,888
I never thought
Spy Lee was one of the GK shadows.

244
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,974
Come to think of it,

245
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,435
did you approach me
with an ulterior motive?

246
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,939
How is Mr. Oh?

247
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,359
I should've visited him to say hello.

248
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,946
Please tell him that I'm sorry.

249
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,451
I'll be leaving now.

250
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,928
Why are you hesitating?

251
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,933
You chose Yoo Byung-jun,
but you won't give him everything?

252
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,979
What does that mean?

253
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,482
I know you won't answer me,

254
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,526
so I'll find out myself.

255
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,625
Get me some cigarettes.

256
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,879
What's this?

257
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,174
I guess Sophia Chung dropped it.

258
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,426
Would you like me to throw it out?

259
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,345
Give it to me, sir.

260
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,683
La Natura.

261
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,653
Sophia Chung?

262
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,698
I'll give it to her, sir.

263
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,658
No.

264
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,663
-Drive.
-Yes, sir.

265
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,342
Since you came with us,
you should leave with us.

266
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,804
Please get in. We'll give you a ride home.

267
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,017
Thank you for the offer,
but my chauffeur is here.

268
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,977
See you next time.

269
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,745
Did you have dinner?

270
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,289
I ate with my friends.

271
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,292
-At a convenience store?
-Yes.

272
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,088
Let's go home and have proper dinner.

273
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,717
And stop listening to those boy bands.

274
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,845
You should listen to classical music.

275
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,640
That'll help you play better quickly.

276
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,385
What's wrong?

277
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,887
Drive.

278
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,141
Okay.

279
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,478
To where?

280
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,238
Why do you think
I took your case, Ms. Cha?

281
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,031
Money?

282
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,618
Sophia Chung. Nickname Jeong Bok-gi.

283
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,872
Because I've gotten really curious
about her.

284
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,293
I believe you know a lot
about Sophia Chung.

285
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,962
Don't you know her better than I do?

286
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,381
Don't you go way back?

287
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:26,431
As expected, Sophia and you
seem to have become quite close.

288
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,226
Hey, Ms. Lawyer.

289
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,729
I don't know you very well.

290
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:38,109
So tell me about you first,

291
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,195
kindly.

292
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,489
So you want a detailed explanation?

293
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,824
You can

294
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,788
hear it from your dearest.

295
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,624
What I want to know is,

296
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,043
if Jeong Bok-gi didn't know

297
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,629
who I am like you didn't.

298
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,717
I mean, who my dad is.

299
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,181
A commoner?

300
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,976
Bullshit.

301
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,858
So I'm curious about her.

302
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,568
I want to know what she's planning.

303
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,113
It looks like you have no idea.

304
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,493
If that's what you think,
feel free to do so.

305
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,623
You should learn to talk politely.

306
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,460
I think we're going to
end up on the same boat.

307
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:44,467
Because my dad and I chose Kwon Hyuk-jang.

308
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,098
Mr. Kwon already told me about
what you two have been up to,

309
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,432
so don't be too surprised.

310
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,477
So you and I

311
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,564
may not have the time to gossip,

312
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,733
but we need to prepare ourselves
for what's up ahead.

313
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,485
Don't you agree, Spy Lee?

314
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,113
I mean, Team Manager Lee Jeong-hwan.

315
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,659
All right. But let me ask you one thing.

316
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,371
Is Director Oh on his own?

317
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,583
You don't want to go all-in
because you don't want to lose it all.

318
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,627
I want to see the hand
that I'm betting on.

319
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,339
Right. That must be
why you kept in touch with me

320
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,259
while working for Mr. Kim Sang-man
and weighing us.

321
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,555
I see how you could misunderstand.

322
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:35,143
I was just working hard as a shadow.

323
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:39,355
Don't you know very well
what the higher-ups are like?

324
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,942
They always take the side of the winners.

325
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,070
Whether it be Kwon Hyuk-jang
or Yoo Byung-jun.

326
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,031
Right.

327
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,741
Fine.

328
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,535
I'll tell you something that'll help you

329
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,662
make your bet.

330
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,877
While Mr. Kwon promised
to restore your identity,

331
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,879
I'll promise you

332
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,798
your reinstatement.

333
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,094
Not as a shadow, but as a white collar.

334
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,642
All right. We're all on the same boat.

335
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,229
Let's begin an honest conversation.

336
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,627
What do you think this is?

337
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,758
I heard Assemblyman Yoo was just here.

338
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,135
You already know who he met.

339
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,805
That's why you sneaked in, isn't it?

340
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,600
This is their conversation
that you wanted to hear.

341
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,732
Would you open up to me now?

342
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,070
Or would you like to just leave?

343
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,489
I'll hear it.

344
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,464
I gave it to them.

345
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,719
Stop putting me up to difficult tasks.

346
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,140
I don't want to get involved in
something complicated and ruin my life.

347
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,434
There's ginseng in the back.

348
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,312
Give it to your mother.

349
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,175
Because someone informed me
of the secret ledger.

350
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:16,596
You two will make sure that I'll get my
hands on President Choi's secret ledger.

351
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,640
They're funny.

352
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,104
It's clear that who's on your side,
isn't it?

353
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,608
All right. I'll tell you.

354
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,737
Sophia Chung's real name
is Jeong Yoon-kyung.

355
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,198
Jeong Yoon-kyung.

356
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,878
Since when?

357
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,756
When did you start working
with Oh Hyun-kyung?

358
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,258
Why do you ask?

359
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,636
I just want to know.

360
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,765
It's been about three to four years.

361
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,811
Then you were working

362
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,647
with her when I was on trial,

363
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,859
I, the independent panel, will rule
for the case number, 2018978.

364
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,863
I sentence the defendant to 18 months
in jail and 100 million won fine.

365
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,287
I know, Jeong-hwan.

366
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,416
I know you have
nothing to do with it, but--

367
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,379
A detective agency's biggest clients
are large law firms.

368
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,340
They need to collect evidence quietly.

369
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,967
Are you saying it's a coincidence?

370
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,469
Or…

371
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,973
did you plan it like Oh Hyun-kyung said?

372
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:43,850
Yes.

373
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,435
It was all planned.

374
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,479
Joo-eun.

375
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,568
You'll never understand what GK shadows do

376
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,319
or have to bear.

377
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,238
Why did you save Jeong Bok-gi?

378
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,827
Things went wrong
from the moment you saved her.

379
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,459
I really don't get you.

380
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,323
KIM MYUNG-HYUN

381
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,084
President Choi's ledger.

382
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,836
I'll show it to you.

383
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:43,302
However, I'll only show you
Assemblyman Kwon's record.

384
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,472
If you see the other records,

385
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,224
you'll be ousted

386
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,519
from politics in Korea.

387
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,356
Do you understand?

388
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,235
There's something you also need
to understand.

389
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,697
I'm the future of this country.

390
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,910
You, along with GK, are investing
in the future.

391
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:13,457
Wrap your head around that
and never forget it.

392
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,066
Come here.

393
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,568
Yes, sir.

394
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,782
Isn't tomorrow
Mr. Woo's death anniversary?

395
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,950
Pardon?

396
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,910
Yes, it is.

397
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,831
What? You forgot
your own father's death anniversary?

398
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,461
No, sir. I've been looking forward
to the day for several days now.

399
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,214
You've been looking forward
to a death anniversary?

400
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,969
Well, what I meant was…

401
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,640
I'm fully prepared to make sure
everything goes smoothly.

402
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,063
Put this on his table.

403
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,482
He used to enjoy them.

404
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,649
Thank you, sir.

405
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,196
-No kids yet?
-Pardon?

406
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,031
Any good news?

407
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,407
No, sir.

408
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,118
She doesn't want to have any just yet.

409
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,829
How about you?

410
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,794
I'm sure everyone is different,

411
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,962
but you should have one.

412
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,091
It may change the way you view the world.

413
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,052
Yes, sir.

414
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:55,184
When it comes to women,
you need to open their hearts first.

415
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,312
Yes, sir.

416
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,234
-Think about it on your way out.
-Yes, sir.

417
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,793
What is it?

418
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,461
Do you want a drink?

419
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,505
I have a meeting.

420
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,718
I see.
Neo Hotel's been recently remodeled.

421
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,763
Do you want to enjoy a spa?

422
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,852
Did Mr. Kim tell you
to get something from me?

423
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,228
No.

424
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,105
Don't be absurd.

425
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,234
He just

426
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,947
advised that we try for a baby.

427
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,660
Look here, Mr. Woo Seok-ho.

428
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,040
Who will it be?
Kim Sang-man or your father-in-law?

429
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,251
Think wisely.

430
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,171
We may not love each other,
but we should protect our families.

431
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,549
Because that's the very reason
we got married to begin with.

432
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,844
Wait.

433
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,935
We were quite close when we were young,

434
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,022
Hyun-kyung.

435
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,736
You're really ridiculous.

436
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:43,626
PORK RIBS APLENTY

437
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,929
-Hello.
-Hello.

438
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,306
How many people?

439
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,683
I have someone waiting for me.

440
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,435
I see.

441
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,241
Would you like to order more meat?

442
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,117
Do you have pork rinds?

443
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,244
How many servings?

444
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,413
Two, please.

445
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,790
Yes, sir.

446
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,418
Have a drink.

447
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,554
Why did you come here?

448
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,806
To have meat.

449
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,186
Come on. What's wrong with this place?

450
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,438
Aren't you embarrassed as a father?

451
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,190
Joo-eun comes here all the time.

452
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,025
Gosh.

453
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,194
-Goodness.
-Ma'am.

454
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,737
Can I drink today?

455
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,032
And some meat too?

456
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,868
-Sure.
-Thank you.

457
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,787
This too. Thank you.

458
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,675
Fine. How long will you keep this up?

459
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,722
Rack your brain, will you?

460
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,308
All right, I get it.

461
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,310
I have a plan,

462
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,229
so stop ordering me around.

463
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,148
I never ordered you around.

464
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,983
You do it all the time.

465
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,110
"Do this, do that."

466
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,529
I was giving you advice, not orders.

467
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,866
Anyway…

468
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,244
You should ask your wife to fly back in.

469
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,580
Why? Do I look pitiful?

470
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,497
Yes.

471
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,712
My eldest kid got a scholarship
to Stanford.

472
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,380
Congratulations.

473
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,050
After graduating, my kid will get a job,

474
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,426
get married there,

475
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,054
and have a great life.

476
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,726
This is on the house!

477
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,721
-What's going on?
-What do you mean?

478
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,889
What about Jeong-hwan?

479
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,267
What about him?

480
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,477
Where is he?

481
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,561
Why do you ask?

482
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,148
I don't care.

483
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,695
Did you two fight?

484
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,447
Don't be ridiculous.

485
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,282
We're not kids.

486
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,118
Okay, so you fought.

487
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,370
We didn't.

488
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,337
About him…

489
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,339
What is it this time?

490
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,299
Jeong Hyeon-cheol.

491
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,176
Who?

492
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,012
President Choi's driver.

493
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,223
What about him?

494
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,892
Lee Jeong-hwan knew all along.

495
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,312
What do you mean?

496
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,314
But more importantly,

497
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,527
He was the director of
All Together Church's Haneul Foundation.

498
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,404
Could you step on it, sir?

499
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,697
Okay.

500
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:47,244
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

501
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,129
His information is
in Jeong-hwan's computer

502
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,881
back at the agency.

503
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,601
REPORT ON PERSONNEL
JEONG HYEON-CHEOL

504
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,521
Jeong Hyeon-cheol, the director
of Haneul Foundation,

505
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,607
was President Choi's driver?

506
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,115
"Jeong Hyeon-cheol 24 Hours"?

507
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,451
What is this?

508
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,872
Was Jeong-hwan spying on him?

509
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,213
"Anesthesia"?

510
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,798
MESSAGE SENT TO NOTIFY OTHERS OF ABSENCE
WHILE ANESTHETIZED

511
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,259
A "will"?

512
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,428
MADE HIM WRITE HIS WILL
WHILE SEMI-CONSCIOUS

513
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,474
Why did Jeong-hwan…

514
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,692
CASE SUMMARY
JEONG HYEON-CHEOL SELF-IMMOLATION CASE

515
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,283
HANEUL FOUNDATION'S BOARD MEMBERS

516
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,576
THE BODY FOUND AT THE SCENE

517
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,078
He must've been very upset.

518
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,664
How could he set himself on fire?

519
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,083
That's horrific.

520
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,609
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

521
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,736
Where are you going?

522
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,947
I thought we were both in on this.

523
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,285
What will you tell the chief?

524
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,121
Stop here.

525
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,248
Don't put yourself in a tough spot.

526
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,226
CHIEF JEONG DAE-SANG

527
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,354
Kim Myung-hyun.

528
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,523
What did he get up to today?

529
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,239
-I…
-What?

530
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,700
I'm being ostracized.

531
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,120
I can't do this anymore.

532
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,330
I'm sorry, sir.

533
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,387
Why did you tell me to dig up
a suicide case that's been closed?

534
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,933
Jeong Hyeon-cheol may be dead,
but the case hasn't been resolved.

535
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,105
That case needs to come to light
once again.

536
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:41,937
So?

537
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,314
I have to do it because I'm a cop?

538
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,734
If I do it, they'll claim
that it's a conspiracy and a fake news.

539
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,866
You should make this public. Please.

540
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,369
That's all I need.

541
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,414
Goodbye, then.

542
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,792
At least give me something to work with.

543
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,629
President Choi's driver changed
his testimony during the second trial.

544
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,966
Two years later,
he established a foundation

545
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,302
and became the director of a megachurch.

546
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,566
That much is already in the file.

547
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,243
Jeong Hyeon-cheol

548
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,036
isn't dead, is he?

549
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,583
You were the ones

550
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,502
who investigated that case.

551
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,972
That's why you handed over
the bugging device?

552
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,600
She must be confused.

553
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,227
She won't be sure
if we have the ledger or not

554
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,521
and if she should trust Jeong-hwan.

555
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,442
Also, she won't be able to trust

556
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,736
Jeong Yoon-kyung as well.

557
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,323
So, we're going to play dirty
to get what we want.

558
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,910
And our target is Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

559
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:23,830
That's right.

560
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,320
WOOK'S GUKBAP

561
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,907
Care for a drink?

562
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,837
I've always been curious…

563
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,093
about your past, Edward.

564
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:53,271
It took me a decade
to walk through that door.

565
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,447
It's all here.

566
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,868
Kim Jae-wook's past, I mean.

567
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,876
Never in my wildest dreams
did I imagine this.

568
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,630
I did tell you.

569
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,471
I even made you rice soup.

570
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,393
Why does it smell like
the countryside in here?

571
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,144
Aren't you hungry?

572
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,857
Today, we'll be having
a special Korean dish.

573
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,484
Dried radish greens and rice soup.

574
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,071
Where did you learn to make this?

575
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:46,116
My father taught me. My parents
used to run a rice soup restaurant.

576
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,285
I'm afraid I can't fall for your lies
anymore. You make it so obvious.

577
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,013
This must be

578
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,727
where Yoo Byung-jun met
with President Choi.

579
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,776
Did you really think there's
only one copy of President Choi's ledger?

580
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,990
Yoo Byung-jun met President Choi

581
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:30,201
three times here.

582
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,622
At Wook's Gukbap

583
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,374
with a bag of money.

584
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:41,504
And your father was a witness to it all.

585
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,090
He even remembered the exact dates.

586
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,053
As if he was boasting
about his incredible memory,

587
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,431
he testified against them for the police.
And in return,

588
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,894
all the police officers who lied
about protecting him

589
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,896
quit their jobs.

590
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,734
In order to leave their son
some insurance money at the least,

591
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,364
him and his wife
stabbed each other to death.

592
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,333
But why?

593
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,545
Why Yoo Byung-jun?

594
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,923
Why did you choose him?

595
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,807
What are you really up to?

596
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,601
What now?

597
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,814
Are you wondering if I'm plotting
my revenge?

598
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,650
If I get revenge,

599
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,486
what do I get in return?

600
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,863
There's nothing for me to gain.

601
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,625
My parents died…

602
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,216
because they chose to die.

603
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,136
It was stupid and wrong.

604
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,930
And I…

605
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,226
chose this path for myself.

606
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,564
What did I see in you…

607
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,655
all this time?

608
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,167
Let me give you one last warning.

609
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,465
Don't let anyone see…

610
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,135
your true face.

611
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,571
-Yoon-kyung--
-Don't.

612
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,409
I've matured too much…

613
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,919
to trust you.

614
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:59,869
SPY DETECTIVE AGENCY

615
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,416
Who are you?

616
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,876
What are you doing here?

617
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,772
Joo-eun?

618
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,442
Joo-eun, are you all right?

619
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,943
Joo-eun.

620
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,146
How did it go?

621
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,481
I got it.

622
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,565
Good work.

623
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,575
Joo-eun!

624
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:45,993
Joo-eun.

625
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,705
Joo-eun.

626
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:49,706
Joo-eun.

627
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,040
Joo-eun?

628
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:52,834
Jeong-hwan.

629
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,794
Joo-eun.

630
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,046
What happened?

631
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,882
Tell me the truth.

632
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,343
About what?

633
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,721
Did you kill him?

634
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,599
Did you kill Jeong Hyeon-cheol?

635
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,386
-Joo-eun.
-I believe you.

636
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,221
I'm scared.

637
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,099
-I don't know if I can do this.
-You do know

638
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,519
that Joo-eun was for real, right?

639
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,021
There was a tip-off

640
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,483
that someone had been laundering money
through the Haneul Foundation.

641
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:02,987
How can we keep working together
when you have so many secrets?

642
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,615
He's finally going to use the ledger.

643
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,283
I wanted to be successful.

644
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:10,244
I'm sorry, Joo-eun.

645
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:15,750
There was no way for me
to find success within GK.

646
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:20,838
