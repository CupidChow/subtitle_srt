1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,802
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS, AND RELIGIONS

2
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,971
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,976
People.

4
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,522
People live their own private lives.

5
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,774
And

6
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,069
in the Constitution,
there's something called Privacy Law.

7
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,989
So everyone has
the right to privacy by law.

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,743
However, is it really protected?

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,872
We live in a world
where we feel like losers

10
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,999
if we don't share our private lives.

11
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,170
So we share
our private lives with one another.

12
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,506
And sometimes, we steal them.

13
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,551
Or at times, for our personal interest,

14
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,513
we collect, analyze,
and use other people's private lives.

15
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:42,185
Right now, Korea is facing
the era of shared privacy

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,062
while we are engaged in a war of privacy.

17
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,732
And I

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,778
fabricate my private life,

19
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,200
so I can be happy like I am now.

20
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,509
EPISODE 1

21
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,348
How do you like it here?

22
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,392
SPRING, 2010

23
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,309
It's nice.

24
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,396
Doesn't this remind you
of our trip to Europe?

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,942
The steak we had there
was really delicious.

26
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,611
-Do you want some wine?
-Sounds great.

27
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,780
Excuse me.

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,493
We'd like to order some wine.
Can you make a recommendation?

29
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,578
I'll bring the menu.

30
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,038
Soju is the way to go with meat.

31
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,374
You're still young.
Give a couple more years.

32
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,296
I only drank soju
when I was your age, too.

33
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,173
You're treating me like a kid again.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,098
He finished the whole bottle.

35
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,810
-He'll call a chauffeur.
-There are a lot of motels around here.

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,898
-That'd be a waste of money.
-And how do you know that?

37
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,443
Forget it. We'll have to take
a rain check on the wine.

38
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,904
How sad.

39
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,239
I'll keep eating here.

40
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,039
Go do your job.

41
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,464
Joo-eun! Oh, no. Joo-eun!

42
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,216
Joo-eun, what happened?

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,051
-Joo-eun.
-Joo-eun.

44
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,135
-No way.
-My daughter.

45
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,970
-Is she dead?
-Joo-eun.

46
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,889
Joo-eun.

47
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,102
What kind of a driver are you?

48
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,063
Let go of me. And we'll talk.

49
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,483
-Hold on. Did you drink?
-Joo-eun, wake up.

50
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,318
Gosh. Damn it.

51
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,154
Joo-eun.

52
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,491
What are you going to do?

53
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,163
Gosh. I can't believe you pushed me.

54
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,123
You're a part of the family.

55
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,501
We spent a lot of money to raise you.

56
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,045
How much longer
will you freeload off of us?

57
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,632
I could have jumped in myself.
You didn't have to push me.

58
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,841
That's attempted murder.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,513
You're acting as if you were hit
by a truck on a highway.

60
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,807
Besides, you didn't spend
any money to raise me.

61
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,726
I don't go to prep schools
or even have tutors.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,896
How could you say that to your daughter
who studies all on her own?

63
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,274
You mean you gave up studying on your own.

64
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,192
You just lounge around at home.

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,528
What about the money
for your clothes and allowance?

66
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,613
Where did that money come from?

67
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,781
Aren't I entitled to that?

68
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,535
It's a price you must pay
for bringing me into your happy marriage.

69
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,371
And I was conceived
when you two were drinking and having fun.

70
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,331
You only married him because of me.

71
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,127
You should at least fulfill your duties
as a mother until I come of age.

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,754
How can you be so irresponsible
and call yourself a mother?

73
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,924
You got your ID card. You're an adult now.

74
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,468
That doesn't make me an adult.
I can't get in a bar yet.

75
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,054
-But you do.
-Legally speaking.

76
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,433
You ignore the law, get into bars
with a fake college ID for drinks.

77
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,770
That proves
that you're a full-grown adult, okay?

78
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,606
-Come on.
-Just eat.

79
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,997
I have a very casual relationship
with my daughter.

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,791
We're like good friends.

81
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,004
Just like in Northern Europe.

82
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,968
Dad.

83
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,888
Your daughter is injured.
Very severely injured.

84
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,475
I'm sorry, my daughter.
I'm just in a good mood.

85
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,814
How much did you get?

86
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,191
-Joo-eun.
-Yes?

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,819
It's a trade secret.

88
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,945
Come on!

89
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,657
Whatever. I don't want anything else.
I want to buy a smartphone.

90
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,825
What?

91
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,620
You mean the phone
that costs like a million won?

92
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,039
No way.

93
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,084
Isn't that too much for a student
to carry such a phone?

94
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,044
You said I'm an adult now.

95
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,755
Exactly. You should buy it
with the money you earned.

96
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,256
You con artists!

97
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,468
I had the lead role.
Don't turn me into an extra now.

98
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,053
Are you conning your daughter, too?

99
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,388
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,556
Dad is the lead
and I'm the supporting role.

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,433
You're not an extra.
You're the stuntwoman.

102
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,063
Besides, we're not scamming people.
We're filming a documentary.

103
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,232
A documentary to redistribute the wealth.

104
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,275
We're filming a documentary, okay?

105
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,444
-Stop the car!
-Don't.

106
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
Come on! Stop the car now!

107
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,120
Joo-eun.

108
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,206
Let go of me. I'm reporting you two.
No, I'll turn myself in.

109
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,083
Fine. I'll buy you a smartphone.

110
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,751
Too late now.

111
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,547
Okay. I'll throw in a new jacket.

112
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:08,886
Your're lucky.

113
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,681
I'm too nice for my own good.

114
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,730
I'm so proud of you.

115
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,400
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

116
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,822
-Ta-da. Isn't this cool?
-What is it?

117
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,158
-What's that?
-Doesn't this look so pretty?

118
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,242
That's so cool.

119
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,371
Look at this. I can browse
the internet if I touch the screen.

120
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,042
On top of that, this phone takes
awesome photos. It's amazing.

121
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,043
Look over here.

122
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,254
One, two, three.

123
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,798
Look.

124
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,595
Let's take another one.
There's a beggar in the photo.

125
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:02,440
Because Jesus will lead me

126
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,446
Thank the Lord

127
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,409
For Jesus is with me

128
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,788
Through the hardships of life
I'm always happy--

129
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:23,836
Because Jesus will lead me

130
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,799
Thank the Lord
Jesus Christ

131
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,095
What…

132
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:42,522
Thank the Lord
Jesus Christ

133
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:48,569
For Jesus is with me

134
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,520
Joo-eun.

135
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,021
What's your real job?

136
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,192
Are you a beggar?

137
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,319
Of course not.

138
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,279
Then, what is it?

139
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,659
This is just temporary.
It's like a part-time job.

140
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,327
Then, what is your day job?

141
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,501
-I perform confidence tricks.
-Are you in the circus, too?

142
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
No, I con people.

143
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,466
If you don't want to admit it,
at least keep it consistent.

144
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,552
A documentary actor or a trickster?

145
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,345
Let's go with a documentary actor.

146
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,434
I want you to stick to your day job.

147
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,395
Just stick to conning people.
At least that looks cool.

148
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,355
Don't beg for money on the street.

149
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,400
Right now, I feel…

150
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,615
I feel so crappy right now.

151
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,827
Come home early. Don't drink.

152
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,831
Okay.

153
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,501
This is a part of the documentary, too.
Why won't she understand?

154
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,297
Does she think I enjoy doing this?
I'm doing this for her.

155
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,301
I did everything to raise her well.
Now she's preaching to me?

156
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,094
Gosh, it startled me.

157
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,489
Do you get good grades? You don't.

158
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,033
-Is going to school my day job?
-Is it not?

159
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,035
Dad, I'm still just a student.

160
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,579
Aren't you curious
about what I'll do with my life?

161
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,415
Whatever I become,
I'll be fantastic at it. Don't worry.

162
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,376
I'll have a successful life.

163
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,964
Please do so.

NINE YEARS LATER

167
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,399
Mom!

168
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,026
It must have been so tough for you.

169
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,324
The weather

170
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,869
makes me want to read a book.

171
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,783
I was reading a book,

172
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,035
then I was reminded
of my trip from a year ago.

173
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,913
I want to go on a trip with someone, too.

174
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,172
-You're so pretty.
-The goddess returns.

175
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,382
Are you in Nice? Let me come with you.

176
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,759
I think it's been a year.

177
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,635
It's been a while. I missed you.

OTTU RESTAURANT

179
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,987
Welcome.

180
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,787
What would you like?

181
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,708
Kimchi stew, please.

182
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,045
-Make it spicy and flavorful.
-You must order more than a serving.

183
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,715
I'll pay for two servings,
but just give me one serving.

184
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,101
What's this?

185
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,686
It's on the house.

186
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,064
Why?

187
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,274
-No?
-What do you mean?

188
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,237
People who come here alone
are usually from the slammer.

189
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,661
Well, I guess you could think that.

190
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,497
But I'm not.

191
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,917
-Really?
-I work for a large conglomerate.

192
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,628
You have to eat tofu
if you want to stay out of there.

193
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,174
"Your crimes will wash away,
and you'll have a slate as clean as tofu."

194
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,762
This is what some people think.

195
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,641
But it's actually because the people
who served time are malnourished.

196
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,103
It's for nourishment.
That's why they gave them tofu.

197
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,066
Well, I have nothing to do with that,

198
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,151
but I know this
as I'm quite knowledgeable.

199
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,780
Don't put tofu in the stew, please.

200
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,226
When people meet

201
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,854
They always talk about the same thing

202
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,690
Day after day

203
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,068
I feel so frustrated

204
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,821
When you leave without talking to me

205
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,575
It makes me so sad

206
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,370
-Clap.
-Sit down.

207
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,918
What's my score?

208
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,086
You get 100 points. 100 points.

209
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,005
You should be a singer.

210
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,760
What do you want, Mr. Singer?

211
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,597
Soju and ramyeon with rice cake.

212
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,026
-Let's work.
-What kind of work?

213
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,278
-The usual.
-Let me think about it.

214
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,447
-About what?
-Other stuff.

215
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,491
Don't. You'll only get a headache.

216
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,620
I don't want to talk about jobs.
I just got out.

217
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,752
Have you had kimchi stew
with a ten-million-won ginseng?

218
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,256
It's amazing. You should try it someday.

219
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,763
Are you going to waste time again
for some revenge?

220
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,525

221

HOME KIMCHI STEW RESTAURANT

222
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,248
You have always liked kimchi stew
ever since you were a kid.

223
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,165
How tacky.

224
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,337
-Mom.
-What?

225
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,256
I got in.

226
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,384
What?

227
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,886
I got into a college.

228
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,348
Really?

229
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,645
-Congratulations.
-What was that?

230
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,231
Your daughter got into college.

231
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,276
You didn't sound sincere at all.
Aren't you happy?

232
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,238
Why would I be happy?
I doubt you got into Hankuk University.

233
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,158
Is that the only college in Korea?

234
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,454
No matter what you do,

235
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,498
only the people in the top 1% survive.

236
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,752
You've lived in this country for 20 years,

237
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,378
and you still don't know that?

238
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,172
The rest of them are just fillers.

239
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,884
-Is it a two-year or four-year college?
-Four-year.

240
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,303
A two-year one would've been better.

241
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,557
It'll be another two years
of tuition fees, drinking,

242
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,478
and dating guys.

243
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,480
Come on.

244
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,357
Get a part-time job
and help me out when you can.

245
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,818
If you don't, I'm not paying for college.

246
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,404
Forget it. Are you really my mother?

247
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,032
Did you adopt me to use
as an actor for your documentary?

248
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,242
I'm telling you to do what you're good at.

249
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,036
You were born to do this.

250
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,246
You're a natural.

251
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,706
Goodness.

252
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,751
-Hi, ma'am. Here you are.
-My gosh.

253
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,127
Mr. Kim. Have a seat.

254
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,756
-Who is she?
-Joo-eun, say hello.

255
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,217
This is Mr. Kim Jun-beom.
We work at the same branch.

256
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,718
This is my daughter, Cha Joo-eun.

257
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,804
She has a great mug just like you.

258
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,806
At the same "branch"?

259
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,266
You're unbelievable.

260
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,820
With that mug of hers,
everyone will believe whatever she says.

261
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,573
Goodness. You and your vocabulary.

262
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,409
Why can't you make it sound subtler?

263
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,122
If you can't, just be quiet.

264
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,113
Make it believable.

265
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,116
Make it look rough and lively.

266
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,662
-Well…
-Let's get ready.

267
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,372
-Let's go.
-Okay.

268
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,168
-Poong-yeon.
-Yes?

269
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,171
-Don't make any mistakes.
-Okay.

270
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,009
Well, the thing is…

271
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,971
I'm a Buddhist.

272
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,892
Don't worry about the license.
I already got it.

273
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,853
But how could I pretend to be a pastor?

274
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,689
Until when will you fake injuries
to make a few bucks?

275
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,026
If not the top 1%,

276
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,406
you should try to reach the 10%.

277
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,201
"The 10%"?

278
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,244
Okay.

279
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,437
Hey, mister. Mister!

280
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,231
Hey.

281
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,109
Hey, mister.
Who gave you permission to be here?

282
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,029
-Do you really not have legs?
-Really?

283
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,156
-No, I don't.
-Hey.

284
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,950
-Hey, strip him.
-Wait.

285
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,537
-You're fine.
-You have legs!

286
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,497
-My goodness.
-Hey.

287
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,998
-You have legs.
-Film this.

288
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,169
You have legs! Look! He has legs!

289
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,172
You have legs.

290
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,592
-What's this?
-Damn it.

291
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,010
He's got legs. He's fine.

292
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,387
-I knew it.
-I know, right?

293
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,180
-His legs are just fine.
-Hey, mister.

294
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
-What are you doing?
-He's suspicious.

295
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,819
Pastor.

296
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,867
Are you all right?

297
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,078
Yes.

298
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,707
But what are you doing here?

299
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,628
I was in the neighborhood
to volunteer at the disability center.

300
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,299
But Pastor,

301
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,012
have you been begging
for money without telling us?

302
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,847
Yes.

303
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,017
Is this how you've been helping

304
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,936
the kids and the elderly?

305
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,440
Good luck, pastor.

306
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,235
I had no idea.

307
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,701
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,618
Pastor.

309
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,662
Lord.

310
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,498
So you've found out now.

311
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,170
Can you promise me

312
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,922
that you'll keep this a secret?

313
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,840
Okay.

314
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,801
-Father.
-Father.

315
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,220
-Lord.
-Lord.

316
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,056
Lord.

317
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,121
Joo-eun.

318
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,426
Why are you out here in the cold?

319
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,348
Mom became a banker

320
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,725
and you became a pastor.

321
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,061
Well,

322
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,273
you could say
that your mom and I grew a little.

323
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,317
We've reached a new level.

324
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,070
People in this field seem to recognize us.

325
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,906
-So you've been promoted.
-Something like that.

326
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,411
But aren't we Buddhists?

327
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,328
Yes.

328
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,790
Can't Buddhists believe in Jesus?

329
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,129
You should learn to broaden
your perspective of the world.

330
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,221
-Why aren't you working together?
-What?

331
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,349
Did you fight with Mom?

332
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,226
-No.
-Then?

333
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,688
There's a limit
to running a family business.

334
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,566
Let's say
I want to give a go at different genres.

335
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,737
By the way, how did it go?

336
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,947
How did what go?

337
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,117
Well,

338
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,036
college.

339
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,543
It's okay. You don't even need
to go to college these days.

340
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,504
A lot of people choose
not to go to college.

341
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,008
I got in.

342
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,886
Really? For real?

343
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,387
Hooray!

344
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,183
Congratulations.

345
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,937
Is my daughter going to be
a college student?

346
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,855
Really?

347
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,611
Thank you, God. Thank you, Buddha.

348
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,198
When I was young,

349
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,575
my dream was to date a college student.

350
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,910
I can't believe this.

351
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,122
Let's see. What should I get you?

352
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,166
Is there anything you want?

353
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,668
-Just...
-What is it?

354
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,462
Give me money.

355
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,341
Right. Money is the best.

356
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:15,889
By the way,

357
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,767
what are you trying to do as a pastor?

358
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:20,977
What?

359
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,688
I'm scared

360
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,943
because you're messing with Jesus now.

-Now, that's what I call a pastor.
-He deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.

366
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,590
Fake pastors
who talk nonsense should watch and learn.

367
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,012
Good work.

368
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,681
Thank you.

369
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,226
It's your share of the donations
collected for a rural church.

370
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,894
I see.

371
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,773
We had quite a lot of invitations.

372
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,484
I've carefully selected
our current target.

373
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,989
It has the largest congregation
and the biggest slush fund.

374
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,454
We'll conquer it with faith.
Like the crusaders.

375
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,415
Okay.

376
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,377
Don't worry.

377
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,298
I already worked things out
with the church.

378
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,550
You only need to believe in God

379
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,385
and work hard on your ministry.

380
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,929
Is this a bonus?

381
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,640
It's today's sermon.

382
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,892
Just read it as it is written.

383
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,812
Okay.

PASTOR CHA HYUN-TAE
REVIVAL MEETING

385
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,580
Pastor Cha. Welcome.

386
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,624
-Hello.
-Hello.

387
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,627
I have so much respect for you.
I've heard a lot about you.

388
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,128
Goodness. Thank you.

389
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,796
-It's an honor to meet you.
-Thank you.

390
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,548
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

391
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,799
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

392
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,344
-Let's go.
-This way.

393
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,147
I've waited so long to attend his sermon.

394
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,108
He's looking great, isn't he?

395
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,144
Is he

396
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,480
illiterate?

397
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,858
You said he was a beggar.

398
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,696
What's wrong with him?

399
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,455
I lost my sermon on the way here.

400
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,959
This must be God's will too, right?

401
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,839
Anyway, what I want to say
to you today is very simple.

402
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,884
Do you happen to know
where I had been begging?

403
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,344
-Hongdae.
-Hongdae.

404
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,972
Yes, that's right.
Hongdae, the street of youth.

405
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,975
Why do you think I chose
a place with a lot of young people?

406
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,314
Because that's where I made the most.

407
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,820
Which means
that young people are more generous.

408
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,156
In my experience,

409
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,659
I'm not saying
this applies to everyone here though,

410
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,872
the older people get,
the less generous they become.

411
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,874
As if a heavy duty lock is
on their wallet.

412
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:17,172
So why do people get stingier
as they get older?

413
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,965
Because they don't believe in God?

414
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,010
Yes. That's also true,

415
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,053
but to be more precise,

416
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,307
it's because
they believe in too many things.

417
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,226
Children, real estates,
and retirement funds.

418
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,438
Try to love and trust God

419
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,648
only half as much
as you love these things.

420
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,735
You'll be generous naturally.

421
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,945
You'll be naturally prosperous.

422
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,283
Don't be betrayed
by the children you rely on.

423
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:50,288
Love and trust your God more deeply.

424
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,290
I hope you find the light.

425
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,541
Hallelujah!

426
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,168
-Amen.
-Amen.

427
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,544
Hallelujah!

428
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,256
Amen!

429
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,674
-Amen!
-Hallelujah!

430
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,927
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

431
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,261
-Amen.
-Amen.

432
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,515
-Amen!
-Hallelujah!

433
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,933
Hallelujah!

434
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,520
Amen!

435
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,356
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah.

436
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,067
Oh, Lord. Father.

437
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,444
Hallelujah!

438
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,904
Amen!

439
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,574
-The shepherd who blesses me
-Hallelujah!

440
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,118
-The shepherd who blesses me
-Lord!

441
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,248
-Hallelujah!
-There is a shepherd

442
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,167
Who blesses me

443
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,418
Unbelievable.

444
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,962
I made him.

445
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:44,509
-The shepherd who blesses me
-The shepherd who blesses me

446
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,426
Shall we

447
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,138
test their faith now?

448
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,183
Pastor.

449
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,853
There's a company
that I've been sponsoring secretly.

450
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,606
Well, it's not big enough to be a company.

451
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,650
It's more of a small factory.

452
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,028
The cross that our Lord Jesus Christ
was crucified on.

453
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,322
It's a factory that manufactures crosses.

454
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,244
Dear congregation,
if you help this factory with your faith,

455
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:15,623
it can become a global cross business
that spreads out to the world.

456
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,749
Hallelujah!

457
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,210
-Hallelujah.
-Amen.

458
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,796
Everyone,

459
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,758
shout amen if you trust me.

460
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,468
-Amen!
-Amen!

461
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,306
Say amen if you trust me!

462
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,724
-Amen!
-Amen!

463
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,144
Lord! Bless those who make offerings

464
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,980
100 and 1,000 times more!

465
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,940
-Hallelujah!
-Amen!

466
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,984
Will you trust me?

467
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,235
-Yes!
-Amen!

468
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,322
Hallelujah!

469
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,657
-Amen!
-Amen!

470
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,660
We've exceeded
our goal of ten billion won.

471
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,833
Ten billion won?

472
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,047
We should assure our congregation
that there will be profit.

473
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,425
We may start a Holy Grail business
instead of making crosses.

474
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,762
I heard it's buried somewhere
in the Mediterranean.

475
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,848
-What do you mean?
-Is something wrong?

476
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,851
Well--

477
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,354
You thought
this was a documentary, didn't you?

478
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,941
Isn't it?

479
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,902
You should dream bigger, Pastor Cha.

480
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,905
I have…

481
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,243
begun to paint a new picture.

482
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,761
What's that?

483
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,937
It's the new church.

484
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,233
It'll be the biggest church in Gangnam.

485
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:08,987
Really?

486
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,866
It'll be the biggest church in Gangnam.

487
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,953
You're going to build this?

488
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:21,958
I would like you
to be the pastor of the new church.

489
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,420
Me?

490
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,174
I'm sure you'll do fine.

491
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,765
Well,

492
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,395
I want to invest in it, too.

493
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:47,734
I'm really going to do my best this time.

494
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,529
You don't have to make an investment.

495
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,449
Investment profits and donations
from the congregation are enough.

496
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,950
No.

497
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,828
As the pastor of the new church, I should.

498
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,207
All right. If that's what makes you happy.

499
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,543
You do that.

500
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:06,878
Thank you.

501
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,426
Actually, there's something
I've been dreaming of for a long time.

502
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,511
Since the church planting days,

503
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,847
I've been praying earnestly for this

504
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,809
and have been waiting for God's answer.

505
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,395
A world where everyone is an owner

506
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,273
and where everything
is shared equally before God.

507
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,402
I've been wanting
to make a church like that.

508
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,531
Finally, God has answered my prayer.

509
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,449
Look at this.

510
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,537
Everything
that takes place here will be ours.

511
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,332
All of us will be the owners.

512
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,418
The perfect residential
and commercial complex,

513
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,504
the utopia of dreams,

514
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,423
is this church.

515
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,467
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

516
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,386
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

517
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,555
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

518
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,892
Lord!

519
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,979
-I'm always rejoicing as I work hard
-I'm always rejoicing as I work hard

520
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,317
-For the hand of my pastor guides me
-For the hand of my pastor guides me

521
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,780
-The true reason for my blessing
-The true reason for my blessing

522
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,407
We have 20-billion-won return
on investment including donations.

523
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,201
Plus 30 billion won from bank loans.

524
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,912
-Thank you, pastor
-Thank you, pastor

525
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,913
Good job.

526
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:27,416
-He abides with us
-He abides with us

527
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,836
-Even in agony…
-Even in agony…

528
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,213
Where should I go?

529
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,634
-For the hand of my pastor guides me
-For the hand of my pastor guides me

530
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,887
How about Puerto Escondido?

531
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,557
It's a beach town in southeastern Mexico.

532
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,935
The beach there is amazing.

533
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,437
Didn't you buy the church site?

534
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,817
I did. I just made
a down payment for the loan.

535
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,237
You didn't think

536
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,616
we'd really build a church, did you?

537
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,160
Please.

538
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,453
Pack light.

539
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,168
We can buy what we need there.

540
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,760
What is it?

541
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,179
Where's your dad?

542
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,763
How would I know?

543
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,807
Call him. He might answer your call.

544
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,060
Call him and find out where he is.

545
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,563
Why? What is it this time?

546
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,856
Your father

547
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,483
gave all our money to the church!

548
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,794
Bok-gi. Where are you?

549
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,339
What's going on?

550
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,549
I'm sorry, Pastor Cha.

551
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,718
I've been sent
on a business trip to Europe.

552
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,721
By the way, I left you a check.

553
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,057
I'll give you the details once I arrive.

554
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,268
So, you know what to do
during the police investigation, right?

555
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,438
Your daughter
has to graduate from college.

556
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:23,199
My heart is fluttering with dreams

557
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:30,748
If you want to write love
Write it with a pencil

558
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,168
Love…

559
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:12,039
YOU HAVE TO ERASE IT CLEAN
WITH AN ERASER

560
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,000
-Drag him out.
-Get him.

561
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,210
-You crook!
-We got the crook.

562
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,254
-Crook!
-Where's my money?

563
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,256
-What are you going to do?
-You crook.

564
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,550
-Give me back my money.
-Die!

565
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,343
-Hey, where's my money?
-Bastard.

566
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,512
-Do you know how I got that money?
-Gosh.

567
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,015
-Hey.
-Stop it!

568
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,142
-You call yourself a pastor?
-Stop!

569
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,144
My dad's a victim, too.

570
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,646
Are you his daughter?

571
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,898
-You're in on this, aren't you?
-No.

572
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,984
Then, get lost!

573
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,242
Give me back my money.

574
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,457
Get him out of here!

575
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,541
Give my money back!

576
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,178
Did you tell them Dad is here?

577
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,765
-Yes.
-Are you crazy?

578
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,476
We need to get that bitch.

579
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,270
Your dad has to talk
if we want to get her.

580
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,439
He says he doesn't know.

581
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,900
Can't you see that he's become
the subject of a documentary?

582
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,693
They took him for a ride too.

583
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,196
And who was in the driver's seat?

584
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,574
He only has himself
to blame for this and no one else.

585
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,700
Besides, you know

586
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,163
how hard I've worked to save that money.

587
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,249
I had to work all sorts of documentaries.

588
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,087
I saved that money up
diligently and earnestly.

589
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,342
Your dad, that bastard,
gave all the money away to that bitch.

590
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:50,638
He basically let the world know
that he's easy prey. Do you understand?

591
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,016
Still, we're a family.

592
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,560
He's your husband.

593
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,729
A family has a home and lives together.

594
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,650
We lost our house.
We sleep in public bathhouses.

595
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,736
This isn't a family!

596
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,246
-Come on.
-What?

597
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,290
Give me my money back. I need that money.

598
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,084
Where do you think you're going?

599
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,003
Why are you keeping silent?

600
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,798
You said that the woman
who was with you planned the whole gig.

601
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,553
Why aren't you saying anything?

602
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,140
I had a wrong dream,

603
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,643
but I don't regret it.

604
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,229
What a stupid thing to say.

605
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:26,901
Dad.

606
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,075
Don't worry about me.

607
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,329
Make sure to finish college, okay?

608
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,997
That's not important right now.

609
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,460
Before you graduate,
drink and date all you want,

610
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,921
and have fun in clubs.

611
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,966
That's what I envied the most
when I was young.

612
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,676
I still do.

613
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,348
You still had a lot of fun though.

614
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,059
I did.

615
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,772
I did, but it's different
when you're a college student.

616
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,280
When you go out,

617
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,825
there will be a lawyer waiting for you.

618
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:24,959
Ms. Cha Joo-eun?

619
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,970
Let's not see each other again.

620
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,772
CHA HYUN-TAE
REGULAR SAVINGS

621
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,690
TRANSACTION HISTORY

622
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,775
Get a small room with the money.

623
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,194
It's enough to cover tuition
and living expenses.

624
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,446
I'm really sorry, Joo-eun.

625
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,866
-Thank you for our daily bread.
-You'll have to get a part-time job.

626
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,076
-Amen.
-Amen.

627
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,829
I really didn't want you
to work during college.

628
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,622
My daughter…

629
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,125
I'm sorry.

630
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,515
Should I sing for you?

631
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,353
-This--
-No.

632
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,524
Help me find that bitch.

633
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,569
-Who?
-The one that put my dad in jail.

634
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,863
Oh, that bitch.

635
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,489
Do you know her?

636
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,618
I've never met her,

637
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,289
but I've heard rumors about her.

638
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,124
So what's her deal?

639
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,379
Her nickname is Jeong Bok-gi.
Her real name is unknown.

640
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,091
She's quite good in this field.
She's both skilled and decisive.

641
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,385
Can you find out where she is now?

642
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,387
-What if I can?
-I'll catch her.

643
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,267
You can't. At least for now.

644
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,397
And Jeong Bok-gi…

645
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,360
She got on a plane
when her documentary premiered.

646
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,111
Where to?

647
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,154
Somewhere far away.

648
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,574
Darn it.

649
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,868
With that much profit,

650
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,954
she'll be traveling all over
for the next few years.

651
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,289
She may not even return.

652
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,461
We have no choice but to pray
that she'll become homesick

653
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,298
or come up with a documentary idea

654
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,717
that she's dying to shoot
and decide to return.

655
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,136
So there's a chance she might return?

656
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,850
Then can you teach me how to act

657
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,977
until she comes back?

658
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,982
You said I have an ideal mug.

659
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,945
Why ask me when you have your mom?

660
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,949
I pursue a different style of acting.

661
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,373
Once you learn to act,

662
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,085
you will also become "that bitch."

663
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,046
Live an easy life.

664
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,092
The life where you can trust
your friends and the world.

DDINGHO RESTAURANT

00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,973
The best malatang
is at the five-way intersection.

670
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,102
I'll have to try it first.

671
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:28,906
Who are you?

672
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,825
Didn't you think
I'd check your photo before meeting you?

673
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,244
"Photo"? What photo?

674
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,955
I know you didn't receive any photos.

675
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,000
If you did,
you wouldn't have led me into this alley.

676
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,297
Excuse me.

677
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,050
It's better to be safe than sorry.

678
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,182
Hello.

679
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,476
I'd like you to cooperate with us.

680
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,479
What were you two doing?

681
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,605
You bastards!

682
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,231
Freeze! Put down your weapon!

683
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,027
Damn it!

684
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,948
Gosh, she's complicated things.

FALL, 2014

00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,018
-I know Cha Gyeong-ju.
-Really?

693
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,686
What do you like about him?

694
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,480
Everything.

695
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,231
-Everything? So do I.
-Yeah.

LATE FALL, 2016

UNCLE HAN SON

701
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,571
I thought
you were lying low for the time being.

702
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,576
What is this?

703
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,702
A luxury bag.

704
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,670
You have good taste.

705
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,598
Have a drink.

706
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,978
Buy some clothes
that'll go well with that bag.

707
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,608
You'll be playing
a fourth-generation chaebol next.

708
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,296
Can I take a break?

709
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,049
I've been working like a dog for years.

710
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,677
Let me have some fun for a short while.

711
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,806
We should keep at it
while the going is good.

712
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,267
I've done enough.

713
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,228
You're the one who wanted to learn.

714
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,522
Take the bag and buy some clothes.

715
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,566
I'll call you later.

716
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,241
I saw her.

717
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,618
I think I saw that bitch.

718
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,204
-Who?
-Jeong Bok-gi.

719
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,834
Did you know that she was back?

720
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:56,751
No.

721
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,753
Just go buy some clothes.

722
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,841
Focus on what you need to do,
not on what you want to do.

723
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,885
Don't you know
why I'm doing this in the first place?

724
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,596
You do.
It's all because I want to catch her.

725
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,808
Yet you want me to ignore her?

726
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,977
We can't catch her.
We can't hold a candle to her.

727
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,894
So?

728
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:16,980
Are you scared?

729
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,899
Fine, I'll do it alone.

730
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,158
Thanks for the gift.

731
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,673
Hello.

732
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,218
Hello, I'm Detective Kim Jae-hui
from Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

733
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:51,348
Do you remember the woman
in a yellow dress who came here

734
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,349
about an hour ago?

735
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,394
-What did she purchase?
-Two pieces of knitwear.

736
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,688
May I ask what this is about?

737
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,066
Did she pay with credit card or cash?

738
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,692
With cash.

739
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,319
Cash…

740
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,365
By the way, where are the CCTV cameras?

741
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,741
There it is.

742
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,329
Jeong Bok-gi.

743
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,582
Please call me if she visits again.

744
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,877
If you tell her
that a detective was looking for her,

745
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,421
you'll be arrested
for harboring a criminal.

746
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,422
Do you understand?

747
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,361
You owe me one, okay?

748
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,490
We have to succeed.

749
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,213
A medical appliance pyramid scheme.

750
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:09,300
Our company, P&H,
stands for "Physical fitness and Healing."

751
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:13,054
Our high-tech medical appliances
protect your mental health

752
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,681
as well as physical health.

753
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,892
If I were to tell you that you just need
to apply and attach them,

754
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,810
would you believe me?

755
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:22,230
Our appliances will kill off
even cancer cells. The low-frequency--

756
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,527
The low-frequency pads will

757
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,904
continuously provoke your body to move.

758
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:23,833
DIRECTOR

759
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,924
Although it's a pyramid scheme,
she must have ledgers and contracts.

760
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,637
Whether it be a double-entry ledger,
a fake contract, or her seal, find it.

761
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,389
Who are you?

762
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,148
I just wanted to succeed.

763
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,068
As a fellow female,

764
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,446
I wanted to ask her
for some tips on success.

765
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,824
Well, then.

766
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,704
Ma'am.

767
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,589
If you don't mind,

768
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,759
I could give you some advice instead.

769
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,432
We need to make some changes to the plan.

770
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,433
How?

771
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,436
Congratulations on becoming
a diamond member in the shortest time.

772
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,480
This is only the beginning.

773
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,235
I bet it wasn't easy to persuade
the gold members, your rivals.

774
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,988
-You're amazing.
-Well…

775
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,740
I just paid for this membership.

776
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,492
Is that so?

777
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,704
The lifespan of this business
is only three years.

778
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,873
There's no need
to gradually climb up the ladder.

779
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,628
It'll be game over soon anyway
since you'll be closing down the business.

780
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,840
I should make money when you guys do.

781
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,593
"Closing down"?
I'm afraid I'm not following you.

782
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,143
Do you really not know?
Or are you just pretending?

783
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:16,899
Who are you?

784
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:18,776
Let me see.

785
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,821
I'd like to think of myself as a broker.

786
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:26,200
But others may think of me as a lobbyist.

787
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,786
A broker suits you better.

788
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,580
All right, then.

789
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:35,334
I wonder
what your intentions are, Ms. Broker.

790
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,462
You're the one
who approached me, Mr. Park.

791
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,630
You were trying to get into my pants.

792
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,923
Then you should let me.

793
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,133
It all depends on you.

794
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,679
Okay, let me hear what you want then.

795
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,476
Let's set up an account

796
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,146
where we can manage
all the company's funds for three years.

797
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,691
I know you're the one
managing all the accounts.

798
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,319
Are you a commission broker?

799
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,322
A gift.

800
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,499
Cheers?

801
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,877
Cheers.

802
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:28,471
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Kim Jun-beom from Shinjung Bank.

803
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,848
Likewise. I'm Park Jin-woo from P&H.

804
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,602
Look at you.
You must be passionate about working out.

805
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,395
It's just my build.

806
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,981
My body adds muscles just by breathing.

807
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,233
It's useless and bulky.

808
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,526
I see.

809
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,319
I'm built that way too.

810
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,654
Please sit.

811
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,662
I'm sure you've heard of the conditions.

812
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,122
Will you be making
all the transactions through our bank?

813
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,551
Let's go to the bank right now.
This will benefit the both of us.

814
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,593
Let's begin.

815
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,890
I guess my work here is done.
I'll leave the rest up to you two.

816
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,370
Welcome. This way, please.

817
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:45,631
This way, please.

818
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,094
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

819
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,095
SON CHA-OK

820
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,350
Hello.

821
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,060
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

822
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,145
Please sit down.

823
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,107
I heard you wanted to set up
your main bank account with us.

824
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,484
Will the interest rate be high?

825
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,029
We'll provide you
with the best conditions.

826
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,281
Of course, you will.

827
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,366
Do you have the documents?

828
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,579
Oh, no.

829
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:19,790
Mr. Kim.

830
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,146
Oh, no.

831
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,774
What's wrong with me?

832
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:53,866
What should I do?

833
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,675
I guess he's running a bit late.

834
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,134
I'm sorry.

835
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,428
-There must be a traffic jam.
-I see.

836
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,527
Mr. Lee, how far are you?

837
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,952
You're almost here?

838
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,586
STRICTER REQUIREMENTS
FOR OPENING NEW ACCOUNTS

839
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,049
REPAIR SERVICES

840
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,148
Thank you.

841
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,478
I apologize for the delay.

842
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,317
All right, then.

843
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:54,528
Goodbye, sir.

844
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,292
It's freezing. Hurry up and close down.
We shouldn't let anyone else in.

845
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:14,256
SHINJUNG BANK

846
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,219
Hey, open up. We need to clean up.

847
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,848
Why are you so stupid?

848
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:34,026
TOMORROW INVESTMENT

849
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,957
Have a drink.

850
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,254
Good work.

851
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,052
-Come have a drink.
-Okay.

852
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,223
Keep an eye on him.
Make sure he doesn't go to the bank.

853
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,058
No one goes to the bank these days.

854
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,312
I won't let it drag on for too long.
Interest rates aren't that much anyway.

855
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,108
Once we receive the money,
I'm going to put an end to this.

856
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,610
That's not right.

857
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:20,406
I hate to admit it,
but I can't help but acknowledge

858
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,950
that bitch's really good.

859
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,912
-That money is going to snowball.
-So?

860
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,123
Let's give it a week.

861
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,626
Let's find out how happy she'll make us.

862
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,211
No, it's too dangerous.

863
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:39,466
I can't trust that branch manager,
and there are too many variables.

864
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,093
It's like walking through a minefield.

865
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:44,972
It's only natural to be walking
on a minefield full of variables.

866
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:47,433
Did you think
making a documentary would be easy?

867
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,435
We'll make more than enough.

868
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:53,397
I just want to see her
bawl her eyes out as soon as possible.

869
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,153
I thought you took after me,
but you're a clone of your dad.

870
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,363
That's a compliment, right?

871
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:03,824
What do you think?

872
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:07,244
Then I'll understand
we'll be pulling out right away.

873
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,538
Anyway, I'm getting 20%.

874
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:14,001
Since Han Son brought you in,
you two figure that out.

875
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,045
He and I will be halving it.

876
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,217
I covered all the costs.
Make it six to four.

877
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:25,554
Fine.

878
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:34,313
P&H PARK JIN-WOO

879
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,940
He hasn't forgotten.

880
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,568
Let's grab a drink next time.

881
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,038
Thanks

882
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,374
for helping me.

883
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,343
I poured you too much.

884
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,182
How was I today? Did you like it?

885
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,563
Mr. Park.

886
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:20,943
How many men do you think
I've encountered through my business?

887
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,030
Had I slept with every single one of them,

888
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,284
what kind of bitch
do you think I'd be right now?

889
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,204
A despicable bitch?

890
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,210
I want to be a good bitch.

891
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:43,465
So let's just remain business partners.

892
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,182
In return, I'll raise your commission fee.

893
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,078
Hello, sir.

894
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:14,955
Thank you.

895
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:20,502
I'd like to sincerely thank you once again
for doing business with our bank.

896
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:25,007
The money's been deposited,
so call Mr. Park and thank him.

897
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:29,386
Boost his ego to distract him,
then wire everything right away.

898
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,805
Okay. What will you do?

899
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,267
I'll go get a good look
at that bitch's face.

900
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,442
ACCOUNT BALANCE

901
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,360
It's done.

902
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,030
Now, let's end this.

903
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,701
It increased by 10 million just now.

904
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,621
ACCOUNT BALANCE

905
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,042
Let's wait until the end of the day, okay?

906
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,344
Thank you so much, Mr. Park.

907
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,679
I truly mean it.

908
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,890
Have you had lunch yet?

909
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,811
-I have.
-Then how about dinner?

910
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,646
Is Japanese cuisine okay with you?

911
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,482
Sure, I'll see you there. Okay.

912
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,835
I saw that you changed our bank.

913
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:43,752
Right.

914
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,840
The branch manager was so arrogant
and the interest rate was too low.

915
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,134
Is that so?

916
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,260
Yes, ma'am.

917
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,643
-Ms. Cha, aren't you going?
-Sorry?

918
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,522
The director wanted to show her gratitude
toward the diamond members

919
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,816
and invited
all the diamond members to lunch.

920
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:12,990

921

MY PUPPY

922
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,258
The digits are soaring, Joo-eun.

923
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:33,635
Just one more hour.

924
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,054
Just one more hour.

925
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:40,309
Pick up, will you?

926
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:43,604
Ms. Cha?

927
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,939
Come in, please.

928
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:57,951
-Have a seat, please.
-Where are the others?

929
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,995
I'm not sure. They're all running late.

930
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,706
-Coffee?
-Yes, please.

931
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:15,594
By the way, congratulations
on becoming a diamond member

932
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,388
in the shortest time.

933
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,098
Thank you.

934
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:40,827
What do you want?

935
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:43,497
Sorry?

936
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:45,415
Am I the target?

937
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,045
Did you penetrate the enemy lines

938
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,256
in order to avenge

939
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:54,800
your dad?

940
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,849
Did you really think I wouldn't recognize
Pastor Cha's only daughter?

941
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:08,480
Come in.

942
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,437
I won't be going down alone.

943
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:52,733
Can you handle it?

944
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:56,069
Since Cha Joo-eun joined the company,
we've suffered some damages.

945
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,572
Why don't we drink some more?

946
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:00,991
Just give me what you need to give me.

947
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:02,451
Well, okay.

948
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:05,120
-I'll buy you coffee.
-Out of the blue?

949
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,413
Out of the blue.

950
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:08,707
He's just an office worker
at GK Tech, a conglomerate.

951
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,752
Right. Tomorrow,
we'll have a new prey to target.

952
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,840
Jeong-hwan.

953
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,051
I wanted to show you off.

954
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,178
A documentary with some truth to it.

955
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:22,929
It's just awful.

956
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,562
