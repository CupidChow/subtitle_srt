1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,739
For all four of you who disobeyed Master's order,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,249
you must go to the Tree of Remorse.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,100
Ahhhhhhhhh!

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,239
Stay here.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,970
Don't go anywhere.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,960
Guys, I've found Master Dilak.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,319
Master?

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,530
Master?

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,690
Master Dilak.

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,130
Run.

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,540
Run.

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,889
What did you say?

13
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,890
Run.

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,960
Run is here.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,410
Run is here.

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,059
Run is here.

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,319
He is here.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,019
Run is inside Home School.

19
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,650
He is inside Home School.

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,090
Run is here

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,090
at Home School.

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,169
Right.

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,170
Yes.

24
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,370
Run is inside Home School.

25
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,370
Where is he in Home School?

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,809
I can't remember.

27
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,780
I can't.

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,340
I can't remember.

29
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:02,919
Master,

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,079
can you hear me?

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,620
It's us.

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,759
She has a wound on her foot.

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,440
We must stop the bleeding.

34
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,300
Help carry her.

35
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,619
Why did Master walk barefoot?

36
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,620
It looks like she was running away from something.

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,439
I can't remember.

38
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,090
I can't.

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,720
I can't remember it.

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,120
I can't.

41
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,860
I can't remember it.

42
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:28,019
What is it that you can't remember, Master?

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,850
- I can't remember. - Is it about Run?

44
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,540
Run away.

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,439
Run away.

46
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,280
Master.

47
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,930
Master, calm down.

48
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,570
Master.

49
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,260
- Master. - Run away.

50
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,479
Run away.

51
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,080
Run away!

52
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,169
Master, relax.

53
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,379
What do you want us to run away from?

54
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,450
Who's there?

55
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,820
You must run away.

56
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Run away.

57
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,660
What are you doing out here at this late hour?

58
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Huh?

59
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,980
What happened to Master Dilak?

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
I think she got cut by some rocks.

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Master Dilak, are you alright?

62
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,700
I can't remember.

63
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:30,200
Did anyone hurt you?

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,880
I can't remember.

65
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,859
I can't remember.

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,460
No, no.

67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,940
Master,

68
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,740
it looks like there's something over there.

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,060
Eh?

70
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,810
Headmaster, why are you standing there in the dark?

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,579
Nothing.

72
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,892
Following Master Dilak's voice.

73
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:10,890
Unfortunately, my lamp ran out of oil.

74
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,413
Did you come across someone else, Headmaster?

75
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,560
I didn't.

76
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,053
Are you saying that

77
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,533
apart from us,

78
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,626
there's also someone else in the forest?

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,719
Nothing is going on at all.

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,880
Return to Home School now.

81
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,026
Master Phoban, please take care of them.

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,866
Please follow me, everyone.

83
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,035
Are you telling us that.

84
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,506
GEN4's Run is your brother?

85
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:34,745
And those Masters have locked him up

86
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,652
in Home School?

87
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,649
Why did they lock him up?

88
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,253
What did your brother do wrong?

89
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,599
I think it's not strange for this place to lock someone up.

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,785
Home School is not different from a prison.

91
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,779
Now, we don't even have anything to eat.

92
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,226
It's worse than a prison.

93
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,835
Do you remember this?

94
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,719
The first time I escaped from Home School,

95
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,293
I heard someone's scream from the forest.

96
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:00,748
Could it be your brother's voice, Maki?

97
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,679
Um.

98
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
That's what I've been thinking,

99
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,360
but I've tried tailing those Masters into the forest

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,493
but never succeeded.

101
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,480
That's why I don't know where Run is now.

102
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:17,795
Well,

103
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,986
it's a pretty deep forest.

104
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:22,491
We don't know what we'll meet there if we walk further inside.

105
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:30,360
Master Dilak.

106
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:45,210
What you told me last night...

107
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,106
About... what?

108
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,835
Well, last night,

109
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,479
in the forest,

110
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,146
you told us.

111
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,040
Run is inside Home School.

112
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Run?

113
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,880
Who's Run?

114
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:18,865
What about that wound on your foot?

115
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,280
How is it?

116
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,755
Oh,

117
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,600
Master Praeporn already dressed the wound for me.

118
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,465
So what really happened, Master?

119
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,460
What were you doing inside the forest?

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,960
To be honest,

121
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,173
I can't remember either.

122
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,093
It's probably the side effect of the medicine I took.

123
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:48,613
Medicine?

124
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,585
Are you sick?

125
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,786
Why are you taking medicine?

126
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,480
Hey.

127
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,919
It's her personal matter.

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,145
You're still kids.

129
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,919
Can you not mess with adults' businesses?

130
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,946
Huh?

131
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:23,253
It's alright, Master Prasath.

132
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:24,908
Kids,

133
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:30,106
this medicine helps me fall asleep more easily.

134
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,399
Master Dilak,

135
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,435
let's find something delicious to eat.

136
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,933
We've got plenty of good ingredients today.

137
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,268
It seems our students don't really want to eat it.

138
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,240
Let's go.

139
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,653
Whatever.

140
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,199
Master Dilak's condition is similar to Hugo's and Jingjai's.

141
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,786
It seems their memories were deleted.

142
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:05,745
There're only weird things happening here.

143
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,053
Do you agree?

144
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,839
That Tree of Remorse is already creepy enough.

145
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,600
Now, there's this memory-deleting thing.

146
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,186
What is Home School really trying to do to us?

147
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:22,755
The answer to everything here is probably in the treatment room.

148
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,865
Do you know what a treatment room is?

149
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,786
Where is it?

150
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,200
Hugo and Jingjai can't remember it either.

151
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:37,105
Tibet, Nai,

152
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,355
White, Maki.

153
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,293
What's going on, Pennhung?

154
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:44,053
Well, let's gather with our friends.

155
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:47,973
What's going on?

156
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,573
Shh!

157
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,413
Follow me.

158
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,625
Seriously?

159
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,999
Are we escaping from Home School again?

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,626
Haven't you had enough of it?

161
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:07,619
How do we escape?

162
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,759
There're 13 of us here.

163
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,466
We'll figure it out.

164
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
But I must stay here.

165
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,009
Why, Maki?

166
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,195
Staying here only gives you punishment.

167
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,986
Let's help each other find a way to escape.

168
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,529
Please, Maki.

169
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,825
You're so smart.

170
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,985
You can definitely find a way to get us out of here.

171
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,573
Maki, I miss my dad.

172
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:32,586
I really want to go home.

173
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,266
But this is seriously the first time I feel like going home.

174
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,210
Yes.

175
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:41,209
I can't bear this place anymore.

176
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,506
I want to go home.

177
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,279
But we've been thinking about it.

178
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,532
To successfully get out of here,

179
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,530
we need you guys.

180
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,560
Thirteen of us must escape together, like Hugo said.

181
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,466
Pennhung thinks

182
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,715
we'd better help each other find someone

183
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,452
who has the power to close Home School down.

184
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,449
Nobody deserves to be locked up

185
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,533
or punished like Pennhung was.

186
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
To be honest, I miss my mom.

187
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,426
I'm worried about her.

188
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,271
I want to see her.

189
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,515
Does anyone have any plan?

190
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,532
Hugo, last time you got Jingjai out of here by driving,

191
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,986
but you two still didn't get by.

192
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,520
I do.

193
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,093
Get out of here like how we came in.

194
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,799
What do you mean?

195
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,040
That minibus.

196
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,080
We must steal it and drive out of here.

197
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,585
But before we do that,

198
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,519
we must cut the light off to distract those Masters

199
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,920
and make them head into the forest.

200
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:59,653
After that, one of us must sneak into Master Amin's office and steal the key.

201
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,650
Wow.

202
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,586
You truly deserve to be our Class President.

203
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,159
Don't say that yet.

204
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,779
It sounds easy,

205
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,373
but I think it's difficult to succeed.

206
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,786
It can't hurt to try.

207
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,226
Hey?

208
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,946
Jingjai, what's wrong?

209
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,493
Jingjai.

210
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,826
Jingjai.

211
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:41,620
Jingjai.

212
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,613
Can you hear me?

213
00:12:42,614 --> 00:12:44,986
Jingjai.

214
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,279
Jingjai.

215
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,293
Jingjai, what's wrong?

216
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:53,729
Jingjai.

217
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,293
Hey!

218
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:55,359
What happened to her?!

219
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,040
Jingjai.

220
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,920
Jingjai, wake up.

221
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,280
Jingjai.

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,280
Jingjai.

223
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,986
Can you hear me?

224
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,369
Jingjai.

225
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,240
Jingjai, wake up.

226
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,693
Jingjai.

227
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,319
From checking her body,

228
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
I think there's nothing to be worried about now.

229
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,060
Do you feel that there's still something wrong with your body?

230
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,093
Well, what happened to me?

231
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,332
You're probably stressed out

232
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,933
and haven't got enough sleep.

233
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,009
After taking some rest, you should be okay.

234
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,692
It's not strange that Jingjai is under stress.

235
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:37,690
We haven't eaten anything for a day.

236
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:41,213
That's what you chose by yourselves.

237
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,609
But is that really the only cause of her condition?

238
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,746
Is it possible that her condition was caused by something else?

239
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,329
It's nothing.

240
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,240
Jingjai, feel free to take some rest in the infirmary.

241
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,259
Jingjai,

242
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,693
are you really all right?

243
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,879
Of course.

244
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,400
We must get out of here tonight.

245
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,786
Maki,

246
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,693
we've agreed to follow your plan.

247
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,880
What if it doesn't work?

248
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,720
Just burn this place down.

249
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,130
Yeah.

250
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,933
If we can't escape,

251
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,580
just destroy it.

252
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
Honestly, this sounds like a good idea.

253
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,279
It's so strange.

254
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,346
Why hasn't Master Amin arrived?

255
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
What's going on?

256
00:15:58,801 --> 00:15:59,999
Why did the power go out?

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,453
I'll check on it, Headmaster.

258
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:03,533
Master!

259
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,759
There's a fire!

260
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,546
Pardon?

261
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,540
There's a fire in the hall!

262
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,859
Oh my gosh.

263
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,292
Oh, dear.

264
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:26,290
Did they have to go this far burning the school?

265
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,039
Master Champ and Master Dilak,

266
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,920
please extinguish the fire as soon as possible.

267
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,299
Headmaster, there's a fire in the kitchen.

268
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,506
Pennhung saw someone setting fire in the courtyard.

269
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,679
Master Prasath, please hurry to the courtyard.

270
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,652
Master Praeporn and I will go check on the kitchen.

271
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,466
Yes.

272
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,253
I'll arrest the person who burnt Home School down.

273
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,866
Let's go.

274
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,066
We'd better go now.

275
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,939
Nai, when Masters arrive,

276
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,744
you run that way.

277
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:08,640
I'll run to another.

278
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,799
Why?

279
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,439
What if I want to run with you?

280
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,320
You can't do that.

281
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,960
Let's split up,

282
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:15,081
so it will be more difficult for Masters to catch us.

283
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,120
Tibet!

284
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,799
- Run! - Stop now!

285
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,586
Hey, that way!

286
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,466
These kids are just...

287
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,599
Hey, we've found the key!

288
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,319
Really?

289
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,039
Why were you so fast?

290
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,119
Where did you find it, Mek?

291
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,119
In Master Amin's office.

292
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,329
We just opened the desk's drawer,

293
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,373
and it was right there as if he wanted us to see it easily.

294
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:47,866
Maki, you find it strange, don't you?

295
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,569
Isn't it too easy?

296
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,891
Don't waste time thinking about it.

297
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:51,851
Let's get out of here now.

298
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:52,520
Let's go.

299
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:53,880
Hurry up.

300
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,013
Shit.

301
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:57,466
Master Amin.

302
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Shit. What the hell?

303
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,439
Are you sure

304
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,213
you want to escape from Home School?

305
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,826
Do you really think

306
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,280
I couldn't be onto you?

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,999
I'm disappointed.

308
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,219
I am

309
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,779
because such a childish plan shouldn't have come from the brains

310
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,849
of our Home School students.

311
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,769
But we've never wanted to become Home School students.

312
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,693
That's right.

313
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:41,319
If you don't allow us to go Home,

314
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,826
we'll destroy this place.

315
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:44,089
Right!

316
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,609
Let us go.

317
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,919
We'll go home.

318
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,680
That's right.

319
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,386
I'll go home

320
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:49,769
to my family.

321
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,653
Going back home?

322
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Meeting your family?

323
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,746
How do you know

324
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,746
your families want you to go back?

325
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,740
We're their children.

326
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,099
We belong to the family.

327
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,559
We're their family members.

328
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,559
It's a blood relation.

329
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,359
There's no way our families won't welcome us back.

330
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,579
Wow.

331
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,906
That's interesting.

332
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,539
Is this what you think the word family means?

333
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,840
Just a blood relation?

334
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,613
But to us, Home School is not our home or family.

335
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:36,839
That's right.

336
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,066
It's not our home.

337
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,946
Alright.

338
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,013
If you insist on not staying here,

339
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:46,586
I can't force you.

340
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:47,600
Are you saying

341
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:49,639
you're allowing us to go home?

342
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,879
I'll go beyond that.

343
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,533
I'll let Master Phoban drive all of you to the place

344
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,690
you call "home."

345
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,419
Why are you allowing us to leave this time?

346
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,866
Since you don't see this place as your home,

347
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,919
I can't force you to continue staying.

348
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,906
So why did you force us before?

349
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,466
That's what you have to figure out on your own.

350
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:40,840
Everyone,

351
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,419
it's time to set out.

352
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,013
For those who want to leave Home School,

353
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:49,779
please eat this cookie

354
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,780
and get on the bus.

355
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,439
Why must we eat a cookie?

356
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,439
It's Home School's rule.

357
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,519
Come on.

358
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,519
Are you getting us drugged again?

359
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,106
We're onto you already.

360
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,839
You three go now.

361
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,839
I'll stay.

362
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Why, Maki?

363
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,169
White, I'm an orphan.

364
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,929
I don't have a home.

365
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,319
Though I leave this place,

366
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,132
I don't have anyone to go back to.

367
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:20,130
Just come with me.

368
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,466
It's alright.

369
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,746
I want to stay.

370
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,960
Whatever works for you.

371
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,929
Take care of yourself.

372
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,930
You too.

373
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,373
Maki.

374
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,986
Tibet.

375
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:52,810
Go back to your mom at home.

376
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:00,586
I can stay here.

377
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580
Go now.

378
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:23,370
Take good care of yourself.

379
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:27,580
You too.

380
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,329
I'm glad

381
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,330
you've chosen to stay here.

382
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,053
Good morning, Run.

383
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
I have something to inform you of.

384
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,559
Last night,

385
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,733
GEN6 students went home already.

386
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,226
Master Amin,

387
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,019
isn't that too harsh for them?

388
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,573
That's what they wanted.

389
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,239
But they didn't know why

390
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,479
they were sent to Home School.

391
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,893
It can't be helped.

392
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,239
It's one of the lessons all of them must learn.

393
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,053
Even you yourself went through that already.

394
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,859
But no matter what,

395
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,249
you must tell them the truth.

396
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,653
It hurts to face such a thing.

397
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:54,933
Yes.

398
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
It hurts so bad.

399
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:10,226
Nothing can hurt more than being hurt by their own family.

400
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,813
But it surprised me

401
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,453
that one student chose to continue staying at Home School.

402
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,746
I'm so curious to know the reason.

403
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,799
Rin, I told you already

404
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,266
not to come to Home School.

405
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:31,930
We've arrived, everyone.

406
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Nai.

407
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,826
Everyone, we've arrived.

408
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,864
Mek.

409
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:43,865
Mork.

410
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,933
Home School bus will park here, waiting for you.

411
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:52,420
Good luck

412
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,186
on coming back to meet your family.

413
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:04,986
This way, please.

414
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,906
Can I sit here with you and have my meal, Maki?

415
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Sure, Master.

416
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,773
Master, do you have something to talk to me about?

417
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,600
I just want to know

418
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,813
how you feel about staying here alone.

419
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm not here alone.

420
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,760
Masters are also here.

421
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,740
Do you miss your friends?

422
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,493
Well, I do.

423
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:58,130
Aren't you worried about them at all?

424
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:01,250
Why should I be worried?

425
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,640
Now, each of them is with their family.

426
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,693
Family?

427
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,690
(Let's eat.)

428
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,893
(Sure. It will taste nice.)

429
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:34,466
Dad?

430
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,226
Mek. Mork.

431
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,080
Stop.

432
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:41,199
Stop now.

433
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,266
Where are you taking it to?

434
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,640
I told you to stop.

435
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,959
Who allowed you to?

436
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,640
Put it down now.

437
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:48,533
White?

438
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:50,053
I told you to put it here.

439
00:30:50,054 --> 00:30:51,813
How could you get here?

440
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,889
Master Amin allowed us to come back.

441
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,419
What the hell?

442
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,626
This didn't go as agreed.

443
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,439
I already paid them.

444
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,533
You must stay there for three years.

445
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,119
Go back already.

446
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,012
Hurry back to Home School

447
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:10,009
before your dad is back.

448
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,653
Pennhung doesn't want to go to Home School.

449
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,920
Pennhung wants to stay with family.

450
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,813
We can't call this a family.

451
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,226
Pennhung, you must remember that

452
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:27,760
a family means we don't hurt each other.

453
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,240
Don't you think that

454
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:36,413
everyone has been allowed to go home

455
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,453
because it's part of Home School's curriculum?

456
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,653
What are you Masters planning to do?

457
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:49,040
We aren't doing anything.

458
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,880
Their families are.

459
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,666
Who's she?

460
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:06,786
Where is Mom?

461
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,826
It's none of your business.

462
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,819
You two must return to Home School now.

463
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,440
I won't go.

464
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,016
If you want us to go that much, you'd better go there yourself!

465
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,613
Mek!

466
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:20,900
How dare you say that to me?

467
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
You daughter is so useless.

468
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,892
You're saying it like you're so useful, Papa.

469
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:32,040
You're not doing anything at all, apart from having new wives.

470
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,600
You're bad mouthing.

471
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,746
I'll slap you to make your mouth full of blood.

472
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:38,159
Go ahead.

473
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,759
Slap me.

474
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,063
Though you slap me to death,

475
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:42,065
I won't go back.

476
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,059
This is my home.

477
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,579
What's this?

478
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,013
How could you allow others to move stuff out of my house?

479
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:51,705
These all belong to my parents.

480
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,699
This is no longer your house.

481
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,419
How come?

482
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,000
I already sold it.

483
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,080
What right do you have to sell it?

484
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,906
This house hasn't been yours from the start.

485
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:09,359
It belongs to my family member.

486
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,253
I have the right to.

487
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,249
But I won't let you do this.

488
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,573
That's your problem.

489
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:16,340
But what can a kid like you do?

490
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,799
I paid a million to send you to Home School.

491
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,679
But you're so stupid for coming back.

492
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,239
You're as stupid as your dad.

493
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,919
My sister shouldn't have married your dad.

494
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Everything was totally ruined.

495
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
I'm sorry

496
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,293
that I can't protect you.

497
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:39,769
The only way to help you is that

498
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,453
you must return to Home School.

499
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,106
But Home School is unkind to Pennhung.

500
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:50,700
Pennhung wants to be at home.

501
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,160
But your dad is even more unkind than Home School is.

502
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,533
Why don't you believe me, Mom?

503
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:30,409
Home School really tortured every student.

504
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,329
Those Masters locked us up.

505
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,639
They forbade us from eating our meals,

506
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,199
and made us argue and fight among ourselves.

507
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,880
Pheng, stop lying already.

508
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,120
You can no longer be such an attention-seeker.

509
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,999
Mom, but I'm telling the truth.

510
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm really not lying to you.

511
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,960
Pheng, you're saying this again.

512
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,293
I have no time to listen to your lies.

513
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,000
Pheng, you've been begging me all this time.

514
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,585
This time, it's my turn to beg you.

515
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:15,580
Go back to Home School.

516
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,200
I don't want to listen to your excuse anymore.

517
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,573
(Yes. The price is agreed as previously dealt.)

518
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:25,653
(Yes.)

519
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:35,373
You have been envious of my parents so much, right?

520
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,772
You planned this from the start, didn't you?

521
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:41,769
You sent me to live somewhere else

522
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,089
because you wanted my parents' property, right?

523
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,639
Is that all you want?

524
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,799
I'm just securing my family's property.

525
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,093
You're an outcast,

526
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,026
who keeps causing trouble.

527
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,609
So where is Mom?

528
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,610
Huh?

529
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,920
Your mom?

530
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,279
She went abroad already.

531
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,412
As soon as she received the money after signing our divorce paper,

532
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,410
she flew away with her new husband.

533
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:14,546
Divorce?

534
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,479
Did Mom and you divorce already?

535
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,306
How about us two?

536
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:22,779
Be frank with me.

537
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
Have you ever seen me as your kid?

538
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,932
How am I wrong, Papa?

539
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:30,930
Is it just because I'm a girl?

540
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,399
Answer me.

541
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,889
Is it because I'm a girl?

542
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,450
I don't want to look after you anymore!

543
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,499
Go back to study.

544
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,600
Don't make me feel embarrassed again.

545
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,480
Got it?!

546
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,026
Fine.

547
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,059
Take this house, Auntie.

548
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,320
Take it.

549
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,106
But can I get one thing in return?

550
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,860
How many millions do you want?

551
00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:16,700
I don't need that much.

552
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:19,969
One punch will do.

553
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,533
Ow!

554
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:33,865
Listen to me.

555
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:35,859
When your mom signed our divorce paper,

556
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,172
she made it so clear to me that

557
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,733
she didn't want to get child custody to take care of you two.

558
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:42,053
That's why the trouble fell on me.

559
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,973
Hugo, are you sure you aren't going back home?

560
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:56,079
Of course.

561
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,263
Why should I go back?

562
00:38:57,264 --> 00:38:58,613
That place is no longer my home.

563
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,906
Now, my home is you.

564
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,933
I'm thinking about escaping to Pattaya.

565
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,505
You're going with me?

566
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:11,500
I'll go everywhere with you.

567
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,330
Let's go.

568
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,760
Jingjai!

569
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,410
Dad.

570
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,609
How dare you bring a guy to steal stuff at home?

571
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,999
You're no different from your mom!

572
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,213
Ow!

573
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,146
I've been bringing you up this much.

574
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,573
How dare you be ungrateful to me?

575
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:54,866
Ow!

576
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,329
Let go of my hand.

577
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,679
Do you want me to shoot you or what?

578
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,026
Dad, don't!

579
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,493
Ouch!

580
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,706
You came back home just because of this reason?

581
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Yes.

582
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,080
What a waste of time.

583
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:24,140
I'm so curious to know

584
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,053
how you could do this to your family member.

585
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,066
How could you do this to someone you love so much?

586
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,060
Do you really want to know

587
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,440
why I sent you to Home School?

588
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Yes.

589
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,426
I want to know.

590
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,839
Dad,

591
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,093
someone threw the rock into our house!

592
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,359
I knew it, Biw.

593
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,979
I told you to stay at Home School.

594
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,579
Why did you come back?

595
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,480
Is this the reason you sent me there?

596
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,213
Yes. It's the reason.

597
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,103
From now, we can't live here anymore.

598
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:39,773
We must move out to get away from them.

599
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:42,139
Where are we going to live?

600
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,973
You don't need to know that.

601
00:41:43,974 --> 00:41:46,253
But you must stay at Home School!

602
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,920
No.

603
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,599
Can't I go with you?

604
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,760
You can't!

605
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,703
How about paying those residents back the money?

606
00:42:01,704 --> 00:42:04,399
Compensate for them and apologize to them.

607
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,579
I think they will forgive us.

608
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,119
Come on, Biw.

609
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,133
Things aren't as easy as you think.

610
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,579
You just need to admit your mistake.

611
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,463
Then, everything will come to an end.

612
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:18,586
You mean I will end up in jail, right?

613
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,612
I see.

614
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:22,610
You want me to go to jail, don't you?

615
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,520
But I won't agree to.

616
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,973
(Come out!)

617
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,039
(Come!)

618
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,000
(Come here!)

619
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,289
(Come!)

620
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,289
(Come!)

621
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,319
(Come out!)

622
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,679
(You're hiding in there.)

623
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,719
(Come!)

624
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,932
(Now!)

625
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:38,929
(Come out!)

626
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,360
(Face us!)

627
00:42:40,426 --> 00:42:45,266
(You ruined my family. I wish your family a disaster.)

628
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:46,679
(Come!)

629
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,539
(Come see us now!)

630
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,785
(Hey!)

631
00:42:49,786 --> 00:42:51,780
(Why are you hiding?)

632
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:08,533
Young boy, why are you sitting here?

633
00:43:10,026 --> 00:43:11,733
Dad called me trash.

634
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,013
That's why I'm sitting here.

635
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,609
Your dad was just probably angry.

636
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,373
There's no dad who doesn't love their child.

637
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,786
But I happen to be

638
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,130
his unwanted son.

639
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,120
You're overthinking.

640
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,893
I hope everyone is doing fine.

641
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,440
Why didn't you let me stay with you, Mom?

642
00:45:21,626 --> 00:45:23,440
I feel sorry for those juniors

643
00:45:24,506 --> 00:45:26,500
for facing this.

644
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:35,826
There's nothing special about being Home School students.

645
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,946
We're just the kids

646
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:40,730
our families don't want.

647
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,653
To me, every Home School student is special.

648
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,210
I love all of them.

649
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,386
If you really do,

650
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:57,700
set me free, Master.

651
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,426
Master Amin won't let me do that, Run.

652
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,813
Don't you want to do something about it, Master?

653
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,303
Will you let Home School go on like this?

654
00:46:12,304 --> 00:46:14,426
You said Home School is our home, didn't you?

655
00:46:14,427 --> 00:46:16,819
But now it isn't anymore.

656
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,906
It's where millionaires spend millions just to abandon their kids.

657
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:29,159
Run, you know well Master Amin isn't doing this for money.

658
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,212
He always has a plan for Home School students.

659
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:35,253
But what Master Amin is planning to do is wrong.

660
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,985
The medicine you make me take won't work either.

661
00:46:38,986 --> 00:46:40,980
But the medicine works with others, Run,

662
00:46:41,986 --> 00:46:45,626
and now Master Amin is about to start the next step of his plan.

663
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:49,533
But no matter what, you must stop Master Amin

664
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,919
before things get even out of hand.

665
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,689
It's too late, Run.

666
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,783
Now, Master Amin has already found the right person,

667
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:58,400
who will be in charge of Home School's next mission.

668
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,720
Who?

669
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,693
Or is it Maki?

670
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,413
No.

671
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,200
It isn't Maki.

672
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,306
So who?

673
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,866
I gave your mom the promise that

674
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,306
I'll take care of you, Tibet.

675
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,600
You're not alone.

676
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,320
You're part of my family

677
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:11,493
though we're not blood relatives.

678
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,693
But at least,

679
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,466
Master Puth,

680
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:31,120
your dad, is my best friend.

681
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,520
Dad?

682
00:48:47,773 --> 00:48:50,373
Was my dad Home School's Master?

683
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:11,569
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

684
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:16,059
Welcome everyone back to Home School.

685
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,299
Everyone must attend the Up To You class.

686
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,179
You're allowed to choose it on your own.

687
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,000
Finally, we've made it to this point.

688
00:49:26,053 --> 00:49:29,359
Home School is full of mysterious stories.

689
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,092
What are you hiding, Master?

690
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,089
What are you afraid I'll find?

691
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,893
I'm not afraid about what you'll find.

692
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,946
I seriously want you to find it.
