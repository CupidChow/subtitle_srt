1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,839
This GEN is not like any other GEN.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,333
We can’t use the old ways with them anymore.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,999
There will be an exam tomorrow.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,544
Shit.

5
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:08,559
What freaking exam is it now?

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,459
The rule for this exam is

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,213
you must find a space to sit until the music stops.

8
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,859
When the music stops,

9
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,119
those who aren’t sitting will automatically fail the exam.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,133
I told you to get up!

11
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:20,599
Beauty, don’t give in.

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,739
Come at me!

13
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,320
Bring it on!

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,211
Come at me if you dare!

15
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:23,866
Bring it on!

16
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:26,213
You’ve always made such a confident face.

17
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:31,329
Don’t fight.

18
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,373
Pennhung doesn’t like it.

19
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:33,600
Don’t fight.

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,293
Pheng.

21
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:42,689
Sit down.

22
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,999
I’ll fail this exam.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,906
No, Maki.

24
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:46,079
- Sit down. - I’ll be fine.

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,499
See, White?

26
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,932
Maki gave up her seat for Pheng.

27
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,930
You’re as selfish as me.

28
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,732
Pheng, take my seat

29
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,729
so this bitch can shut up!

30
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,920
Ooh.

31
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,719
I can do it too.

32
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,680
Sit down.

33
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,399
Please stop, everyone.

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,079
I shouldn’t have passed in the first place.

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,369
Sit down.

36
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,049
There we have our solution.

37
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,426
Bye.

38
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:15,800
White.

39
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,933
If these chairs are such a problem for us,

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,600
just destroy them.

41
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,360
Let nobody pass the exam.

42
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,040
Hey!

43
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,199
What the hell is wrong with you?

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,479
Like I said,

45
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,999
if these chairs are such a problem for us,

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,459
let nobody pass the exam.

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,440
Hey.

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,679
If you don’t stop, I’ll deal with you.

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,252
I’ll deal with you first.

50
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,250
What’s the point of fighting, guys?

51
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,019
Don’t stop me.

52
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,729
Get yourselves together.

53
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,640
Don’t fight!

54
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,666
Don’t fight! Pennhung doesn’t like it!

55
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:17,809
Don’t fight!

56
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,879
Don’t fight! Pennhung doesn’t like it!

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,199
Don’t fight!

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,532
Yes!

59
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,640
Punch him!

60
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:27,080
Beat him!

61
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,933
Go, Tibet!

62
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,333
Go!

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,480
Enjoying much?

64
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,320
White!

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,920
Let go!

66
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,800
Come here!

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,531
Let go!

68
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,240
Will you stop or not?

69
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,986
Have you forgotten that you failed the exam?

70
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:42,819
Let me ask you something.

71
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,119
Have you ever thought about why you failed?

72
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,385
Let’s settle this once and for all!

73
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,600
Ouch!

74
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,386
Answer me.

75
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,579
Well…

76
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,259
I got lost in the forest.

77
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,599
That’s why I failed.

78
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,099
Jean and I just weren't as tough as Master Champ.

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,413
I couldn’t finish all the questions in time.

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,026
Are you sure that’s the reason why you failed?

81
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,813
What other reason could there be, Headmaster?

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,546
While waiting for your friends to finish the exam,

83
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,129
think and ask yourselves carefully

84
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,680
why you failed.

85
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,240
That’s enough!

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,026
Tibet!

87
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:04,772
Don’t fight! Pennhung doesn’t like it!

88
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:05,809
Calm down, Pennhung.

89
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,706
Stop it!

90
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,119
Tibet, that’s enough!

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,849
Don’t fight! Pennhung doesn’t like it!

92
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,426
Ouch!

93
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,159
Don’t fight! Pennhung doesn’t like it!

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,800
Calm down, Pennhung.

95
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,450
Don’t fight!

96
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,586
Don’t fight!

97
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,199
Don’t fight! Pennhung doesn’t like it!

98
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
Stop it!

99
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,920
Pennhung.

100
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,506
Doing this won’t help!

101
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,559
What do you want us to do?

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,626
Let Pheng fail.

103
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,999
Pheng doesn’t deserve to fail.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,652
Pheng sat on the chair before you, Jingjai.

105
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,650
Jingjai is right.

106
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,253
I shouldn’t have passed in the first place.

107
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,960
See?

108
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,929
I have the fairest solution for everyone.

109
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,346
What is that solution?

110
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,659
Let’s start over fairly.

111
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,399
If we keep fighting, we’ll all fail

112
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,369
and in the end, no one will get to contact their family.

113
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,053
Why do I have to start over?

114
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:11,369
I won’t do it.

115
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,626
Don’t be selfish, Jingjai.

116
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,719
Everyone is selfish.

117
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,426
What’s the use of being considerate?

118
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:21,253
Would that help you pass the exam?

119
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:22,786
Everyone.

120
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,979
As long as the music is still playing,

121
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,360
you can either start again or remain sitting.

122
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,852
If you don’t agree to start over,

123
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,623
I will break all the chairs.

124
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:41,383
Both you and I will lose the chance to contact our families.

125
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,746
You wouldn’t dare, White.

126
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:45,409
How can you be sure of that, Hugo?

127
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,640
She’s right.

128
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,373
If we don’t start over, we’ll all fail.

129
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,453
Yes.

130
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:56,013
I agree.

131
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,146
Let’s start over.

132
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,760
How disappointing.

133
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,053
I guess I’m expecting too much from you.

134
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,480
Master, please give us the signal to start.

135
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,340
Of course.

136
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,099
Three,

137
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,560
two,

138
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,039
one.

139
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,293
Go.

140
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:14,440
Jingjai!

141
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,144
Maki!

142
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:16,026
Pennhung!

143
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,929
No!

144
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,440
Let go of me!

145
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,919
Let go of me!

146
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,159
Pennhung, go!

147
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,179
Let go of me!

148
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,720
I will not!

149
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,919
Let go of me!

150
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,259
Let go of me, Maki!

151
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,706
What’s wrong with you?

152
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,520
Go, Pennhung!

153
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,640
Nai, Tibet, let go of me!

154
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,489
Pennhung, go sit down!

155
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,026
Go sit down, Pennhung!

156
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,093
Go!

157
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:44,412
Come sit down, Pennhung!

158
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:45,920
You’re ganging up on me?

159
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,379
You deserve it.

160
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,489
Let go!

161
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,159
Ouch! Let go!

162
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I will not!

163
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,373
I won’t let you take that seat, bitch!

164
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:56,972
I won’t let you either!

165
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:57,906
Ouch!

166
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:59,370
I won’t let you win!

167
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,906
Sorry, girl.

168
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,346
Maki, come sit down.

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,053
Come sit down, Maki.

170
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,866
Come on, Maki!

171
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,666
Shit.

172
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,280
Hey!

173
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,372
Sorry, handsome.

174
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,370
This is an exam.

175
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,169
Sorry, Jingjai.

176
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,266
Hugo!

177
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,824
Stop it!

178
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,480
Let go!

179
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:55,279
You can’t steal my seat!

180
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,419
Give me this chair, Jingjai!

181
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,346
It’s my chair!

182
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,760
Let go!

183
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:01,039
Give me this chair.

184
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,600
No!

185
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Let go, Jingjai!!

186
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:03,649
No, Hugo!

187
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,546
Move!

188
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:05,880
Let me have it!

189
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,379
Time’s up for the first round.

190
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,173
Hugo, Jingjai, you failed the exam.

191
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,732
This is all your fault.

192
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,919
How can you blame me?

193
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,279
You tried to steal my chair!

194
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,613
Woohoo!

195
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,933
Good job.

196
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,489
Woo!

197
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,939
Bye.

198
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,773
Shoo!

199
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,770
It serves you right.

200
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:50,706
Woo!

201
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,919
Here comes the folks who failed the exam.

202
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,609
There’s another one.

203
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,451
These folks failed the exam.

204
00:10:57,452 --> 00:10:57,971
It’s alright.

205
00:10:57,972 --> 00:10:58,960
Damn you.

206
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:01,720
Don’t be upset, buddy.

207
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,289
We all failed.

208
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,160
We’re all sitting here.

209
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:05,360
It’s okay.

210
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,679
Come now. Don’t be mad.

211
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,759
Leave me alone.

212
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,013
Sorry, buddy.

213
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:11,226
He’s so scary.

214
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,252
In this round,

215
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:18,249
let me remind you

216
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,939
to please listen to the rule carefully.

217
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,129
Think, analyze, and distinguish

218
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,379
the task in this exam thoroughly.

219
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,973
Remember that?

220
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
If you’re ready,

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,493
you may begin the exam.

222
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,973
Pheng?

223
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,970
I’ve realized that

224
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,640
after I lied to you all,

225
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:27,360
I shouldn’t have passed the exam in the first place.

226
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,946
I’m sorry, everyone.

227
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,573
Master Praeporn, I withdraw.

228
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,999
If you withdraw,

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,600
you will fail and lose the chance to contact your family.

230
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,600
Are you sure about this?

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,906
Yes.

232
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,746
I’m sure.

233
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,760
Pheng, you failed the exam.

234
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Good luck, everyone.

235
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,960
Everyone,

236
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,099
please remove the chairs

237
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,906
until there’s only one left.

238
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,639
Why keep only one?

239
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,346
Aren’t we supposed to keep four?

240
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:18,239
This is the last round of the exam.

241
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,986
In this round, there will only be one chair.

242
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:30,453
Does that mean only one will pass the exam?

243
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,739
Not necessarily.

244
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,306
More than one of you can pass the exam.

245
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,506
Let me remind you

246
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,400
to please listen to the rule carefully.

247
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,809
Think, analyze, and distinguish

248
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,853
the task in this exam thoroughly.

249
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,880
If you’re ready, ''

250
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,000
you may begin the exam.

251
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,933
Everyone, stop.

252
00:15:57,493 --> 00:15:58,933
What is it, Maki?

253
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,660
I want you all to stop

254
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,449
and think carefully about what Master keeps reminding us.

255
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,969
Why?

256
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,493
What about it?

257
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,173
Every time before we begin the exam,

258
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:15,706
Master reminds us about the task.

259
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,049
Every time.

260
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,973
Remember that?

261
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:20,899
Please listen to the rule carefully.

262
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,849
Think, analyze, and distinguish

263
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,959
the task in this exam thoroughly.

264
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Yes.

265
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,173
Master wants us to interpret the task we received

266
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:31,999
in order to pass the exam.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,133
She said that we may not necessarily pass alone.

268
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:38,853
What should we do?

269
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,850
There’s only one chair.

270
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,679
Master told us to find a space to sit

271
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,092
until the music stops.

272
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:56,786
Anyone who doesn’t have a space to sit when the music stops fails the exam.

273
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,680
And?

274
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,640
I don’t get it.

275
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,373
That’s right, Tibet.

276
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,973
Find a space to sit.

277
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,493
What are you doing, Maki?

278
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,599
Master didn’t say we can only sit on the chairs.

279
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,419
We can sit anywhere.

280
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,449
We just have to sit.

281
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,146
This is the way all of us can pass the exam.

282
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,759
Yes.

283
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,169
Maki is right.

284
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,973
The task is only for us to find a space to sit.

285
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,970
Well done.

286
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:08,969
Congratulations, kids.

287
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,970
All of you passed the exam.

288
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,649
Like I’ve been saying from the beginning,

289
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,539
if you think, analyze, and distinguish,

290
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,969
you’ll certainly pass the exam.

291
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:27,386
Remember that analyzing is the most basic foundation

292
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:29,200
of learning.

293
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,039
The last round of the exam

294
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,093
will take place in Master Amin’s office.

295
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,160
He will supervise your exam himself.

296
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,906
I wish you all good luck.

297
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:12,320
Congratulations to you all for getting to the last round.

298
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:15,609
This round is easy.

299
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,419
You just have to answer the challenge question that I will give you.

300
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,973
There will be only one question.

301
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,699
You will have one hour to find the answer.

302
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,453
You can do anything to find it

303
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,773
but you will only get one chance to answer.

304
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,020
If your answer is wrong, you fail the exam immediately.

305
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,573
If you have no questions,

306
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,213
you may begin the last round of the exam.

307
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,500
Master Amin,

308
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,319
there’s nothing here.

309
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,986
How can Pennhung answer when there’s no question?

310
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,049
That’s what you have to find an answer for.

311
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,929
The question is in the paper you’re holding.

312
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:32,779
Once you find the question, you will find the correct answer.

313
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,013
But, Master Amin.

314
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,729
This is a blank paper.

315
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,640
Yes.

316
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,306
I know.

317
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,000
It’s a problem you have to solve.

318
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:45,533
Don’t forget

319
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:51,346
that only the one who answers correctly will get the reward.

320
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:57,679
Alright.

321
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,699
You may split up to find the question and answer.

322
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,013
Meet back here in one hour.

323
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,049
What now?

324
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,743
This round is even harder than the previous ones.

325
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,293
At least, they gave us tasks before.

326
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,579
This time, we got nothing.

327
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,306
Master Amin said the question is in the paper.

328
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:48,866
We may have to find a way to make it appear.

329
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,859
Does anyone have a good idea?

330
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
This is the last round of the exam.

331
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,800
From now on, I think we all will have to be real competitors.

332
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,089
We must find the answer ourselves.

333
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,779
Do this separately?

334
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,412
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

335
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:10,559
I think we have a better chance of passing if we help each other.

336
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,969
I agree.

337
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,969
I think Master wants to teach us something in this exam.

338
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,039
We all got to this round

339
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
because we helped each other.

340
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:25,960
But in the end, only one will get the reward.

341
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,973
Only one will get to contact their family.

342
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,946
Alright then.

343
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,799
We’ll do it separately this time.

344
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,946
Whoever finds the answer deserves to contact their family.

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,940
What?

346
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,880
There’s nothing.

347
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,853
Alright.

348
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,320
Let’s do what they do in Harry Potter.

349
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There’s no mark on the paper at all.

350
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,293
It really is just a blank paper.

351
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,479
If it’s invisible ink,

352
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,000
the letters might be visible again when cooled.

353
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,746
Please let me guess right.

354
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,305
What are you doing with the candle, Pennhung?

355
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:28,299
During a science class when Pennhung was young,

356
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,303
the teacher asked Pennhung to do an experiment,

357
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,026
Invisible ink and lemon juice.

358
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,479
If we hold the paper close to the heat,

359
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,106
the letters will appear.

360
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,960
I knew this was not going to work.

361
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,973
Shit!

362
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:52,290
No!

363
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,290
It’s torn up!

364
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,859
Hey.

365
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,880
It’s burning.

366
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,986
My guess is wrong.

367
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,759
Students who are taking the last exam,

368
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,320
please gather in the exam room now.

369
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,009
Students who are taking the last exam,

370
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,173
please gather in the exam room now.

371
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,039
Students who are taking the last exam,

372
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,049
please gather in the exam room now.

373
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,733
Students who are taking the last exam,

374
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,000
please gather in the exam room now.

375
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,066
So?

376
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,360
Do you have an answer for me?

377
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,453
Do you, Pennhung?

378
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,733
Yes.

379
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,946
The answer is blank.

380
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Why do you think so?

381
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:44,009
Because there’s no question since the beginning

382
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,279
so no matter what way we try to find it,

383
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,000
we can’t find it.

384
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,649
That means it’s blank.

385
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,946
Pennhung’s answer is blank.

386
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:07,306
Your question and answer are wrong.

387
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:15,450
You failed the exam, Pennhung.

388
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,946
Please leave the exam room.

389
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,853
Since no one has the answer for me,

390
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,106
I will give you one more hour.

391
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,266
But remember,

392
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:49,773
once you find the question, you will find the correct answer.

393
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,705
He asked us to find the answer

394
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,699
but he gave us blank papers.

395
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,373
What exactly does he want?

396
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:03,739
I think those Masters are messing with our heads.

397
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,293
They know we want to contact our families

398
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:08,653
so they lured us with the phone.

399
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
The most annoying thing is

400
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,930
we all want to use the phone,

401
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:16,579
including me.

402
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,986
You do?

403
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,999
I thought you’re not on good terms with your aunt.

404
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,625
I will use it to call the police

405
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:23,120
to shut this place down

406
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,719
or call the reporters to come and expose this place

407
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,280
so we can be done with it.

408
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:32,452
Why are you guys laughing?

409
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,450
I’m very serious.

410
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,560
What about you, Nai?

411
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,010
Why do you want the reward?

412
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,320
I just want to know from my dad

413
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
why he sent me to this school.

414
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
And you, Tibet?

415
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:02,889
Why do you want the reward?

416
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,653
It seems like you really want to pass this exam.

417
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,453
I miss my mom.

418
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,680
She was a songwriter.

419
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,999
Since the day my dad passed away many years ago,

420
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,719
she became sick

421
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,266
and quite unhealthy.

422
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,059
Since then, she could never write a song again.

423
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,933
Drink some water, Mom.

424
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,146
I’ve been taking care of her all this time.

425
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,520
She’s everything to me.

426
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:03,960
Do you want to get some sleep?

427
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,613
I want to be a doctor because of her.

428
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,626
But suddenly one day,

429
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,733
she wanted me to join Home School.

430
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,369
I promise that if Tibet comes to Home School,

431
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,999
I will take care of all his tuition fees

432
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,960
until he graduates with the highest degree

433
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,200
as you and your husband wish.

434
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,819
Moreover, I will continue to support Tibet’s dreams

435
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,173
after you and your husband.

436
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,859
Thank you, Master Amin.

437
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,986
Now I just want to know how my mom is doing.

438
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,292
Is she able to eat?

439
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:14,290
Does she get a full night’s sleep?

440
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,980
I’m worried about her.

441
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:26,060
What about you, Maki?

442
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:29,100
Why do you want the reward?

443
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,840
Actually, I’m not hoping to get the reward

444
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,290
because even if I get it,

445
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,730
I have no one to call.

446
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,920
I’m an orphan.

447
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,746
I don’t have a father or a mother.

448
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,747
I don’t have anyone to miss.

449
00:31:56,173 --> 00:31:58,170
I don’t have anyone to worry about.

450
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,440
Then why are you taking the exam seriously?

451
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,733
I want to know what Master Amin is planning to do.

452
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
I want to know his intention.

453
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Why do you want to know?

454
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,730
No special reason.

455
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,980
I guess I just want to win.

456
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:30,450
How are you going to win?

457
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,506
There’s a way.

458
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:45,169
I think we should help each other find the answer.

459
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,292
At least, we’ll have a better chance of getting the reward

460
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:50,479
than when we tried separately earlier.

461
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,026
But there’s no point in helping each other.

462
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,213
Don’t forget that only one will get the reward.

463
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,825
Tibet, think about it.

464
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,819
Since the first round of the exam

465
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,493
until now,

466
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,059
we’ve passed them because we helped each other.

467
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,769
Don’t you think that might be what Master Amin is trying to tell us?

468
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,373
It seems like he's trying to teach us something in this exam.

469
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,440
What do you say, Tibet?

470
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,320
Alright.

471
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,400
Let’s try and help each other.

472
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,986
That’s it.

473
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,200
Let’s help each other.

474
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,333
Both of you are stubborn.

475
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:19,540
Why these blank papers?

476
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,906
Are they just a trick?

477
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,699
Master Amin said if we can find the question,

478
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,299
we’ll find the answer.

479
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,969
But there’s nothing on these papers.

480
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:38,533
Maybe the question has nothing to do with the papers.

481
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,569
I don’t think so.

482
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,939
Since we came here, the Masters have been trying to teach

483
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,359
and tell us things.

484
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,960
These blank papers must mean something.

485
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,173
Otherwise, why would he give them to us?

486
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,939
That’s just it.

487
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,769
Why the blank papers?

488
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,826
And he’s making us search for the question ourselves.

489
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:01,933
What does Master Amin want from us?

490
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,480
White,

491
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:13,370
you’re so right.

492
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,825
Why would Master Amin do this?

493
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,820
What does he want from us?

494
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,779
Isn’t that a question?

495
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,973
That’s it.

496
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,053
That’s the question missing from the papers.

497
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,919
If every exam is meant to be a lesson,

498
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,520
the only one who has the question is the Master himself.

499
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,419
Do you mean we should just hand these blank papers to Master Amin

500
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,133
and let him write the question down?

501
00:35:49,134 --> 00:35:50,173
Yes.

502
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,239
Are you sure, Tibet?

503
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,960
Just one wrong answer will make us fail the exam.

504
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,320
It doesn’t matter if the answer is right or wrong.

505
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,560
It matters that we help each other.

506
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:33,540
Do you know now

507
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,773
why you failed the exam?

508
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,779
You failed because you only cared about what you wanted.

509
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,879
You wanted to beat each other so much

510
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,529
that you forgot what the Masters were trying to teach you,

511
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,853
that you could help each other.

512
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,729
Remember,

513
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:14,360
as Home School students, all of you are friends.

514
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,013
You’re ready to answer, right?

515
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,199
Is this your answer?

516
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,426
Handing in blank papers?

517
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,973
Yes.

518
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:08,729
This is our answer.

519
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,093
Could you explain

520
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:13,893
why this is your answer?

521
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,719
Based on all the past exams,

522
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,179
the Masters kept emphasizing that

523
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,573
we should listen, think, analyze, and distinguish.

524
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:36,209
So we interpreted that these blank papers represent Home School students.

525
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:42,259
We get the questions and answers through learning from the Masters.

526
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:50,200
So we believe that our answer depends on what you want to teach us.

527
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:56,010
Good answer.

528
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,013
You understand the reason behind this exam correctly.

529
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,920
But this is not the end of the exam.

530
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,786
You will need to answer the question first.

531
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,466
The question for the last round is,

532
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,569
who deserves to get the reward?

533
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,000
You must discuss among yourselves who that is

534
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:35,000
because only one will get to contact their family.

535
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,653
But even though you’re friends,

536
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:57,066
you can’t always move forward together.

537
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,179
You must learn to sacrifice for others,

538
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,000
even if it means losing what you want.

539
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,649
We found the question together.

540
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,649
We deserve to get the reward together.

541
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,650
Why make us choose among ourselves?

542
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:26,019
I’ve told you this since the first round of the exam.

543
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,759
Only one will get to contact their family.

544
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,000
I’m not doing anything other than what I said at all.

545
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,506
Since only one will get the reward,

546
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,570
how about we vote?

547
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,466
Okay.

548
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,026
That’s the fairest way to go.

549
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,893
I vote for Tibet.

550
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,920
I want you to be able to contact your mom.

551
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,133
I vote for Tibet too.

552
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,932
We don’t need this as much as you do.

553
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:17,720
You deserve to contact the person you’re worried about.

554
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,946
Nai?

555
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,640
Who will you vote for?

556
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:29,293
Tibet.

557
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,946
You found the question.

558
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,760
You deserve the reward.

559
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,613
I vote for you.

560
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,609
We vote for Tibet.

561
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,373
He deserves to contact his family.

562
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Here’s your reward.

563
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,586
You get ten minutes to use it.

564
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:13,170
Please make the most of it.

565
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,720
If not everyone gets it,

566
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,520
I won’t get it.

567
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:39,219
Are you sure

568
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,440
you want to give up this opportunity that’s so hard to come by?

569
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:55,973
I got where I am because I have my friends.

570
00:42:58,053 --> 00:43:00,050
Everyone deserves the reward.

571
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:03,960
Good.

572
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:10,559
Then no one will get the reward in this exam.

573
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,449
But even though you won’t get it,

574
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,129
you should be proud of yourselves

575
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,693
for passing the exam.

576
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,439
This is the first time in Home School’s history

577
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,093
that we have this many students pass the exam.

578
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:35,939
I would like you all to keep improving yourselves.

579
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,386
Don’t stop learning new things.

580
00:43:39,973 --> 00:43:45,600
Remember that whenever you’re willing to listen,

581
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:53,960
you’ll understand what Home School is trying to tell you.

582
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:27,960
Master Amin,

583
00:44:28,386 --> 00:44:31,179
I’ve been informed by Master Prasath

584
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,329
that you ordered…

585
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,732
Yes.

586
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:35,730
I ordered it.

587
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,799
Master Amin, I would like you to reconsider

588
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,746
using that treatment with Run.

589
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:45,986
I’ve made my decision.

590
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,266
It’s the only way we can get Run back.

591
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,426
What if it’s life-threatening?

592
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,026
Doing that to Run could kill him.

593
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,746
I know what I’m doing

594
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:08,800
and I will take responsibility for it.

595
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:28,799
I should have voted for myself

596
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,426
so I could call the police.

597
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,159
Do you think Master Amin would let you make that call?

598
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,573
I think Master Amin had expected us to choose Tibet.

599
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,729
That means he didn’t plan to give us the reward in the first place, right?

600
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:46,979
That’s right.

601
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,599
I think so.

602
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,039
Still, it’s a waste of opportunity.

603
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,693
We managed to get to the last round

604
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,960
but got nothing.

605
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,889
Hey, we can’t say we got nothing.

606
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,693
We got to learn more about each other.

607
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,573
You’re right.

608
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,413
I think we all got the reward.

609
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,946
The reward called friendship.

610
00:47:42,546 --> 00:47:43,920
Maki,

611
00:47:44,186 --> 00:47:45,945
where are you going?

612
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,939
I have to follow the Masters.

613
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,105
Maki,

614
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:51,100
what’s going on?

615
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,280
I’m searching for my brother.

616
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,280
It’s the reason I came to study here.

617
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,946
Your brother?

618
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:06,900
You have a brother here?

619
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,586
Yes.

620
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
His name is Run.

621
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,733
He was a student here.

622
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:22,026
Run?

623
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,066
You mean GEN4’s Run?

624
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,186
Today was the first exam day for the GEN6 students.

625
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:08,746
One of them reminds me of you.

626
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:15,133
She passed with flying colors just like you did, Run.

627
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,946
I want you two to meet.

628
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,480
I think you’ll get along well.

629
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,493
Her name is Maki.

630
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:49,786
It’s time, Run.

631
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:11,969
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

632
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,059
Let go of me!

633
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,306
Do understand, Run.

634
00:50:14,307 --> 00:50:16,439
You must be cured.

635
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:16,960
Let go!

636
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:17,999
Where have they gone?

637
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,893
Don’t worry.

638
00:50:18,894 --> 00:50:19,945
We’ll have more chances.

639
00:50:19,946 --> 00:50:21,939
We’ll help each other find your brother.

640
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,899
All students are forbidden from having romantic relationships at Home School.

641
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,611
What kind of rule is that?

642
00:50:26,612 --> 00:50:27,573
It makes absolutely no sense.

643
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:30,254
You broke the 7th rule of Home School.

644
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:33,533
The key!
