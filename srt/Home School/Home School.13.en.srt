1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:05,242
I want you all to believe in what Home School is going to teach.

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:07,720
Run, you think you can stop Master Amin, right?

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,680
I can do it.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,320
I’ll help you escape from Home School.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,200
6 YEARS AGO

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,320
How was it, Run?

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,320
Did you just get punished?

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,960
Yes.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
I went to reflect on my mistake

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,520
as Master Prasath ordered.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,960
Studying at Home School isn’t easy at all, is it?

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,920
Yes.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,720
As you said, studying at Home School is really not easy.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,680
But I’ve heard several Masters praise Zero and you a lot

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,120
for scoring the highest among GEN4 students.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,520
But that still isn’t good enough.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,040
I’m afraid I’ll disappoint you.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
This is the first time I feel I’m a good-for-nothing.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,160
Don’t say that, Run.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,880
You have just started studying here.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,360
You have done well enough so far.

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,240
You’re a 16-year-old kid

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,680
who successfully learned how to hypnotize.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,120
To me, you’re very talented, Run.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,440
Master Amin,

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,440
thank you very much for believing in me.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,440
Amin.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,440
Hey, Amin!

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,800
What? Amin.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
Where is the wine that Lady Rata gave us?

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,520
Dad?

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,120
What brings you here?

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Run, I’m the owner of this place.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,560
It would be strange if I weren’t here.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Remember this.

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,840
As my adoptive son,

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,160
you must try to befriend that boy Zero as much as possible

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
because he’s the son of Lady Rata.

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,920
This family is minted.

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,960
Got it?

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,360
That’s difficult to do.

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,920
Zero loathes me.

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
How can it be difficult?

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,720
He’s a rich boy.

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,240
All you must do is spoil him.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
Take care of him and make him feel privileged,

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,280
and he will love you.

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,480
Don’t worry.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,880
One of our Home School rules says students must love each other.

50
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,080
Fine.

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
But I don’t give a shit about your rules.

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,560
Just make profits for me.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
By the way, where is the wine Lady Rata gave us?

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,720
I’m afraid keeping liquor inside the school is inappropriate.

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,080
School?

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,160
This is my home.

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
I’m the owner.

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
I have the right to.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,840
I can do whatever I want.

60
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,360
Where is my wine?

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,320
It’s in my office.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,200
It’s just as easy as that.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
What should we do now?

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,080
If we want to know what those Masters’ plan is,

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,480
we must pretend to go with the flow.

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,680
But this time, it’s scary.

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,440
We don’t know if someone will disappear again tomorrow.

68
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,600
Also, we have no clue what Masters are planning.

69
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
You’re right.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
They forced us to believe in what they said.

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
How could they even do that to us?

72
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,280
Why do adults like to do such a thing?

73
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,400
They just want us to believe in what they want

74
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,120
and follow what they find good.

75
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,440
But their definition of good is the standard they set on their own.

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,400
To you, is what Home School does good or bad?

77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,000
But I think, for some matters,

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,800
they have been trying to help us too.

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
To be honest,

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,520
I’m confused.

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,320
I sometimes wanted to believe them,

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,240
but their behaviors made it hard to do so.

83
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,280
That’s right.

84
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
It’s like they’re messing with our heads.

85
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,440
But I think

86
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,960
we definitely won’t agree with what Master Amin is planning to do.

87
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,800
It’s probably the reason why Run has been locked up.

88
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,240
But now, we don’t know where they have locked him up.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Is it possible that

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
they haven’t locked him up here?

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,560
No.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
I feel Run is here.

93
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Can I ask you something?

94
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,560
Why did you change your mind to help me?

95
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,000
It’s because Master Amin has changed.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
He’s no longer the person I used to know.

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Have you just realized that?

98
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
I have felt that since the day

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Master Amin ordered me to kill my adoptive dad.

100
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,360
But that’s what Mr. Bodin deserved.

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,200
No matter how terrible my adoptive dad was,

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,360
killing each other wasn’t the solution.

103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,080
Master Amin, whom I knew, would never use this solution.

104
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,905
Getting back at violence by using violence

105
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,184
will only turn us into a beast.

106
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Master Amin also said this to you, right?

107
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
He did.

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,080
In the past,

109
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,600
when I was bullied by my friends

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
and hurt by Dad,

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,520
Master Amin would often say this to me.

112
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,720
To your mind,

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
why has Master Amin changed this much?

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
His desire to take revenge, perhaps.

115
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
A vengeful feeling,

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,720
built up for long, can possibly change someone.

117
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
But how vengeful must he have felt

118
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
to deal with it in such a cruel way?

119
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
Who’s that?

120
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,920
Is it you, Maki?

121
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,720
Or is it you, Pheng?

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,120
Show yourself now!

123
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
I know you’ve been tailing me.

124
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
Will you show yourself or not?

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,840
I’ll hit you.

126
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,200
Show yourself already.

127
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
It’s you, Nai?

128
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,760
Why are you following me?

129
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,040
How should I explain it?

130
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,400
What?

131
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,920
Say it properly.

132
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,840
I’m worried about you.

133
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,120
You’re worried?

134
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,160
About what?

135
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I’m afraid you’ll disappear.

136
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
That’s why you’re following me?

137
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,760
Do you also want to sleep and guard me?

138
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
I’m thinking about doing that.

139
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
If Master couldn’t catch me,

140
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,800
I would sleep next to you.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Are you serious?

142
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,480
Uh-huh.

143
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
How about Maki, Pheng,

144
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,320
Pennhung, Tibet,

145
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
Mek and Mork?

146
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,280
Aren’t you following them too?

147
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,160
I can’t duplicate myself, can I?

148
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,360
That’s why I must follow the person

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,840
I’m most worried about.

150
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,160
I see.

151
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,000
Next time, don’t tail me.

152
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,200
Got it?

153
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
If you want to accompany me

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
or walk me to my room,

155
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,840
just tell me frankly.

156
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
Okay.

157
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Are we holding hands?

158
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,400
Is it a good idea?

159
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Do you even have to hold my hand?

160
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,120
Your lamp.

161
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,400
I’ll hold it for you.

162
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,560
Whoa.

163
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,320
You’re such a gentleman.

164
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,880
Incredible.

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,800
What a gentleman.

166
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,000
That’s nice.

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,720
What?

168
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Those Masters have disappeared again.

169
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,240
I guess they’re going inside the forest.

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,880
Should we tail them?

171
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,760
We don’t have to.

172
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,720
That won’t be helpful.

173
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
We’ll end up getting caught anyway.

174
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Those Masters won’t allow us to go inside the forest easily.

175
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
But it’s also our chance.

176
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
What chance?

177
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
Our chance to get into Master Amin’s office.

178
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,760
Maki, what are we searching for?

179
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,120
Anything that could be a clue about what happened to Run.

180
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,000
I’ve been searching all over Home School,

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
but I’ve found no clue about him.

182
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,120
This is the only room I haven’t got to search around yet.

183
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
Do you really think

184
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,600
Master Amin has locked Run up in this room?

185
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,920
Someone like Master Amin probably thinks

186
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,640
the safest place is the nearest place.

187
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,120
Do you think

188
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,200
there’s something like a secret door in his office?

189
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,480
Tibet, that’s possible.

190
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
This is Home School.

191
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
You’re right.

192
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey, help me look around.

193
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,200
I…

194
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,120
What is it?

195
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,960
I think I’ve found something.

196
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,200
Eh?

197
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,200
Hurry inside.

198
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,840
Your brother is probably in there.

199
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,840
What are you doing in my room?

200
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
Maki?

201
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,200
This is seriously against the rule.

202
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
What’s inside?

203
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,000
That has nothing to do with you.

204
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,400
Get out.

205
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,720
You have locked Run up in there, right?

206
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,280
I said, get out.

207
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,240
We’re sorry for sneaking in.

208
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,960
Please feel free to punish us in whatever way you want, Master Amin.

209
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,880
But please tell us the truth already.

210
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,360
The truth?

211
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
The truth is

212
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,120
there’s nothing in that room,

213
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,200
apart from being your adoptive dad’s secret room.

214
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,960
My adoptive dad?

215
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,920
Dad Bodin?

216
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Did he come here before?

217
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,440
This house belongs to your dad.

218
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,360
Bodin is the owner of Home School.

219
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,440
Get out!

220
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,760
What did Maki and Tibet do last night?

221
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,960
Why are they being punished?

222
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,760
I’m curious too.

223
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,320
What did they do?

224
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,960
Or did they tail those Masters?

225
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Or they probably found something.

226
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,760
Come on, Tibet.

227
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
You didn’t ask me to go with you.

228
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Where are Mek and Mork, by the way?

229
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,080
They’re running in the forest with Master Champ.

230
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,400
Are they being punished?

231
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,960
Yes.

232
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,320
Master Champ saw Mek and Mork steal Pennhung’s croissants.

233
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
Wow. That sounds like a big deal.

234
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,680
Mek and Mork just stole croissants,

235
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,160
but the punishment for them is even running in the forest.

236
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,320
So will Maki and Tibet be alright?

237
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,080
Won’t the punishment be even more severe?

238
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,240
I think they’re kneeling down, reflecting on their mistake

239
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,920
at the Tree of Remorse.

240
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,800
The Tree of Remorse?

241
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,600
Just hearing its name already scares me.

242
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,720
How come you have an appetite?

243
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Aren’t you worried about our friends?

244
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Pennhung is worried about them.

245
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,320
But it seems you really enjoy eating croissants.

246
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,960
It doesn’t look like you’re worried.

247
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,440
Pennhung hides it inside.

248
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,200
Pennhung sees that Pheng looks really worried,

249
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,920
so Pennhung wants to make Pheng feel at ease.

250
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Thank you, Pennhung.

251
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,040
Good afternoon, kids.

252
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,320
Do you need anything, Master Prasath?

253
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,720
Nothing.

254
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,000
I just want to watch you.

255
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,840
Watch what?

256
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,240
You guys.

257
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,880
Why? Can’t I?

258
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,600
Are you hiding something from me?

259
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Hmm?

260
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,320
No.

261
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,680
Nothing.

262
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,520
Nothing?

263
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
I’ll keep watching you then.

264
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,680
Master Prasath,

265
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,280
do you want something from us?

266
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,760
I clearly told you what I want.

267
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,640
You remind me of the wonderer kid.

268
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Wonderer kid?

269
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,120
What is it?

270
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,240
Hardly had I spoken when you asked another question.

271
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,600
Pennhung and Pheng want to know

272
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,080
why you’re doing this, Master.

273
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,400
Why are you kids so full of curiosity?

274
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
You keep asking questions.

275
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,040
It’s because adults like to behave suspiciously.

276
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,760
Right.

277
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
You’re right.

278
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,440
Well then,

279
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
if you feel annoyed,

280
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
I’ll leave now.

281
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,960
I won’t watch you anymore.

282
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,120
I changed my mind already.

283
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,240
I want to play a game with you two.

284
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,240
What game?

285
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,960
Coin guessing.

286
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,800
It’s easy.

287
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,720
Just guess if it’s A or B.

288
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,640
What do we get if we guess it correctly?

289
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,920
Why are you such a curious kid?

290
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,000
But Pennhung wants to know

291
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,400
what the purpose of this coin guessing thing is.

292
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
Well then,

293
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
you must guess it correctly.

294
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,320
Well, I’ll go with A.

295
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,120
Whoa.

296
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,760
You guessed it correctly.

297
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Look.

298
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,120
So what do I get?

299
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
You’ll get to eat this popcorn.

300
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,080
What if we guess it wrongly?

301
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,960
Just try getting the wrong answer.

302
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,040
Maki, hang in there.

303
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
Um. I’m alright.

304
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,200
Are you, Tibet?

305
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,960
Um.

306
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,400
Please continue feeling remorseful for your action.

307
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,960
You’re not allowed to talk.

308
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,120
How long are you going to keep punishing us?

309
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
We’ve been here overnight.

310
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,400
Until you feel remorseful.

311
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,880
Are we wrong because we want to find out the truth?

312
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Since Master Amin mentioned that

313
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,240
it’s not yet time for you to learn the truth,

314
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,640
that means you’re still not ready to face it.

315
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,400
How could you judge that we aren’t ready?

316
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
I don’t need to answer your question.

317
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,880
You’re being punished.

318
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,560
Learn to be remorseful for your action.

319
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,440
It seems you really trust Master Amin.

320
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
Whatever he asks you to do,

321
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
you agree to follow.

322
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,080
Have you ever questioned him?

323
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,720
You don’t know Master Amin

324
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,200
the way I do.

325
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,400
So what kind of person is Master Amin, whom you know?

326
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,520
He’s better than Bodin, your adoptive dad.

327
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:30,440
How did Master Amin and Dad start Home School together?

328
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,120
How much longer will it take

329
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,400
for the kids to be ready for Project R?

330
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
Master Amin,

331
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,680
we can still stop now.

332
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,520
Why must we stop, Master Praeporn?

333
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,680
There’s a better way to take revenge.

334
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,080
I don’t need a good way.

335
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,160
I want to take revenge to get this into their heads,

336
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
so that it won’t happen again.

337
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Do you still remember

338
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,800
how Home School started?

339
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,600
Anyway.

340
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Make sure everything is ready, Master Praeporn.

341
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,840
No matter what,

342
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,720
Project R must continue.

343
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,800
Leave now.

344
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,440
You’re now ready to start the new game, aren’t you?

345
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,200
But I’m sure you won’t let me join this game.

346
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
That’s a regret.

347
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,560
I want to see you play this game with your sister.

348
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,680
How could we get to this point, Master Amin?

349
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,240
It’s the point where you and I must kill each other.

350
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
Do you know

351
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,520
how Home School was started?

352
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
I guess it was founded because

353
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,440
you wanted to take revenge on my adoptive dad.

354
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,000
No.

355
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,800
Not at all, Run.

356
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:22,480
Home School started because of love.

357
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,000
Since you and I are turning enemies,

358
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,400
I’ll tell you about the start of Home School.

359
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,440
It started here

360
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
in this room.

361
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,960
(The room you’re in now was once)

362
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,280
(the shelter room for Bodin, your adoptive dad.)

363
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,800
(It’s where he hid when the master hurt him.)

364
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,160
Why are you so late?

365
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,560
Did my dad already leave home?

366
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,960
He left quite a while ago.

367
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,373
Don’t tell anyone about this.

368
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:47,184
If anyone finds out, you’re dead.

369
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,360
Sure, Mr. Bodin. I’m just one of the orphans

370
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
you provided a place to live for.

371
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,240
I won’t be ungrateful.

372
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,720
You’re right. Remember this. You’re serving me.

373
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,800
I own your life.

374
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Don’t betray me.

375
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,080
Got it?

376
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
When my dad dies,

377
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,960
everything in this house will become mine. If you treat me well,

378
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
I’ll take care of you

379
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,320
even better than how my dad does.

380
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,840
Sure, Mr. Bodin.

381
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
This is what this world is like.

382
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,046
You must learn to take care of and spoil the person who’s superior,

383
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:49,584
and one day, that person will take care of you in return.

384
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Look at my dad.

385
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,040
He takes good care of and spoils every orphan here.

386
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,640
But he keeps slapping and hitting me.

387
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,078
(It might seem Bodin was pitiful,)

388
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:08,422
(but, in fact, Bodin was as brutal)

389
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:13,088
(as the master, his dad, was to him.)

390
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,080
You can’t? Huh?

391
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,360
It’s just searching for bananas in the forest,

392
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,280
but you can’t do it?

393
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,040
Hey? Are you crying already? How could you call yourself a man?

394
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,920
Huh? Answer!

395
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,400
Come!

396
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,720
Why are you quiet?

397
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,880
Hey? I asked you, so you must answer! Answer my question!

398
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,680
Are you crazy? What? Don’t you know bananas? Why can’t you find them?

399
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,640
What? Say it. Do you know bananas? Answer!

400
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,880
Hey.

401
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,013
Are you still reading?

402
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,700
You already graduated. Why are you still reading?

403
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,900
I think reading books and learning are endless.

404
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:10,880
There’s always new knowledge for us to learn.

405
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,680
What are you talking about? I don’t get it.

406
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,480
Why are you reading it? To make you smarter?

407
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:29,211
You’ll end up serving me anyway.

408
00:29:29,674 --> 00:29:33,064
You’d better spend your time spoiling me.

409
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,240
You’re an orphan without parents,

410
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,156
and nobody is willing to bring you up,

411
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:56,078
so you must find your own way to get by.

412
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:58,208
You can’t learn this from any book.

413
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,480
Noted, Mr. Bodin.

414
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,400
I’ll keep this in mind.

415
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,680
Hey.

416
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,600
Don’t make it too hard.

417
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,800
I’m bruised there. Move up.

418
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,360
(Throughout my living here,)

419
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,000
(I was both a friend and a servant to him.)

420
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,638
(But I also got to learn that a person’s trait can be passed on)

421
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:29,584
(by how he was brought up.)

422
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
Alright.

423
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,880
Whose birthday is on Monday?

424
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,160
Are you soulmates?

425
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,720
Let’s start.

426
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,920
Two times one equals two.

427
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,360
Two times two equals four. Two times three equals six.

428
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,915
Two times four equals eight.

429
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,946
Two times five equals ten.

430
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,280
Two times six equals twelve.

431
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,335
Two times seven equals fourteen.

432
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,350
Two times eight equals sixteen.

433
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,524
Two times nine equals eighteen.

434
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:01,618
Two times ten equals twenty.

435
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:02,720
Two times eleven equals twenty two.

436
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,240
Two times twelve equals twenty-four.

437
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,960
Great job.

438
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,415
Are you hungry? Is anyone hungry?

439
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,000
-Some snacks, please. -Snacks?

440
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,520
Does anyone want to eat some snacks? Whoa. You’re raising both hands.

441
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:21,411
Drinks.

442
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:22,615
Orange juice.

443
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
Hey, Amin. Come here.

444
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,600
This is Pinya, my fiancée.

445
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,520
From now,

446
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,520
you must take good care of her. Got it? Sure, Mr. Bodin.

447
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,560
Please take care of me, Amin.

448
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,280
(But one thing Bodin said is right.)

449
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,640
What were you doing?

450
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,360
I was teaching the kids to memorize the multiplication table.

451
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,757
All of them did a great job.

452
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,640
(People’s lives aren’t equal.)

453
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,680
I taught them myself. I’m glad you praised them.

454
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,240
(The person who’s richer and more well-heeled is always given a chance)

455
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
(to reach for something good before others.)

456
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,440
(Pinya was also a victim of social disparity.)

457
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,625
(Her family forced an arranged marriage on her)

458
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,944
(in exchange for a large sum of money.)

459
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,160
Amin, wait.

460
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,400
Can you keep me company?

461
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,600
What makes you feel uncomfortable, Ms. Pinya?

462
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,400
Several things, Amin.

463
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,360
I feel my life is in jail.

464
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,160
Since birth,

465
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,000
my parents have treated me as if they’re detainers.

466
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Whatever they order me to do,

467
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,200
I must agree to,

468
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,760
or else, they will call me ungrateful.

469
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,320
Ms. Pinya,

470
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,080
I have something interesting for you to try.

471
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Would you like to try playing it?

472
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,880
What is it?

473
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,520
Please show your hands.

474
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,160
Yes. Like this.

475
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,360
Now, fist your right hand,

476
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,760
and open your left hand.

477
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
Like this? Yes. That’s correct.

478
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,320
Now, please close your eyes.

479
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,040
Ms. Pinya, please carefully listen to what I say

480
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,120
and imagine.

481
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,680
Please imagine that

482
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,120
you’re holding a balloon in your right hand.

483
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,640
That balloon is gigantic.

484
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,120
It is gigantic,

485
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:21,360
and it keeps pulling your hand up. It keeps going up.

486
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,720
At the same time,

487
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I’ll place a rock,

488
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,080
which is very heavy, on your left hand.

489
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,160
The balloon in your right hand keeps getting bigger.

490
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,000
It’s getting bigger.

491
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
You feel comfortable

492
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
as your hand moves up.

493
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
You feel freest.

494
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,720
But on your left hand,

495
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,040
I’m putting more rocks.

496
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,720
One more.

497
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,720
Two more.

498
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,120
I keep adding them.

499
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,080
It’s getting heavier.

500
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,960
Heavier.

501
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,080
Heavier.

502
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,600
Open your eyes.

503
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
How could you do that, Amin?

504
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,360
It’s like you’re using magic.

505
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,880
It’s not magic.

506
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,000
It’s called hypnosis.

507
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,760
Hypnosis?

508
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,880
It’s when we order our brain or subconscious to follow what we say.

509
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,466
When you believe, you will automatically follow what is said,

510
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:53,904
without knowing,

511
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,360
just like how you just did.

512
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,800
Amin, can you do another type of hypnosis?

513
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,000
Which one?

514
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:21,280
Hypnotize us to love someone.

515
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
When it comes to love,

516
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,440
we can’t do that.

517
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,200
Sadly,

518
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,920
we can’t force our own heart.

519
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,120
Are you really going to marry Mr. Bodin?

520
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,120
I must marry Bodin.

521
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
And will you be happy?

522
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,800
You don’t need to marry someone you don’t love.

523
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
If it’s just because your family ordered you to,

524
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,000
you mustn’t do it.

525
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,720
Amin, do you know what my dream is?

526
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
I don’t know.

527
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,320
My dream is to become a mother.

528
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,440
I want to have kids

529
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and my own family.

530
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,120
That’s why I believe

531
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,760
I can be happy with my marriage life

532
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,800
though I don’t love him.

533
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,240
But I will love my child the best I can.

534
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,480
(But sometimes,)

535
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
(this world is cruel to us.)

536
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,464
(It doesn’t give us a chance)

537
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:23,224
(to follow our dream.)

538
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
Stop!

539
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,280
Let go of me!

540
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
I don’t want to argue with you. It hurts.

541
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,685
You have no right to walk away from me. Got it?

542
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,400
I don’t want to argue with you, Bodin.

543
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,280
Let go of me.

544
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,360
Let go of me, Bodin.

545
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,080
It hurts.

546
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,680
Let go! Let go of me!

547
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,800
Let go!

548
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,720
Let go!

549
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,080
I’m sorry.

550
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,680
Why don’t you listen to me?

551
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,880
I told you, didn’t I? I told you already, didn’t I?

552
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,880
Answer me! I told you, but why didn’t you listen?

553
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,084
Didn’t you remember it?

554
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:08,904
I talked to you about this already, didn’t I? Huh?

555
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,600
Why didn’t you get this into your head? Ouch!

556
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,600
Ms. Pinya!

557
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,640
Ms. Pinya!

558
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,320
Ms. Pinya!

559
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
My baby.

560
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,680
My baby.

561
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,200
My baby.

562
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,440
My baby!

563
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,360
My baby!

564
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
My baby!

565
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,200
It’s getting dark.

566
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
You’d better take some rest inside, Ms. Pinya.

567
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,280
Not yet.

568
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
I want to continue watching these kids play for a while.

569
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,680
You don’t have to tolerate staying here.

570
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,400
If you want to get out of here,

571
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
I’ll help you.

572
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
I don’t want to go anywhere.

573
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
I want to stay here.

574
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,320
But… This is the only place I can still be a mother to the kids.

575
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,080
I’m sorry

576
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,200
that I can’t help you with anything.

577
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
I hope that

578
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,520
one day this place will turn into a school,

579
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
a home,

580
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,440
and a true family for these kids.

581
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,520
All the kids who were abandoned,

582
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,480
having no parents,

583
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,760
must be provided with love

584
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,560
and good education.

585
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,920
All of them must be safe

586
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,000
and won’t be hurt by others anymore.

587
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,680
I will name this place Home School.

588
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,880
It’s a school that feels like home.

589
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,600
I’ll help you, Ms. Pinya.

590
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,240
We’ll establish it.

591
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
We’ll establish Home School

592
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,120
to be a home for the kids.

593
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,320
Ms. Pinya, are you alright?

594
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,120
I’m alright.

595
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,160
I’m just having a mild headache.

596
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,480
Let’s go inside and take some rest.

597
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,080
Ms. Pinya!

598
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,560
Ms. Pinya!

599
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,774
(I’m enraged by the world that has designed the society)

600
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:11,824
(to force and torture the poor,)

601
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,480
(who are reaching a dead end.)

602
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,640
(But what I hate the most is)

603
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,080
(the human who hurts their family members.)

604
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,960
(And this was how Home School started.)

605
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,480
1991

606
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,360
Did you ask for me, Mr. Bodin?

607
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,080
Take a seat. I have something to talk to you about.

608
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,800
It’s alright.

609
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,560
I’m selling this house.

610
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,960
But it’s master’s order before he passed away that… So what?

611
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,960
My dad died already.

612
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,640
I don’t want to continue running this orphanage.

613
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,624
Doing it won’t earn me money.

614
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:26,657
I have no reason to keep it either.

615
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:29,088
I’d better sell it for some profits.

616
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,760
But this house belongs to Ms. Pinya and you. It’s just a house.

617
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,680
From now,

618
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,120
you can either continue living with me,

619
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,120
or go live on your own.

620
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,120
But if you need anything, let me know.

621
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,880
I’ll help.

622
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,720
I know you have no money.

623
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,680
How about changing this place to a school

624
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,160
for abandoned kids? Amin.

625
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:09,040
I’m a businessman. I won’t do something that doesn’t earn money.

626
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,040
How about making it a special school

627
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,040
for troublesome kids from wealthy families?

628
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,880
A school for kids whom their parents and families don’t want.

629
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,240
In exchange for sending their kids to study here,

630
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,746
these rich families will pay a large sum of tuition fee.

631
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,520
Continue.

632
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,680
We will change this place to a boarding school

633
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,720
and take care of our students using a special curriculum.

634
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
We will change them into new kids

635
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,840
the way their parents want.

636
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,840
How can you change them?

637
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,600
I’ll use hypnotherapy.

638
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,760
I’ll change both their behaviors and mindsets.

639
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,720
That sounds interesting.

640
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,680
Are you sure you can do it?

641
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,200
I am.

642
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,000
I will make it successful.

643
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,920
Are you sure it can make profits for me?

644
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
I want to return your favor, Mr. Bodin.

645
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,240
I’ll make you richer than you have been.

646
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,080
Deal.

647
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,840
How talented you are. Way to go.

648
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,840
(Bodin never knew that)

649
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,000
(the real purpose of Home School is)

650
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,080
(to take revenge on the world)

651
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,579
(for creating a distorted and unequal society)

652
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:18,384
(and for creating a beast hidden in a family.)

653
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,720
(After that, I spent several years experimenting,)

654
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,720
(gathering crews and designing a new curriculum.)

655
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,720
And finally,

656
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,240
Home School you’ve seen now, has been successfully founded.

657
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,800
Did Dad adopt me because of the woman called Pinya?

658
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,480
No.

659
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,240
If Bodin thought that,

660
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,840
he would never hurt your sister and you.

661
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,960
So why did he adopt me?

662
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,440
He adopted your sister and you to put on a front.

663
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,920
So you wanted me to kill him because of this, right?

664
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,680
But you told me this, didn’t you?

665
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,680
If we get back at violence by using violence,

666
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,080
in the end, we’ll turn into a beast.

667
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,120
My thought has changed

668
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,960
since I’ve found out that I’m dying.

669
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:59,360
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

670
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,280
Are we doing the right thing?

671
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,960
There’s nothing right if we want to take revenge.

672
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,560
Mek, Mork!

673
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,960
Home School has changed. They aren’t teaching us anymore.

674
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,960
If we get back at violence by using violence,

675
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,897
in the end, we’ll turn into a beast.

676
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:16,218
What will you do to the thing you hate?

677
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:17,720
We’ll fight with you, Masters!

678
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,720
You must escape from Home School now.

679
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,680
Master Praeporn,

680
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,640
I will stop Master Amin.
