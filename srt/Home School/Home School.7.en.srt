1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,199
As long as the music is still playing,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,186
you can either start again or remain sitting.

3
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:07,419
Only one will get the reward.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,263
I think those Masters are messing with our heads.

5
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:11,812
I'm searching for my brother.

6
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,559
It's the reason I came to study here.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,106
I would like you to reconsider

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,239
using that treatment with Run.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,626
It's the only way we can get Run back.

10
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,439
Get up carefully, Run.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,186
Be careful.

12
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,186
Come.

13
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:52,493
Walk carefully.

14
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:53,579
Let go of me.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,453
I told you to let go of me.

16
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,866
Let go of me!

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,120
Let go of me!

18
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,252
Let go!

19
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,250
I said, let go of me.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,559
Masters, what are you doing to me?

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,249
Set me free.

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,746
I told you to set me free.

23
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:33,419
Set me free.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,080
Don't be scared, Run.

25
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:37,650
You're in the treatment room now.

26
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,169
What treatment?

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,729
I'm not crazy!

28
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,179
I'm not sick!

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,499
Set me free.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,569
I told you to set me free.

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,544
Please.

32
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:47,639
Run, please do understand that

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,539
we're helping you.

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,946
You must be cured.

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,039
Set me free.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,049
Set me free!

37
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,906
Set me free.

38
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,400
Set me free now!

39
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:11,810
Set me free!

40
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:25,946
Run?

41
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,440
Do you mean GEN4's Run?

42
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,720
Run disappeared six years ago.

43
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,786
I think Masters have something to do with this.

44
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:43,540
I'm sure Run has been caught

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,800
and locked up somewhere in this school.

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,506
But I have no clue where he is.

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,760
How can you be sure your brother is here?

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,466
The last time I met him,

49
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,533
he told me

50
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,933
not to come to Home School.

51
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,626
That's why I believe Run is here.

52
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,213
Home School is hiding something.

53
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,080
Run must be locked up somewhere in Home School.

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,533
But tailing them like this is too risky, isn't it?

55
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,306
I'm willing to risk.

56
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,973
I must find my brother no matter what.

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,306
Hey. Let's hide.

58
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,826
I think you can't catch those Masters up now.

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,520
If you continue walking, you may be caught.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,520
I know

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
you're disappointed.

62
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
But I promise

63
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:50,090
I'll help you search for your brother.

64
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,986
Hey.

65
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:01,120
Do you really believe what I told you about Run?

66
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,540
Uh-huh.

67
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:09,813
I believe you.

68
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:21,400
But let's go back for now.

69
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,539
Today, I'm assigning you an easy assignment to complete.

70
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,613
You must write a report about the history of chemistry

71
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,779
and analyze how it is important to the world.

72
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,999
In our next lesson,

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,693
you'll be exchanging your ideas in front of the class.

74
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200
Master,

75
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,065
whenever you say it's easy,

76
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,060
it never is.

77
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,746
If you think it's difficult, it will be difficult.

78
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,360
If you think it's easy, it will be easy.

79
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,799
You must work in pairs on this assignment.

80
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,906
You can pair up with the friend sitting next to you.

81
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,619
But since there are 13 of you,

82
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,693
there will be one group with three members.

83
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,920
Biw, will you pair up with me?

84
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,039
Mek, Mork,

85
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,759
let me join you.

86
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,400
Alright. Sure.

87
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Pennhung doesn't have a pair.

88
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,320
Pheng, do you want to work with Pennhung?

89
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,460
Sure.

90
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,506
Thank you.

91
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,499
Well,

92
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,373
why did you thank me?

93
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,440
I just wanted to.

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,480
Thank you as well.

95
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,305
Since everyone has already paired up,

96
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,300
see you next class.

97
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,090
Jingjai, wait for me.

98
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,089
What will you do next

99
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,160
about Run?

100
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,266
I probably have to find a way to tail those Masters.

101
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,800
I'll go with you.

102
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,920
You don't have to, Tibet.

103
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,820
I don't want to put you in trouble.

104
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,653
I will go.

105
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,866
I already gave you the promise

106
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,346
that I'd help.

107
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,653
Do you think there's something going on between them?

108
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,506
I don't know.

109
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,892
You're close with Tibet, aren't you?

110
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,600
Hasn't he told you about it?

111
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,280
Well, I don't like meddling in other people's business.

112
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,419
Did you just insult me?

113
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,733
I didn't.

114
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,129
I was just saying

115
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,463
I don't like meddling in other people's business.

116
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:46,853
How did that insult you?

117
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,506
Whoa.

118
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,439
Has anyone ever told you that

119
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,519
you like to get on others' nerves?

120
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Some did,

121
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,706
but I already trampled them to death.

122
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:58,880
Wow. You did?

123
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,529
Are you that strong?

124
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,889
Wanna fight?

125
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,760
Bring it on!

126
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,026
Let me knock you out once.

127
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,010
Ow!

128
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,889
That was close.

129
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,419
Hey!

130
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,533
Why is your arm so long?

131
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,969
You can't reach me.

132
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,059
Tibet.

133
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,559
Maki. Help me.

134
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,746
You're teasing me.

135
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:26,139
That was close.

136
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,120
You couldn't reach my face.

137
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,104
Ow!

138
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:28,784
That was close.

139
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:29,480
You almost reached it.

140
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,546
Tibet!

141
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,413
Since I'm walking you to your room,

142
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,399
you must dream about me tonight.

143
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,399
Why must I dream about you?

144
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,599
What?

145
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,186
Why?

146
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,493
It's you who must dream about me.

147
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,773
What are you two doing?

148
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,519
Nothing, Master.

149
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,099
Hugo,

150
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,959
you aren't supposed to be here.

151
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,320
Return to your bedroom now.

152
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,653
I'll dream about you tonight, Jingjai.

153
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,279
Since other Masters and I have been observing your behaviors closely,

154
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,373
we have agreed to add one more rule.

155
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
This is the 7th rule.

156
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,169
All students are forbidden

157
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,360
from having romantic relationships at Home School.

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,013
Hey?

159
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,292
What kind of rule is that?

160
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,839
It makes absolutely no sense.

161
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,169
Be frank with us.

162
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,466
How could you add the rule in the middle of the term?

163
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,106
Does a romantic relationship also include

164
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,299
no affair?

165
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,520
Hey, Mek.

166
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,146
You're just...

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,809
Headmaster, I don't get it.

168
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,092
Previously, you taught us to love each other.

169
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:29,089
Now we're doing that,

170
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,599
but you then forbid us.

171
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,306
What do you really want us to do?

172
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,679
The kind of love Home School is trying to teach you is

173
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,519
the friendship among friends that will never be destroyed.

174
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,519
It's not teens' rough and temporary love

175
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,226
some of you are developing.

176
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,320
I think the new rule is totally nonsense.

177
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,859
Can we stop others from liking or loving someone?

178
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,969
Only those fuddy-duddies establish such a rule.

179
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,013
What right do they have to forbid us?

180
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,689
You're right.

181
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,929
There are only few of us here.

182
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,452
If we don't hook up among ourselves,

183
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:23,449
then who?

184
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,079
I'm telling you,

185
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,419
I'm thinking about dating every man in our Gen.

186
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,186
Let's see if those Masters can stop me.

187
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,252
You're saying it like

188
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,250
all of them will agree to date you.

189
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,839
It can't hurt to try.

190
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,373
I'm deciding who I should start dating first.

191
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,226
How about Nai?

192
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,546
But Tibet is also an interesting choice.

193
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:51,239
Those two look arrogant.

194
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,559
It's challenging for me.

195
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,906
I think they must be tasty.

196
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,320
Oops. Do I sound too greedy?

197
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,426
Jingjai, but you're dating Hugo, aren't you?

198
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,199
We're just in the talking stage.

199
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,172
It's not a serious relationship.

200
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:13,279
He's like a makeshift light meal

201
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I can eat when my stomach is empty.

202
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,039
To be honest,

203
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,426
I don't want to have a serious relationship with anyone.

204
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,493
Jingjai,

205
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,946
do you know you're behaving like those jerks?

206
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,159
Fuji, why are you serious about it?

207
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,600
I don't like those who behave like my dad.

208
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,933
I'm not your dad.

209
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:47,259
What? What's wrong with you?

210
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,626
Are you on your period or what?

211
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,560
Jingjai, go get the second book for me.

212
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,639
Jingjai.

213
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,960
I told you to bring me the second book.

214
00:16:20,453 --> 00:16:22,450
Hey, did you hear what I said?

215
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,839
What did you say?

216
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,399
I said,

217
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,819
bring me the second book.

218
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,720
Do that yourself.

219
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,879
Jingjai, this is a pair assignment.

220
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,092
It's not an individual work.

221
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,090
You should help me.

222
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:40,899
Well, I'm not available.

223
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
I have a mission to complete.

224
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,080
I'm sorry.

225
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,339
You're so freaking useless.

226
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,826
You're only obsessed about men all day, aren't you?

227
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,026
What did you say?

228
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,289
I told you

229
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,129
your brain is trash.

230
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,920
You're only obsessed about men.

231
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,411
Fuji!

232
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:07,519
What's so damn wrong with you?

233
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,106
You insulted me all of a sudden.

234
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:10,533
Look at you.

235
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,412
Last night, I thought I wouldn't talk to you about this,

236
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:15,409
but I think I can't stand you any longer.

237
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,609
Be honest with me.

238
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,026
Are you that horny?

239
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,439
Whether I'm horny or not is my business.

240
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,439
Why are you being freaking nosy?

241
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,019
I loathe someone like you.

242
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,249
Does your family know you're behaving like this?

243
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,579
Shut your mouth.

244
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
I won't.

245
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,906
You're such an attention-seeker.

246
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,625
Are you an unloved child or what?

247
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,620
Your parents don't love you, do they?

248
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,019
I told you to shut up!

249
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,663
What do you know about me?!

250
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,079
You have no right to mention my family, Fuji.

251
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,640
You crazy bitch!

252
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,371
A crazy bitch you are!

253
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:52,372
Let go of me!

254
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,639
You are!

255
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,253
You are!

256
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,279
Stop already!

257
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,613
Stop!

258
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,009
Don't fight.

259
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,479
Pennhung doesn't like it.

260
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,451
Don't fight.

261
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:02,173
- Pennhung doesn't like it. - Let go of me.

262
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:02,840
It's none of your business!

263
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,706
White!

264
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,773
Pennhung doesn't like it.

265
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,529
Can you not fight?!

266
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,760
Pennhung doesn't like it.

267
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,449
Pennhung, relax.

268
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,612
Calm down, Pennhung.

269
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:12,613
Pennhung doesn't like it.

270
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:14,053
Stop now.

271
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,226
If you don't, you will be punished

272
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,679
by being locked up alone!

273
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,859
Don't fight!

274
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,333
Pennhung.

275
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,906
Dad,

276
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,293
why did you bring me here?

277
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,333
To see your mom.

278
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
What?

279
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Miw.

280
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,533
Come here.

281
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,413
Mom.

282
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,426
This is your mom's true color.

283
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,409
Your mom is promiscuous.

284
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,410
She's unfaithful!

285
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,939
I gave you everything,

286
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,279
including fame and wealth.

287
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,652
How could you do this to me?

288
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,650
You cheated on me!

289
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,106
Dad!

290
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,259
Enough, Dad!

291
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,739
Don't hurt her.

292
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,413
Just keep siding with her.

293
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,493
You both are ungrateful.

294
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,559
Mom.

295
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,853
Are you alright?

296
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,253
It's alright.

297
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,573
Jingjai, let go of me.

298
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,139
Did I touch you too hard?

299
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,893
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,491
Ball.

301
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:12,106
Mom.

302
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:13,839
Open the door for me, Ball.

303
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,933
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,200
What's this?

305
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:19,969
(Come on.)

306
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,169
(I'll give you whatever you want, Ball.)

307
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:22,891
(Stop it.)

308
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:25,132
(How could you let your daughter and husband come here?)

309
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,226
What are you doing here alone, beautiful baby?

310
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,653
Go away.

311
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,466
I want to be alone.

312
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,240
I've heard that

313
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,066
girls like to do things opposite to what they actually feel.

314
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,199
I told you to leave me alone.

315
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
I want to be alone.

316
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,653
Don't you get it?

317
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,293
Hey, Jingjai.

318
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,613
You don't have to act like you're strong all the time.

319
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:36,986
Hugo.

320
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,346
I want to be alone.

321
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,489
I'm fine.

322
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,649
I'm alright.

323
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,053
Just leave me alone.

324
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,000
When you're with me,

325
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,250
it's fine to be weak.

326
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,493
It's alright.

327
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,440
Life is just full of awful things.

328
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,586
Do you know that

329
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:31,290
nobody loves me?

330
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:35,010
Everyone hates me

331
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,426
and chases me away.

332
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,946
They insult me.

333
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,973
My parents don't even love me.

334
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Damn it.

335
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,186
Nobody wants me.

336
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,373
Someone does.

337
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,093
It's me.

338
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,599
Hey.

339
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,426
Are you serious

340
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:20,519
or do you just expect something else?

341
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,440
Well, it will be nice if I can get both.

342
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,213
I'm kind of greedy.

343
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,960
Okay?

344
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,866
Are you feeling better?

345
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I told you I'm fine.

346
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,533
Can I sit like this?

347
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,173
I didn't say you can't.

348
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,943
All the books say they're important to the world.

349
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:11,826
None of them mentions what's most important.

350
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:13,679
Relax.

351
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,000
Take your time.

352
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,146
There're a lot to read.

353
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,619
Nai, White.

354
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,849
Can you do me a favor?

355
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,225
Uh-huh. What is it?

356
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,219
Well, I'm working on my report,

357
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,093
but Mek and Mork haven't shown up.

358
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:37,969
They don't help me at all.

359
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,012
I'm not good at this subject either.

360
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,010
Can you two help me?

361
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,409
Okay. I'll help.

362
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,560
Thank you.

363
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,373
How much have you finished, Biw?

364
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:50,733
Here.

365
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,880
Give me a second.

366
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,560
White, let me ask you something.

367
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:20,810
Do you like Nai?

368
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,986
Why did you ask?

369
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Well,

370
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
I like Nai a lot.

371
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,959
But according to the rule,

372
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,080
Masters forbid us from having romantic relationships.

373
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:48,386
But can love be forbidden?

374
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,546
Biw,

375
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,026
but now it's not time to think about love.

376
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,419
Your answer means

377
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,053
you don't have a crush on Nai, right?

378
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Here.

379
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,119
Take that book.

380
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,626
I think it's helpful.

381
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,373
Thank you.

382
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,199
Thank you to you both.

383
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,183
Without you, I would certainly be in trouble.

384
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:36,893
You don't have to thank me.

385
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,426
It's not a big deal.

386
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,253
To me, it is.

387
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,546
You two are so kind to me.

388
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,889
Friends must help each other.

389
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,899
By the way,

390
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,506
are you usually this kind to everyone, Nai?

391
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,289
If you are,

392
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,626
I guess a lot of girls certainly like you.

393
00:26:57,627 --> 00:26:58,826
I don't think so.

394
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,329
People usually don't dare to talk to me.

395
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,200
I don't like to talk to anyone either.

396
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,959
Is it because you already have a girlfriend?

397
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,639
That's why others don't dare to talk to you.

398
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
I don't.

399
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,199
I'm single.

400
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,560
What is your ideal type?

401
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I like someone like White, I guess.

402
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,080
Does what I said make you feel uncomfortable?

403
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,986
So, do you like me?

404
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,019
No.

405
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,520
I'm just saying I like a girl like you.

406
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:44,853
Um.

407
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:12,600
This place is beautiful, isn't it?

408
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,346
That's right.

409
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
Hugo,

410
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,680
do you want to lie down and watch stars with me?

411
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,330
Are you serious?

412
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,240
Yeah.

413
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,306
After that, my parents got divorced.

414
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,106
Mom left to live a new life with her new boyfriend.

415
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,179
It's understandable

416
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,449
why Mom couldn't stand living with someone like Dad.

417
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,653
But I really don't understand

418
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,706
why Mom left me here with someone like him.

419
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,449
Mom abandoned me so easily,

420
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,450
like she just threw trash away.

421
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:48,559
Mom abandoned me, leaving me with Dad

422
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,066
although she knew he never loves me.

423
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,640
I have to tolerate living with Dad, who never understands me.

424
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,053
He keeps scolding and controlling me.

425
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,786
Sometimes he hit me

426
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
like how he did to Mom.

427
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Mom never worries about me.

428
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:23,170
But as I grew up,

429
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,809
I came to understand that.

430
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,493
Mom has never cared about me because

431
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:32,610
she never loves me.

432
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:47,706
My dad never loves me either.

433
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,520
He only loves my older brother.

434
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,706
Hunter, my brother, is everything to my family.

435
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,213
He is the hope and future of my family,

436
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,826
unlike I, who is a good-for-nothing.

437
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,880
Hunter died because of me.

438
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,426
My parents told me

439
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,880
it was my mistake.

440
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,746
He died because of me.

441
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:50,740
If they could choose,

442
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,240
they wanted me, not Hunter, to die.

443
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,546
To be honest,

444
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
I want to die and let Hunter live.

445
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:07,220
I find no reason to live

446
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:16,826
because the person who truly loves me is no longer in this world.

447
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,053
After that,

448
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,533
I feel home is not my place.

449
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:34,530
It's not where I belong.

450
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm not part of the family.

451
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,026
My parents hate me,

452
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:50,340
and I do hate them.

453
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,600
Do you know that

454
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,560
these whole crazy things aren't our faults at all?

455
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,240
It's all because of those awful adults.

456
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:15,340
I feel sorry for us.

457
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,186
Nobody loves us.

458
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,000
The world is not fair.

459
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,786
It's so biased.

460
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,333
But at least,

461
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:36,586
this unfair world has brought me to meet you.

462
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:19,346
Where are you going, Master Praeporn?

463
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,700
I have a concern about something.

464
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,573
I'm afraid there will be a danger.

465
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,699
If you insist on going,

466
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,320
I'll accompany you.

467
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:41,946
Going to the forest alone at night is dangerous.

468
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Yes.

469
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,960
Maki.

470
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Tibet.

471
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,400
Where are you two going?

472
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,640
Well, we're looking for our report book.

473
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:25,412
I guess we accidentally dropped it there.

474
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:26,920
We're going out to look for it.

475
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,919
Now?

476
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,600
Pennhung thinks it's already late.

477
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,419
Let me help you, okay?

478
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,049
It's alright.

479
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,559
You two can go back and take some rest.

480
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,419
We can go by ourselves.

481
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,009
But the rule says

482
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,572
we aren't allowed outside the bedroom

483
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:44,959
after the time they have specified.

484
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,253
Tibet and Maki are breaking the rule.

485
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,053
Tibet!

486
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:50,369
Maki!

487
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,370
Tibet!

488
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:54,059
What should we do, Pheng?

489
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,546
Pennhung is afraid they will be punished.

490
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,973
Let's follow them, shall we?

491
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,413
Pennhung is also afraid of getting punished.

492
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,410
How about getting punished together?

493
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,733
Let's go.

494
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,099
Huh?

495
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,640
Pheng, wait.

496
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,386
Where have they gone?

497
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,786
Maki.

498
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,899
Don't go.

499
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,746
Pennhung doesn't want Maki to get punished.

500
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,626
Tibet.

501
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,530
Maki.

502
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:50,919
Let's go back.

503
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Going to the forest is against the rule.

504
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Maki,

505
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,659
let's stop here tonight.

506
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,439
I can go alone.

507
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,946
Maki!

508
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,105
Pennhung doesn't allow Maki to go.

509
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:12,100
It's dangerous in the forest.

510
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,772
But if Maki insists on going,

511
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:18,770
Pennhung will go with you.

512
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,320
I'm also joining.

513
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,720
Um. I'll go back then.

514
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
Yay.

515
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,940
Pheng, let's go.

516
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,480
Maki.

517
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,640
We'll have more chances.

518
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,373
Don't worry.

519
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:03,413
We'll help each other find your brother.

520
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
Let's go.

521
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:38,186
Get up.

522
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,779
What? Who the hell is this?

523
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,959
Headmaster?

524
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,059
Follow me.

525
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,586
Ouch! Where are we going?

526
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,920
- What's going on, - Let go of me.

527
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
- Headmaster? - It hurts.

528
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,743
Everyone stays in this room.

529
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,289
No one is allowed to leave the room.

530
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,131
Come.

531
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:53,960
Where are we going?

532
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:55,119
Ow! It hurts.

533
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,786
Come!

534
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:57,239
Ouch!

535
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,904
Let go of me.

536
00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:58,905
It hurts!

537
00:38:58,973 --> 00:38:59,973
Ow!

538
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,959
Let go!

539
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,959
I told you to let go of me.

540
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,013
Hugo?

541
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,089
Both of you were brought here because

542
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,640
you broke the 7th rule of Home School.

543
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,719
All students are forbidden

544
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,013
from having romantic relationships at Home School.

545
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:28,453
Who would want to abide by such a silly rule?

546
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,945
Everyone should have the freedom to love, shouldn't they?

547
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:34,939
Love is not wrong.

548
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,253
This crazy rule you set is.

549
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,453
You aren't supposed to have high school love.

550
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,359
Your duty is to study.

551
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,746
Love will be a distraction to you.

552
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:52,739
Stop forcing such an old way of thinking on us, Master.

553
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,293
What era are we living in now?

554
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,720
Fine.

555
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,945
If you want to love each other that much,

556
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,940
I'll allow you to stay together.

557
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,799
Master Phoban,

558
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,452
lock Hugo and Jingjai up

559
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:11,450
until they reflect on their mistakes.

560
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:13,786
Yes, Headmaster.

561
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,771
Hey.

562
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:17,720
Ow.

563
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,464
Let go of me!

564
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:19,000
Hey!

565
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,610
Let go!

566
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:20,899
Hey, it hurts.

567
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,333
Let go!

568
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,680
Miss Jingjai and Mister Hugo,

569
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,679
please walk inside the room properly.

570
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,440
Let go of me!

571
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:30,819
Ow! Let go!

572
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,079
If you want to go in,

573
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
do that alone!

574
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:37,093
Jingjai, the key!

575
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:39,090
Hugo, let's go.

576
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,093
Mister Hugo!

577
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,849
Mister Hugo!

578
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,049
Miss Jingjai!

579
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,609
Open the door now!

580
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,059
Don't lock me up!

581
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,569
Come, Jingjai.

582
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,570
Hurry up.

583
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,040
Hugo.

584
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:00,706
What?

585
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:02,626
Why did you stop?

586
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,279
Jingjai,

587
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,560
I love you.

588
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,399
Let's escape for now.

589
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Let's go.

590
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,490
Does it work?

591
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,680
Hugo.

592
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:34,679
We've been driving for ages already.

593
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,679
Why haven't we found anything?

594
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,973
It's only the forest.

595
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,259
Relax.

596
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,093
We'll find a way out soon.

597
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,090
Or are we getting lost?

598
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,239
Hey, Hugo.

599
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,239
I remember that we drove past this area before.

600
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,864
Huh?

601
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:04,840
Are you sure?

602
00:42:04,841 --> 00:42:07,453
It's like we've been driving in circles.

603
00:42:07,454 --> 00:42:08,939
Damn it.

604
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,960
This place is seriously a maze.

605
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,973
How about this way?

606
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:17,970
We already went there.

607
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:30,699
Hey?

608
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,506
What's wrong with the car?

609
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,280
What's wrong with it?

610
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
What?

611
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,609
Damn it.

612
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,639
We ran out of gas.

613
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
What?

614
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,099
What should we do now?

615
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,532
We don't know where we are now.

616
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:48,665
We don't have a phone

617
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,660
and haven't brought any stuff with us either.

618
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,146
We even managed to escape already.

619
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,959
Jingjai.

620
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,866
Hmm?

621
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:03,279
I guess we have to walk.

622
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,693
Huh? Walk?

623
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:07,690
In the dark?

624
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,690
Don't be scared.

625
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,720
You still have me.

626
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,719
Which way are we going?

627
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,093
We also got lost when driving.

628
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:39,945
If we walk,

629
00:43:39,946 --> 00:43:41,940
won't we get lost and die in the forest?

630
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Trust me.

631
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,133
We'll figure it out.

632
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,879
Hey, Jingjai.

633
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,373
There's a car passing.

634
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,879
Help us!

635
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,106
It's a police car.

636
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:34,319
Officer, please help us.

637
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,539
We lost our way.

638
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,639
What happened?

639
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,959
Why are you here?

640
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,959
It's dangerous around here at night.

641
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,760
We are...

642
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,786
Well,

643
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,586
We're heading to town.

644
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,063
But our car broke down,

645
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:49,546
and there's no phone signal.

646
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,120
Officer, can you please drive us to town?

647
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,880
I'll give you a ride then.

648
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,826
Luckily enough, I'm driving past this area,

649
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,120
or you will have to walk all night.

650
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:03,346
This way, please.

651
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,200
Thank you so much, Officer.

652
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,040
Excuse me,

653
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,066
are we nearly there?

654
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,000
We're arriving soon.

655
00:45:41,493 --> 00:45:44,640
Jingjai, I think something is fishy here.

656
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:46,133
Agree.

657
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:53,679
Officer, can you please pull over?

658
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
My stomach hurts so bad now.

659
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,919
Can you please pull over?

660
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,120
I have a stomach ache.

661
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,490
Stop!

662
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,640
Stop.

663
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:12,039
Hey, let us go.

664
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,439
Can you open it?

665
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,626
I can't.

666
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,253
Hey?

667
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,533
Is it locked?

668
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,339
Stop now.

669
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,011
Hey!

670
00:46:20,012 --> 00:46:20,733
Stop.

671
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,880
I told you to stop!

672
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,889
Let us go.

673
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,026
Where are you taking us?

674
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,840
- Let us go! - If you don't stop,

675
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,411
I'll hit you.

676
00:46:26,412 --> 00:46:26,984
Stop!

677
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:27,985
Let us go!

678
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,649
Officer, thank you very much for driving our students here.

679
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,119
Please let me know

680
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,266
if you need me to help with anything, Master Amin.

681
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,333
What is this?

682
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,729
Both of you,

683
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,946
be prepared for the punishment.

684
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
Hey?

685
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,160
What? Again?

686
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,453
Let go of me.

687
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,740
It hurts!

688
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,504
Let go of me!

689
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:08,505
Let go!

690
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,693
Maki?

691
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,690
Are you sick?

692
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,546
Master Praeporn,

693
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,586
do you know GEN4's Run?

694
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:41,213
Why did you ask?

695
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,493
I just want to know where he is.

696
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,133
Why do you want to know?

697
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,146
Do you know him?

698
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,560
I want to see him.

699
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:11,386
I'm sorry.

700
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,380
I don't know where Run is.

701
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:19,680
Master, you're lying.

702
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,586
Today's meal is your favorite, Run.

703
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:57,826
I remember that

704
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:59,613
when you were still studying,

705
00:48:59,614 --> 00:49:02,066
you loved eating this a lot.

706
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,060
When will you set me free?

707
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,879
On the day this dish was served,

708
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,173
you would be extra happy.

709
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,720
Can you still remember that?

710
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,720
I asked when you'd set me free.

711
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,360
I told you already.

712
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,899
I'll set you free only after

713
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,579
you become that old Run.

714
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,733
You'd better kill me, Master Amin!

715
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,813
There's no way I'll become that old Run again.

716
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:49,066
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

717
00:49:49,213 --> 00:49:50,813
I think it's time for us

718
00:49:50,814 --> 00:49:53,760
to start The Lizard Game.

719
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,319
You each have to pick up a call

720
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,253
to find out which animal you are assigned to be.

721
00:49:58,254 --> 00:50:00,739
One of you will become a lizard.

722
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,040
Just reveal to us if you're a lizard.

723
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,319
As a lizard,

724
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,719
it keeps changing colors.

725
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,986
You look the most suspicious, Jean.

726
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:08,306
Don't judge me, okay?

727
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:11,519
Don't underestimate this GEN.

728
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,493
They always go beyond our expectations.
