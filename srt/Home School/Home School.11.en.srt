1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,339
Isn't that too harsh for them?

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,919
It's one of the lessons

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,809
all of them must learn.

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,579
Even you yourself went through that already.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,299
You must stop Master Amin

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,889
before things get even out of hand.

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,399
It's too late, Run.

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,130
Now, Master Amin has already found the right person.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,890
He is Master Puth's son?

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,899
Yes.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,839
Tibet is Master Puth's son.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,621
He is the student who could pass through

13
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:30,979
Master Amin's challenging lessons

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,980
like you did.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,970
Why does it have to be.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,599
Master Puth's son?

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,659
Master Amin wants Master Puth's son to carry on the project.

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,170
Master Puth has left unfinished.

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,419
But Tibet's life will be full of danger

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,420
if he continues this project.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,730
Run, you haven't believed in this project at all, have you?

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,460
I haven't.

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,480
I don't believe in it.

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,479
Take Master Puth, for example.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
He ended up dying here.

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,649
No matter what,

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,560
every Home School Master is willing to die for Home School.

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,820
Why?

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,100
Why haven't I known about this at all?

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,260
Mom never told me about Dad being Home School's Master.

31
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,759
Why did she hide it from me?

32
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,889
It's our rule at Home School.

33
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:16,559
Every Master is not allowed to reveal to others what job they're doing.

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,940
That also includes their family members.

35
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:28,279
Your mom just found out about it after Master Puth died.

36
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,920
Why didn't you tell me my mom was dying?!

37
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,240
That was the last beg from your mom.

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,289
She wanted you to live your life like other kids do

39
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,700
without having to care for her like you had been doing.

40
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,980
But don't worry.

41
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,360
While you were at Home School,

42
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,680
I took good care of your mom.

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,619
She passed away in peace.

44
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,580
I gave her the promise that

45
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,440
I'll take care of you the best I can.

46
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,290
I don't understand

47
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,410
why Mom didn't want me by her side.

48
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,610
Why didn't she even say goodbye to me?

49
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,580
Master Amin, did you ask my mom

50
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,720
why she decided to do so?

51
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,610
Your mom told me that

52
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,860
she believed saying goodbye wasn't the ending page.

53
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,719
She didn't want a goodbye between you and her

54
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,280
to end with death.

55
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,940
She wanted you to move forward

56
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,050
to start your own life

57
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,020
because, honestly, your mom hasn't gone anywhere.

58
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,540
She will always be in your heart.

59
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,490
Why did everyone leave me

60
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,100
without giving me a chance to say a word?

61
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,460
That's because sometimes humans are weak.

62
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,080
They aren't brave enough to see their loved ones in pain.

63
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,380
That's how your mom was,

64
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
and so was your dad.

65
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,440
Master Amin, do you know about my dad's death?

66
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,650
Why did he commit suicide?

67
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,400
Why did Master Puth do this?

68
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,840
Master Puth didn't agree to take the medicine.

69
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,929
Home School prepared for him.

70
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,930
It was his choice to reject the treatment.

71
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,739
But Master Puth wasn't sick.

72
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,569
Master Puth!

73
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,680
Run.

74
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,250
Master Puth has left us, Run.

75
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,160
Master Amin,

76
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,409
I'm sure Master Puth wouldn't do this.

77
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,820
He would never commit suicide.

78
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,679
The autopsy result and the evidence at the scene have confirmed that.

79
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,320
Master Puth committed suicide.

80
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,119
But I don't believe that.

81
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,730
I don't believe someone like Master Puth would do that.

82
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Are you telling me

83
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,239
my dad didn't commit suicide?

84
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,620
Yes.

85
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,170
Before that happened,

86
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,779
Master Puth had an important project to work on,

87
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,020
and it's impossible that

88
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,049
he would abandon everything he had created.

89
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,209
So what's that project?

90
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,360
What's the project my dad was working on?

91
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,210
If you want to know,

92
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,420
you must return to Home School.

93
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,140
Why are you following me?

94
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,849
Master Prasath,

95
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,560
why are you following me?

96
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,530
I'm worried about you.

97
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,119
I'm doing fine.

98
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,460
Thank you.

99
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,060
Did you take the medicine I prepared for you?

100
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,780
I already did.

101
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,250
Please don't forget to take it correctly and on time.

102
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,059
From when have you become in charge of medication?

103
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,539
It's Master Praeporn's responsibility, isn't it?

104
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,930
Master Amin ordered me

105
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,010
to take care of you the best I can.

106
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,370
That also includes every student at Home School.

107
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,980
Show yourself now, Maki.

108
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,339
Why are you walking around at this late hour?

109
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,600
You know it's against the rule, don't you?

110
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm sorry, Master.

111
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,159
I couldn't sleep,

112
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,919
so I came out to take a walk.

113
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,440
Aren't you tailing Master Dilak?

114
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,779
Let's not waste time talking.

115
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,849
I'll walk Maki to the bedroom.

116
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,460
Master Dilak.

117
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,120
Please continue patrolling the building.

118
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,320
I'll walk her to the room.

119
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,180
Maki, let's go.

120
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Do not wander outside again.

121
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,410
If I find you break the rule,

122
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,140
you'll be punished.

123
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,659
What are you hiding, Master?

124
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,980
Or are you afraid I'll find out about it?

125
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,919
I'm not afraid that you'll find out.

126
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,160
I seriously want you to find it.

127
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,600
I'm even counting down to that second to arrive.

128
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
What do you mean, Master?

129
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,170
You'll know soon.

130
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,460
Home School won't keep you waiting for long, Maki.

131
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,010
I'll wait for that, Master.

132
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,179
Master Amin, why aren't we setting out?

133
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,440
Someone is still missing.

134
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,359
We've been waiting for some time already.

135
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,919
I think Nai won't come back.

136
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
I believe he will.

137
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,499
I feel sorry for you

138
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,890
that you're coming back.

139
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
I feel sorry for you too.

140
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
Hey.

141
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,170
I feel sorry for you.

142
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,940
I feel sorry for you, everyone.

143
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,610
Since everyone is already here,

144
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,090
let's return to our home.

145
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:15,170
Welcome back to Home School.

146
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,299
I'm glad

147
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,279
everyone decided to come back to Home School.

148
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,460
I know many of you didn't want to come back here.

149
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,120
You haven't seen Home School as your home.

150
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,300
That's why I needed to reveal the truth

151
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:41,004
and many reasons about Home School to you all.

152
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,819
You're probably curious why, at Home School,

153
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,959
there're weird rules,

154
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,729
irregular subjects,

155
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:01,730
and Masters who sometimes behave weirdly, unreasonably,

156
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,729
and too cruelly.

157
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,479
But this is Home School's curriculum,

158
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,276
which makes every Master behave in such a manner

159
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,850
to intentionally cause you to feel like that.

160
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,889
Can you tell us

161
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,059
why Home School's curriculum has been designed like this?

162
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,899
Our curriculum emphasizes the fact that you must understand.

163
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,649
The real world you'll be facing is a lot crueler than

164
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:40,620
what you're facing in Home School.

165
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,809
But if you can get through this hardship,

166
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,479
you'll grow up to be a strong adult,

167
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,809
who can never be hurt by anyone out there.

168
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,379
But isn't what you did to us too cruel

169
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,979
to be called a way of teaching?

170
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,219
How about what your family did to you?

171
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,100
Isn't that even crueler?

172
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,169
Every Master knew from the start that

173
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,479
your parents sent you all here to Home School

174
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,650
because they no longer wanted you.

175
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,330
You were abandoned by your own family.

176
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,660
Why didn't you tell us from the start?

177
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,239
It's because we all knew

178
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,180
you would feel hurt to the full.

179
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,739
We also knew you would find out the truth one day.

180
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,409
What Masters can do is teach you to be strongest

181
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,319
and full of strength.

182
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,019
Home School has been founded

183
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,619
with the aim to look after kids who are unwanted,

184
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,299
hurt by their family,

185
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,779
and abandoned.

186
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,400
Home School has been both a home and a family

187
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,650
to our students from GEN1 to the present GEN.

188
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,460
Home School focuses on teaching you to learn about

189
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,099
friendship and the true love

190
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,700
you'll never experience from your own family.

191
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,859
You probably feel that you're alone,

192
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,729
thinking that you're left with no one,

193
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,859
but in fact, you're not.

194
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,009
You always have your GEN6 friends,

195
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,200
and Home School will never leave you.

196
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,279
At Home School, we believe

197
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,770
everyone can change this world into a better place to live in.

198
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:59,219
Every one of you is my hope.

199
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:07,200
Therefore, every Master must take care of you the best they can.

200
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,180
Your dad used to teach the subject Master Dilak is teaching?

201
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,610
Yes.

202
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:32,010
And he passed away here?

203
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,640
But Master Amin doesn't believe he committed suicide.

204
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,560
Um.

205
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,820
Home School is full of mysterious stories,

206
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,120
including that about GEN4's Run,

207
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,560
strange behaviors of Hugo, Jingjai, and Master Dilak,

208
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:06,370
and now the mystery behind Master Puth's death.

209
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,680
Who's that?

210
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,880
Who's over there?

211
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,450
Pheng and Pennhung?

212
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,339
How long have you been standing there?

213
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,969
Pennhung didn't intend to eavesdrop.

214
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,049
Pennhung just walked past by chance.

215
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:49,369
We often saw you secretly talking about Home School,

216
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,090
so we're worried about you.

217
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,519
So what did you hear?

218
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,679
Oh, nothing.

219
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,769
We didn't hear anything much.

220
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,969
Pennhung and Pheng heard you talk about Run, Maki's brother.

221
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,399
He's our GEN4 senior who disappeared six years ago.

222
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,919
Also, we heard you say Master Dilak is acting strange,

223
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,239
and so are Hugo and Jingjai.

224
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,959
We also heard that Master Puth is Tibet's dad,

225
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,500
and he died in Home School.

226
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,290
Wow.

227
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
You know all.

228
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,039
But don't worry.

229
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,779
We promise to keep this a secret.

230
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,699
We won't tell anyone.

231
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,610
But can we ask one thing from you?

232
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,119
What is it?

233
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,419
Please don't do something that puts you in danger.

234
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,939
I'm worried.

235
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,490
That's right.

236
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,279
Don't break the rule.

237
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,279
But if you do,

238
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,890
don't let them catch you.

239
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,640
Thank you.

240
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,200
We'll be careful.

241
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,800
If you need our help anytime,

242
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,689
just let us know.

243
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,819
We're willing to help

244
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,159
because we also feel that

245
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,920
there're weird things here.

246
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,800
Hmm?

247
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,179
What is it, Pennhung?

248
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,610
Do you want to say something?

249
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,640
Well,

250
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:48,620
I saw Master Puth talk to GEN4's Run before.

251
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,559
Where did you see them?

252
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,959
At the bookshelf.

253
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,610
Someone put it there.

254
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,539
Is it a good idea to sneak in here at this hour?

255
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,919
If they find us, we'll certainly be locked up.

256
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,089
I told you not to come with us.

257
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,899
But everyone is coming.

258
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
How can I not?

259
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,969
Don't be afraid, Pheng.

260
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,610
I think Masters aren't at Home School tonight.

261
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,759
How could you know?

262
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,050
None of the Masters are patrolling the building.

263
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,159
She's right.

264
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,090
Since we walked outside like this,

265
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,239
Master Phoban would already show up to stop us if he was here.

266
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,290
Right.

267
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,600
So where are they?

268
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,890
I don't know either.

269
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,340
Pennhung has found it!

270
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,970
Pennhung came across a memory card

271
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,800
inside this Winnie-the-Pooh book,

272
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,800
so I secretly watched it.

273
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,729
It's a video of people playing chess.

274
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,610
I couldn't catch what they were saying.

275
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,460
Maki.

276
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,250
Are you okay?

277
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,920
Maki.

278
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Maki.

279
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,090
Don't come close.

280
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,980
Are you okay?

281
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,520
Don't come close.

282
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,210
Maki.

283
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,809
Why are you crying?

284
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,810
I don't know either.

285
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,290
But I'm so scared of it.

286
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,250
That's the one.

287
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:48,100
That's the memory card.

288
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,760
Finally, we've made it to this point.

289
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,320
As everyone is already well aware of,

290
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,599
this is the most important period of time

291
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,959
of Home School's curriculum.

292
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,849
From now on,

293
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,340
we all have to work very hard

294
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,490
to achieve the goal of the curriculum Master Amin has designed.

295
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,880
But I think

296
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:41,520
someone among us here doesn't want this plan to succeed.

297
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,260
Master Prasath, what are you trying to say?

298
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,289
Stop getting on our nerves already

299
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,860
and tell me now.

300
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,769
Relax, Headmaster.

301
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm warning you because I mean well.

302
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,839
You don't have to mess with our heads

303
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,570
like you do to the students.

304
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,019
If I don't do so,

305
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,199
it won't be fun, Master Praeporn.

306
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,420
Enough already, Master Prasath.

307
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,890
Yes, Master Amin.

308
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,820
Just say it.

309
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,130
I'm just suspecting that.

310
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,740
Master Dilak is probably the rat

311
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,360
trying to destroy your plan, Master Amin.

312
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,170
That's not true.

313
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,459
May I know why you're slandering me, Master Prasath?

314
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,700
Or someone else is probably behind Master Dilak's action.

315
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,020
On the day Master Dilak lost her way in the forest,

316
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,220
I saw someone else's footprints next to hers.

317
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,099
Stop talking nonsense already.

318
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,579
Every Master will never betray Master Amin and Home School.

319
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,370
Is that so, Headmaster?

320
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,519
How did you find it, Pennhung?

321
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,720
You're incredible.

322
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,480
I came across it while I was looking for a place to hide croissants.

323
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,819
Tibet.

324
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,410
Can you please insert the memory card for me?

325
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Sure.

326
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,129
Where, Pennhung?

327
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,380
Here.

328
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
I don't want to do this at all.

329
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,780
But this is the only way to erase your nightmare.

330
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,580
I don't want to think about it.

331
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,620
Sometimes, we can deal with a nightmare by confronting it.

332
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,900
Actually,

333
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,840
the bad thing I see in my nightmare has nothing to do with me.

334
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,640
It's related to my sister.

335
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
(What happened to your sister?)

336
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,840
Whenever she faced bad situations,

337
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,220
she asked me to read out Winnie-the-Pooh for her.

338
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,019
(Why did she like that book?)

339
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,930
(Was there a specific reason?)

340
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,760
She once told me

341
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:49,840
she wanted to have a friend like Winnie the Pooh

342
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,410
because, in reality,

343
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,890
she never had one.

344
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,160
My sister loves this book a lot.

345
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,970
Why did such a thing happen to her?

346
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,610
Did someone do something to your sister?

347
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,600
Let me check.

348
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,010
Maki, let's go back.

349
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
I feel

350
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,380
something really did happen,

351
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,490
but I can't remember it.

352
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,880
Let's go back for now.

353
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,330
What?

354
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,799
Why aren't you taking it with us?

355
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,009
Take it.

356
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,299
It has been here all along,

357
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,699
so that means Masters don't know about it.

358
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,640
Let's keep it here.

359
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:23,729
It's the safest place.

360
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,019
Hurry up,

361
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,290
or else Masters will be here.

362
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,620
Let's go.

363
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:42,920
Don't.

364
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,740
Don't hurt me.

365
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,050
I'm sorry.

366
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,019
Don't come close.

367
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,619
Don't come close!

368
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,779
Don't hurt me!

369
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,930
Don't!

370
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,260
Don't!

371
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:01,369
Don't hurt me!

372
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,450
Don't!

373
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,599
Don't hurt me!

374
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,179
I won't do it again!

375
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,060
I won't!

376
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,620
I won't do it again!

377
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,410
I'm sorry!

378
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,330
Don't!

379
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:12,809
Get out!

380
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,009
I won't do it again!

381
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,409
I won't!

382
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,320
Don't hurt me!

383
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,890
Maki.

384
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,890
Don't hurt me!

385
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,610
Maki!

386
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,729
- Don't hurt me! - Maki, wake up!

387
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,380
Wake up!

388
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
Maki!

389
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,570
Maki!

390
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,250
Get up carefully.

391
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,819
Maki, it's just a nightmare.

392
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,699
It's alright.

393
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,359
You were dreaming.

394
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,360
What did you see in your dream?

395
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,120
Someone was punishing me,

396
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,420
but I couldn't see that person's face.

397
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,850
My hands also feel really hurt.

398
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,930
Where are others?

399
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,219
They're taking a shower.

400
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,479
Today, Masters didn't wake us up to exercise.

401
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,639
That's right.

402
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,779
Headmaster said

403
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,859
they'll prepare a welcoming meal for us.

404
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,700
What?

405
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,000
Welcoming meal?

406
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,359
Holy God.

407
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,529
They're really going all out.

408
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,129
It's the party to welcome us back to Home School.

409
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,049
No doubt they have made it this extra.

410
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,129
Since we came back,

411
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,999
Masters have been kinder to us.

412
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,900
True.

413
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:01,889
We didn't have to exercise in the morning.

414
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,619
Plus, we woke up to this breakfast buffet.

415
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,999
I started to find this rather scary.

416
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,099
I don't dare eat it.

417
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,020
Agree.

418
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,739
What trick are they using this time?

419
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,739
We don't know if they will come up with another weird course.

420
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,529
Hey, don't jinx it.

421
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,479
The meal looks yummy now.

422
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,579
Guys, let's not overthink.

423
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,999
Considering what we just faced,

424
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,139
I think we deserve something as consolation.

425
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,659
Hugo is right.

426
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,290
I guess Masters sympathize with us.

427
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,450
Maki,

428
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,560
eat something.

429
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,239
How do you like today's meal?

430
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,399
Do you like it?

431
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,580
I cooked it my best.

432
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,649
Super delicious.

433
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,450
You are exaggerating.

434
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,939
I feel so touched

435
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,379
that you enjoy the meal I cooked.

436
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,489
Will croissants be included in our lunch too?

437
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,179
I want to eat some more.

438
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,159
Certainly, Mr. Pennhung.

439
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,689
But as for now,

440
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,689
I have something to inform you of.

441
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,459
What is it?

442
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,660
Don't tell us you'll make us play a weird game again.

443
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,779
No, we won't.

444
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,019
I'm here to inform you that

445
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,919
you must attend the Up to You class.

446
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,180
Up to You class?

447
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,130
What is it?

448
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,899
It's the class that allows you to choose

449
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,169
which Master you would like to learn about.

450
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:06,639
Everyone will get to learn about that Master's thoughts and attitudes.

451
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,489
Don't worry.

452
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,620
There is strictly no punishment during class.

453
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,220
Every Master will provide you with knowledge and love.

454
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:25,300
Please feel free to consult that Master about every problem you have.

455
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,930
Why did you two choose to learn this subject with me?

456
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,860
Please place your hand on my hand, everyone.

457
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,959
Close your eyes

458
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
and listen to what I say.

459
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,399
Before I became Home School's Master,

460
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,970
I worked as a doctor at a public hospital.

461
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,640
I had always dreamed of becoming a pediatrician.

462
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,260
I loved to cure every kid.

463
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,250
I had a lovely son,

464
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,400
and a husband who always supported me.

465
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,639
I think I understand you, Master.

466
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,809
You probably feel that you don't fit it

467
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,169
and can't get along with others.

468
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,970
Nobody pays attention to you.

469
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:15,520
My husband and son were killed by a 15-year-old kid,

470
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,210
who drove dad's car to hang out

471
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,099
and ran a red light.

472
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,409
This is so unfair, Master.

473
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,339
You should have been able to bring our country reputation,

474
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,579
but those assholes got in your way.

475
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,620
That's why our country won't develop.

476
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,170
You don't see anything at all, right?

477
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,480
Everything is in the darkness

478
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,240
with no way out.

479
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,640
That kid never received any punishment,

480
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,440
and I never heard any apology from that kid either.

481
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,180
You must feel that you're alone,

482
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,040
having no one to rely on.

483
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,690
Well, I now feel as if you could read my mind.

484
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,689
What I said is right, isn't it?

485
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,320
It's wrong.

486
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:16,489
What?

487
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,810
Wait.

488
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,569
Even though what you thought was right,

489
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,300
I won't tell you the answer anyway.

490
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:31,900
Because the cause of that kid's behavior was the parents.

491
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,459
But I want you to remember that

492
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,499
cronyism and those connection things will never disappear.

493
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,180
They did everything to silence the news.

494
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,649
They bribed the police

495
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,079
and even the director of the hospital I was working at.

496
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,779
Why, Master?

497
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,539
Since it's not a good thing,

498
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,539
why are we keeping it?

499
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,099
That's because some people are concerned only about their own benefits.

500
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,729
This kind of system can continue because of selfishness.

501
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:04,170
Yes. That's exactly how I feel

502
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,770
since I accepted the truth that

503
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,169
my dad is not a good person.

504
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,779
Keep this in mind.

505
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,600
Never reveal your feelings to anyone

506
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,700
because that will become your weakness.

507
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,259
Dad never values me.

508
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,620
I feel he is disappointed that.

509
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,019
I was born to be a girl.

510
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,599
They did everything by claiming that

511
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,819
they wanted to protect their kid.

512
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,739
I think men just want to take control of us,

513
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,560
limiting us to only be what they've imagined us to be.

514
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,729
But in fact, they were creating a devil.

515
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,489
Can't we do anything about it, Master?

516
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,180
I did try,

517
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,319
but in the end, I ended up having to quit that industry

518
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
and become Home School's Master.

519
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,580
So how did you get through that, Master?

520
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,420
It's because of you dad, Tibet.

521
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,579
Master Puth and Master Amin helped me.

522
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,080
How did they help?

523
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,680
Master Puth once told me something.

524
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,880
I have never forgotten.

525
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:31,370
Don't let anyone devalue you,

526
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,159
and don't stick to the thought that

527
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,810
women have to always rely on men.

528
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,200
Sometimes, we can deal with a nightmare by confronting it.

529
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,920
Stop believing in words from those crazy adults.

530
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,419
That's because I know,

531
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,959
at Home School, I can help you change something.

532
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,600
Learn to think and distinguish

533
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,850
what you should believe.

534
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,700
Master Praeporn,

535
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,730
can I ask you to please help me with one thing?

536
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,140
I also want to fight my nightmare,

537
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,140
but I can't recall what happened.

538
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,239
I don't know what caused this recurring nightmare.

539
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
Are you sure

540
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,960
you're ready to face the truth?

541
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,090
I am.

542
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,380
The only thing you must hold onto is the fact that

543
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,250
we do have each other.

544
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,960
You may open your eyes now.

545
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,370
You're not alone anymore.

546
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,599
Master Dilak, you excel at this.

547
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,209
Pennhung really likes listening to the music.

548
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,039
I'll play it for you often then.

549
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,040
That's nice, Master.

550
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,050
Close your eyes, Maki.

551
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,360
Imagine that you're in a safe place,

552
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,500
filled with peace and relaxation.

553
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,280
You're safe.

554
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,100
Nobody can hurt you.

555
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:31,090
Now, I want you to think of your past days

556
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,210
when you were a kid.

557
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,439
You're holding that book in your hand.

558
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,440
It's the book you like.

559
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,480
What's that book?

560
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,640
Winnie-the-Pooh book.

561
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,530
You're reading that book.

562
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,440
You really like it.

563
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,450
You read it over and over again.

564
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,880
While you're reading,

565
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,450
what can you see around you?

566
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,370
God,

567
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,080
please protect my sister.

568
00:49:46,546 --> 00:49:48,385
Please make her forget,

569
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:50,380
not recall it.

570
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,960
I don't want my sister to feel hurt.

571
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,600
Please make her forget.

572
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,560
Please don't let her recall it.

573
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,986
I see my dad.

574
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,980
Dad is walking to me.

575
00:50:14,253 --> 00:50:15,980
(Put your hands here.)

576
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,440
I'm scared.

577
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,133
Why are you scared?

578
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,769
Because I...

579
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,040
I...

580
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,439
I broke the rule.

581
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,866
(Put your hands here.)

582
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,466
(Now!)

583
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,093
(Put your hands here now!)

584
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:52,090
Put your hands on the table.

585
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,626
You understand why I'm doing this to you, right?

586
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,680
Don't move.

587
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,519
Dad!

588
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,146
Dad, what are you doing?

589
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,899
Run, it's not your business.

590
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,704
Get out!

591
00:51:07,705 --> 00:51:08,371
I won't let you do this.

592
00:51:08,372 --> 00:51:08,920
Run!

593
00:51:08,921 --> 00:51:10,479
Get out now!

594
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,533
It's not your business!

595
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,880
Stay there.

596
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,853
Put them on the table.

597
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:15,089
Now!

598
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,773
Don't hide them.

599
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,866
Ouch!

600
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:27,099
Dad!

601
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,133
Get out!

602
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,280
Ow!

603
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:31,733
It hurts!

604
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:33,729
It hurts!

605
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,599
Dad!

606
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,619
Dad, it hurts!

607
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,620
Maki.

608
00:51:40,426 --> 00:51:41,600
Dad, stop!

609
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,293
You're protecting her, right?

610
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:50,786
Maki.

611
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,840
Maki.

612
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,520
You're protecting her!

613
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,906
Maki.

614
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,400
Maki.

615
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,080
Maki.

616
00:52:16,626 --> 00:52:17,546
Dad.

617
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:19,280
Maki.

618
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,386
Tibet.

619
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,066
I know now

620
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:54,173
why I can't remember anything.

621
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,720
So what happened?

622
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,040
When I was a kid,

623
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,866
my memory was deleted.

624
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,853
Master Amin took me to the treatment room.

625
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,066
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

626
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,839
Maki just found out the truth about her past.

627
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,939
That girl shouldn't have faced such a thing.

628
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,866
What's your relationship with my dad, Master Amin?

629
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:00,179
You'll find out about everything soon.

630
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,599
I have something to inform you of today.

631
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,059
You must take separate classes,

632
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,733
based on what each Master has picked for you.

633
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:09,439
Why must we do that?

634
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,186
To prepare yourselves for the treatment process.
