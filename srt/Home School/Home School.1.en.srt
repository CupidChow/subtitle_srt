1
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Run.

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,680
Run!

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,520
Run!

4
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Run!

5
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,080
Run!

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,760
Let go of me! I'm going home.

7
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,720
Let go of me! I'm going home.

8
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Eat the jelly, Run.

9
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,480
Let go!

10
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Run,

11
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,480
this is your home.

12
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
It isn't.

13
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,760
Home school is hell.

14
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,800
(Home School is a special alternative boarding school.)

15
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,880
(Every three years, the admission exam will take place once to accept new GEN students into our school.)

16
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,560
(But our admission exam is different from those of other schools)

17
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,120
(because parents must take this exam on behalf of their children.)

18
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,480
You may begin now.

19
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:17,320
(Our intense courses here are special as they have been thoroughly and logically designed)

20
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,080
(to fix and improve your children)

21
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,400
(in their academic performances, personalities)

22
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,064
(as well as attitudes.)

23
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:30,824
(No school out there has managed to achieve this goal.)

24
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,080
Why do you want your child to study at Home School?

25
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,600
I believe

26
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,840
Home School can turn my child into a better person.

27
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
When will he finish this?

28
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I want to provide something good for my daughter.

29
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,520
Hi, I'm Biw. What's your name?

30
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,040
I don't want her to be surrounded by an unpleasant environment out there.

31
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,160
I'm Pheng. Let's be friends.

32
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,040
My daughter needs extra care and attention.

33
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,280
Home School is the best answer to what we're looking for.

34
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Our sons are good people.

35
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Isn't this quality reasonable enough for them to get accepted into Home School and be under your care?

36
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:25,956
Do you think your child can endure the pressure that could result from our intense courses?

37
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,520
Pailert Family members must be able to endure any pressure coming in.

38
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,320
I want Home School to be really strict with my daughter.

39
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm willing to pay a million per term for that.

40
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,640
Why must Home School accept your child as our student here?

41
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:49,897
Pennhung, my son, is a special child,

42
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,429
so he deserves to study at a special school like Home School.

43
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,625
(Of course, to have your child take these special courses we provide,)

44
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,297
(you're required to pay the school fees and the initial charges,)

45
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:04,665
(which are more expensive than those required by other schools.)

46
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,948
Our family is willing to pay over 1 million per term

47
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,040
if Home School accepts my son as a student.

48
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Hey, do you have a lighter?

49
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,600
You have cigarettes?

50
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,436
No school is a more suitable option than Home School.

51
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:31,624
I think Home School can change my child into a new person.

52
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey.

53
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:38,700
Give me your Line id.

54
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:42,857
It will be a relief for me if my child gets accepted into Home School.

55
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,720
If I don't reply, don't pester me.

56
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,160
You're playing hard to get.

57
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:06,036
Students who're taking the exam for scholarship opportunities,

58
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:07,821
please follow me.

59
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:21,306
I guess you already know that getting accepted into Home School isn't easy.

60
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:29,949
In every GEN, we offer only two spots for scholarship students,

61
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:35,956
while over 1,000 students submit their applications.

62
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,320
You must think it over well enough before giving me your answer.

63
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Sure.

64
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:50,909
Why do you want a scholarship to study at Home School?

65
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:54,268
My mom wants me to study here.

66
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,457
She said Home School will provide me with a scholarship fund...

67
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,270
that allows me to complete my university degree.

68
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,049
I'm an orphan.

69
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:04,378
I don't have money, parents...

70
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:07,316
or a family to support me as other children do.

71
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:12,295
There's no chance for me to go to a special private school

72
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
whose tuition fee is over 1 million like Home School.

73
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:18,228
The only possible way for me to study in such a good school like this is...

74
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:19,919
by getting this scholarship.

75
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:21,944
If I'm offered a scholarship to study here,

76
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,010
my mom doesn't have to worry about me anymore.

77
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:28,815
I believe studying at Home School can help change my fate.

78
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,640
But studying here is very much different from studying at any other school.

79
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,240
Can you adjust yourself to it?

80
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,840
I've been through a lot of tough matters so far.

81
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,136
Studying at Home School is a gift to my life.

82
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,746
To me, I don't find this a big deal.

83
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,747
I've set my own goal.

84
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,200
We'll send you the exam result later.

85
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,600
I hope we'll get to meet here at Home School.

86
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,840
How's the result, Maki?

87
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,840
I got accepted into Home School.

88
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:32,462
Are you sure you want to study there?

89
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
I have to, Sister.

90
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,160
I'll pray to God to help protect you then, Maki.

91
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,640
Miss Maki, please get changed to join our welcoming party.

92
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,320
Thank you.

93
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Thank you.

94
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:21,397
Oho.

95
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,000
This welcoming party is well worth it for the tuition fee paid. Is it?

96
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,021
They should have provided us with some wines.

97
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:29,957
This is obviously a party for little kids.

98
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,856
But I think it's delicious.

99
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,415
It's so good.

100
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,360
Try it. It's so yummy.

101
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
Thanks.

102
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,465
I'm Maki. You?

103
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,320
I'm White.

104
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:01,127
A well-made croissant must come with a honeycomb texture...

105
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:05,394
showing the correct way of folding and rolling butter into dough.

106
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,654
After we bite it,

107
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,760
we must sense the pleasant smell of butter all over our mouth.

108
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,685
Congratulations to 13 of you

109
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,710
who have been selected.

110
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:32,943
From now,

111
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:38,943
you're officially Home School's GEN6 students.

112
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:45,715
Let me inform you once again that your parents have already signed the consent form,

113
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,201
allowing you to be Home School's students...

114
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,833
and given us permission to take care of you,

115
00:12:54,087 --> 00:13:00,407
both for your academic performance and well-being, throughout these three academic years.

116
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,862
What's especially important is that,

117
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:08,761
all of you must strictly abide by Home School's rules.

118
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,254
Finally, throughout your three years as Home School's GEN6 students,

119
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,480
you'll earn a brand-new type of life experience

120
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,440
you'll never forget.

121
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Damn.

122
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Hey?

123
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,960
Wake up.

124
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,280
Why do I feel so dizzy?

125
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:10,160
We got drugged.

126
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:41,216
Welcome to Home School.

127
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,239
Where are you taking us to?

128
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,600
Home School.

129
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,680
Why did you get us drugged?

130
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,880
White.

131
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,360
White, wake up now.

132
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,360
Everyone, wake up.

133
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:44,894
Everyone. Wake up already. Wake up. Everyone.

134
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Hey,

135
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,440
where is this place?

136
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:03,604
You're at Home School.

137
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,125
From today,

138
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,640
this is your home.

139
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,644
What are you talking about?

140
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,215
This is kidnapping.

141
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,771
- It's illegal. - True.

142
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:16,818
Take us back now.

143
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,843
Don't raise your voice at Master Amin.

144
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
But why did you have to get us drugged?

145
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:32,120
Everything you're facing now is part of our courses at Home School.

146
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,920
All of your parents have been well-informed of it,

147
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:41,310
and they have agreed to let us take care of every one of you.

148
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,107
What course is this?

149
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,435
Has the term begun already?

150
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,400
We haven't prepared anything. We don't have clothes with us either.

151
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,811
Don't worry.

152
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:51,815
Your parents have prepared everything for you.

153
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,733
But we didn't agree to.

154
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Isn't this wrong?

155
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,680
If Master Amin doesn't ask,

156
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,788
you have no right to speak.

157
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,186
Now, all of you are Home School students.

158
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,726
I won't be.

159
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,616
I won't stand staying here.

160
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,320
Move.

161
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,880
Are you looking for trouble?

162
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,840
If you don't stop causing trouble,

163
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:33,525
I must punish you, Mr. Hugo.

164
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:48,390
All of you must strictly abide by Home School's rules.

165
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:53,495
Those who fail to do so must be punished.

166
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Here's our rule 1.

167
00:17:56,927 --> 00:18:01,667
You're not allowed to use your phone in Home School.

168
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,082
Please put your phone and valuable items in the box.

169
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:49,598
Rule 2.

170
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,003
Every student must go to bed at the same time.

171
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
You're also not allowed to leave the room after bedtime.

172
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Every student must wake up

173
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
based on the time Home School has determined.

174
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,480
What?!

175
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:17,893
I only slept for only few hours.

176
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:19,588
Why do they keep waking us up?

177
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I want to go home.

178
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Ugh! You've been crying all night.

179
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,040
It's annoying!

180
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,709
Oh?

181
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,560
One of you is missing.

182
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,560
Where is Jingjai?

183
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,050
She's sleeping.

184
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Jingjai must want to take some rest.

185
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,058
Alright, everyone.

186
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:55,175
Here's the next rule of Home School. Every Saturday and Sunday,

187
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,600
you must cook your three meals on your own.

188
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,560
From Monday to Friday,

189
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Home School is in charge of cooking your meals.

190
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,730
Why are you doing it so slowly? Just put it here.

191
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,080
Are you hurried? Will we get to eat it right away or what, huh?

192
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:15,597
I'll cook for you guys.

193
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:16,935
You should have told us you can cook.

194
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,902
Stew, fry, stir-fry, cook, boil, and steam.

195
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,223
Cooking, cooking.

196
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,575
Good luck. Bye.

197
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Cooking, cooking.

198
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,302
What the hell? This is literally a prison.

199
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,200
Good morning, GEN6 students.

200
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,613
I know many of you still haven't managed to adjust yourselves to this place.

201
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,560
But don't worry.

202
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,360
Previous GENs also faced this same problem.

203
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,760
But as time passes,

204
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
I dare to guarantee that, to you,

205
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,840
this place will feel like home.

206
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,840
This is a prison,

207
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:13,629
not a home.

208
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,144
I want to talk to my dad.

209
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:17,395
I don't want to stay here anymore.

210
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,770
Right.

211
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,231
- We want to go home. - Stop!

212
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,332
Be quiet already.

213
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:25,840
I told you already that if Master Amin doesn't ask,

214
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
you have no right to speak.

215
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,240
Since everyone wants to go home,

216
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,880
let me ask you a question.

217
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,600
What is a home?

218
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,840
It's where we live.

219
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,120
That's it?

220
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,920
Home is where our mind can rest, isn't it?

221
00:21:56,406 --> 00:22:00,526
To me, home is a family.

222
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Your answer sounds interesting, Tibet.

223
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,880
A home is just a place.

224
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:12,125
Sometimes, it's where they hook up with their mistress.

225
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,200
Alright then.

226
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm assigning you to figure out what a home means.

227
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,196
So, are their answers wrong, Teacher?

228
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,880
They aren't,

229
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,160
but they aren't the correct answer for Home School either.

230
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,360
From now on, I want you all to address everyone teaching at Home School

231
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,320
as Master.

232
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:55,069
You must respect and be strictly disciplined to what Masters teach you

233
00:22:55,273 --> 00:23:01,629
while also abiding by Home School's rules, especially our rule 5.

234
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,760
Every student must stay within our school's area only.

235
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,800
You're not allowed to go inside any restricted area.

236
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,440
Don't walk in the forest...

237
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
because you will get lost,

238
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,080
and might be fatally harmed.

239
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,120
Who does that old bastard think he is?

240
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,910
I won't stay here no matter what.

241
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:49,606
Right, I won't stand getting locked up in here.

242
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
What should we do?

243
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,894
Escape. You haven't skipped class, have you?

244
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,254
Outside the fence is just a forest, isn't it?

245
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,449
It won't be a problem.

246
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,999
Help them.

247
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Hurry up.

248
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,960
Hurry up!

249
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:15,965
Wait for me.

250
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,520
White, hurry up. Wait for me.

251
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,360
We're lucky enough...

252
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,000
to have an open-air like this to breathe.

253
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,960
What's your name?

254
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm Nai.

255
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm Maki.

256
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:41,716
Nice to know you.

257
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
You?

258
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
I'm Tibet.

259
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,815
Why did you two want to study here?

260
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,080
You're scholarship students, aren't you?

261
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,255
I came because of my mom.

262
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,360
What about you?

263
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,040
I'm here for myself.

264
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,480
I lived at the orphanage.

265
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,600
There's no chance for me to study at any good school.

266
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,960
I think this school can pave the way for me.

267
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,600
Here?

268
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:15,525
Don't you think this place is strange?

269
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,596
It's full of weird rules.

270
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
No school courses out there would involve getting students drugged.

271
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:28,949
But what's stranger than this place is your family.

272
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,279
They knew full well what you would be facing here,

273
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,685
but they still tried to pass the exam...

274
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
to let you study here.

275
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,360
(All Home School's GEN6 students,)

276
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,280
(please gather in the meeting room now.)

277
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,520
(All Home School's GEN6 students, please gather in the meeting room now.)

278
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
What? Where are others?

279
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,061
Where have they been to?

280
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,177
Pennhung saw them escape from here.

281
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,493
Do we call this skipping school?

282
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,360
Escaping?

283
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
But it's the forest outside.

284
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:24,705
True.

285
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,732
They already warned us that it's dangerous, didn't they?

286
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:29,241
You're right.

287
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:32,357
Do you think they're alright now?

288
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,720
I think this forest is so frightening.

289
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:48,981
I have an important matter to inform you of.

290
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,795
Your friends escaped from Home School.

291
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:56,608
This is against our rule 5,

292
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:59,374
so all of you must take responsibility.

293
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,160
How do we take responsibility?

294
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:10,775
You must search for them and bring them back to Home School.

295
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
Pardon?

296
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Why do we have to search for them?

297
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,315
It's the duty of Masters, isn't it?

298
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:18,214
We've just moved here.

299
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:19,815
We aren't familiar with the route.

300
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,511
If we search for them in the forest, we might get lost too.

301
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:26,691
Master, you told us yourself that the forest is dangerous, didn't you?

302
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Why are you making us go there?

303
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,839
We aren't even the ones trying to escape.

304
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:33,160
It's because it's your responsibility.

305
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:38,151
According to rule 6, every student must be responsible for each other's life.

306
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:42,199
As GEN6 students, all of you are friends with each other.

307
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,574
How many hours have we been walking?

308
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,240
It has been ages, hasn't it?

309
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,240
When can we get out of this forest?

310
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,720
Hey, guys.

311
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,480
Can we take some rest? I can't go on anymore.

312
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,920
Right. Let's take some rest now. I really can't continue.

313
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,400
Will you guys rest to let Masters find you here, huh?

314
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,026
Come on. Let's go now.

315
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,960
Hurry up. Fine. Let's go.

316
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:26,985
Be more patient, okay?

317
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,530
What the heck? We've been walking for long,

318
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:30,835
but I haven't drunk any water. We're almost there.

319
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,400
Mek? Mork?

320
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,040
White.

321
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,040
Can you hear us?

322
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:42,465
Jingjai. Hugo!

323
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:44,356
Jean!

324
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,760
White.

325
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,320
Jingjai!

326
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Let's go in different directions to look for them.

327
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,985
The forest is scary at night.

328
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,636
We must find them before it gets dark,

329
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:03,464
or we could be in danger.

330
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:10,135
Pheng and Biw, you go with Nai.

331
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:15,448
Tibet, Pennhung, and I will go in another direction.

332
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:16,925
Okay.

333
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,840
Be careful, guys.

334
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:29,081
White! Jingjai!

335
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Mek!

336
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,800
Can you hear us?

337
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,600
Jingjai.

338
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,600
Hugo!

339
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,520
White!

340
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,026
Hey, how about returning to Home School for now?

341
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:01,777
What's with you, Mork?

342
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:03,707
Are you already scared?

343
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,151
I'm scared that we might get stuck in this forest all night.

344
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,206
If we go back, I don't know how they will punish us.

345
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:13,566
I won't go back.

346
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,480
I choose to stay outside rather than be locked up in there.

347
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,935
I don't want to go back either,

348
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,160
but I agree with Mork this time.

349
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:26,227
Those Masters told us it's dangerous in the forest.

350
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:28,252
It's getting dark now.

351
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:29,797
You cowards.

352
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,600
If you aren't brave enough,

353
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
you shouldn't have come with us from the start.

354
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,920
You're such a chicken.

355
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,200
What did you say again?

356
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,080
I said...

357
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
you're a chicken.

358
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,120
Apart from being a coward, you're also deaf, aren't you?

359
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,120
Whoa, jerk.

360
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,120
Stop.

361
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,920
- What the hell is wrong with you? - Stop. Let go!

362
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,631
- Stop! - Let go!

363
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:05,015
Stop!

364
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
It's not time to fight among ourselves!

365
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
Pull yourself together already.

366
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Anyway, I'm going back to Home School.

367
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,320
Follow me if you're going too.

368
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,160
White, what about you? Are you coming with us?

369
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,760
No. I'll go back to Home School.

370
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,800
Up to you. You silly.

371
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,640
Hugo. Jingjai.

372
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,400
White.

373
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,000
Mork!

374
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,520
Hugo!

375
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Maki, wait for me.

376
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,803
Are you sure this is the right direction?

377
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:28,366
We're just walking back toward the direction we took earlier.

378
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,520
Fuji, look at so many wounds you have.

379
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,800
Are you alright?

380
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,775
- You're bleeding a bit too. - I'm okay.

381
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Really?

382
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Everyone, be quiet.

383
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,240
What's happening?

384
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,120
I think I heard something.

385
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,080
White!

386
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,865
Fuji. White.

387
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,769
- White. - Hurry up.

388
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:20,457
Hugo. Jingjai.

389
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,160
Fuji. White.

390
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,840
Hey, over there.

391
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,840
Come this way now.

392
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
White.

393
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
White.

394
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
White.

395
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,680
What's going on?

396
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:45,385
Why are you looking like that?

397
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,530
I heard someone's scream in the forest.

398
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,280
Someone's scream?

399
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,120
What do you mean?

400
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,964
It's someone's scream.

401
00:33:55,989 --> 00:33:57,832
It sounded like someone was being tortured.

402
00:33:58,363 --> 00:33:59,824
Which direction did the sound come from?

403
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,040
Over there.

404
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Maki, where are you going?

405
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,320
I'll find out what that sound is.

406
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
But I think we'd better go back now.

407
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,280
Look at Fuji. She has wounds all over her legs.

408
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:29,640
Alright.

409
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,792
Let's go back to Home School.

410
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:35,050
Hey, do you know the direction?

411
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,878
This forest is like a maze.

412
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:41,582
We've been walking and getting lost in here for many hours.

413
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,565
We won't get lost.

414
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,605
Pennhung can take you guys back.

415
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
You remember the direction, Pennhung?

416
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:52,962
I don't.

417
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:53,975
What?

418
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,160
But Pennhung made some marks.

419
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh, how clever you are.

420
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,080
Pennhung thinks we must head that way.

421
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
You did a great job.

422
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:46,081
Master Praeporn will be taking care of your friends now.

423
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:47,535
Please follow me.

424
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,040
But some of your friends haven't come back.

425
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,159
You must find everyone.

426
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,331
Master, I think you should help us search for them.

427
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:16,691
The forest at night is very dangerous.

428
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,613
We're still young.

429
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:21,309
Won't adults like you try to do something about it?

430
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,640
Pennhung thinks what you're doing now is not right, Master.

431
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,152
Adults are supposed to take care of the younger ones, aren't they?

432
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:30,020
But I told you already...

433
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,400
that you must be responsible for the lives of your friends,

434
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
who are in the same GEN.

435
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,400
If something happens to anyone, it's your fault.

436
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,628
Good luck to you.

437
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:45,286
You're touring the forest today.

438
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,161
Good luck to you.

439
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:48,981
You're touring the forest today.

440
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Good luck.

441
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Hey.

442
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,953
I'll go with you.

443
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:08,860
I'm part of the causes of this whole thing that put you in trouble.

444
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,400
Hugo. Jingjai.

445
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,800
Can you hear me?

446
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:31,895
Hugo.

447
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,120
Jingjai.

448
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,734
I just don't understand.

449
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:40,625
Why aren't Masters helping us search for them?

450
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,930
How could they let us do this on our own in the forest?

451
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,828
Head Master mentioned that,

452
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,547
according to rule 6,

453
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,070
every student must be responsible for each other's life.

454
00:37:54,683 --> 00:37:57,988
But that shouldn't be the reason they forced responsibility on us, right?

455
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,240
Guys, do you feel something?

456
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,480
What is it?

457
00:38:22,574 --> 00:38:24,523
I feel someone has been following us.

458
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:25,860
A ghost?

459
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:27,719
Or a tiger?

460
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:32,720
Tibet.

461
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,000
I think it's someone.

462
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
Someone?

463
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,840
But there's nothing around.

464
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,160
Why are they walking fast?

465
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Ow!

466
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,280
Why did you scream?

467
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,760
You scared me.

468
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,008
I shouldn't have come with you guys.

469
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:17,424
I should have returned to Home School with White.

470
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,960
Hey, it's your decision, isn't it?

471
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,578
Who would have thought men like you would suck at this?

472
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:30,581
What can a woman like you do then,

473
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,320
apart from complaining?

474
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
What's your problem with me complaining, huh?

475
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:35,945
- Why? - Hey.

476
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,570
Hey, enough.

477
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:39,032
- Look at her. - Jerk.

478
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,160
I said, stop.

479
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,840
Do you smell something?

480
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,080
What smell?

481
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,200
Ew.

482
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:13,118
Oh!

483
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:27,226
Hey, run!

484
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Ouch!

485
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:30,225
Ouch!

486
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,480
Ouch! Wait for me! Hey!

487
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,120
White!

488
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,369
Biw, I can't do this anymore.

489
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,120
Let's take some rest.

490
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,322
Sit here, Pheng. Take some rest.

491
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:57,174
How could those Masters leave us in the forest like this?

492
00:40:57,987 --> 00:40:59,878
Aren't they worried about us at all?

493
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,501
Let's hurry up and find them,

494
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:05,286
so we can return to Home School.

495
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,200
Do you think we can find the right direction to go back?

496
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,980
We've been walking around here for so long.

497
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:14,176
We're already lost in the forest, aren't we?

498
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,120
Guys, the light went off.

499
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,488
Why are we even here?

500
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:26,536
I want to go home, Biw.

501
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,720
Don't worry.

502
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,520
I'll get you out of here.

503
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,840
I promise.

504
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
Let's go.

505
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Hey!

506
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,793
Where is Jingjai?

507
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:17,747
I don't know. I've been running with you.

508
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:19,676
Damn it.

509
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,040
I'm going back to help her.

510
00:42:22,065 --> 00:42:24,145
Wait. Are you serious?

511
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,035
We just heard that damn sound, didn't we?

512
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,098
I'm going.

513
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:41,020
Ow! Damn it.

514
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:44,025
Why am I here?

515
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,160
Hugo.

516
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,040
Jingjai.

517
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Hugo. Jingjai.

518
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Hey, help me.

519
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:56,735
I'm here.

520
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,480
Can you hear me?

521
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,280
I'm here. Hey.

522
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,560
Help me.

523
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:03,745
I'm here.

524
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,800
I'm right here.

525
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,583
Can you hear me?

526
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:09,841
Jingjai!

527
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,040
I thought I would be dying in here.

528
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:18,065
It's alright. We're already here to help you.

529
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,690
Are you hurt?

530
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,880
I fell down. I can't stand up.

531
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:24,905
I don't know if my leg is broken or not.

532
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,120
Let me check.

533
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,360
Slowly.

534
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
Ow, it hurts.

535
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,497
I think you just sprained your ankle.

536
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:43,107
But don't put much weight on this foot.

537
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,175
Let's hurry back to Home School,

538
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
and let Master take care of it.

539
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Okay.

540
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,360
Please hold this for me.

541
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,680
Ow!

542
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
It hurts so bad.

543
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,440
Since everyone has been found,

544
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
let's return to Home School.

545
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:53,085
Master Amin,

546
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,440
I would like to ask you something.

547
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,960
Go ahead.

548
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,364
You planned the whole thing that happened today, didn't you?

549
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:05,667
My answer is both "yes"...

550
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:06,935
and "no."

551
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,760
It wasn't my plot to make you escape from Home School.

552
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,040
It was your own choice.

553
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
What about "yes"?

554
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,120
It was my intention to make you go out there

555
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:29,853
and search for your friends on your own,

556
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:32,558
and I had been watching you.

557
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,991
Are you saying you had been following us that whole time, Master?

558
00:45:37,312 --> 00:45:38,535
What for?

559
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,520
To make all of you here remember that...

560
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,160
from now, you're home for each other.

561
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:51,932
Home is not a place,

562
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,655
but it's a friendship.

563
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,913
You must rely on each other and mustn't leave anyone behind.

564
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:07,038
And this is your first lesson here at Home School.

565
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,514
If you clearly understand this already,

566
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:18,038
feel free to leave...

567
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,200
and get enough rest.

568
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,560
Be ready for the first day of the term.

569
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,360
Please.

570
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,160
(Rin, wait for me here.)

571
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,139
(After I handle everything, I will hurry back and pick you up.)

572
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:37,851
While you're here, don't tell anyone that you're my sister, Rin.

573
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,709
You're Maki.

574
00:47:40,082 --> 00:47:41,785
Got it, Maki?

575
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:49,745
Run, where are you going? I don't want you to go.

576
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,043
I have to.

577
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,080
Take good care of yourself...

578
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,720
until I come back to pick you up.

579
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,000
You must promise me that you will come back.

580
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,360
I promise.

581
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,600
Rin, keep in mind that,

582
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,858
no matter what happens,

583
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,200
don't go to Home School.

584
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,720
Please take care of my sister.

585
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,040
What are you looking at, Maki?

586
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:04,975
Who is he?

587
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,520
His name is Run.

588
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,960
He's my favorite student.

589
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:20,614
And how is he doing now?

590
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,920
(Directed by Kanittha Kwunyoo)

591
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,440
Run! If anyone stops, I will make you all run 5 more rounds each.

592
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:44,255
Our parents didn't pay an expensive tuition fee for us to eat this.

593
00:49:44,342 --> 00:49:45,582
Can that person cook us new ones?

594
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,000
Each of you must take care of one duckling well.

595
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:52,775
If anyone fails to do so. that person will be punished.

596
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,840
I don't see any benefit from caring for those stupid ducks.

597
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,949
Can you stop acting like you're our leader?
