1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,412
I also want to fight my nightmare.

2
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,409
I don't know what caused this recurring nightmare.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,692
Are you sure

4
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,689
you're ready to face the truth?

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,689
Tibet.

6
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,699
I know now.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,969
So what happened?

8
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,505
When I was a kid,

9
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:14,500
my memory was deleted.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,986
Every Master knows my true identity?

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,169
They know I'm Rin, Run's sister?

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,466
Then why did you pretend you didn't recognize me, Master Amin?

13
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,399
Since your intention is to hide your identity from everyone,

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,733
I should respect what you want, shouldn't I?

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,706
Did I get the scholarship to study here

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,009
because it was your intention?

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,019
No.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,413
You got accepted because of your potential.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,986
What is your relationship with my dad, Master Amin?

20
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:02,266
Bodin is just your stepdad.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,960
He's a stepdad who hurt you.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,893
You don't even have to call him Dad now.

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,786
You hypnotized me and deleted my memory

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,986
because my stepdad ordered you to do it, right?

25
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:21,133
No, again.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,826
I did so because your brother begged me.

27
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:37,733
Master Amin, I want to ask you something about Run.

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,040
If I can give you the answer, I will.

29
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,800
Run shot Dad Bodin

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,173
because of what happened to me, right?

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,333
Why didn't you answer?

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,060
Why did Run do that?

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,266
And where is Run now?

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,719
What happened to my brother?

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,253
It's not yet the right time.

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,426
You'll find out about everything soon.

37
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,613
Please be patient and trust me.

38
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,200
Believe in Home School,

39
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,506
and you'll find out the truth about everything.

40
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:25,666
When?

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,946
Please believe in Home School.

42
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,601
Where am I now?

43
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:43,579
You're in the treatment room.

44
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:45,680
But don't be scared.

45
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:50,534
It's where we'll help cure you.

46
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,854
Am I sick?

47
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,600
You're sick

48
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:58,161
because of the violence someone has done to you.

49
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:20,974
After this, your hurtful memories will be gone.

50
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:24,930
You won't remember what happened today,

51
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:30,614
as well as me, your doctor.

52
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:57,547
The treatment starts when this light goes off.

53
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,541
Why are you sitting here?

54
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:56,267
Sometimes adults refuse to tell us about some matters,

55
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:02,147
claiming that we're still kids, who aren't ready.

56
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,141
It feels so uncomfortable

57
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:10,214
to be in a box those adults have set.

58
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,814
But I won't agree to.

59
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:20,570
I won't follow the plan Masters order us to do.

60
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,680
But if we don't follow it,

61
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:27,881
we won't find out what Home School is really trying to do.

62
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,667
Can you trust Master Amin, Tibet?

63
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,427
I can't answer that either.

64
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:53,161
I just want to know what my dad's project is.

65
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,333
The only way for me to find out the truth is

66
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,867
agree to do what Home School wants us to do.

67
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:17,227
What if

68
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,641
the truth disappoints us?

69
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:29,134
What will we do then?

70
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,507
It's better than

71
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,501
living while knowing nothing.

72
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:41,841
I'm tired.

73
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,400
Master Champ is so tough.

74
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,680
True.

75
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,680
I couldn't catch him up.

76
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:55,240
Luckily, the girls went back already.

77
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:57,241
If White sees me looking like this,

78
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,547
she will keep teasing me.

79
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,143
Why?

80
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,195
Why do you have to make sure you look handsome only in front of White?

81
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:06,193
I must keep cool, you know.

82
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,396
I like her.

83
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:10,769
I see.

84
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,169
Have you told her how you feel?

85
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,803
Actually, I told her once that

86
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:20,803
I like a girl like her.

87
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:23,516
Do we consider that confessing love or not?

88
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:24,962
That sounds like

89
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:26,688
she must analyze what you said on her own.

90
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:28,682
It's similar to when we watch a movie

91
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,623
and have to catch up with the plot.

92
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:33,342
But I like that type of movie.

93
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,863
It looks kind of smart.

94
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:37,503
But people interpret things differently.

95
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,596
If she interprets it wrongly,

96
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,129
then it's game over.

97
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,049
You're right.

98
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:47,489
So what do you like about White?

99
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:53,463
I like her because she's being herself.

100
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:56,062
She has a cool personality too.

101
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:57,302
I see.

102
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:00,036
Your ideal type is someone who is radical, right?

103
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:01,392
My ass!

104
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,862
I mean she's cool.

105
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,082
I see. She is.

106
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,542
Don't tease me.

107
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:08,942
How about Maki and you?

108
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:12,116
Is there something between you two?

109
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,422
Nothing much.

110
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,689
We just held hands last night.

111
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,876
Eh?!

112
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:20,623
You're wicked, Tibet.

113
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,729
Have you told her your feeling?

114
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,969
Not yet.

115
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:28,249
It seems Maki doesn't pay much attention to this thing.

116
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:32,183
But White and Maki held Pennhung's hands before.

117
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:35,942
Oho.

118
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:39,036
Then you must teach us, Professor.

119
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:41,996
Pennhung, who do you think is the prettiest girl here?

120
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,449
Um.

121
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:49,238
Well, everyone is equally pretty.

122
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:53,752
But the girl who likes croissants will look the prettiest to Pennhung.

123
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,739
How about the most handsome boy?

124
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:01,738
Well, everyone is equally handsome.

125
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,161
But the boy who likes croissants

126
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:06,552
will look the most handsome to Pennhung.

127
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,219
I love croissants.

128
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:13,748
Then Nai is the most handsome boy in Home School.

129
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,779
Did you hear that, Tibet?

130
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,738
Whatever.

131
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,192
Let's go now, handsome boy.

132
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:20,548
Pennhung, let's go.

133
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:21,792
Are we eating croissants?

134
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:23,139
I'm joining you.

135
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:31,992
Pheng, look at her.

136
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,379
Who gave you that, Jingjai?

137
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,525
Hugo did.

138
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:43,468
Does this mean

139
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,218
you two are already in a relationship?

140
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:47,458
No, we aren't.

141
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,459
What?

142
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,258
So what do you define this status then?

143
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,125
Um.

144
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:54,538
I think the status between you two is pretty clear.

145
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,108
Well, we haven't defined our status.

146
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,658
Honestly, we've never talked about

147
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:02,485
whether we should be in a relationship or not.

148
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,845
Do you like Hugo?

149
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:07,552
I think I do.

150
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:11,188
What are you waiting for then?

151
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:12,099
Just date him.

152
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,388
Wait.

153
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,278
Jingjai, let me ask you again.

154
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,698
Are you sure you want to date Hugo?

155
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,871
Why?

156
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,888
A man only treats you well when the relationship has just started.

157
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:24,138
But as time passes, when he gets bored of you,

158
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,525
he will turn into an asshole.

159
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:27,551
Come on.

160
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,548
Not every man behaves like that.

161
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:30,578
Whatever works for you.

162
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:32,338
I just want to warn you.

163
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,628
It's fine.

164
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,672
I happen to like bad boys.

165
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,508
Right. You don't have to worry about her

166
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:41,778
because Hugo is a consistent asshole.

167
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,779
He really is.

168
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,778
That's harsh.

169
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:46,828
By the way,

170
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,272
do you girls have a crush on anyone?

171
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,165
I used to have a crush on Nai,

172
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,259
but he didn't like me.

173
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,725
I think Nai already has a crush on someone.

174
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:02,752
Who?

175
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,359
It's not me, of course.

176
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:10,485
Is it White?

177
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,272
Nai once said he likes a girl like me,

178
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,939
but that doesn't mean he likes me.

179
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,498
Come on.

180
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:20,878
The meaning is similar, isn't it?

181
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,018
How about you?

182
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,298
Do you like him?

183
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,112
Or do you like someone else?

184
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,072
Answer now.

185
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,979
Why is everyone targeting me, huh?

186
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,838
Hey. Ask Maki.

187
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:35,790
She's smiling.

188
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,403
Ask her now.

189
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:37,099
I want to know.

190
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,979
Maki, who do you like?

191
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,578
I don't have time to think about this thing.

192
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,278
Come on.

193
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,578
That's not true.

194
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,378
Tell me

195
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:47,725
so we won't like the same guy.

196
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:49,138
Eh?

197
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,845
Does that mean you have a crush on someone, Biw?

198
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:57,779
Hey.

199
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,992
Your body is as curly as your hair now.

200
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:01,165
Just say it.

201
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,438
I think Jean is pretty cool.

202
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,738
Whoa.

203
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,805
You like Jean?

204
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,311
That Jean?

205
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,378
What do you find good about him?

206
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,152
Come on. He's cute and cool.

207
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:16,245
Right?

208
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,552
How about you, Fuji?

209
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,352
Is there any guy who interests you?

210
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:22,788
But I think

211
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,418
the twins could be your perfect match.

212
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,418
You can date two guys.

213
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:27,478
- Mek and Mork. - Fab.

214
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,405
Well then,

215
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:29,671
I'll give one to Maki.

216
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,325
Maki, I take one, and you take the other.

217
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,952
Good morning, Headmaster.

218
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,068
Stop talking nonsense already.

219
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,908
I have something to inform you today.

220
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,308
From now, our class schedule will be changed.

221
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:50,068
You must take separate classes,

222
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:52,952
based on what each Master has picked for you.

223
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,918
Headmaster,

224
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,348
why must we do that?

225
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:06,005
To prepare yourselves for the treatment process.

226
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:09,832
Treatment?

227
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,999
Let me see.

228
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:33,578
Before we start the treatment process,

229
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:37,765
I want you to eat the cupcakes in front of you.

230
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:40,679
Let's do that before we start.

231
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,258
Did you bring what I told you?

232
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,019
Your important item.

233
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,324
Why did you ask us to bring it, Master?

234
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,319
It's part of our lesson.'

235
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,899
What if I don't eat it?

236
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,709
That's fine.

237
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,619
But you must leave

238
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,392
to wait for your friends who eat the cupcakes

239
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,205
to adjust themselves for the treatment.

240
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:26,939
Do you think this world is fair to women like us?

241
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,058
Of course, it isn't.

242
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:31,379
We're living in a male-dominated country.

243
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,658
Whenever women ask for something,

244
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:34,979
people say they're too demanding.

245
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:38,558
I do understand that not every woman is good.

246
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,338
But when women demand what they deserve to get,

247
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,339
they shouldn't be looked down on.

248
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,019
This is the last gift

249
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,832
my brother bought for me.

250
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,152
How about you, Mork?

251
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,272
It's my family photo.

252
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:58,472
It's so important to me

253
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,589
because I think we'll never get to take another one.

254
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,472
I want you to put it in there.

255
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:23,712
If I compare myself with one thing,

256
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:28,659
I think I'm like a Little Match Girl.

257
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:32,525
What's the reason, Pheng?

258
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,272
Seeing you two always reminds me of a sentence by Christopher Columbus.

259
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,552
What's the sentence?

260
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,392
You can never cross the ocean

261
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:48,032
until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.

262
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,628
Saying this means you put something in the cupcakes, right?

263
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:54,629
That's correct.

264
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,912
These cupcakes contain the medicine

265
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:00,579
that will help you enter the treatment process.

266
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:02,198
I'm curious.

267
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,045
What do you mean by treatment?

268
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:05,912
What treatment is it?

269
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,828
We're curing you,

270
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:11,952
so you will be ready to live in the society.

271
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,299
Hey?

272
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,189
I was kicked out of my house.

273
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:27,029
Nobody cares about me.

274
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,639
I have no home to go back to.

275
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,259
The only thing I can do is

276
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:39,139
light a match and think of my past happiness.

277
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,098
Master.

278
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:47,099
Why are you doing this?

279
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:53,752
But Pennhung doesn't see you as a Little Match Girl.

280
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,512
Why?

281
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,508
In the end of that fairy tale,

282
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:02,765
that girl freezes to death alone.

283
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,908
But Pennhung and other friends

284
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:10,765
certainly won't let Pheng freeze to death alone.

285
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:13,445
Thank you, Pennhung.

286
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:18,378
I think men like to judge us.

287
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:19,671
When our outfits are too revealing,

288
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:20,239
they insult us,

289
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,751
and when our outfits are too polite,

290
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,511
they tease us for looking like aunties,

291
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,179
while, in fact, these clothes are our choices.

292
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,285
How come they become others' problems?

293
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:32,708
To me, the worst thing is victim blaming.

294
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:35,028
Whenever there's a problem,

295
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:37,218
people choose to blame women first

296
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,219
while they're actually victims.

297
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,965
That's right.

298
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,078
When women are harassed,

299
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,018
they are blamed for wearing too revealing clothes.

300
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,098
I don't understand why people don't learn to teach men

301
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:52,112
to behave well and respect women too.

302
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,005
You keep sticking to what you're used to.

303
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:57,722
You keep dwelling on your past days

304
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,818
that you can't turn back time to fix.

305
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:03,878
Do you know that these are your weaknesses?

306
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,308
I don't get it.

307
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,419
What's the purpose?

308
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:08,338
If I don't eat it,

309
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,019
does that mean I can't be cured?

310
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:14,259
It helps you get into the treatment process more easily.

311
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,405
It's part of Home School's curriculum.

312
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:22,911
How about you, Pennhung?

313
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:24,909
What do you think you resemble?

314
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:33,589
Pennhung thinks Pennhung is like a twisted croissant.

315
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:36,588
Why a twisted croissant?

316
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:40,068
When people go to a bakery to buy croissants,

317
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:45,148
they always choose the one that looks nicest and yummiest,

318
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:48,779
and the one that doesn't look nice will remain as the last piece.

319
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,748
But Pennhung thinks

320
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:55,938
a twisted croissant is not different from any other croissants.

321
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,765
Though it's not perfect,

322
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,339
it's as yummy as others.

323
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:04,605
You understand it correctly.

324
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:08,112
This society is unfair to women like us.

325
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,758
But what hurts more is that

326
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,352
some women are still willing to be suppressed

327
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:19,508
and forced to be what men want them to be.

328
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,138
They keep setting a standard of what women should be,

329
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:25,498
while, in fact, women have freedom to be themselves.

330
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:28,308
They can feel good about who they are,

331
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:29,885
without being judged.

332
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:32,309
You can never move forward

333
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,499
if you don't leave these things behind.

334
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,152
I'll destroy your weakness.

335
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:41,679
Nobody can hurt you anymore.

336
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,278
Headmaster,

337
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,579
what is your purpose of having this conversation with us?

338
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,272
I want you all to have a belief.

339
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:57,798
I want you to believe in your thought.

340
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,578
Believe in your self-worth.

341
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,378
Believe that you can change this rotten society that suppresses us.

342
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:09,218
Don't ever let anyone determine what your value is

343
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:11,068
or what you can do

344
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:12,871
just because you are a woman.

345
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:14,005
Do you understand?

346
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,118
Yes.

347
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,485
I do, Headmaster.

348
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,098
Everything has its own value.

349
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:25,778
Don't let others judge your value.

350
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:31,685
Home School students are always valuable to us.

351
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:36,112
I'll make you strong like I am.

352
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:14,219
Trees.

353
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:16,925
Breezes.

354
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:18,919
Pennhung

355
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,219
with Pheng

356
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:25,072
and ducklings.

357
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:27,949
They're small

358
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,189
and like to eat....

359
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,552
What do they like to eat?

360
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:35,899
Croissants.

361
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:41,428
They like to eat croissants.

362
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:42,819
One more time.

363
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:45,604
Trees.

364
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,599
Breezes.

365
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:50,549
Pennhung

366
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:53,399
with Pheng

367
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,868
and ducklings.

368
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,512
They're small

369
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:04,325
and like to eat croissants.

370
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,339
It's your turn, Pennhung.

371
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:13,312
Pennhung's Baby Duck

372
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:16,832
eats a lot.

373
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:20,512
It grows up fast.

374
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:25,258
Smart.

375
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,939
It's also smart.

376
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:30,198
Pheng.

377
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,978
Can you help Pennhung sing?

378
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:33,979
Of course.

379
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,965
Pennhung's Baby Duck

380
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:43,179
eats a lot.

381
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,045
It grows up fast.

382
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,992
It's also smart.

383
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:50,525
What's next?

384
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,832
I brought you your light meal, Mr. Run.

385
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,632
Why did you bring it today?

386
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,979
It's Master Praeporn's responsibility, isn't it?

387
00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:29,565
Home School is now starting the treatment process.

388
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,139
Every Master is not available.

389
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:35,379
Please enjoy it.

390
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:38,299
Wait.

391
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,139
Can you stay and talk to me?

392
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,792
But Master Amin ordered me

393
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:50,512
not to talk to you.

394
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,045
Let's just have a short conversation.

395
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:56,992
In the past, when I was still studying,

396
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:00,299
you enjoyed talking to me, didn't you?

397
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:05,109
But...

398
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,392
But I'm not feeling so sure

399
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,028
because you...

400
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,285
I won't do that to you, Master Phoban.

401
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:18,279
I just really want to talk to you.

402
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:23,005
Sure, Mr. Run.

403
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,005
But let's not talk for too long.

404
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,645
Just this is already enough.

405
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:40,965
Master Phoban, you're the kindest in Home School.

406
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,285
You're polite and humble.

407
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:52,005
But some say I'm too obedient.

408
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,019
You once told me

409
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:58,269
you're too obedient

410
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,525
because your mom also is.

411
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:14,125
Look at me.

412
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:19,939
On the day

413
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:22,579
you went back to see your mom for the last time,

414
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,392
what did you see?

415
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:42,339
I saw Mom lying at the stairs landing.

416
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,472
Dad hurt Mom.

417
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,205
Dad hurt Mom.

418
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,232
Whenever my dad got drunk,

419
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,239
he hurt everyone.

420
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,259
Then what happened?

421
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,059
I needed a place to hide.

422
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,359
I needed a place to hide,

423
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,285
so Dad wouldn't find me.

424
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,059
And what are you waiting for?

425
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,739
Master Amin!

426
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,232
Great job.

427
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:07,752
You never disappoint me, Run.

428
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,229
And I'm glad

429
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:16,845
you always remember well what I taught you.

430
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:18,838
I remember everything.

431
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:21,379
I also remember what you deceived me.

432
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,299
You're my favorite student.

433
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:26,838
Until now,

434
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:32,228
nobody and no student can be as talented as you are.

435
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:33,882
What do I get from being talented?

436
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:35,432
I'm locked up in here anyway.

437
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,238
That's because you don't believe in Home School.

438
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,898
You don't open up your mind to receive the treatment.

439
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,148
I'm not sick.

440
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:45,379
You are.

441
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:47,671
You have changed a lot.

442
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:49,669
You're not Master Amin I used to know.

443
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,958
I can only hope that your sister won't follow what you did,

444
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:09,885
or else, she will be locked up like you are.

445
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,392
Wake up, White.

446
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,859
What's going on?

447
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,912
Why am I here?

448
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,618
Maki.

449
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:41,739
Tibet.

450
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,352
Nai.

451
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:46,752
Everyone is being in a trance.

452
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,628
In a trance?

453
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:50,152
What do you mean?

454
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:53,432
It's a state of hypnosis.

455
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:56,668
It's one of the steps of this treatment.

456
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:57,918
Hypnosis?

457
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,028
For what?

458
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:00,778
For curing you.

459
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,779
We aren't sick.

460
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:08,458
Every student at Home School has a wound

461
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,605
that needs to be healed.

462
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:13,838
You also do.

463
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,598
Your wound makes you hate those adults,

464
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:21,379
who like to slander you and call you a bad child.

465
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,958
Your aunt betrayed you

466
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:27,179
and tricked you into living here.

467
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:31,925
Did I tell you this whole thing, Master?

468
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:33,179
You did.

469
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,619
But don't worry.

470
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:38,159
Your story will be a secret,

471
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,259
just like your friends' stories are.

472
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,405
Why haven't they woken up yet?

473
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:06,698
Hey?

474
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:08,398
What's going on?

475
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,979
How come I am here?

476
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,718
Jingjai and Hugo acted strange

477
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,899
because they ate the cupcakes like we did, right?

478
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:20,699
They didn't.

479
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,085
They didn't eat the cupcakes.

480
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:27,832
They ate something stronger.

481
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:40,125
Master, why did you ask us to come here?

482
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:42,752
Do you want us to do something for you?

483
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:47,458
No.

484
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,152
I'm not making you do anything.

485
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:52,645
I just want to give you some sweets today.

486
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:54,162
Do you think we are kids?

487
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:55,445
You're giving us sweets.

488
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:57,819
Yes.

489
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,818
To me, you're always kids.

490
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:01,518
When kids behave well,

491
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,712
they must get some sweets.

492
00:34:02,713 --> 00:34:04,525
Am I right, kids?

493
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:10,798
But do we only get that jelly?

494
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,158
Um.

495
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,070
Isn't that too little?

496
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:13,992
Just one?

497
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:15,278
Relax.

498
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:18,668
If you behave well, you'll get some more.

499
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:20,038
I guarantee

500
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,245
you'll get many more rewards.

501
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:31,548
Let's do it.

502
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:34,579
This is our first time getting a reward.

503
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:37,379
But those four won't get it.

504
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,699
Though it's just a jelly,

505
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:42,152
I'll eat it.

506
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:06,392
Why didn't I get the jelly today?

507
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,885
It depends on the amount of medicine needed in each treatment.

508
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,358
Will I get the same thing tomorrow?

509
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:18,152
It depends on whether you can recall it or not, Master.

510
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:25,045
Can you now recall who was with you in the forest that night?

511
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:27,219
Do you really want me to say it?

512
00:35:29,445 --> 00:35:30,445
Yes.

513
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,158
It was you, Master Praeporn.

514
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,965
You were with me that night.

515
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:32,512
You're GEN6 girls who are selected

516
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:37,818
to receive the treatment today.

517
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:42,499
I want all of you to open up your mind as much as possible

518
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:49,232
and believe in what Home School is going to teach.

519
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:52,205
Please believe

520
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:56,219
you can change into a better person.

521
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,952
You can become a new person, ready to enter the society

522
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,339
and change it.

523
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:11,598
Everyone, please kneel down,

524
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,458
close your eyes,

525
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,765
and clasp your hands at your chest.

526
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:32,339
Now, think about the past versions of you

527
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:35,118
because from now on,

528
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,019
the old version of you won't exist anymore.

529
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:42,165
Remember all the cruelty you have faced.

530
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:45,139
Remember it.

531
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,179
Fuji, open your eyes.

532
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:58,179
You're the first one to receive the treatment.

533
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,992
Master Phoban,

534
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,819
bring the selected GEN6 boys here.

535
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,179
Yes.

536
00:40:26,605 --> 00:40:27,979
Alright, Fuji.

537
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:32,285
I'll start the treatment for you now.

538
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,165
Do you know that

539
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,818
16-year-old kids like you are like pieces of white cloth,

540
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,819
which is so innocent?

541
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:43,885
That isn't true.

542
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:46,859
I think that sounds super boring.

543
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:52,818
Why are kids limited to being defined as a white cloth

544
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:54,819
and innocence,

545
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:59,139
while they can actually choose what they want to be?

546
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:05,165
Fuji, you can also choose what you want to be.

547
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,499
You can change it, Fuji.

548
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:13,499
You can make a change.

549
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:23,512
Master, what do you want me to change?

550
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:27,165
Your mindset.

551
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:32,379
Are you ready to let me change it?

552
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:35,339
I'm ready, Master.

553
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:45,979
From now,

554
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,525
this will be extremely cruel to your feelings.

555
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:53,708
(I earned money to send you to study, )

556
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:55,708
(not fight with others!)

557
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:57,272
(Is this what you should do, huh?)

558
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:58,992
(You're shameless!)

559
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:02,739
(I earned money to send you to study, )

560
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:04,678
(not fight with others!)

561
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,084
(Is this what you should do, huh?)

562
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:08,165
Your dad never sees your value. (You're shameless!)

563
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:10,990
(Having a daughter is like having a toilet in front of the house.)

564
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:14,632
He devalues you because you're just a woman. (This is exactly why I didn't want to have one.)

565
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:16,108
(It's embarrassing!)

566
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:17,549
(How dare you talk to me like that?)

567
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:19,604
(A daughter is useless!)

568
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:21,598
(I didn't want to have a daughter.)

569
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,152
(I earned money to send you to study, )

570
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,711
(not fight with others!)

571
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:25,898
Why would you care about that kind of person?

572
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:27,598
(You keep making me feel embarrassed.)

573
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,119
What do you think a 16-year-old kid can do to the adult?

574
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:32,511
(You're shameless!)

575
00:42:32,512 --> 00:42:34,509
You can change it, Fuji.

576
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,978
You can take revenge.

577
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:39,298
(Try to behave like your little brother.)

578
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:41,338
(This is exactly what Papa said.)

579
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,120
(Having a daughter is like...)

580
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:42,901
You can change it.

581
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:43,805
(...having a toilet in front of the house.)

582
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:46,605
(I earned money to send you to study, )

583
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:48,838
(not fight with others!)

584
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:53,258
(You keep fighting with boys!)

585
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:54,951
(Is this what you should do, huh?)

586
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:56,979
(You're shameless!) I can change it.

587
00:42:57,979 --> 00:42:59,299
I can take revenge.

588
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:02,698
(Try to behave like your little brother.) I can change it.

589
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:04,699
(This is exactly what Papa said.)

590
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:07,432
I can take revenge.

591
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:08,858
I can change it.

592
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:10,272
(That's why I didn't want to have a daughter!)

593
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:11,112
I can take revenge.

594
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:12,165
(It's embarrassing!)

595
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,872
I can change it.

596
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:15,539
I can take revenge.

597
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:17,838
I can change it.

598
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,619
I can take revenge.

599
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:36,032
White.

600
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,758
White, wake up.

601
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:38,838
Maki.

602
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:40,352
Maki, wake up already.

603
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:42,418
Something happened.

604
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,419
What is it, Pheng?

605
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:48,278
Biw, Fuji, and Jingjai have disappeared.

606
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:49,758
Where have they gone?

607
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:50,539
I don't know.

608
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,831
I woke up and didn't see them here.

609
00:43:52,832 --> 00:43:54,058
I tried searching everywhere

610
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:54,979
but couldn't find them.

611
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,484
How about Masters?

612
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:58,478
I didn't see them either.

613
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:01,765
Why are problems keep coming in?

614
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:04,699
Aren't you tired at all, Masters?!

615
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:10,005
But nobody has disappeared like this before.

616
00:44:10,629 --> 00:44:13,005
Will they be in danger?

617
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,111
Let's take a shower,

618
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:20,109
and hurry outside to search for them again.

619
00:44:21,899 --> 00:44:23,445
Let's go, Maki.

620
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:39,165
How many times have I told you not to smoke in here?

621
00:44:39,712 --> 00:44:42,392
Now, there's something else you should worry about more.

622
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:45,711
Stop behaving like this already.

623
00:44:45,712 --> 00:44:48,445
Home School is now at its important moment.

624
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:50,632
That's why I'm stressed out.

625
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,268
If you're feeling unwell, take some rest.

626
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:55,979
Just forget about other things for now.

627
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:00,478
How can I do so?

628
00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:02,245
I feel sorry for these kids.

629
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:04,832
They aren't ready for it.

630
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:09,805
Relax, Praeporn.

631
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:12,352
You must believe in Master Amin.

632
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:17,632
And do you still believe in him, Headmaster?

633
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:20,778
Do you still believe in him

634
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:23,499
the way you did when Master Puth was alive?

635
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,405
Please watch your words, Master Praeporn.

636
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:32,765
Yes, Headmaster.

637
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:35,005
I'm sorry.

638
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:38,032
I'm just a bit stressed out.

639
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:43,485
Maki just found out the truth about her past.

640
00:45:44,632 --> 00:45:46,629
I feel sorry for her.

641
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:49,659
That girl shouldn't have faced something like this.

642
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:53,725
Because something like this happened to the kids,

643
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:57,632
we must believe in Master Amin

644
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:03,032
though this is against our feelings.

645
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:21,779
Don't worry about your friends who are missing.

646
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,632
They haven't gone anywhere.

647
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:26,429
They are doing fine.

648
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:32,138
Won't you let us know where our friends are?

649
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:35,188
They're inside Home School, Maki.

650
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:38,179
What are you trying to do to us?

651
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:42,472
I'm helping your friends.

652
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:45,712
I'm curing them.

653
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,472
You should believe in Home School.

654
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,938
To make us believe in Home School,

655
00:46:52,939 --> 00:46:54,938
your words alone aren't enough

656
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:58,152
because your action doesn't seem to be trustworthy at all.

657
00:46:58,419 --> 00:46:59,725
That's fine.

658
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:03,468
Soon you'll believe in it

659
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:05,685
like others do.

660
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:07,988
What if we don't?

661
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:09,312
What will happen?

662
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:14,963
One.

663
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:15,699
Two.

664
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:16,430
Three.

665
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:17,299
Four.

666
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:18,030
Five.

667
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:18,683
Six.

668
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:19,499
Seven.

669
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:20,299
Eight.

670
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,508
Turn right.

671
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:22,390
One.

672
00:47:22,391 --> 00:47:23,243
Two.

673
00:47:23,244 --> 00:47:24,003
Three.

674
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:24,870
Four.

675
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:25,712
Five.

676
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:26,310
Six.

677
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:27,219
Seven.

678
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,043
Eight.

679
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:28,910
Nine.

680
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:29,510
Ten.

681
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:30,205
Eleven.

682
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:31,238
Twelve.

683
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,428
Thirteen.

684
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:35,178
Turn left and continue walking.

685
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:36,099
One.

686
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:37,030
Two.

687
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:37,990
Three.

688
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:38,790
Four.

689
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,763
Five.

690
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:40,523
Six.

691
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,524
Seven.

692
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,499
Run, you think you can stop Master Amin, right?

693
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:05,499
Yes.

694
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:08,485
I can do it.

695
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:13,619
I'll help you escape from Home School.

696
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:41,838
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

697
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:42,878
Master Amin,

698
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,402
we can still stop it now.

699
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:47,205
I want to take revenge to get this into their heads!

700
00:48:47,232 --> 00:48:48,431
Master Amin has changed.

701
00:48:48,432 --> 00:48:50,428
He's no longer the person I used to know.

702
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,098
If we want to know what those Masters' plan is,

703
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,738
we must pretend to go with the flow.

704
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:55,042
This time, it's scary.

705
00:48:55,043 --> 00:48:57,311
We don't know if someone will disappear again tomorrow.

706
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,308
I think I've found something.

707
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:01,309
How did we get to this point, Master Amin?

708
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:04,725
It's the point where you and I must kill each other.
