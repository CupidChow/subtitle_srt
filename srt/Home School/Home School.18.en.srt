1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,619
This game is called Revenge.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,249
The kids will start hunting for you.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,591
How can you guys fight Master Prasath?

4
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:08,743
If I were you now,

5
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:11,804
I would be so worried about Maki, White, and Nai.

6
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,208
Are you betraying us?

7
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:14,919
Hurry up!

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
Everyone, stop!

9
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:21,040
Maki!

10
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,444
Maki!

11
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:32,782
Maki, hang in there!

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,275
Why did you do that, Maki?

13
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,426
You must be okay.

14
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:39,410
Don't leave me.

15
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,124
Press the wound.

16
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,502
Run away!

17
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:42,120
No!

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,744
Run away!

19
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:43,126
No!

20
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:44,026
We won't leave you!

21
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:45,848
Maki!

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,288
What a loving group you three are.

23
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:53,600
Run away!

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,297
I'm sorry but I have to do this.

25
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,982
You still like playing games, Prasath.

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,319
It's fun, Master Amin.

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,724
You've gone too far.

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,777
Did you really have to kill?

29
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:42,399
Oh.

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,186
If you're talking about Master Praeporn's death,

31
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,919
I have no part in it.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,417
She was just unlucky.

33
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,250
You're despicable.

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
If I'm so despicable, shoot me.

35
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,564
Why, Prasath?

36
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,857
Don't you like this home anymore?

37
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,995
Of course, I like it.

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,208
Otherwise, why would I be doing this?

39
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,986
But what you're doing is destroying my beloved home.

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,386
Master Amin.

41
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:17,777
I'm fine, Yani.

42
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:18,871
I'm fine.

43
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:26,568
I've decided to fight you myself, Prasath.

44
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,306
I will not go anywhere.

45
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:33,555
I will protect this home until my last breath.

46
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:42,246
Maki!

47
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:43,091
Nai!

48
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:43,911
Can you hear me?

49
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:44,915
Maki!

50
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,689
Maki!

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,719
Can you hear me?

52
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,760
Maki!

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,459
Everyone, run!

54
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,244
Run away now!

55
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:02,186
Maki, come on!

56
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:03,324
Maki!

57
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,549
Maki, get up!

58
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,799
Maki!

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,635
Run now!

60
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:08,644
Maki!

61
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,002
Maki!

62
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:13,662
White!

63
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:14,783
- Maki! - Can you hear me?

64
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,279
What should we do?

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,431
They're nowhere to be found.

66
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:22,889
Keep looking.

67
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,302
Don't be discouraged yet.

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,069
Maki!

69
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,235
Nai!

70
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:29,230
Hang in there.

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Maki.

72
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,185
I can't hold on anymore.

73
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:40,180
Hang in there, Maki.

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,017
You will be okay.

75
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:43,044
Do you understand?

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,720
Maki.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,493
Let go!

78
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:52,839
Let go, Master Phoban!

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,440
Let go!

80
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:56,289
I will not let you hurt the kids again!

81
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,169
You want a piece of me, huh?

82
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,351
As you wish!

83
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,559
You think you're so tough, huh?

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,564
Huh?

85
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,622
Kids!

86
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,782
You girls stay here.

87
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,666
I'll distract him.

88
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:36,977
No.

89
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,524
Don't go, Nai.

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,759
You girls run.

91
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,789
Run!

92
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,142
Nai!

93
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Kids!

94
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
Where are you?

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,871
Come out. I know you guys are around here.

96
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,688
Kids!

97
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,350
Good timing. I was just feeling stiff.

98
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:25,271
Shit. Why is he freaking tough?

99
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,426
We're almost there.

100
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:35,269
Maki.

101
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,773
Hang in there.

102
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:38,569
Slowly.

103
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,724
We're almost there.

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,346
Maki.

105
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:43,706
Are you okay?

106
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,213
We're almost there.

107
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,248
Come on.

108
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,399
You know what, Nai?

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,183
I've been through worse than that

110
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:04,471
but I didn't understand why I kept fighting with others when I was a kid.

111
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:06,669
Even when I was an athlete,

112
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,377
I didn't understand why I couldn't fix this problem.

113
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:13,332
But as time went by, I started liking it.

114
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,330
I started loving it so much

115
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,769
because I got to let out my feelings of being oppressed.

116
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,471
That's why I teamed up with Master Prasath.

117
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,679
You guys are crazy.

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
I won't let you hurt my friends.

119
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,680
I'll show you I can stop you.

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,488
Try me.

121
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,164
Come on.

122
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Maki!

123
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Maki!

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,426
Stop me?

125
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,582
You can't beat me.

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,344
Maki!

127
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:23,345
White!

128
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,720
Maki, where are you?

129
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,537
Stop me, huh?

130
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,911
Maki.

131
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,059
Maki.

132
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,271
No. What should I do?

133
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,591
I can't hold on anymore.

134
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,088
You must hang in there.

135
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,719
Don't say that, please.

136
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,680
Maki.

137
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Run.

138
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,610
I want to see Run.

139
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:52,302
Sure.

140
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,119
I will take you to him

141
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,555
but you must hang in there, okay?

142
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,795
Get up.

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,869
We have to get back.

144
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,960
Maki.

145
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,395
You want a piece of me, huh?

146
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,110
Will you surrender now?

147
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,262
Maki, don't fall asleep.

148
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:28,328
Maki.

149
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,857
Maki.

150
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,850
I want to see Run.

151
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:33,555
Sure.

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,142
I will take you to him.

153
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:39,813
Maki!

154
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,235
Nai!

155
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:42,319
- White! - Tibet.

156
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,448
Tibet.

157
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,657
Maki!

158
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,742
Maki.

159
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:50,977
Help!

160
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,271
Maki.

161
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
Maki.

162
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,639
It's alright, Maki.

163
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,653
Maki.

164
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,650
Maki.

165
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,954
Maki, it's alright.

166
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:04,835
I'm here.

167
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,159
You'll be okay.

168
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,369
Maki.

169
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,739
Maki, promise me

170
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,595
you'll hang in there.

171
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:13,622
Please.

172
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,506
Since you love playing games so much,

173
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:23,560
let's play a game, shall we?

174
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,328
What game, Master Amin?

175
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,213
Let's bet on our beliefs.

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,631
Bet on our beliefs?

177
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,568
What beliefs?

178
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:49,155
I believe none of the kids will turn into monsters like you want.

179
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:54,200
Deal.

180
00:10:54,577 --> 00:11:00,764
I'm sure one of the Home School kids will kill someone.

181
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:08,050
Ooh.

182
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,799
Maki.

183
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,879
Maki, you'll be okay.

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Maki.

185
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,404
Run.

186
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,844
I don't want to die.

187
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,746
Maki.

188
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:21,889
You must hang in there.

189
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,471
Listen to me.

190
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:23,579
Promise me.

191
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,373
Please.

192
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:25,511
Please, Maki.

193
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,510
Maki.

194
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,013
Maki.

195
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,119
Don't fall asleep, Maki.

196
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,355
Hang in there, Maki.

197
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,600
Hang in there.

198
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,189
Maki!

199
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,951
Maki, wake up!

200
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,029
Maki, wake up!

201
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,573
Maki!

202
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Maki!

203
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,337
Maki!

204
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,849
Tibet, listen to me.

205
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,991
Hurry take Maki back to Home School.

206
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,244
Maki!

207
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,071
Where are you going, Run?

208
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,017
I'm going to kill him.

209
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,431
Run!

210
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,906
Maki!

211
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
Stay still.

212
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,400
Let go!

213
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,328
Let go!

214
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,959
You're so damn strong for a girl.

215
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,320
Dad!

216
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,262
Where are you?

217
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,373
Hey!

218
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Hugo!

219
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,639
Shoot!

220
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,982
Shoot me

221
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:16,462
so I'll die as you wish.

222
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:19,214
Don't challenge me.

223
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,559
You think I'm challenging you?

224
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm not.

225
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,617
I want to die and leave this awful world already

226
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,052
so I can see my brother!

227
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:30,049
You have no right to talk about Hunter like that.

228
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,453
Why can't I talk about him?

229
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,857
Because you're the reason Hunter…

230
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Blame me all you want, Dad.

231
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,204
You hate me anyway.

232
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,589
Kill me!

233
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,039
Shoot!

234
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,328
Do it!

235
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,727
Jean,

236
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:04,719
I can't do this anymore.

237
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,213
Please stop.

238
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,684
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,130
Give me some gratitude.

240
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,866
Jingjai, I'm sorry.

241
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:20,240
Please let me live.

242
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:23,049
I won't do it again.

243
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,799
Jingjai.

244
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,404
Please let me go.

245
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:31,909
Mek, what should we do with her?

246
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,826
You caught her?

247
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:33,929
Good.

248
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,746
Hold her tight.

249
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,169
Seize her.

250
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,599
Why are you standing there?

251
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,522
Slap her!

252
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:39,820
- Shut up! - You ungrateful daughter!

253
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:40,821
Shut up!

254
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,382
Slap her!

255
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,973
Shut up, you old bastard!

256
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,528
You're the one who should be slapped!

257
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:50,859
Biw!

258
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,869
Let go!

259
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,240
This is not the Biw that Pennhung knows.

260
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:57,768
Biw is one of the most goodhearted friends Pennhung knows.

261
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,949
That Biw is weak.

262
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,871
She got lied to by her dad.

263
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,289
That Biw is gone.

264
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,288
That's not true.

265
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:10,209
The Biw who protected me was not weak.

266
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,599
I believe that Biw is still inside you.

267
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,034
No matter how bad things get,

268
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,030
we'll get through it.

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,702
How dare you say that to an adult?

270
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,372
Excuse me.

271
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:24,369
What respect does an adult who keeps beating up his child

272
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,339
and hurting women even deserve?

273
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
Huh?

274
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:31,589
Are you confused?

275
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,186
I can beat you up so you'll stop being confused.

276
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,799
Let go!

277
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,189
I said let go!

278
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,124
No!

279
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,419
Stop it, Biw.

280
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,222
Damn it!

281
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,149
You guys are so annoying!

282
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,973
I'll keep being annoying

283
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,690
because you're my friend.

284
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,564
Biw.

285
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,702
Biw, dear.

286
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,088
Why did you come back?

287
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,817
Didn't you escape?

288
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,749
Do you want to die?

289
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,804
Hey.

290
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,644
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,060
Please stop hurting your friends.

292
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,208
Can you stop acting like a good man

293
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:39,559
when the real you is so despicable?

294
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,342
You lied to people.

295
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,890
You even lied to me.

296
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,697
I know.

297
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,689
I'll take responsibility for it.

298
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,115
Just please don't do this anymore, Biw.

299
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,875
Please let me go.

300
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,570
You deserve to die.

301
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:11,270
You know what, Prasath?

302
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,007
No matter how deep

303
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:19,161
in the dark we humans find ourselves,

304
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,109
there's always

305
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:27,277
light at the end of the tunnel.

306
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,346
Kill me!

307
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:07,589
Shoot!

308
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,129
Do it, Dad!

309
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,639
Shoot me!

310
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,991
What are you waiting for?

311
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:13,022
Shoot!

312
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,720
No dad wants to lose his child.

313
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,186
I will take responsibility for it.

314
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,563
Just please don't do anything like this again, Biw.

315
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:57,560
How are you going to take responsibility?

316
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,540
I will turn myself in.

317
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,155
And you know why?

318
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,380
It's because of love.

319
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,049
No matter how much others hurt us,

320
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,560
love will keep us from wanting to hurt anyone.

321
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,870
Goodbye, Dad.

322
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
Jean!

323
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,806
Jean!

324
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:01,680
Hey!

325
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,566
Jean!

326
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,567
Hey!

327
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,746
- Jean. - Calm down.

328
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:07,755
Jean.

329
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,520
Calm down, Jean.

330
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:13,365
Love

331
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,444
will make us

332
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,323
forgive.

333
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,462
And start seeing our own worth.

334
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,022
Once we see our own worth,

335
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:37,688
we'll never turn into monsters.

336
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,106
That's not always the case, Master Amin,

337
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,977
because revenge can make us do anything.

338
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:10,510
You're so stubborn, Nai.

339
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,915
I told you that you can't beat me.

340
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:22,693
Master.

341
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Run.

342
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,328
It's good that you're here.

343
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,080
We can finally get this over with.

344
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,349
You shot my sister.

345
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,386
I'll kill you.

346
00:21:42,115 --> 00:21:43,546
Do it, Run.

347
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,528
If you can.

348
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,269
Are you sure you want to fight me?

349
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,351
I want to ask you that as well.

350
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,266
Are you sure you want to fight me?

351
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,217
I'm not afraid of you.

352
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,444
From now on, there's no Master and Student.

353
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,928
Did you forget something, Master?

354
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:15,586
What?

355
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I want you to think of what you love doing the most.

356
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,782
What's your favorite thing to do, Master?

357
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:44,822
Punch.

358
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:48,429
Then start doing it.

359
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,653
Punch yourself.

360
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:03,650
Keep punching.

361
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,946
Keep punching.

362
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,613
You like it, don't you?

363
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,128
Keep punching.

364
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:14,644
Harder.

365
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:16,413
Keep going.

366
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,271
You like it, don't you?

367
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,542
Keep going.

368
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:22,540
Don't stop.

369
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,342
Harder.

370
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:24,560
Keep going.

371
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,006
Harder than that.

372
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:26,933
Harder.

373
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:27,951
Harder.

374
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,649
I said harder!

375
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,649
Harder!

376
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,799
Keep punching!

377
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,342
Don't stop.

378
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:34,779
I said don't stop!

379
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,724
Keep punching!

380
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:36,826
Keep going!

381
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,960
Run!

382
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,142
Don't!

383
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,293
Run!

384
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,431
Don't do it. I beg you.

385
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:56,871
I can't let someone like him live.

386
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,617
Please don't do it, Mr. Run.

387
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:00,666
Run,

388
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,853
if you do it, Master Prasath will win.

389
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,146
Damn it!

390
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,346
Mr. Nai.

391
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,275
Please help my sister.

392
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,431
Don't worry, Run.

393
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,662
Your sister will be okay.

394
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,573
I promise.

395
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,733
I'm glad you all are back to normal.

396
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,339
Yes.

397
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,039
Don't be like that again.

398
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,368
Especially you, Jingjai.

399
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,013
I won't hurt anyone again.

400
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,355
Thank you.

401
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,629
Thank you all for agreeing to save Home School.

402
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,622
There's no need to thank us.

403
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:15,288
Once we eat them, we'll forget this, right?

404
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,874
That's right.

405
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,870
Once all of you've eaten them,

406
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,817
Home School will erase your memory of Project R.

407
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,240
But for those of you who wish to turn yourself in for the crime you committed,

408
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,960
Home School will keep that part of your memory.

409
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
What a shame, Master Amin.

410
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,364
I lost this time.

411
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,471
I hope we get to play games with each other again.

412
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,760
This is where the game between you and me ends, Prasath.

413
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,739
Home School will be on shaky ground without you.

414
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,888
No.

415
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,533
Even without me, this home will still stand strong

416
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,333
because I have someone who will take care of it after me.

417
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,519
Hi.

418
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,653
In that case, can I say something to the future owner of Home School?

419
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,986
Of course.

420
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:30,737
Remember this, Run.

421
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,408
As long as I'm alive, Project R will be brought back.

422
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,533
Maybe not by me but by someone else.

423
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,377
Be careful.

424
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,059
This was such a happy semester for me.

425
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Go.

426
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,426
I'm sorry I locked you up in here.

427
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,739
The Master Amin who locked me up wasn't the Master Amin I loved.

428
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,231
I'm not angry.

429
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,679
Do you know why Prasath locked you up in here

430
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,395
and tried to give you the pills to hypnotize you?

431
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,684
He wanted to win.

432
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,853
He wanted to change my thinking to be like his.

433
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,262
Prasath may have been successful in hypnotizing me,

434
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,666
but he misjudged you.

435
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,404
You're not me.

436
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,262
You're much stronger than me.

437
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:54,799
And that strength is what made Prasath fail to change you,

438
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,239
no matter what he did,

439
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,939
whether it's locking you up, hypnotizing you,

440
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,564
drugging you,

441
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:08,800
or even all those games he played with you.

442
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:16,026
Nothing he did can change who you are

443
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,453
because you know the value of humans.

444
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,053
You see the value of love.

445
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:43,930
And you don't let anger or hatred turn you into a monster.

446
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,017
Thank you, Run,

447
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:55,650
for protecting Home School.

448
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,675
Tibet, I'm really recovered.

449
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:23,866
Don't worry.

450
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,564
You were shot so badly.

451
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,262
How can I not worry?

452
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,789
But I'm fine now.

453
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,790
I'm back at Home School.

454
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,639
It's good to have you back.

455
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
I haven't been able to sleep much.

456
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,515
I'm glad you're safe.

457
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,822
I couldn't sleep for many nights.

458
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm sorry I'm the reason you couldn't sleep.

459
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,373
I couldn't sleep because.

460
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,053
I missed you.

461
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Mm.

462
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,635
So,

463
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:24,700
did you sleep well at the hospital?

464
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:27,817
Mm.

465
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:30,124
So,

466
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:35,160
did you miss me?

467
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,150
Mm.

468
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,102
Mm.

469
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,684
Maki.

470
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,008
Run.

471
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:56,786
Ouch!

472
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,240
Your wound still hurts, doesn't it?

473
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,889
Just a little.

474
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,657
Let me hug you again.

475
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:15,964
Very good.

476
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,359
It's so good to have Maki back.

477
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,400
Yeah.

478
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:42,400
What about us?

479
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:45,880
What are you talking about?

480
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:51,733
I once said I liked a girl like you.

481
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:56,880
Isn't that obvious enough?

482
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,088
You want to know how to make it obvious?

483
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,813
I'll tell you.

484
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,711
Come here.

485
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:21,280
That's how you do it, understand?

486
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,577
That's it.

487
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:14,506
The weather is so nice today.

488
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,422
Ms. Pinya,

489
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,413
I've fulfilled my promise.

490
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:52,097
I made Home School every kid's home.

491
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:07,262
I hope to see you soon.

492
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,791
(To Run, )

493
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,697
(if you're reading this, )

494
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,035
(it means I'm no longer in this world.)

495
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:14,560
(I think you already know that Home School is everything to me)

496
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,427
(and you're one of the reasons)

497
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:24,264
(I want to protect this home the best I can.)

498
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,226
The weather is as good as ever.

499
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:28,471
Yes.

500
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,982
Look at that.

501
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:33,022
(It's a shame that I have too little time.)

502
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,637
(I probably won't have a chance to see)

503
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:39,446
(all of you grow up and become adults, )

504
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,289
(But I believe) -Why is it red?

505
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,109
I dyed it.

506
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,695
Really?

507
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:02,137
(you'll be able to take care of your sister well)

508
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:03,160
You dyed it red?

509
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,582
(and you guys will certainly grow up to become good adults.)

510
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,830
(Lastly,)

511
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:17,604
(I want to give all my assets to you, my son.)

512
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,497
(Please take care of Home School for me, Run.)

513
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:20,159
Good morning, Run.

514
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,999
Good morning, Headmaster.

515
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Are you bringing breakfast to Master Amin?

516
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,351
Yes.

517
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:26,888
Let me come with you.

518
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Run.

519
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,053
[Run]

520
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,986
It's been six months, Master Amin.

521
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,902
Everything at Home School is falling into place now.

522
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,280
Pennhung, try playing after me.

523
00:44:20,177 --> 00:44:22,170
(Pheng)

524
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:24,539
(Mm)

525
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,266
(Mmhmmm)

526
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,409
Go, Pennhung.

527
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,946
You can do it.

528
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:40,551
Pennhung will try.

529
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,169
Do you want to sing, Pheng?

530
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,622
Pennhung will play the guitar.

531
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:50,142
Let's sing together.

532
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:51,982
Alright.

533
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:55,519
(Baby Duc)

534
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,982
(Of Pennhung)

535
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:01,370
(Eats a lot)

536
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,142
(It grows up fast)

537
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,733
Smart.

538
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:12,702
Also.

539
00:45:12,703 --> 00:45:14,008
(It's also smart)

540
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:23,319
Pennhung, you're really gifted.

541
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,279
You will play better than me in the future.

542
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,287
That's true.

543
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:29,280
You're really good at this, Pennhung.

544
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,231
Thank you.

545
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,967
Pennhung thinks Pennhung has found

546
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:38,960
something Pennhung likes as much as croissants.

547
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,960
Pennhung likes music.

548
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,946
And…

549
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,973
And?

550
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:50,778
Pennhung

551
00:45:52,137 --> 00:45:53,792
also likes Pheng.

552
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,888
(Master Amin, the classes are going well.)

553
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,946
(Pheng)

554
00:46:01,947 --> 00:46:04,693
(Master Diak is still as kind as ever.)

555
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,448
(She's happy with teaching the kids and being herself.)

556
00:46:09,697 --> 00:46:12,337
(No one is forcing her to be someone else anymore.)

557
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:13,733
Jingjai.

558
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Hmm?

559
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,479
(Headmaster still doesn't like it when students talk in class.)

560
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,831
Ahem.

561
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,289
This is not the time to display your affection.

562
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,675
Focus on the exercise.

563
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:29,822
Yes, Ma'am.

564
00:46:29,823 --> 00:46:33,626
(But Headmaster isn't as strict as before)

565
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,502
(because she's found that the students' happiness is her happiness.)

566
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,549
Hey, twins.

567
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,906
Why do you guys keep stealing Pennhung's croissants?

568
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,713
Stealing Pennhung's croissants makes them more delicious.

569
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:56,284
If you don't believe us, I dare you to try.

570
00:46:56,285 --> 00:46:57,299
Come on.

571
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,262
Help me search.

572
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,559
Alright, fine.

573
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,289
(I've made some changes to Home School's rules regarding food.)

574
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,920
(Now everyone gets to eat good food at every meal.)

575
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:15,709
(But some students still steal food.)

576
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,737
I found them.

577
00:47:19,768 --> 00:47:22,729
Pennhung left you two a message.

578
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,079
Especially for you, Mek, Mork.

579
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,586
From Pennhung.

580
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,799
Wow.

581
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,537
This really is good.

582
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,759
(They get to live the life they deserve.)

583
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,269
Tibet!

584
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,715
(They get to smile, laugh, )

585
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:03,511
(be happy, fall in love, and enjoy their heartwarming friendship.)

586
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,017
Run!

587
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,629
(I think you'd be very happy, Master Amin, )

588
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:16,106
(if you saw how happy all the kids are at Home School.)

589
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,100
(The bad things are gone.)

590
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,026
(From now on, no one will get hurt by their families again.)

591
00:48:32,044 --> 00:48:35,235
(No one will get hurt from being abandoned.)

592
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:41,404
(Because we'll be each other's friends, home, and family.)

593
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,613
(We have each other.)

594
00:48:47,377 --> 00:48:52,995
(Home School is our home and family.)

595
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,431
To Home School.

596
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,426
Don't worry, Master Amin.

597
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:24,275
I will take care of Home School and all the kids the best I can.

598
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:32,428
Run,

599
00:49:33,397 --> 00:49:34,459
it's…

600
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:37,665
Is everything alright, Headmaster?

601
00:49:59,194 --> 00:50:00,385
Zero.

602
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:06,217
Hello, Run.

603
00:50:13,337 --> 00:50:14,661
Do you want some?

604
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:12,530
