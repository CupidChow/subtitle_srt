1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,489
Everyone voted.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,399
You must accept the majority decision.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,529
How can I accept it when Pheng cheated?

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,119
Today’s voting is void.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,569
No one is going home.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,929
Why am I the only one being hated?

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,239
It’s because you refuse to accept the truth.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,720
Get lost.

9
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,026
Maki.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,746
Pheng!

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,840
Pheng!

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,186
Pheng.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,333
It’s me.

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,330
Tibet.

15
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,280
I know

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,760
this is hard for you.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,333
But you didn’t mean to, did you?

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,706
Someone like me deserves no friends.

19
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:15,266
Don’t say that, Pheng.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,613
You have me.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,240
I’m your friend.

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,659
We can still help each other fix

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,080
the mistake you made.

24
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:34,340
It’s already too late.

25
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,539
No matter what I do,

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,933
no one will care about me.

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,859
Everyone hates me.

28
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,120
I don’t, Pheng.

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,733
I want to help you, Pheng.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Don’t be scared.

31
00:01:58,893 --> 00:02:00,890
Let me help you, okay?

32
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,890
What’s up?

33
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,213
Biw, I’m sorry.

34
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,699
I’m sorry about everything I did.

35
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,119
I’m sorry that I deceived you

36
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,879
and lied to you,

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,679
making you feel uneasy.

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,600
From now on,

39
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,600
I won’t do those things again.

40
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,452
I’m truly sorry.

41
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,450
Have you finished?

42
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,339
It’s alright, Pheng.

43
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,199
It’s not easy for her

44
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,969
to forgive you right away.

45
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,609
It may take some time.

46
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,769
But in the end,

47
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,052
I believe Biw and other friends will understand you.

48
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,049
You did well, Pheng.

49
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,050
I’m proud of you.

50
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,333
Everyone can make a mistake.

51
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,649
Life is like taking an exam.

52
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,449
If we pass it,

53
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,906
we’ll learn which answer is right or wrong.

54
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,600
Master Amin,

55
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,319
I have a concern about the course 	we’re teaching the kids.

56
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,760
Everything must follow the curriculum we have designed, Headmaster.

57
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,019
But how can you be sure that everything will go as planned?

58
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,969
GEN6 is not like any other GEN.

59
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,906
That’s why I want us to speed up

60
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:52,339
and proceed to the next step.

61
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,529
As you said, this GEN is not like any other GEN.

62
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,813
We can’t use the old ways with them anymore.

63
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,079
But Master Amin,

64
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,079
if we fail this time just like what happened to Run,

65
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,319
things will even get out of hand.

66
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,586
To me, Run is not our failure.

67
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,289
(Attention, please.)

68
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:31,666
(All GEN6 students, please report to the meeting room now.)

69
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,819
I have an important announcement to make.

70
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,379
There will be an exam tomorrow.

71
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,079
Please be well-prepared.

72
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,239
Shit.

73
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
What freaking exam is it now?

74
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,240
We haven’t studied anything.

75
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,999
What exam are we taking, Headmaster?

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,999
Since the beginning of the term,

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,253
we’ve barely studied anything.

78
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,039
How can we take an exam?

79
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,359
She’s right.

80
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,186
What knowledge do we have to do the exam?

81
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,129
Stop.

82
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,786
Be quiet

83
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,013
and listen.

84
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,219
This exam will test your basic knowledge and skills.

85
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,786
It’s part of our curriculum here at Home School,

86
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:21,379
so do not complain about anything.

87
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,732
If your Master tells you to take an exam,

88
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,730
you must do it.

89
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:34,659
Here comes a surprising exam.

90
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,360
What exam will it be?

91
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,746
I don’t know.

92
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,459
Damn it.

93
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,779
They didn’t tell us

94
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,359
which subject the exam will be about.

95
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,159
Who on earth would know

96
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,666
what to study?

97
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,499
Why are we taking this exam?

98
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,499
All they make us do is nothing.

99
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,746
They just keep testing us

100
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,079
and punishing us.

101
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,773
I’m freaking sick of this.

102
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,139
Just don’t care about it.

103
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,773
You don’t need to study.

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,519
If you fail, you just retake it

105
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,559
because they won’t kick you out of this school anyway.

106
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,745
Well, it happens that.

107
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,740
I’m not a good-for-nothing type like you are.

108
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,809
This is damn boring.

109
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,059
I freaking miss my phone.

110
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,680
This place has nothing fun to do at all.

111
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,499
I freaking want to play the game.

112
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,066
My rank must have been moved down already.

113
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,929
Today’s exam is special,

114
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,226
and it’s meaningful to all of you here the most.

115
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,586
Which subject’s exam are we taking, Master Amin?

116
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,719
It’s the subject,

117
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,559
which requires you to apply every bit of your intelligence,

118
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,733
talents, tactics, and strengths.

119
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,853
For this exam, you need to use everything I’ve mentioned.

120
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,289
Let me repeat this.

121
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:28,546
For this exam, only one student will be rewarded.

122
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,220
Here’s the reward.

123
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,266
Shit.

124
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,520
The phone.

125
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,786
That’s right.

126
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,239
The reward for the person who passes the exam is

127
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,906
the right to use the phone.

128
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,120
You can call anyone you want to.

129
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,539
We’re at a disadvantage

130
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,453
if the exam tests our academic knowledge.

131
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:14,099
You haven’t even tutored us anything.

132
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,369
That’s right.

133
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,946
You didn’t give us any exam guideline either.

134
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:20,169
How can we do it?

135
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,133
True.

136
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,760
This is unfair.

137
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:29,400
Of course, Home School strictly sticks to fairness.

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,893
You can choose to take the exam for the subject you’re good at.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,700
Most importantly, you can do whatever way you want

140
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,130
to pass the exam.

141
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Let me repeat it.

142
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,200
You can do it in any way.

143
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,706
What do you mean by ‘any way’?

144
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,680
It means as explained, Hugo.

145
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,613
There will be three rounds in this exam.

146
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,973
Only those who pass will be eligible

147
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:21,440
to advance to the next exam round.

148
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:24,306
Don’t be sad if you fail

149
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,219
because ever since I’ve established Home School,

150
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,399
there has been only one student who made it to the final round

151
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
and got the reward.

152
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:36,840
Who is that person?

153
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,053
He’s GEN4’s Run.

154
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,039
In the first round,

155
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,969
you have five subjects to choose from.

156
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,480
Maths.

157
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,666
History.

158
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,720
Physical Education.

159
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,866
Agriculture.

160
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,653
Maki, Tibet.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,026
Can I join you?

162
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,519
Sure, Pheng.

163
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,106
And English.

164
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,359
You’re allowed to choose the subject you believe you can do best,

165
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,929
but we do ask you to do it your best

166
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,120
and with your fullest potential.

167
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:03,980
Have you already considered it well enough

168
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:07,290
to choose this subject for your exam?

169
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:14,009
Hugo, why did we choose Maths?

170
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,079
I’m not good at it.

171
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,179
Are you?

172
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,039
Though we aren’t good at it,

173
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,420
someone is.

174
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,379
Trust me.

175
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,732
We will certainly pass the exam.

176
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,730
What are you plotting, Hugo?

177
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,626
It’s none of your business.

178
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,049
Why don’t you take an English exam?

179
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,439
Not your business.

180
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,240
What does it mean?

181
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,120
I don’t get it.

182
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,506
- Right. I know. - Let’s not fight.

183
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:36,106
Alright, students.

184
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,359
Let’s begin.

185
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,160
Please take your seat.

186
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,859
Well,

187
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,333
let me tell you something before we start.

188
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:55,480
Previous GENs usually called me Master Prasat.

189
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,586
Are you curious why?

190
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,733
You will find out soon.

191
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,652
But let me warn you that.

192
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:07,279
Physical Education exam at Home School isn’t easy.

193
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,759
Our exam is a lot tougher and more challenging

194
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,049
than you might expect.

195
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,680
Come on, Master.

196
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:14,979
Don’t try to scare us.

197
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,559
We aren’t afraid.

198
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,809
In the morning, you made us run for many rounds.

199
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,706
I’m telling you,

200
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:23,449
my arm and leg muscles are so well-prepared for this.

201
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,159
You can make us do either sit up or push up.

202
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,940
Just go ahead.

203
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:27,573
We’re not afraid.

204
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,999
Are you making us take an exam

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,026
or trying to scare us, Master?

206
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,680
I really like how brave you are, Nai.

207
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,419
Before our exam begins,

208
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,706
let me ask you why you chose this subject.

209
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:54,449
I like social studies, political studies

210
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,719
as well as history.

211
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,089
That’s why I believe I can do best.

212
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,019
I perform best in social studies,

213
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,889
so I think this subject can help me pass this round.

214
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,439
To me, this subject involves memorization and understanding.

215
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,186
I’m confident that I can do well in memorization.

216
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:17,770
It looks like all of you are confident.

217
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,759
Miss Biw, it seems you aren’t worried at all.

218
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,519
Aren’t you afraid of failing?

219
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,719
This subject isn’t easy at all.

220
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,179
Well, I’m the only person who chose this subject,

221
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,106
which means I don’t have to compete with anyone.

222
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:37,640
So, I have a higher chance to pass, right?

223
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:39,901
Do you think it’s that easy, huh?

224
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,773
There are 100 questions in this exam.

225
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,866
You have 30 minutes to finish it.

226
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,786
There’s only one task for you in this exam.

227
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:02,529
We’ll run and you must overtake me.

228
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,573
If you can do it, you pass this exam.

229
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:08,639
Whoa. This is just a piece of cake, Master.

230
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,279
You have one hour to figure out

231
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,783
what message the author wants to deliver in this passage.

232
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:18,039
Remember that you’re allowed to do anything

233
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,199
to find the answer.

234
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,466
The person who scores the highest will pass this exam.

235
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,199
Those who score low will automatically fail this exam.

236
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Do you understand the rule?

237
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,372
You have to find no fewer than 12 species of flowers

238
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,369
within one hour, Miss Biw.

239
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,613
Do you think you can do it?

240
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,259
Of course.

241
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,666
I’ve learned how to arrange flowers before.

242
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:47,319
All I have to do is find any types of flowers

243
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,093
and arrange them in this vase.

244
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:50,360
Am I right?

245
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,769
Yes.

246
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,729
You have one hour to

247
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,986
answer 20 questions.

248
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,079
Any question?

249
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,599
Hang on, Master.

250
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,719
There are 100 questions,

251
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,413
but you’re giving us just this amount of time.

252
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:08,899
Who will finish it in time?

253
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,893
She’s right.

254
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:12,173
I guess we can’t even finish reading the questions.

255
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:15,866
It’s your problem, not mine.

256
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,026
Master,

257
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,613
we can choose to sit anywhere we want, right?

258
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,239
Yes.

259
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,453
You can sit wherever you want.

260
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,079
You can do any way

261
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,653
to get as many correct answers as possible.

262
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,699
Do it.

263
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,213
I’ll copy yours.

264
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:01,370
Good luck to you all.

265
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,610
You may begin the exam.

266
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,379
To all Home School students,

267
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,759
good luck on your exam.

268
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,619
Please also remember that

269
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,539
only those who pass will advance to the next round.

270
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:51,080
Only one student will get the reward.

271
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:53,690
You may begin.

272
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,026
Huh?

273
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,640
You may begin.

274
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,219
I’ll start now.

275
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,680
Three, two, one.

276
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,173
Hey! Stop it!

277
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,680
Don’t you think what you two are doing is too disgusting?

278
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,089
How are we wrong?

279
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,759
The Master told us himself

280
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,053
that we can do it in any way.

281
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,466
Master Diluk.

282
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,239
Are you sure this is the right passage?

283
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,409
It seems these sentences are not connected.

284
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,386
She’s right.

285
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,380
I can’t understand it.

286
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,919
How can we interpret it?

287
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,919
This is the right one.

288
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,586
It’s your job to find the answer.

289
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,689
Remember that

290
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,626
only the winner will be recorded in the history.

291
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,880
The student who gets the first place will be remembered.

292
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,506
Do you know I made it today because whatever I do,

293
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I must be No.1?

294
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,699
In this world,

295
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,786
nobody cares about those who rank below the first place.

296
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,879
If you can’t be the first place,

297
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,333
don’t show me your school report.

298
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,209
From now,

299
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,569
you can use whatever way you want.

300
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,306
You can either cheat or bribe.

301
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,853
I don’t care about it.

302
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,560
But you must be the first place.

303
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,143
Everyone in our family is second to none.

304
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:28,653
Get this into your head.

305
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,533
Leave!

306
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,399
You have three minutes left.

307
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,173
Who on earth will finish it in time?

308
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,040
Will you let these two cheat on the exam this shamelessly?

309
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,479
As I told you,

310
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,025
you can do the exam any way you want.

311
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:52,020
You decide.

312
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,760
What kind of adult are you

313
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,370
to teach students to cheat?

314
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,440
This means we can help each other.

315
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,453
We don’t have to do it separately.

316
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Let’s help each other, okay?

317
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,120
Deal.

318
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,699
Two heads are much better.

319
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,426
But I’m afraid I’ll be a burden to you.

320
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,680
Pheng, no one is a burden to anyone

321
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
if we help each other.

322
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,440
Master!

323
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:29,466
Master!

324
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,533
Master!

325
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:33,600
Hey! Master!

326
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,520
Ow!

327
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,729
Pennhung, don’t let them copy yours.

328
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,853
Got it?

329
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,499
White, if you don’t shut your mouth,

330
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,052
I’ll tear your answer sheet.

331
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,259
What are you doing, Jingjai?

332
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,986
Hey.

333
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,065
You’re disturbing us while we’re doing the exam.

334
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,059
I’ll do the same thing to you,

335
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,839
so all of us will fail.

336
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,879
Give me.

337
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,760
Jingjai!

338
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:13,972
Students, your time is nearly up.

339
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:15,969
If you don’t speed up,

340
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,970
all of you might fail.

341
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,653
You have one minute left.

342
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,480
I think this passage uses some capital letters strangely.

343
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,089
You’re right.

344
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,813
In English, we only use a capital letter for the first word of each sentence

345
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:53,659
and for a proper noun.

346
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,640
But in this passage, capital letters are used randomly.

347
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,346
Where am I now?

348
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,119
Hey, Master!

349
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,813
I won’t give in!

350
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,400
Master!

351
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,479
What’s your decision?

352
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,826
Do you want all of us to fail

353
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:28,840
or pass it together?

354
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:37,199
Pennhung, let’s help each other do this exam

355
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,813
for these idiots to copy.

356
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,319
What does it mean?

357
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,160
Or is it a sentence?

358
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:16,650
But what sentence?

359
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,333
Three.

360
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:25,053
Damn it.

361
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,106
Two.

362
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,119
How could we catch up?

363
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,489
He is damn fast.

364
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,703
What did he freaking eat?

365
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:37,333
Should we just jump and catch him?

366
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,306
Alone we go fast, but together we go far.

367
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,329
Headmaster,

368
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,849
we’ve got the answer.

369
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,653
One.

370
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,019
Time’s up.

371
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,373
Please stop.

372
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:11,831
Damn it!

373
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,060
Master!

374
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,706
Everyone!

375
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,760
Can anyone hear me?

376
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,329
Help me.

377
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,106
I’m here.

378
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,179
Master, I don’t want to take this exam anymore.

379
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,719
Help me.

380
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,426
I’m here.

381
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,385
Congratulations, Nai.

382
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:04,380
You scored the highest.

383
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,506
You passed this round of exam.

384
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,439
Congratulations.

385
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
All of you passed this exam.

386
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,471
Yay!

387
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,320
You passed.

388
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Master!

389
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Master!

390
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,899
Everyone!

391
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,386
I can’t take it anymore.

392
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,986
Can you get me out of here?

393
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,840
How was it?

394
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:24,290
Do you still find it a piece of cake?

395
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,413
I can’t bear it.

396
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,769
We give up.

397
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,186
I can’t go on.

398
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:38,200
Master, aren’t you tired at all?

399
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,920
Master, you should become a national runner.

400
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:45,540
I used to be a national athlete.

401
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:49,013
Wait.

402
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,809
Seriously, Master?

403
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,480
Yes.

404
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Oho.

405
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:57,209
Why would I lie to you?

406
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,986
Then why did you become Home School’s Master?

407
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:02,799
It doesn’t matter why.

408
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,066
What matters now is that you failed the exam.

409
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:07,826
Master Phoban.

410
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,426
I thought I would die in the forest.

411
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,559
I’m here to help you, Miss Biw.

412
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,240
But as for now,

413
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,240
you failed the exam.

414
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
You two failed the exam.

415
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,413
Join others in the meeting room.

416
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,439
But don’t be glad yet.

417
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
This is just the start.

418
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,689
From now, there won’t be a regular exam anymore.

419
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:56,200
You must compete against each other

420
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,906
because only one student will get the reward.

421
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,439
Those who passed the exam,

422
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,719
please report to Master Praeporn’s class

423
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,059
to prepare for the next round.

424
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,653
Those who failed,

425
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,266
please gather in the meeting room now.

426
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:46,573
Run, let’s see if GEN6 students could perform well like you did.

427
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,209
Whoa. Mork?

428
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,880
Someone like you failed the exam.

429
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:11,880
What a sight for sore eyes.

430
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,480
Shut up.

431
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,659
Why must I?

432
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,699
I won’t.

433
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,520
You failed the exam.

434
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:19,931
What’s the point of saying that, huh?

435
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:21,492
- Why? I just want to. - Do you want me to knock you out?

436
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:23,489
Why are you two fighting?

437
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,939
You scared me.

438
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,693
You’re so scary.

439
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,899
I can’t believe someone like you could pass a Maths exam.

440
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,689
I’m smart, you know.

441
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,059
I had a trick.

442
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,199
You just cheated.

443
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,133
You can’t say you’re smart.

444
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:40,879
What a toxic trait you have.

445
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,866
Congratulations to all of you who passed the first round of the exam.

446
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:49,939
In this second round, I’ll be your examiner.

447
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,359
But before we begin,

448
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,866
please listen to the rule carefully.

449
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,659
Think, analyze, and distinguish

450
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,839
the task in this exam thoroughly.

451
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,049
If you can do these,

452
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,720
you’ll certainly pass the exam.

453
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,106
So what exam are we taking this time?

454
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,440
Please get changed, everyone.

455
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:20,960
For what?

456
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,049
Is this a group exam, Master?

457
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,306
But why are the chairs facing one another like that?

458
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:54,979
I guess you’re making us play the Musical Chairs Game.

459
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,779
That’s right.

460
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,573
This exam is similar to the Musical Chairs Game

461
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:01,480
you’re already familiar with.

462
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,093
Huh?

463
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,039
Are you kidding?

464
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,786
Why are we taking such an exam?

465
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:07,773
What’s the point?

466
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:12,209
You’ll get to see true colors.

467
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,679
You must do whatever you can to get to sit,

468
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,959
but it’s not exactly the same as the Musical Chairs Game

469
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,760
you played when you were young.

470
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,626
The rule for this exam is

471
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,839
you must find a space to sit until the music stops.

472
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,026
When the music stops,

473
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,626
those who aren’t sitting will automatically fail the exam.

474
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,999
There will be three rounds in this exam,

475
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,759
and we’ll keep reducing the number of chairs in each round.

476
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,399
What kind of exam is this?

477
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,200
It’s totally nonsense.

478
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,906
At Home School,

479
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,386
no exam is considered nonsense,

480
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:52,220
but if you don’t want to do it,

481
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:54,889
feel free to give up your chance.

482
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,329
A very important rule for this exam is

483
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,919
as long as the music is still playing,

484
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,893
you can do whatever to get to sit.

485
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:08,866
Any question?

486
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:12,379
Are you saying that

487
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,533
violence is also allowed here?

488
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
If I use it, I won’t be wrong, right?

489
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,419
You can use violence,

490
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,973
state your reasons to convince your friends,

491
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:27,773
or beg them.

492
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,770
It’s your right to do so.

493
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:37,680
You’re also allowed to do anything to protect your seat.

494
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,213
Alright.

495
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,779
If there’s no more question,

496
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,400
let’s begin the exam.

497
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,453
Biw, who do you think will pass this round?

498
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,279
I think those boys will.

499
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,179
I don’t think girls can beat them.

500
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,053
Being girls doesn’t mean we’re always losing, does it?

501
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,186
Hey. Let’s bet

502
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,373
who will fail first.

503
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:25,466
Deal?

504
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:27,319
What do we get from betting?

505
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,692
Just to satisfy ourselves.

506
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,652
Those who guess it right will get to smack

507
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:32,773
those who get it wrong on their heads.

508
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,969
Deal.

509
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,826
This is damn nonsense.

510
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,120
I think Pennhung can’t catch up with others.

511
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,679
I think Pheng will be eliminated first.

512
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,706
Wait and see if you don’t believe me.

513
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:55,559
But I think it will be either Hugo or Jingjai.

514
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,659
Why are you saying so?

515
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,560
It’s because they’re assholes.

516
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,520
They deserve to be eliminated.

517
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,769
Awesome.

518
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,466
Am I right?

519
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,200
I didn’t say you’re wrong.

520
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,360
Please be ready.

521
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:36,139
The exam begins in

522
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,960
three, two,

523
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:40,960
one.

524
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,611
Ow!

525
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:46,386
Move.

526
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:47,859
White!

527
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,039
Pheng, sit.

528
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,760
Pennhung, sit.

529
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,000
Damn it.

530
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,679
Hugo, how could you do this to me?

531
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,679
I’m sorry, Beauty.

532
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,899
But this is an exam.

533
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,279
Please understand me.

534
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,733
Damn you.

535
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,440
Hey, the music is still playing.

536
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,026
Hey, Jingjai.

537
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:44,860
Steal Pheng’s seat.

538
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,839
She doesn’t deserve to pass the exam.

539
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,680
She bullshitted us before.

540
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,493
Yeah. You’re right.

541
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,319
Pheng, get up.

542
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,653
Will you stand up or not?

543
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,969
Stand up now.

544
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:03,800
Let go of me.

545
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,531
- It hurts. - Jingjai.

546
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,291
Jingjai, stop.

547
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:06,799
-Jingjai, don’t do that. -I want your chair.

548
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,371
Get up.

549
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,211
I’ll sit here.

550
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:09,519
You don’t deserve to pass the exam.

551
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,064
Stand up now.

552
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:10,640
Let go of me.

553
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,291
It hurts.

554
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:12,080
Enough already.

555
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,800
Get up.

556
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,546
Jingjai.

557
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,626
You won’t, right?

558
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,899
Get up!

559
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,973
White!

560
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,969
If you dare, give up your seat.

561
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,520
But if you do so, I’ll steal yours.

562
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,385
White.

563
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:54,380
Why would you care?

564
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,729
Pheng is bullshitting us.

565
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,386
Don’t you remember what they did to us?

566
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,639
You two are even worse.

567
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,009
Are we?

568
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,179
So what?

569
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,999
Don’t be so shameless.

570
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,179
You pushed Pheng.

571
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,706
So what?

572
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:09,999
I followed the rule.

573
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,039
What freaking rule?

574
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,359
Do you still have a human’s heart?

575
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,559
You also pushed me first.

576
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,719
That served you right.

577
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,680
If you’re brave enough,

578
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,264
get up.

579
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:16,866
Why must I?

580
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:18,049
You pushed her first.

581
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,840
Will you give up your chair or not?

582
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:20,049
I can’t stand you anymore.

583
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,624
I can’t either.

584
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,719
You’ve been behaving like this so many times.

585
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,532
- Hugo and you. - You started it first.

586
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:25,439
I have borne with you so many times already.

587
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,064
So what?

588
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:26,800
Will you get up or not?

589
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,453
I won’t.

590
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:29,449
Give up yours if you want.

591
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,692
I can’t stand you anymore!

592
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:31,863
I told you to get up!

593
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:33,133
What will you do to me?

594
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,906
Please. Don’t fight.

595
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,693
Beauty, don’t give in.

596
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,120
Come.

597
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,011
Bring it on!

598
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:38,680
Come.

599
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,986
You’ve always made such a confident face.

600
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:45,999
Don’t fight.

601
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,119
Pennhung doesn’t like it.

602
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,293
Don’t fight.

603
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,199
Bring it on.

604
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,639
Don’t fight.

605
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,399
Don’t be such an asshole.

606
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,626
I can’t take it anymore.

607
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:58,899
I want to slap you!

608
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,089
Go ahead!

609
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,040
Bring it on.

610
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,453
- Don’t fight. - Bring it on!

611
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,693
If these chairs are such a problem for us,

612
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,986
just destroy them.

613
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:19,173
Let nobody pass the exam.

614

615
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,173
As long as the music is still playing,

616
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:48,186
you can either start again or remain sitting.

617
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,499
Come!

618
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,049
Doing this won’t help!

619
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,252
Only one student will get the reward.

620
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,199
I think those Masters are messing with our heads.

621
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,579
It’s the only way we can do to get Run back.

622
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,119
I’m searching for my brother.

623
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,613
It’s the reason I came to study here.

624
00:41:04,614 --> 00:41:06,160
You mean GEN4’s Run?
