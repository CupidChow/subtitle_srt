1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,520
And finally,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,640
Home School you’ve seen now, has been successfully founded.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,200
Did Dad adopt me because of the woman called Pinya?

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,840
He adopted your sister and you to put on a front.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,160
So you wanted me to kill him because of this, right?

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,160
Thank you so much,

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,480
but if Dad sees this, I’ll probably…

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,960
You’ll be fine.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,960
You can stop and go inside.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Did you already talk to Dad?

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
I will talk to him.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,960
Don’t worry.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
I can’t deal with him anymore.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,280
I don’t know why he’s so cruel to me and my sister.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,760
If he doesn’t love us, why did he adopt us?

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,960
I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,360
Sometimes, my head orders me to fight back.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,040
Run, if we fight violence with violence,

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,040
in the end, we’ll turn into a beast.

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,160
But if the world is this awful, being a beast is probably better.

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,720
That’s not true.

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,200
That’s not true, Run.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,240
You can still be yourself.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,480
You’re worth more than that.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
Don’t give up.

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,640
Don’t decrease your worth

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,440
just for one bad person.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,200
Don’t let yourself become a beast.

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,960
Then what should I do

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
to stop Dad from hurting me?

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,560
There’s a way to stop your adoptive dad

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,400
without using violence like he does.

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,800
How?

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Attend Home School.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,120
Alright.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,960
I will attend Home School.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,040
I promise you here that I will help you in every way.

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,640
I will help you become stronger

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,680
and I will help you become a new person.

40
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,840
All my thoughts have changed

41
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,800
since the day I found out I’m dying.

42
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,440
Is that why you’ve changed?

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
2017

44
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,040
Is your illness that serious?

45
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
I can only say that I probably can’t live for as long as I should.

46
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Then get treatment abroad.

47
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
They might have a way to cure it.

48
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,920
I can’t leave Home School yet.

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
Why not?

50
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Why would you die for Home School?

51
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,160
For Ms. Pinya’s dream.

52
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,320
Pinya is long gone.

53
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,240
Why do you care?

54
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
How can I leave Home School when you’re like this?

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,160
What are you talking about?

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,520
I don’t understand.

57
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,800
You would never understand, Mr. Bodin,

58
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,800
because you never care about anything in your life other than yourself.

59
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:56,253
How dare you say that to me, Amin?

60
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,780
I’m so sad I can’t live for much longer

61
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:08,032
but I’m glad that you’re going to die before me.

62
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,432
What are you talking about?

63
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:20,432
Why did you bring the gun?

64
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:27,392
You will use this gun to take your own life.

65
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:30,032
What nonsense are you talking about?

66
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:32,032
But before you die,

67
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,992
you will change everything in your will.

68
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:40,472
In particular, you will give me the sole ownership of Home School.

69
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:43,872
Why would I do that?

70
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:57,632
Sometimes, when you face life and death,

71
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:01,632
some of your thoughts will not be the same.

72
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:08,592
But did you really have to kill my dad?

73
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,472
Bodin killed himself.

74
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,152
You hypnotized him.

75
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:19,552
He deserved to die anyway.

76
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:24,752
Who’s that?

77
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,392
Who?

78
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,792
What are you doing, Amin?

79
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,352
What are you doing?

80
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:47,112
Shall we play a game, Mr. Bodin?

81
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,832
Even though Dad was a bad man,

82
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:12,712
your solution was just as bad.

83
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:24,592
I did everything for you, Run.

84
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:33,072
This reason of yours

85
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:39,232
is why I’ve always believed

86
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:42,112
I killed Dad

87
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:47,312
and the Master Amin I loved and respected.

88
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:20,512
What’s up, Master Prasath?

89
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:23,952
I want to report on the progress of Project R.

90
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:29,140
There will be some delays.

91
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,716
You’ve been wasting time playing your game.

92
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,552
That’s what’s delaying it.

93
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,792
I’m sorry, Master Amin.

94
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:39,592
Never mind.

95
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:43,342
Tonight I will go to the treatment room myself.

96
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,037
Are you sure that’s a good idea?

97
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,912
You’re not very healthy.

98
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,592
If Project R is any more delayed,

99
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:57,952
I will probably not live to see the success of it.

100
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:01,952
Alright, Master Amin.

101
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:03,712
Wait.

102
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,392
Sir.

103
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:11,312
Let me ask you something, Prasath.

104
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,112
What is it?

105
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:18,712
Does changing our plan to do this

106
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:27,432
make us the beasts we hate?

107
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:31,552
Why do you think so?

108
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:39,352
I’ve recently been dreaming about the past about Run.

109
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:47,392
It makes me hesitate and confused.

110
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:53,152
About what? Are we doing the right thing?

111
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,192
There’s nothing right

112
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,792
about taking revenge.

113
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:06,258
I think you’re just tired from treating Run.

114
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,711
May I volunteer to treat him from now on?

115
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,936
Maybe it will be a success this time.

116
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:17,792
Please don’t forget to take the pills I’ve prepared for you.

117
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:20,872
I’m worried about you.

118
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:56,872
Tibet.

119
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,392
Tibet.

120
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,312
Tibet.

121
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,312
Tibet.

122
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:17,352
Where are we?

123
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:19,352
The infirmary.

124
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:27,952
Do you remember anything? How did we end up here?

125
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,713
I only remember that...

126
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:36,576
I saw you faint and tried to call the Master to check on you

127
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:39,752
but I wasn’t doing well either.

128
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:44,192
Are you feeling better?

129
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:45,272
Yeah.

130
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,352
I’m feeling better now.

131
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,952
What about you?

132
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,952
My legs hurt a bit.

133
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:59,032
Of course they are.

134
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,032
We were kneeling for so long.

135
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:05,472
I wonder if that crazy punishment is over yet.

136
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,032
It is over.

137
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,272
You don’t have to reflect on your mistake anymore.

138
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:25,152
What about our missing friends? Have they returned?

139
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:29,552
You just woke up and you’re looking for trouble already?

140
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:36,192
Many of our friends disappeared. How can we not worry about them?

141
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,192
What is Home School doing to us?

142
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:44,912
You all are in the preparation stage for Project R.

143
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,072
Project R?

144
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:51,872
What is it?

145
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:54,672
If you want to know,

146
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:57,598
go check out

147
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:01,936
what’s hidden inside the Winnie-the-Pooh book after classes.

148
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:06,072
It’s Master Puth’s experimental record.

149
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,392
You’ve known all along?

150
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:13,672
Everything at Home School is carefully planned.

151
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:17,549
You’re just little kids following the breadcrumbs

152
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:22,291
that Master Amin leaves.

153
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:26,000
Why do you Masters have to make it complicated?

154
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,072
Why didn’t you tell us from the beginning?

155
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:30,872
Wouldn’t that be easier?

156
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,912
That wouldn’t be fun.

157
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,912
I have a test for you.

158
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:14,272
Please answer my questions based on your feelings,

159
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,472
Hugo.

160
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,392
Yes, Master Amin.

161
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,392
Which place do you feel is not safe?

162
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,592
The forest or the meadow?

163
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:35,592
The forest.

164
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:42,432
Which place do you feel is not safe?

165
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:46,592
The forest or home?

166
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:52,752
Home.

167
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,752
Which one do you hate?

168
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,992
The snake or the centipede?

169
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,752
The centipede.

170
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:10,072
Which one do you hate?

171
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:14,992
The centipede or death?

172
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,952
Death.

173
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:26,638
Is your older brother the reason

174
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:29,376
that you hate death?

175
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:33,912
Yes.

176
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:43,152
Which one do you hate more?

177
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:50,392
Death or your father?

178
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,432
I can’t answer that.

179
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,432
Why can’t you?

180
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:09,272
It’s not difficult at all.

181
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:11,392
Answer the question.

182
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:14,032
Which one do you hate more?

183
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:20,672
Death or your father?

184
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,072
My father.

185
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,992
I hate my father.

186
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:31,752
Last question.

187
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:39,632
What will you do to the thing you hate?

188
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:04,312
I think Home School punishments are teachings and lessons

189
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,712
we have to interpret and understand.

190
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:10,712
Tibet, can you fast-forward to see if we can find something more?

191
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,552
Tell me about your friends.

192
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:21,312
We fight the most often.

193
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:24,912
You mean Zero?

194
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:25,712
Yes.

195
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:26,552
Zero.

196
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:29,352
How do you feel when you fight with Zero?

197
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:36,992
If we don’t fight, we’ll probably be good friends.

198
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,632
Run is only talking about studying at Home School.

199
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:41,472
None of this is about Project R. Even though we’re different,

200
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,952
I think we both understand pain.

201
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:54,272
Stop the video, Tibet.

202
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:57,512
Why?

203
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:58,552
This is it.

204
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,552
This is the treatment room.

205
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:14,192
I’m sorry I had to cover your head like that.

206
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:16,792
Everything here is a secret.

207
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:20,072
No student can know where the treatment room is.

208
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:21,232
Of course.

209
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,872
I understand.

210
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:27,912
What are we testing today?

211
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:30,992
I call it Project R.

212
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:33,432
R is short for recovery

213
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:37,992
which means restoring or returning to a normal state.

214
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:42,392
Returning to a normal state?

215
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:44,392
What does it mean?

216
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:49,712
To put it simply, it’s about healing your trauma.

217
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:54,192
The wound caused by your adoptive dad.

218
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:58,312
It will help you forget those bad things.

219
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,952
Can forgetting really help?

220
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:06,192
Trauma always leaves a wound.

221
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,832
What you said is interesting, Run.

222
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,512
That’s why I want to test if this solution

223
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:15,152
can help heal or get your feelings back

224
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:19,832
after the trauma kids like you have been through.

225
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:23,232
What do we have to do?

226
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:28,272
Master Amin and I have invented a special formula.

227
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:46,552
This medicine will help us get into your subconscious mind easier

228
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:50,432
so we can instill some beliefs

229
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:53,752
or make you forget your bad memories.

230
00:20:57,432 --> 00:21:01,752
Does this medicine have side effects?

231
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:05,992
You might feel dizzy or have a little headache

232
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:07,152
but don’t worry.

233
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:09,552
It will certainly not harm you.

234
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:15,072
The only thing dangerous about this medicine and this project is

235
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:17,792
the person who wants to use it the wrong way.

236
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:22,392
Who do you mean?

237
00:21:30,032 --> 00:21:36,232
Master Amin must be going against the purpose of Project R.

238
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,072
He must be using the project to change the kids’ thoughts

239
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,392
and make them do something.

240
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,552
Do what?

241
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,952
That doesn’t sound like a good thing.

242
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:49,192
Project R in Tibet’s dad’s definition is Recovery.

243
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:52,872
What else can R be short for?

244
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,752
It’s either short for Return

245
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:01,072
or Rebirth

246
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:02,512
which means being born again.

247
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:04,792
I don’t think that’s where Home School is going.

248
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,032
Excuse me.

249
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:11,992
Pennhung can only think of one “Re-”.

250
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:16,752
Don’t tell me it’s the Thai children's game song Re Re Khao San.

251
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,392
Yes.

252
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:17,832
I knew it.

253
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,632
Pennhung, we’re being serious here.

254
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,952
Sorry.

255
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:26,192
I understand if Pennhung thought of that,

256
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:28,792
but how could you, Nai?

257
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:29,512
Hey.

258
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:37,272
But I think Project R in Master Amin’s definition is a warning signal.

259
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:42,392
It comes from “R you ready?”.

260
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:45,192
Are you serious?

261
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:46,712
Pennhung.

262
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:47,272
Yes?

263
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,672
Did you bring croissants?

264
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:49,672
Yes.

265
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:50,432
Can I have one?

266
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,152
I think we need to prepare ourselves.

267
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:56,752
Enough.

268
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:57,272
Just eat it.

269
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,232
Stop talking.

270
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:00,032
Stop your nonsense.

271
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:01,072
What?

272
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:02,112
We’re being serious here.

273
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:03,152
I am serious.

274
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:04,672
“R you ready” is not serious.

275
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:05,552
Are you crazy?

276
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,952
It’s a warning sign for us to prepare ourselves.

277
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:13,752
Revenge.

278
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:15,312
Hmm?

279
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:18,512
It’s Revenge.

280
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,032
I think Master Amin wants to get revenge.

281
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:25,272
Revenge?

282
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:31,072
I think that’s it.

283
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:35,032
But revenge on what?

284
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:36,272
Revenge on who?

285
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:56,152
Well done, kids.

286
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,432
Excellent.

287
00:23:58,232 --> 00:24:00,312
Now you know all about my plan.

288
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:02,952
What should we do next?

289
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:09,432
We’ll fight you, Master.

290
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:15,552
Bring it on.

291
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:18,072
I look forward to it.

292
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:30,312
Now put things back and get a good night’s sleep.

293
00:24:46,712 --> 00:24:47,472
7.

294
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,552
8.

295
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,112
Turn right.

296
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:51,672
1.

297
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,632
2.

298
00:24:52,912 --> 00:24:53,632
3.

299
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:54,632
4.

300
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:55,592
5.

301
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:56,432
6.

302
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:57,832
7.

303
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:58,672
8.

304
00:24:58,672 --> 00:24:59,352
9.

305
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:00,432
10.

306
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,432
11.

307
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:02,352
12.

308
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:03,072
13.

309
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:05,072
Turn left.

310
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:06,832
Then continue walking.

311
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:07,672
1.

312
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:09,152
2.

313
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:10,032
3.

314
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:10,992
4.

315
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:11,712
5.

316
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:19,912
Hot breakfast is served.

317
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:23,872
You look extra cheerful, Master Prasath.

318
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:27,392
Did something good happen?

319
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,432
I won’t tell you.

320
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:31,432
It won’t be fun if I tell you too easily.

321
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:40,632
Shall we play a game then?

322
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:56,992
What game?

323
00:25:57,512 --> 00:26:01,672
Your favorite game, coin guessing.

324
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:02,952
Interesting.

325
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:04,952
Let’s make a bet.

326
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:07,072
If you win,

327
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:09,792
you can order me to do anything and I’ll do it.

328
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:13,912
What if I lose?

329
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:18,592
You will answer my question truthfully.

330
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:20,592
Do you dare?

331
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:32,392
You can guess first.

332
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:36,072
A or B?

333
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:42,392
I’ll go with B.

334
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:46,792
That means I have to go with A.

335
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:09,192
What?

336
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,752
I lost?

337
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:13,392
I won.

338
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,032
You must answer my question.

339
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,032
Ask away.

340
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:24,592
What is Master Amin making GEN6 do in Project R?

341
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,592
I have no idea.

342
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:29,912
You’re lying.

343
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:33,672
I never lie.

344
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:37,072
You know how serious I am about the game.

345
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:40,672
If I lose, I do everything I promise.

346
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:46,472
You’re still as exasperating as ever.

347
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:53,232
There’s something else about me that never changes.

348
00:27:56,512 --> 00:27:58,512
I really hate losing.

349
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:00,792
I hate it to the core.

350
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:03,112
Yes.

351
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:04,952
I’m well aware of that.

352
00:28:10,952 --> 00:28:13,472
We have an appointment in the treatment room tonight.

353
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:16,872
I’ll beat you then.

354
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:21,712
I’ll wait for it, Master.

355
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:55,552
Maki.

356
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:58,192
What are you doing here alone?

357
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:04,592
The Masters have disappeared again today.

358
00:29:07,032 --> 00:29:09,232
Maybe because it’s the weekend?

359
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:13,912
I don’t think that’s the only reason.

360
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:16,912
Something is happening here.

361
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,832
Even though the Masters are not here now,

362
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,792
I can feel that someone is always watching us.

363
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,912
You’re probably thinking too much.

364
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:40,152
We can go to Master Amin’s office to prove it.

365
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:44,552
I’m sure the Master will show up.

366
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:46,712
Doesn’t that sound too much like a ghost story?

367
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,192
I think the Master is watching us through CCTV.

368
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:56,512
For what?

369
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:58,712
A new lesson?

370
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:00,712
This is not about a lesson.

371
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:05,352
He just wants to show he has power and is in control of everything.

372
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,312
I don’t think Master Amin would do that.

373
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:13,272
Or are you talking about Master Prasath?

374
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,352
Yes.

375
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:21,672
I think Home School has changed.

376
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:24,872
They aren’t teaching us anymore.

377
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:28,112
They want us to do something for them.

378
00:30:30,392 --> 00:30:32,392
That can’t be a good thing.

379
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:01,872
Don’t disappoint me, kids.

380
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:10,632
Master.

381
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:12,072
Something happened.

382
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:13,512
What happened, Master Phoban?

383
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:17,152
Master Amin is lying unconscious under the Tree of Remorse.

384
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:18,192
What?

385
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:23,872
Take a deep breath.

386
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:34,392
Have you been passing out a lot lately?

387
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:38,912
A few times.

388
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:42,392
Let’s go to the hospital.

389
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,392
Let’s get you a detailed checkup.

390
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:53,272
You know my answer, Master Praeporn.

391
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:56,792
Do you have any other symptoms?

392
00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:04,552
I get absent-minded

393
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,072
and confused a lot.

394
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:09,432
Confused?

395
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:12,232
What do you mean?

396
00:32:13,512 --> 00:32:16,632
It may be because I’m old.

397
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:24,672
Some memories have started to become fuzzy

398
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:27,752
and make me confused.

399
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:33,992
Maybe it’s warning us to stop.

400
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:43,032
How are you feeling, Master Amin?

401
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,587
What we’re about to do

402
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:52,872
is restore justice for those kids,

403
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:54,552
Master Praeporn.

404
00:32:55,032 --> 00:33:01,152
We’re about to teach those horrible adults

405
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:05,272
to feel guilty about what they did.

406
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:15,272
Careful.

407
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:16,752
Careful, Master.

408
00:33:25,312 --> 00:33:29,832
I won’t stop no matter what.

409
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:35,512
Please go rest in the infirmary.

410
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:53,172
It’d be great if you could convince Master Amin

411
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,472
to take some rest in the infirmary.

412
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:02,392
You got it.

413
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:43,592
You must run away today.

414
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:46,552
Don’t you want me to stop Master Amin anymore?

415
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:50,312
The only way you can stop him is to run away.

416
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:52,152
I can’t.

417
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:53,272
My sister is here.

418
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:55,272
I’ll take care of Maki.

419
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,952
For now, you must escape from Home School

420
00:34:57,952 --> 00:34:59,952
to make Master Amin stop Project R.

421
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,832
What’s your plan?

422
00:35:05,152 --> 00:35:08,832
I’ll rescue you from the treatment room tonight.

423
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:11,912
What about Master Prasath?

424
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:20,072
We’ll see who’s better at hypnotizing, me or Master Prasath.

425
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:22,232
No, Master.

426
00:35:22,232 --> 00:35:23,552
It’s too risky.

427
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:26,912
Let me handle it.

428
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:32,672
Keep this.

429
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:44,712
If something unexpected happens,

430
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:48,672
use it and run away.

431
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:20,672
Master Amin, I’m sorry for betraying Home School.

432
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:42,672
Did Pennhung change his croissant hiding spot again?

433
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:57,392
Hey, Mork.

434
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,032
I found you something to eat.

435
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:03,032
I found these jellies.

436
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:05,872
Someone must have hidden them.

437
00:37:05,872 --> 00:37:07,392
Where did you find them?

438
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:09,232
In the classroom.

439
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:11,232
But I don’t know who they belong to.

440
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:12,952
Are you going to eat them or not?

441
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:14,352
Of course, I am.

442
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:16,832
Hey, hey.

443
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:20,912
So good.

444
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:46,472
Remove the cover.

445
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:49,072
Let me see Run’s face.

446
00:37:56,152 --> 00:38:06,392
Run, I still hope you’ll go back to your old self.

447
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:11,072
I’m still me.

448
00:38:11,312 --> 00:38:14,912
I have never changed and never will.

449
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,912
Master Amin,

450
00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:21,512
let me repeat what you told me.

451
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:24,712
If we fight violence with violence,

452
00:38:24,712 --> 00:38:27,392
in the end, we’ll turn into a beast.

453
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:40,872
I told you already.

454
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:50,232
People can always change their minds.

455
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:56,672
No matter what,

456
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,672
I will never stop…

457
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:02,392
stop…

458
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:03,672
stop…

459
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:06,552
Project R.

460
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:11,672
It has to be successful.

461
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:14,472
Successful.

462
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:15,872
Master Amin.

463
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,352
Are you alright?

464
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:23,152
Master Amin might be tired and needs rest.

465
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:26,792
Please take Run to the treatment room.

466
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:28,432
I’ll catch up with you soon.

467
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,712
Yes, Master Prasath.

468
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:51,832
Be careful not to let Mek and Mork find out.

469
00:39:52,112 --> 00:39:54,712
Be careful not to let Mek and Mork find out.

470
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:07,752
The croissants are going to get hard.

471
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,872
Let’s find another spot.

472
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:26,952
Mek!

473
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:27,992
Mork!

474
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:31,512
What happened?

475
00:40:32,872 --> 00:40:34,752
Help.

476
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:37,472
Pennhung must get help.

477
00:40:37,472 --> 00:40:44,432
Pennhung must get someone to help Mek and Mork.

478
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:19,192
Maki.

479
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,632
Master!

480
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:24,672
Master!

481
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:29,872
What’s going on?

482
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:31,712
Mek and Mork ate the jellies.

483
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:33,072
Both of them fell unconscious.

484
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:34,512
It looks like they went into shock.

485
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,032
Master?

486
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:45,512
Master Praeporn?

487
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:55,232
Mek.

488
00:41:55,632 --> 00:41:56,472
Mork.

489
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:03,432
When did you find them like this?

490
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:06,432
Pennhung found them about 20 minutes ago.

491
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,472
Mek and Mork will be alright, won’t they?

492
00:42:09,472 --> 00:42:11,472
We must take them to the infirmary now.

493
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,472
Help me.

494
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:20,712
Come, Tibet.

495
00:42:22,992 --> 00:42:23,912
Careful.

496
00:42:28,832 --> 00:42:30,152
Slowly.

497
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:55,152
Why is Master Prasath taking so long?

498
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:59,472
Do you think something happened to Master Amin?

499
00:43:00,232 --> 00:43:01,152
I don’t think so.

500
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:14,832
Why don’t you go back to Home School and check?

501
00:43:15,432 --> 00:43:17,192
In case something happened.

502
00:43:17,192 --> 00:43:19,992
I don’t trust you with Master Phoban, Run.

503
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:27,992
Then let Master Phoban go instead.

504
00:43:28,912 --> 00:43:30,712
You can stay here with me.

505
00:43:30,712 --> 00:43:32,592
I won’t fall for your tricks, Run.

506
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:34,072
Are you afraid of me, Master?

507
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:56,072
Do you hear something?

508
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:04,592
Do you hear it, Master Phoban?

509
00:44:14,032 --> 00:44:15,672
Listen carefully.

510
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:32,112
It sounds like a clock ticking.

511
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:52,752
What a runner like you fears

512
00:44:53,712 --> 00:44:55,712
is the time that keeps running.

513
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:08,192
The more time runs, the more afraid you become, right?

514
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:30,152
Master.

515
00:45:30,152 --> 00:45:31,112
Wake up, Master.

516
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:32,312
Time’s up, Master Phoban.

517
00:45:33,352 --> 00:45:35,272
Master!

518
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:36,752
Master!

519
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:42,352
It’s just the two of us again.

520
00:46:33,072 --> 00:46:36,352
Repeat after me, Master Amin.

521
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:02,152
Goodnight, Master Champ, Master Phoban.

522
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:18,232
1.

523
00:47:18,552 --> 00:47:19,272
2.

524
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:19,872
3.

525
00:47:19,872 --> 00:47:20,392
4.

526
00:47:20,392 --> 00:47:21,232
5.

527
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:21,832
6.

528
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:22,632
7.

529
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:23,272
Turn right.

530
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:23,992
8.

531
00:47:23,992 --> 00:47:24,832
9.

532
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:32,832
Fighting violence with violence is the right thing to do.

533
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:44,712
Fighting violence with violence is the right thing to do.

534
00:47:45,952 --> 00:47:47,432
Say it again.

535
00:47:50,192 --> 00:47:57,152
Fighting violence with violence is the right thing to do.

536
00:47:57,432 --> 00:48:05,152
Fighting violence with violence is the right thing to do.

537
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:08,432
215.

538
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:09,632
216.

539
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:10,432
217.

540
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:11,232
218.

541
00:48:11,232 --> 00:48:12,152
219.

542
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,712
Left.

543
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:17,592
1.

544
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:18,472
2.

545
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:19,072
3.

546
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:19,632
4.

547
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:20,192
5.

548
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:23,872
6.

549
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:24,992
1503.

550
00:48:24,992 --> 00:48:25,952
1504.

551
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:26,832
1505.

552
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:27,952
1506.

553
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:35,952
The Tree of Remorse.

554
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:41,512
1507.

555
00:48:41,512 --> 00:48:42,872
1508.

556
00:48:42,872 --> 00:48:43,992
1509.

557
00:48:43,992 --> 00:48:45,112
1510.

558
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,032
1511.

559
00:48:46,032 --> 00:48:47,152
1512.

560
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:18,832
Master Praeporn, I will stop Master Amin.

561
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,432
Say it again.
