1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
Please avenge Master Praeporn.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,699
I won't fall for your trick, Master.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,957
My first priority right now

4
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:08,228
is to protect the lives of every GEN6 student.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,466
Can no one help us?

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,579
What?

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,579
What the hell is going on?

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,799
Hey.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,549
Who tied me up like this?

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,140
Why did you tie me up?

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,580
Are you crazy?

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,999
You're noisily kicking up a fuss as soon as you woke up.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,719
What do you want?

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,129
Why did you capture me?

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,129
No, no.

16
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,940
I don't want anything from you.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,200
I just wanted to invite our students' parents

18
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,260
to join our activity in Home School's Project R.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,260
Home School?

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,899
How dare you do this much to me?!

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,030
Master? Where is Master Amin?

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,789
Bring him here now!

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,649
Master Amin is sick.

24
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,019
He can't meet you now.

25
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,290
I don't care.

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,099
I want him here right now.

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,690
Set me free now!

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,390
Do you know who I am?

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,460
I'm Metha Pailert.

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,200
Okay.

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,649
Well then, Mr. Metha,

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,180
do you somehow remember how you answered our questions about your son?

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,519
How does that have something to do with this?

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,190
Today, you'll get to see some changes.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,180
Nai will change into a better kid as you wish, Mr. Metha.

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,979
Set me free now!

37
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,439
I'm ordering you to set me free.

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,709
Someone like you is a privileged elite.

39
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,460
You're superior to anything because of the power of money.

40
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,720
Your family suppressed others,

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,220
and you finally end up having a good and happy life.

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,250
You care only about your own interests, don't you?

43
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,189
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,740
I don't get it.

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,030
I'm sorry that

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,129
words from someone low-class like me can't make you understand.

47
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,350
So, let me invite someone your level to explain this to you.

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,380
There he is.

49
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,979
Nai, untie me now.

50
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,259
Nai!

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,259
I said, untie me now!

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,170
Why must I do it?

53
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,969
Why did you say that?

54
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm your dad.

55
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,519
You said I'm just a stupid kid, didn't you?

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
You said I'm not different from trash.

57
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,830
So, I'm just trash,

58
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,550
not your perfect son.

59
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,530
Have you gone crazy or what?

60
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,389
This kid hasn't turned crazy yet,

61
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,460
but I'm not pretty sure about tomorrow

62
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,860
because Project R will officially start tomorrow.

63
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,740
What the hell is Project R?

64
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,749
Set me free!

65
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,660
Set me free now!

66
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,440
Louder.

67
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:38,339
Help me, anyone!

68
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,829
Help me!

69
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,119
Set me free!

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,650
I said, set me free!

71
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,448
Hey. What's going on outside?

72
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,929
It's so noisy.

73
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,538
Should we go out to check on it?

74
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,148
Hey. Are you serious?

75
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,998
What if we meet Jingjai and others again?

76
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,458
Last time, we almost didn't survive.

77
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,018
What if something bad happens to our friends?

78
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,749
I'm worried about our female friends.

79
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,078
Pennhung,

80
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,618
Maki and those friends are even smarter than us.

81
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,618
They can certainly get by.

82
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:26,968
Now, I'm worried about us.

83
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,179
Damn it.

84
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,028
But we're men,

85
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,858
so we must be brave.

86
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,859
Alright. You go out to check on them.

87
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:45,008
Pennhung thinks that

88
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,558
if we're brave as a team,

89
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:50,179
it's probably safer for us.

90
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,719
As a team?

91
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:58,049
Mek and Mork, aren't you worried about other friends?

92
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,419
Let's go out to check on them, shall we?

93
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,569
Fine.

94
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:09,729
Let's go.

95
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,318
Where are you guys going?

96
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,658
Fuji, Jean, why are you here?

97
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:22,408
Fuji, you don't have to talk that politely.

98
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,988
It gives me goosebumps.

99
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,988
Don't change the topic.

100
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,989
I asked where you're going.

101
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,648
Please listen, everyone.

102
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,828
You're strictly not allowed to leave this room.

103
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,909
This is Master Prasath's order.

104
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,928
Well, we heard a loud noise.

105
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,929
Was anyone hurt?'

106
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,348
Nobody was, Pennhung.

107
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,359
Everyone is doing fine.

108
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,538
Please go to bed now.

109
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,748
Tomorrow is the start of Project R.

110
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,188
Project?

111
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,999
Project R?

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,309
What is it?

113
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,119
We'll get to take revenge soon.

114
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,879
It will be the most enjoyable day.

115
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,499
Taking revenge on what?

116
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,999
Our parents, Pennhung.

117
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,979
Those parents who abandoned us.

118
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:27,898
What the hell?

119
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:29,898
Why are they locking us up?

120
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,608
I guess they're afraid we'll obstruct that Project R.

121
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,399
Do they even think we can do anything?

122
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,768
They have a gun.

123
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,459
How can we fight?

124
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,169
What should we do, Run?

125
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,399
Pennhung feels bad about this

126
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,979
though Pennhung's parents aren't here.

127
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,178
But I really don't understand this.

128
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:54,179
Why did they target only some parents?

129
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,779
Fuji said we aren't ready.

130
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,908
Aren't ready for what?

131
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,909
Fuji told us nothing.

132
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,089
She kept giving us such a horrifying smile.

133
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,248
Master Prasath wants to destroy those big-name families,

134
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:10,768
who are influential in our country.

135
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,769
It's like a total set zero of the whole thing.

136
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,859
That's probably true.

137
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,189
Nai's dad is from an elite family,

138
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,739
and he's a politician.

139
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:29,818
Hugo's dad and Jingjai's mom are both from upper-class families.

140
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,454
Jean's dad is a big-name businessman,

141
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,148
who owns a factory.

142
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:35,983
Biw's dad is a village headman.

143
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,475
Fuji's dad is a rich Chinese businessman,

144
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,308
who owns a leading import company.

145
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,832
They are all possessing a high social status.

146
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,663
Does that mean our parents are poorer than theirs,

147
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,918
so we weren't targeted?

148
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,561
Right. That's possible.

149
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,889
There's one more reason for that.

150
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,939
We aren't likely to hate each other enough.

151
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,574
What do you mean?

152
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:04,819
Enough hatred to kill each other.

153
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,183
Project R is about to start.

154
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:14,872
I want you to think about the pain you suffered

155
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,369
from being hurt and abandoned by your family.

156
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,147
Think about how you were hated

157
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:22,196
and treated as if you weren't their child.

158
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:26,179
You're worthless and meaningless to them.

159
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,178
Remember how you feel

160
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,912
and turn it into a vengeful feeling.

161
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,778
Change it into your strength

162
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,779
and get back at them as much as they deserve.

163
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:37,378
A hypnosis to change one's mindset and behavior will work well

164
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,200
if one's mind is weak and hurt so much that it falls apart.

165
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,423
Under that state, one will be weak enough

166
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:49,494
to be easily convinced to change one's mindset.

167
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:51,903
Please eat the jelly

168
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,516
and choose the weapon you want to use.

169
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:06,659
So how can we bring them back to the normal state?

170
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:10,481
Only one person knows how to do it.

171
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:12,339
Who?

172
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,112
Master Amin.

173
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,348
Welcome to the rapprochement activity

174
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:27,414
between parents and Home School students.

175
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,448
We'll be playing a game today.

176
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,885
Are you excited?

177
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:39,343
This game is called "Revenge."

178
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:43,459
It's the game that allows the kids

179
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,249
to take their revenge on their own parents.

180
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,658
Take their revenge?

181
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,312
What are you talking about?

182
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:04,053
The rule is so simply classic.

183
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,049
It's similar to Tag Game's rule.

184
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:08,688
What nonsense are you talking about?

185
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,490
You'd better untie me now.

186
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,489
Tag Game.

187
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,549
Don't tell me

188
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,791
you haven't played it with your children before.

189
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,632
It's the game we played when we were young.

190
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,081
Hey.

191
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,079
You haven't played it for real?

192
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:31,201
But this doesn't surprise me that much

193
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,219
because you guys never care about others anyway.

194
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,036
You only care about your own business.

195
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:47,888
Let me explain this easy rule to you all, little kids.

196
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,081
All you have to do is run away,

197
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,450
while your kids are chasing after you to catch you.

198
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,499
That's it.

199
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,388
But what's important is that

200
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:04,232
you mustn't let them catch you.

201
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,248
What if they can catch us?

202
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:08,072
What will happen to us?

203
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,978
Remember this.

204
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:16,952
Getting back at violence by using
violence is the best way to take revenge.

205
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:22,151
Die, of course.

206
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,668
It sounds fun, doesn't it?

207
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:37,458
We're making kids chase after and kill their parents.

208
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,211
Just thinking about it already excites me.

209
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,682
That will never happen.

210
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:49,878
There's no way my daughter will kill me.

211
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:55,780
Biw, my daughter, loves me more than anything else.

212
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,784
Village Headman Bird,

213
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:03,487
are you sure?

214
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:05,326
Of course.

215
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,331
Okay.

216
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,278
Well, then.

217
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:12,936
Let me show you something, little kids.

218
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:28,811
What do you find dissatisfying about your daughter?

219
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,847
Since she was born a girl,

220
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,543
she must be disciplined.

221
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,535
She must learn to follow my order.

222
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:35,985
But what's with her?

223
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:37,949
She keeps causing trouble

224
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:39,540
and argues with me unstoppably.

225
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,816
She makes me feel embarrassed.

226
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,536
What a useless daughter.

227
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,475
Jingjai is the problem between her dad and me.

228
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,033
Her behavior is disgusting.

229
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:50,575
She's a spoiled girl.

230
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:54,045
She doesn't care what others say about the way she dresses.

231
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,362
She doesn't have qualities of a lady.

232
00:13:55,363 --> 00:14:00,233
Everything unpleasant a Thai woman does can be found in my daughter.

233
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,138
Pailert's family members mustn't care about others.

234
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,291
We don't show mercy or sympathize with someone

235
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,727
who isn't on the same level with us.

236
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:09,995
But Nai doesn't understand this.

237
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:14,189
Someone this stupid is not different from trash.

238
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:17,915
Hugo doesn't deserve to be my son.

239
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,806
He shouldn't have been my son.

240
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,805
He doesn't deserve to use my surname.

241
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,995
He's ungrateful.

242
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,735
He betrayed his own dad.

243
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:31,535
I want my daughter to continue being a little 5-year-old girl.

244
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,211
I don't want her to grow up.

245
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,407
The more mature she turns, the more she knows about things.

246
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,885
If I could choose,

247
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:40,801
I would exchange Hugo's life with his brother's.

248
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:42,795
He should have been thrown away and dead

249
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,491
like a stray dog.

250
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:53,112
I only picked some parts to show you.

251
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:55,105
As for the full video,

252
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:57,487
I have shown it to your kids repeatedly

253
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,469
for hundred or thousand times.

254
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:05,966
Now, do you still think your kids love you?

255
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:07,656
Damn it!

256
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,145
Little boy,

257
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:21,264
are you still confident that your daughter won't kill you?

258
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,926
I won't die.

259
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,442
I'm not guilty.

260
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,380
Alright.

261
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,571
I'll give you a chance to run away.

262
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:38,615
You have 99 seconds each.

263
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:40,489
No particular reason, by the way.

264
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,047
I just happen to like number 9.

265
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:43,395
After I count to 99,

266
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:47,478
the kids will start chasing after you immediately.

267
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,113
But don't be scared.

268
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:53,922
I'm giving a privilege to the richest one to run away first.

269
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:59,824
Isn't this too awful?

270
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,475
I'm not poor.

271
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:03,700
I have tons of money.

272
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,045
I can give you all.

273
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,162
Wow.

274
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:12,464
But you aren't as rich as little boy Metha.

275
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:15,922
As I told you,

276
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:19,175
this is the society you created on your own.

277
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:20,315
Who created it?

278
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:22,115
I didn't.

279
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:23,735
It goes like that automatically.

280
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:24,482
Come on.

281
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,815
That's how you are.

282
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,815
When you're affected by something a bit,

283
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,298
you step up and complain.

284
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,797
If you weren't caught and brought here,

285
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:33,615
you would be lying on your back comfortably,

286
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:35,080
counting your money at home day by day.

287
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,069
You wouldn't give a shit about anything.

288
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,135
You!

289
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,135
Bastard!

290
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,755
You're insane!

291
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:42,985
Let go of me already.

292
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:44,223
Hey.

293
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:46,216
Stop talking, everyone.

294
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:50,162
So I'll be the first one who gets to run away, right?

295
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:51,475
Mr. Metha.

296
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,220
What a selfish person you are.

297
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,007
But this is my right.

298
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,158
Little boy Metha,

299
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,345
you're an asshole.

300
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:02,509
You heard it correctly.

301
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,931
Stop rambling already.

302
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,433
Can I go now?

303
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,718
Sure.

304
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,287
How about me?

305
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,676
Who is the second one to go?

306
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:23,775
It's me, right?

307
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:24,276
Me.

308
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,016
I'm richer than them.

309
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:25,833
Me.

310
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,469
Actually, these two little boys,

311
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,345
Songyoth and Nithi, are as rich as each other.

312
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,175
Set me free first then.

313
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:33,627
Hey.

314
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:34,224
I'm richer.

315
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:36,331
- Who should go first?
- I should, of course.

316
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:37,336
I'm richer.

317
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:38,985
Hey. I am.

318
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:39,584
I'm richer!

319
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,275
Kids, relax.

320
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,482
I'll decide.

321
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:44,086
Me.

322
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,984
Lady first.

323
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:48,505
Little girl Miw will go first.

324
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:49,238
Hey.

325
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,615
Why?

326
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,473
I'm richer.

327
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:56,295
She's the only woman here.

328
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:59,190
Her gender has been suppressed in the society.

329
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,424
That's why this little girl Miw is allowed to go first.

330
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,245
Hurry up and free me now.

331
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:08,918
You three boys, Songyoth, Manat, and Nithi,

332
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,235
please leave now.

333
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:12,056
Hey. Come this way.

334
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,645
Untie me first.

335
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,873
Untie the rope for me first.

336
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:16,198
Relax.

337
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:16,889
Hurry up.

338
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,890
Make it fast.

339
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:20,312
Move!

340
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:22,306
Hey, hurry up.

341
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,331
Hey?

342
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,326
They're all gone.

343
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,087
When will you free me?

344
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:41,086
Little boy Bird.

345
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:48,571
You're the poorest,

346
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,753
and you also own those villagers some debts.

347
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:53,665
Look at someone like you.

348
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,546
Why!

349
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,226
Come on.

350
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:58,189
I'm just kidding.

351
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,398
Relax. Don't be scared.

352
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:04,331
I'll start counting.

353
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,416
One.

354
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:11,315
Two.

355
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,155
Three.

356
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:14,485
Hurry up.

357
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,411
- Untie me!
- Four.

358
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:20,198
Who's that?

359
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:24,196
Headmaster!

360
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:26,037
Others could have heard you guys.

361
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,035
How's everything outside?

362
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,036
Have those kids started doing that already?

363
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:32,485
Project R has started.

364
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:35,496
Those kids are now chasing after their families.

365
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,349
Let's hurry up and figure out a way to help them.

366
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,832
What should we do?

367
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,825
They're being hypnotized now.

368
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:42,885
She's right.

369
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:45,238
They're so horrifying now.

370
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:47,691
You guys don't have to do anything.

371
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,513
Leave it to Run and me.

372
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,950
What Headmaster said is right.

373
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,553
It's too dangerous outside.

374
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,758
Let Headmaster and I handle it.

375
00:19:57,007 --> 00:20:01,025
Run, will you just let us stay here and do nothing?

376
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,675
I won't agree to.

377
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:03,735
Right.

378
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,486
We've been locked up too often.

379
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,485
Stop locking us up already.

380
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:10,313
Pennhung is bored of getting locked up.

381
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,811
Can't we just help each other?

382
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,500
We can't do that.

383
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,863
It's too dangerous.

384
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,856
I don't want to lose anyone anymore

385
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,446
especially Home School students.

386
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:24,009
I gave Master Praeporn the promise that

387
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,482
I'll protect every Home School student.

388
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:33,522
Headmaster, we also want to protect our friends

389
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:36,313
and you.

390
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,291
What matters is that

391
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:42,793
there're only two of you.

392
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,771
How can you guys fight Master Prasath?

393
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:50,829
I agree with Maki.

394
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:56,136
Two of us alone can't beat Master Prasath.

395
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,473
Come on, you guys.

396
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:08,260
I agree then.

397
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:12,415
But you guys must promise me that you'll be careful.

398
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,677
Don't do anything that is too dangerous.

399
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:17,131
If you feel unsafe, you must run away right away.

400
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,215
Got it?

401
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:19,216
Yes.

402
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:22,198
Alright, Run.

403
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,562
It's your turn.

404
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:28,153
Are you sure that what you've planned will work?

405
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:30,856
It's 50:50.

406
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,525
But I'll make it successful

407
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,882
to protect everyone.

408
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:37,842
Dad!

409
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,486
Why am I facing such a thing?

410
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:03,247
What is this?

411
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:14,651
The most dangerous place is the safest.

412
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:28,740
You're an ungrateful kid.

413
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,025
You betrayed me.

414
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:31,522
You're a good-for-nothing daughter!

415
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:32,927
Mr. Nithi.

416
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:35,184
Help me.

417
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,385
Nonsense.

418
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:37,780
My kid almost catches me up!

419
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:43,460
Dad!

420
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:53,895
Don't hurt me.

421
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,225
I'm begging.

422
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,033
Auntie, don't worry.

423
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:02,109
I'm not the one who's taking revenge on you.

424
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,131
What do you mean?

425
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,415
Auntie, nice to meet you.

426
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,416
I'm Hugo.

427
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:12,891
Dad!

428
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:28,746
Dad.

429
00:24:29,956 --> 00:24:31,158
Jean!

430
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,706
What are you doing?

431
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,184
Ouch.

432
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:37,069
My leg.

433
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,793
Don't.

434
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,785
If you hurt me,

435
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:49,113
you'll go to hell after you're dead.

436
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,623
It's a sin.

437
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,616
Now, you're referring to a sin?

438
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:54,936
How about what you did to others?

439
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,073
Aren't you afraid of Karma too?

440
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:03,210
Jingjai.

441
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,206
What are you doing?

442
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:07,558
This is me, your mom.

443
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,447
Why are you talking to me so nicely?

444
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:14,205
You usually don't talk to me this way.

445
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:15,885
It's not the same thing.

446
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:17,442
You're my son.

447
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:21,505
A son can't hurt his own dad.

448
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:23,096
You already cut me off, didn't you?

449
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,784
You wanted me to lie on the roadside and die, didn't you?!

450
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,776
Calm down.

451
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:31,316
Put that sword down first.

452
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:36,287
You want me to put this sword down?

453
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:39,771
Dad.

454
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,792
Come out to see me.

455
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,786
I've missed you a lot.

456
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,460
Biw, is that you?

457
00:25:49,736 --> 00:25:51,638
Biw, I'm here.

458
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:55,415
Biw, please help me.

459
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,416
You still love me, right?

460
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:00,509
Please get me out of here.

461
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,616
Mom, are you scared of me?

462
00:26:03,286 --> 00:26:05,833
But when you left me with Dad,

463
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,527
you weren't scared of how I would feel.

464
00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:10,642
Jingjai.

465
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:14,171
I love you.

466
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,549
Please don't hurt me.

467
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:22,980
Since I'm your ungrateful son anyway,

468
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:27,273
I don't have to care about anything.

469
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,395
I love you.

470
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:32,900
Please don't hurt me.

471
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:34,895
Yes.

472
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:37,425
I'll get you out of here, Dad.

473
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:40,155
I was right.

474
00:26:40,156 --> 00:26:41,475
I know

475
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:46,571
the bond between a dad and his daughter can't be broken.

476
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:49,069
But you will leave this place in pieces.

477
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:04,197
I don't know if my leg is broken or not.

478
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:05,580
I don't think it's broken.

479
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:06,790
You just probably sprained it.

480
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,642
Let me twist it back for you.

481
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,127
You're good at running away.

482
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:21,433
Jingjai, don't!

483
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:33,656
You ungrateful daughter!

484
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:42,916
Dad!

485
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:43,753
Don't!

486
00:27:43,754 --> 00:27:45,407
Help me!

487
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:53,798
Are you sure that

488
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:57,424
this method can regain Master Amin's consciousness?

489
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,340
To be honest,

490
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,958
I'm not quite sure

491
00:28:04,556 --> 00:28:07,869
how to wake him up from hypnosis.

492
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:15,407
But there's one thing that can heal the pain now.

493
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,460
It's the love

494
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:19,967
everyone has for each other around.

495
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:22,962
It probably sounds impossible,

496
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:27,851
but I do believe in love.

497
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,358
Master Amin,

498
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:54,438
can you hear me?

499
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,246
I know you're in there.

500
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:01,816
Please hear me out.

501
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:05,478
Throughout my life,

502
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,996
I've been just an orphan.

503
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:12,447
I have no parents.

504
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:17,273
My sister is the only family member I have.

505
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:20,571
I used to think that

506
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:26,420
my sister and I would be alone for the rest of our lives.

507
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:34,047
But on that day when you came to save my life,

508
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:37,949
I came to realize that

509
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:43,282
there's another person who cares about me.

510
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:51,380
We're not blood relatives,

511
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:55,078
but you've given me love

512
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,073
as if I were your son.

513
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:00,704
Though you didn't adopt me,

514
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,389
do you know that

515
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:14,716
you're the only Dad I have throughout my life, Master Amin?

516
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:36,384
I love you, Dad.

517
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Nai.

518
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:09,375
It's me.

519
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,616
Help me.

520
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:19,327
Dad, do you remember this golf club?

521
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:25,238
It's the same as the one you used to hit me.

522
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:29,131
I hit you

523
00:31:29,336 --> 00:31:32,029
because I wanted you to grow up strong.

524
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:34,500
No dad would do such a thing.

525
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,660
I brought you up so well.

526
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:38,642
I gave you everything.

527
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:40,669
You were born surrounded by wealth,

528
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,687
fame, and convenience.

529
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:46,402
Without me,

530
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:49,025
you wouldn't be who you are today.

531
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:50,607
But I never wanted them

532
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:57,842
because you never gave me the only thing I've wanted.

533
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:04,611
Fine.

534
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:08,233
Just tell me what you want.

535
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:10,315
I'll buy you everything.

536
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:14,358
But you must get me out of here first.

537
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:19,015
I want love

538
00:32:19,016 --> 00:32:20,607
and warmth.

539
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:25,042
Your money can't buy them, Dad.

540
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:34,811
But I don't need them anymore.

541
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:38,695
The only thing I want is to hurt you

542
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:41,007
like how you hurt me before.

543
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,042
Don't!

544
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:46,595
You're disobedient!

545
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:49,024
What a disobedient daughter!

546
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,936
Don't be stubborn, Dad.

547
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:53,565
Don't!

548
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:54,560
Don't hurt me!

549
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:55,264
Don't!

550
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,425
Fuji!

551
00:32:56,426 --> 00:33:00,135
Biw!

552
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:01,149
Let go!

553
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:02,725
Let go.

554
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:04,250
Don't you think you've gone too far?

555
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:06,245
Fuji, pull yourself together.

556
00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:07,602
We know you don't want to do this.

557
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:08,895
You're being hypnotized.

558
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:09,798
Biw, don't!

559
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,864
That's your dad.

560
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,285
Because he's my dad,

561
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:12,971
I must kill him.

562
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:14,025
Don't hurt me!

563
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:14,740
Let go!

564
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:16,898
Biw I know is not this kind of person!

565
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,153
I told you to let go of me,

566
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:19,922
Mek, Mork.

567
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,491
Biw.

568
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:24,918
Killing each other is not the solution.

569
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,685
Come back now!

570
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:29,915
Dad!

571
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,380
Let go of me!

572
00:33:32,316 --> 00:33:33,789
Let go!

573
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:37,575
I said, let go!

574
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:38,482
I won't!

575
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,197
You two want to die, right?!

576
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:42,196
Don't get in my way again!

577
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,015
What should we do?

578
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:56,109
No matter what, we can't let Fuji kill anyone.

579
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:58,242
We must help her.

580
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,016
Deal. Let's do whatever.

581
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:12,016
It's alright, Run.

582
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:18,136
I believe that, deep inside,

583
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:22,749
Master Amin heard you.

584
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,753
I don't know what to do anymore.

585
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:32,287
How could we handle Master Prasath?

586
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,156
I don't know either.

587
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:39,295
But for now, we must get the kids out of this place.

588
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:41,762
Let's help them as much as we can.

589
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:43,318
Yes.

590
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:49,042
Headmaster, I'm sorry for disappointing you.

591
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,500
It's alright, Run.

592
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:57,469
Let's hurry out of here.

593
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:09,789
Don't lose hope in me yet, Run.

594
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,786
Master Amin.

595
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:17,380
I'm back.

596
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:19,376
I'm sorry.

597
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:30,056
I'm sorry, Run.

598
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:34,900
All this time,

599
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:40,393
I have been a good-for-nothing dad.

600
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:46,322
You must have felt so painful, right?

601
00:36:02,316 --> 00:36:04,713
I will fix everything.

602
00:36:11,576 --> 00:36:14,793
I've also planned something, Master Amin.

603
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:28,402
You won't hurt me, right?

604
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:31,487
Don't deceive me.

605
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:34,506
I won't do something like that.

606
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:39,753
You're now feeling grateful that I brought you up, right?

607
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:42,016
Good.

608
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,491
This is how a grateful son should be.

609
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,215
Though you've been brainwashed by Home School,

610
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:51,405
deep inside, you're still my son.

611
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:53,842
I haven't been brainwashed!

612
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,155
What do you mean?

613
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:58,835
Why didn't you help me from the start?

614
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:01,180
How could you let me run away desperately like this?

615
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:02,700
To make it look realistic, Dad.

616
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:04,198
Realistic? What the hell?

617
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:08,188
I'll report this to the police to close down this school.

618
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:10,186
You can't do that

619
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,438
because I won't let you.

620
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,355
What's wrong with you?

621
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:17,309
Will you continue staying here?

622
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,504
Yes.

623
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:25,922
But first, can I say something to you?

624
00:37:29,026 --> 00:37:31,576
I want to respect you as my dad,

625
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:35,576
but as a human,

626
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:38,953
you're awful.

627
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:42,195
You're selfish

628
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:44,838
and never set an example of a good dad.

629
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:48,082
But I promise you that.

630
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:54,633
I won't grow up to be like you.

631
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:58,553
Nai.

632
00:37:58,571 --> 00:37:59,736
Nai.

633
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:05,033
Is everything alright?

634
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:06,496
Yes.

635
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:09,420
Everything is going as Run has planned.

636
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,159
Lucky enough, Master Phoban changed his mind to help us.

637
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,995
If you were also hypnotized,

638
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:14,996
that would tire us out.

639
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:18,916
If everything is alright,

640
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,447
please eat this, Mr. Metha.

641
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:25,555
What?

642
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:27,051
Why are you giving me the cake?

643
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,251
If you want to get out of here,

644
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:31,584
you must eat it.

645
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:33,505
Why must I?

646
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:36,384
It's because you must forget everything that happened today,

647
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,327
so that Home School can continue.

648
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:43,068
If you remember everything that happened today,

649
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:45,442
you'll close down Home School, right?

650
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:48,029
Are you really going to stay here?

651
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,664
Of course.

652
00:38:55,556 --> 00:38:58,562
I'll study here until I graduate

653
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:01,629
because I believe Home School can turn me into a better person.

654
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:08,082
Most importantly, I have my friends here with me.

655
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:04,349
I was tricked, wasn't I?

656
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:08,315
You and Nai aren't hypnotized, right?

657
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:10,616
Because of Master Praeporn's death,

658
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:14,349
Master Phoban no longer agrees with you.

659
00:40:17,036 --> 00:40:19,058
Tibet, why didn't you call me Master?

660
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:21,664
Someone like you doesn't deserve to be the Master.

661
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:25,565
That's true.

662
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:26,633
I won't defend myself.

663
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:29,584
Just keep smiling.

664
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:32,456
Your plan is ruined now.

665
00:40:34,276 --> 00:40:36,579
Talking like this ruins the fun, Tibet.

666
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,575
You must stop everything now!

667
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:41,362
And get my friends back to their old selves,

668
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,016
or else, I'll shoot you.

669
00:40:49,976 --> 00:40:50,811
Where?

670
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:52,287
How about here?

671
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:55,370
Or here?

672
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:56,485
Shoot.

673
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:57,282
Shoot me.

674
00:40:57,283 --> 00:40:58,936
Your chance is just in front of you.

675
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:00,935
You can do it, Tibet.

676
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:01,860
Shoot me.

677
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:03,405
You can do it.

678
00:41:03,406 --> 00:41:04,544
You can end this game.

679
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,715
Shoot!

680
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:06,269
Bang!

681
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,540
Shoot now!

682
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:18,555
You're weak, Tibet.

683
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:21,362
How can you change the society?

684
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:24,286
You're too good.

685
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,825
I agree to be weak,

686
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:29,798
but I will never become a monster like you.

687
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:39,007
Inside of you here probably hides a monster.

688
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:41,673
By the way,

689
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:43,504
do you know that those kids,

690
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:47,513
who were hurt or abandoned by their families,

691
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:51,087
are often labeled as trash?

692
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:08,967
Trash.

693
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:10,767
Worthless.

694
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:14,185
That's such a major breeding ground of monsters.

695
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:15,051
Let go!

696
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:16,095
I said, let go!

697
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:17,184
No.

698
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,465
Stop, Fuji.

699
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:20,545
Pull yourself together.

700
00:42:20,546 --> 00:42:21,291
Stop.

701
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:23,286
Mek, move.

702
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:25,286
Dad!

703
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:32,805
Fuji, enough.

704
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:34,235
Stop this already.

705
00:42:34,236 --> 00:42:35,156
Stop!

706
00:42:35,157 --> 00:42:35,991
Stop now!

707
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:36,992
Ouch!

708
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,069
Ouch!

709
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:47,475
Inside of you probably hides a monster just like others, Tibet.

710
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:49,798
I won't be in your game.

711
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,798
Not every human is evil like you.

712
00:42:54,686 --> 00:42:55,798
Is that so?

713
00:42:56,696 --> 00:42:58,375
But do you know that

714
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:01,193
every human has a dark side hidden?

715
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:04,580
I just woke it up

716
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:09,620
to make humans reveal their inborn traits and true colors to others.

717
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,405
You can't change me,

718
00:43:11,406 --> 00:43:14,251
and I'll never become what you want me to.

719
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:17,460
Well, shall we bet?

720
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:21,456
I bet I can change you,

721
00:43:22,056 --> 00:43:25,451
just like how I bet with Master Puth, your dad.

722
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:27,718
What did you do?

723
00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:30,767
Listen.

724
00:43:31,282 --> 00:43:32,838
Your dad loved you a lot.

725
00:43:33,602 --> 00:43:35,595
You're his everything.

726
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:37,576
I was so envious.

727
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:41,273
I wish my dad were like Master Puth, your dad.

728
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:43,389
But that's impossible.

729
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:45,300
That's why I had to destroy him.

730
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:52,891
I'm thinking about quitting Home School.

731
00:43:55,824 --> 00:43:57,296
Why, Master Puth?

732
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:02,586
I want to go back and live with my son.

733
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:05,051
I want to see him grow up.

734
00:44:07,726 --> 00:44:10,598
And you'll leave Home School just like this?

735
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:15,247
At one point in life,

736
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,331
a dad must put his child before anything else.

737
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,100
Master Puth, to be frank,

738
00:44:38,562 --> 00:44:40,096
it's a regret.

739
00:44:42,856 --> 00:44:44,784
But before I leave,

740
00:44:45,326 --> 00:44:47,967
I want you to stop what you're doing to Master Amin.

741
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:51,522
I don't want him to turn into this kind of person.

742
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,624
But Master Amin asked me to hypnotize him.

743
00:44:59,686 --> 00:45:00,686
I know,

744
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:05,647
but Master Amin I know will never agree on using violence.

745
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:12,020
But if we don't do this,

746
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:14,376
we can't make a change, Master Puth.

747
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:19,362
Our Home School students will keep being hurt by their own families.

748
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:28,251
Prasath.

749
00:45:29,744 --> 00:45:31,735
I understand that you were hurt by your dad so much

750
00:45:31,736 --> 00:45:33,736
that you lost everything.

751
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:36,384
But using violence won't help.

752
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:40,011
It will only turn us into a monster.

753
00:45:58,296 --> 00:46:00,006
Why are you laughing?

754
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,367
What if I've already turned into a monster?

755
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,496
What will you do, Master?

756
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:12,873
What are you doing?

757
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:17,762
In the end, your dad...

758
00:46:18,056 --> 00:46:19,695
Prasath, let go!

759
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:20,918
Let go!

760
00:46:26,146 --> 00:46:27,584
Prasath.

761
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:28,616
Prasath.

762
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:43,851
Woo-hoo.

763
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:51,087
Your dad didn't even have a chance to live and see you grow up.

764
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:53,984
Plus, not long after your dad's death,

765
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,327
your mom was sick

766
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:59,247
and then joined him in death because she missed him.

767
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:01,496
Wow.

768
00:47:02,496 --> 00:47:04,767
I killed two birds with one stone.

769
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:07,433
Your family was totally screwed because of me.

770
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:08,975
Asshole!

771
00:47:08,976 --> 00:47:10,989
Shut up!

772
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,706
I don't believe you!

773
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:16,367
Hey, why would I lie to you?

774
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:18,971
This is exactly how I want you to become.

775
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:22,438
You're an important part of Project R.

776
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:25,869
I don't believe you!

777
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,069
Shut up!

778
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:29,931
Listen.

779
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:31,300
This is such an important matter.

780
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:32,405
Listen to me.

781
00:47:32,406 --> 00:47:33,595
Do you know that

782
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:35,167
before your mom died,

783
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,775
she really wanted to see you?

784
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:40,171
She wanted to see you so desperately.

785
00:47:40,172 --> 00:47:41,605
It's me.

786
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:42,945
It's my doing.

787
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:45,131
I ordered Master Amin not to allow you to go back.

788
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:48,144
Shut up!

789
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:15,069
I need more.

790
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:16,856
More!

791
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:26,500
Shoot.

792
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:29,467
Shoot.

793
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:30,468
Tibet.

794
00:48:33,616 --> 00:48:35,007
Listen to me.

795
00:48:36,596 --> 00:48:40,195
To take revenge on someone who hurt you,

796
00:48:40,196 --> 00:48:45,353
you mustn't turn into a monster like him.

797
00:48:47,786 --> 00:48:55,786
Getting back at violence by using violence will only give you tears.

798
00:49:15,904 --> 00:49:16,962
Tibet,

799
00:49:18,366 --> 00:49:21,051
don't grow up into someone you hate.

800
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,743
You still have your friends

801
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:25,735
and others you love.

802
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:27,327
You can still be happy.

803
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:31,949
Don't let hatred ruin who you are, Tibet.

804
00:49:31,984 --> 00:49:36,136
You're too worthy to turn into a monster like Prasath.

805
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:48,047
You guys are such good people.

806
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:50,678
But I've prepared another bomb.

807
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,676
What are you planning to do?

808
00:49:52,918 --> 00:49:53,918
Run,

809
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:56,118
if I were you now,

810
00:49:56,856 --> 00:50:00,758
I would be so worried about Maki, White, and Nai.

811
00:50:16,176 --> 00:50:17,765
Everything is alright.

812
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:19,315
Mr. Metha is safe.

813
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,024
After we handle everything here,

814
00:50:21,025 --> 00:50:23,416
I'll send all the parents home.

815
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:25,416
Let's go help others now.

816
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:28,020
Master Phoban,

817
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:30,162
are you betraying us?

818
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:32,756
Everyone, run away!

819
00:50:32,757 --> 00:50:33,407
Run now!

820
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,062
Ouch!

821
00:50:34,063 --> 00:50:35,063
White!

822
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:47,593
Hurry up!

823
00:50:51,993 --> 00:50:52,676
Stop!

824
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:53,102
Ouch!

825
00:50:53,103 --> 00:50:54,103
White!

826
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,624
Hurry up!

827
00:50:58,176 --> 00:50:59,736
Everyone, stop!

828
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:03,456
White!

829
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:05,996
White!

830
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:08,793
Are you alright?

831
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:09,793
White.

832
00:51:54,296 --> 00:51:55,566
Maki!

833
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:08,761
Hang in there.

834
00:52:08,786 --> 00:52:10,480
You'll be alright.

835
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:11,186
Maki!

836
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,278
Maki...

837
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,495
Run away!

838
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:16,222
No!

839
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:16,969
Now!

840
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:17,958
We won't.

841
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:19,948
We won't leave you!

842
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,651
Run away now!

843
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:27,478
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

844
00:52:29,862 --> 00:52:32,607
Let's bet on our beliefs.

845
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,357
I believe

846
00:52:34,358 --> 00:52:40,897
none of the kids will turn themselves into monsters as you want.

847
00:52:40,898 --> 00:52:42,017
Deal.

848
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:47,453
I'm sure one of Home School students will kill someone.

849
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:49,844
Run, where are you going?

850
00:52:50,698 --> 00:52:52,431
I'll kill him.
