1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
This GEN is developing exponentially.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,919
That's why I want you to start the new course right away.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,693
I wonder if the kids will be able to pass it.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,129
What have you done to Hugo and Jingjai?

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,600
Hugo and Jingjai are only being punished for their mistakes.

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,133
Hugo.

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,826
Hugo?

8
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,820
Why the hell are you standing?

9
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,519
Hey.

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,786
Hugo?

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,680
Can you hear me?

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,440
Hey?

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,720
Hugo.

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,779
Can you hear me?

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Treatment room.

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640
Hugo?

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,240
Treatment room!

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,571
Hugo!

19
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:28,360
Treatment room!

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,944
Hugo!

21
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:29,771
Treatment room!

22
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:30,253
Hugo!

23
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,319
Damn it.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,200
What the hell is going on?

25
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,213
Treatment room!

26
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:35,919
- Hugo! - Treatment room!

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,289
Hugo, what's wrong with you?!

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,960
What's wrong with you?!

29
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:39,986
Hugo!

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,259
Treatment room!

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,479
Hugo!

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,560
Treatment room!

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,852
She's gone?

34
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,850
How could it happen?

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,049
I don't know, Master Amin,

36
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,649
but I guess

37
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,666
the medicine Master Dilak received has a side effect.

38
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,880
Has Master Praeporn been informed of this?

39
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,280
I informed her already.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,769
Do you know if.

41
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,959
Master Praeporn gave Master Dilak the right amount of medicine

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,720
she should be given?

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,329
I'm not sure.

44
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,253
You must be in charge of examining this closely, mustn't you?

45
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,503
You know Master Dilak is sick.

46
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,146
If we fail to take care of her well,

47
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:39,039
her symptom could return.

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
I won't let this happen again, Master.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:51,199
Master Dilak even decided to join us at Home School.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,573
You must take good care of her.

51
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,053
Yes, Master Amin.

52
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:01,306
Find her and make sure she's alright.

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,626
Let's continue our treatment for you, Run.

54
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,933
Why don't you want to watch what I want you to?

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
I won't watch.

56
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:58,890
But you must watch it, Run.

57
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:02,010
You must trust me.

58
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,809
Try opening up your mind,

59
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,640
and you'll see that it's good.

60
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,266
(Rin!)

61
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,213
(Rin, come here!)

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,680
(Come join me.)

63
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,739
Hey, everyone.

64
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,799
This is Rin, my little sister.

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,665
I love her a lot.

66
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,659
Come on.

67
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,879
(Let me see your face.)

68
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,360
(Come on, Rin.)

69
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,493
(Let me see.)

70
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:40,133
(Show them what you read today.)

71
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,279
What is the story? Show us.

72
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,419
Winnie the Pooh.

73
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,626
Is it fun?

74
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,920
(How can it be fun?)

75
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:46,959
(You haven't even read it.)

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,079
(I already did.)

77
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,826
(You're lying.)

78
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:49,693
(I'm not.)

79
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:50,733
(Really?)

80
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,840
Did you find her, Master Prasath?

82
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,439
I didn't.

83
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
I don't know where she has walked to.

84
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,120
But usually, she isn't behaving like this.

85
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,280
I knew Master Dilak wasn't ready.

86
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,013
But Master Amin doesn't think so.

87
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,650
Then quickly find her.

88
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,650
Where?

89
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,426
Treatment room?

90
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:24,940
Did he refer to the infirmary?

91
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,419
I don't know,

92
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,493
but I think Hugo is looking so weird.

93
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,650
That's right.

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,249
I also think Hugo and Jingjai are acting weird

95
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,426
after being released.

96
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,289
How about Jingjai?

97
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,480
Did she also sleepwalk?

98
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
She didn't,

99
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,400
but she's acting weird too.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,506
How?

101
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,480
This morning,

102
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:06,733
I met Jingjai in front of the bathroom.

103
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,180
It must be changed.

104
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:19,290
It must be changed.

105
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,290
It must be changed.

106
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,586
It must be changed.

107
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:27,810
It must be changed.

108
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
It must be changed.

109
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:32,040
Jingjai?

110
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,866
It must be changed.

111
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
It must be changed.

112
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,960
Jingjai.

113
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,253
It must be changed.

114
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,786
Are you alright?

115
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:44,370
It must be changed.

116
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,279
It must be changed.

117
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,546
Jingjai!

118
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,026
What?

119
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,209
What are you doing?

120
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,760
I'm brushing my hair.

121
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,546
I'm sure those Masters have done something to Hugo and Jingjai.

122
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,666
Or.

123
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,093
Did those Masters use some black magic on them?

124
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,279
Is that the best idea you could come up with?

125
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,519
What?

126
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,519
I'm just doubting.

127
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,773
We're living in the land of superstition, aren't we?

128
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:40,266
Or did they get brainwashed by some creeds?

129
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,639
Why didn't you just say The UFO caught them?

130
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Hey.

131
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:50,740
But NASA already confirmed the UFO existence.

132
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,173
Maki.

133
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,970
What are you thinking?

134
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,059
Don't fight.

135
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,960
Pennhung doesn't like it.

136
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,659
Don't fight.

137
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,520
Pennhung doesn't like it.

138
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,171
Mek, Mork,

139
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:08,466
don't fight. Pennhung doesn't like it.

140
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,559
Don't fight.

141
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,320
Mek. Mork.

142
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,179
Why are you two fighting?!

143
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,659
Look at Mek.

144
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,419
He stole my food.

145
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,693
Why are you making this little thing such a big deal?

146
00:10:18,694 --> 00:10:20,179
You're damn selfish.

147
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,739
I'm your twin brother,

148
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,199
but you've never given me anything.

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,639
If you asked me nicely,

150
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,009
I would give you.

151
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,799
But you stole it.

152
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,799
You didn't even tell me.

153
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,199
If I asked you,

154
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,609
would you give me, huh?

155
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,493
Ptui!

156
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:35,489
Would someone like you give it to me?

157
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,986
I've never received anything.

158
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:39,739
Dad only gave good things to you.

159
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,879
I've never got anything!

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,519
It's because you behave like this.

161
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,144
That's why Dad hasn't given you anything.

162
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,599
What's wrong with me behaving like this?

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,240
Right.

164
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,053
I'm an asshole,

165
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,579
and so what?

166
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,049
In the end, Mom loves me.

167
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,492
I'm better than you whom Mom never loves.

168
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:55,586
Watch your words!

169
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,049
Don't fight.

170
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,289
Pennhung doesn't like it.

171
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,066
Don't fight.

172
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,613
Pennhung doesn't like it.

173
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:02,679
Stop!

174
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,664
Don't fight.

175
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:04,691
- Don't fight. - Mek, Mork,

176
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:05,733
- Stop! - Pennhung doesn't like it.

177
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,346
Don't fight.

178
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,619
Stop!

179
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,053
Stop already!

180
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,929
Why are you two always arguing?

181
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,279
You are twin brothers, aren't you?

182
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,426
Don't you love each other?

183
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,053
Love? My ass!

184
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,379
I'm so damn upset

185
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,533
to have been born looking like him.

186
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:20,689
Wow. Asshole.

187
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,503
Do you think I really want to look like you?

188
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,360
I didn't want to be your twin brother.

189
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,649
Mek, Mork,

190
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,339
don't fight.

191
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,569
Pennhung doesn't like it.

192
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,480
Mek, Mork,

193
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,091
don't fight.

194
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,092
Pennhung doesn't like it.

195
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:41,826
(GEN6 students, please get changed and gather in the courtyard now.)

196
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,160
There will be no class today,

197
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,879
but I've prepared an activity for you to join

198
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,239
to test how ready you are as a student at Home School.

199
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,649
What activity?

200
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,652
We don't want something like Master Praeporn's activity.

201
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:11,586
Each Master has a different way of teaching.

202
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:13,039
Don't worry

203
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,293
because there's nothing complicated or deceiving in my course.

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,986
Please take one stick each.

205
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Hurry up!

206
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,666
In this activity, you will be divided into two teams.

207
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:00,009
Those who got black sticks are in the Black Team.

208
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,859
Those who got white sticks are in the White Team.

209
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,320
Please take the gloves, based on your team color.

210
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,813
What are you making us do, Master?

211
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,499
You must compete.

212
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,579
You must fight over the food

213
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,492
because the winning team will get the ingredients

214
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,359
to cook their next meal.

215
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,440
The losing team won't get to eat anything.

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,573
You're making us skip our meal again, aren't you?

217
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:39,919
Be frank with us.

218
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
What's your problem with this?

219
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,530
It's because that's necessary.

220
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,439
You must do whatever you can to survive.

221
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,819
In the real world, everyone is fighting over things

222
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,773
and competing to live a good life.

223
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,609
What competition is it?

224
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,019
A representative from each team will be randomly selected,

225
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,146
depending on my decision.

226
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,409
Can that even work?

227
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,546
Of course,

228
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,786
since it's my rule.

229
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,520
Mek,

230
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,493
you will represent the White Team.

231
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,440
Mork,

232
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
you will represent the Black Team.

233
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,480
Please step to the front, both of you.

234
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Now!

235
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Are we playing Tug-Of-War or what?

236
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:08,666
I'm ordering you to punch each other.

237
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,880
Whichever team drops the rope first, that team loses.

238
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,466
After I give you the signal to start,

239
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:34,853
please fight to your fullest potential.

240
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,619
If you win,

241
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,169
your team will be full,

242
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,839
but if you lose,

243
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,339
your team and you won't get to eat.

244
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,559
Most importantly,

245
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,680
the result depends on who drops the rope first.

246
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,479
If you're ready,

247
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
please stand there.

248
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Mork, don't give in.

249
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,139
The competition begins in

250
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,649
three, two, one.

251
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,650
Start!

252
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,413
Ow!

253
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,169
Mork, go for it!

254
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,840
Come on, Mork.

255
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,879
Mek, don't stop.

256
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,304
Don't give it.

257
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:17,305
Bring it on.

258
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,013
Mork, don't be such a loser.

259
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,373
Come on!

260
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,419
Mek, don't let him hug you.

261
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
Push him!

262
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,499
Mek, punch him.

263
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,293
That's right.

264
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:34,599
Mek, punch him.

265
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,359
Keep fighting. Don't give up.

266
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,559
Mek, take the rope from him.

267
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,360
Mork, keep fighting.

268
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,293
Don't drop the rope.

269
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,200
Mork, you can't beat him.

270
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,613
Mork, don't drop the rope.

271
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,329
Mek, get the rope!

272
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,679
Mek, enough.

273
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,453
Will you drop it or not?

274
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:48,450
Mek, don't stop.

275
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:49,813
Mork, don't drop it.

276
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,426
Mek, take the rope.

277
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:52,809
Mek, pull it!

278
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,619
Mek, enough.

279
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,306
Mek, stop.

280
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,986
Mork can't take it anymore.

281
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,039
Master, I think you should stop this now.

282
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,573
Mork can't go on anymore.

283
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:07,919
The result depends on whoever drops the rope first.

284
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,145
If no one does,

285
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,140
the competition must continue.

286
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,089
Are you making students kill each other?

287
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,225
Mek, enough.

288
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:17,840
Mork.

289
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,680
Mek, stop.

290
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,573
Mork, drop the rope.

291
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:20,899
Mork, enough.

292
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,291
Go away!

293
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,240
Mek!

294
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,169
Mek, stop!

295
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,506
Drop it. We can give up.

296
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:27,346
Mork, drop it.

297
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,493
Feel free to give up.

298
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,826
Just drop the rope first.

299
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,939
Let go of me!

300
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,729
Or you can make Mork drop the rope.

301
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,506
It's your right.

302
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:36,719
You have the right to choose which team should win.

303
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,613
Let go of me!

304
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:38,959
Tibet, stay away!

305
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,059
Grab the rope!

306
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,359
Or our team will lose.

307
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,739
Maki, help Mork.

308
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,720
His condition is not okay now.

309
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,691
Mork, drop the rope.

310
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,026
- Do you want to die or what? - Maki, help.

311
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:48,479
Enough!

312
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,384
Mork can't bear it anymore.

313
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:49,891
Stop!

314
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:50,691
Stop fighting already!

315
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:51,133
Pennhung.

316
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,299
Stop!

317
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,439
Stop fighting!

318
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,479
Stop!

319
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,663
Mork can't bear it anymore.

320
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:56,839
Stop fighting already!

321
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,119
Calm down, Pennhung.

322
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,184
Are you making my team lose or what?

323
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:00,000
Stop already.

324
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,079
White.

325
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,051
Move!

326
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:03,040
That's against the competition rule.

327
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,360
We won't follow this crazy rule!

328
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,383
Do you guys want to get punished that much?

329
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:10,973
You will stop only when someone drops the rope, right?

330
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,304
Stop!

331
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,160
Mork!

332
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,666
Maki.

333
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,979
Stop.

334
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,409
Stop already.

335
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,093
Move.

336
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:21,120
I won't.

337
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:22,893
I told you to move.

338
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,213
Nai!

339
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,493
What the hell are you doing?

340
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,239
I'll punish all four of you

341
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
for disobeying my order.

342
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,699
Whatever the punishment is,

343
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,479
just go ahead, Master.

344
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,729
But let me repeat this to you.

345
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,960
We don't feel guilty about what we did at all.

346
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,746
What Master made us do was too cruel.

347
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,819
I know,

348
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,106
and I admit that what I ordered you to do was cruel.

349
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,946
Why did you order us to do it then?

350
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,159
You don't need to know.

351
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,586
When the right time comes, you'll understand it.

352
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,983
What if we don't want to understand it?

353
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,719
Why must we understand such a crazy thing?

354
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,529
You just wanted to mess with our heads.

355
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,199
Yes.

356
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,319
You're right.

357
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,293
Also, I already predicted that you four would do this.

358
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,489
But have you ever wondered

359
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,853
how your friends would live without you guys?

360
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,839
All our friends are much stronger than you think, Master.

361
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,320
But when humans really see no way out,

362
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,786
they reveal their primitive instincts.

363
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,800
But humans aren't always cruel.

364
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,053
We do care for

365
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,786
and sympathize with each other.

366
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:36,980
We try to help each other.

367
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,619
You'll soon see

368
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,293
that the world is not as kind as you think.

369
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,306
Headmaster.

370
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,053
Stop being stubborn already, Run.

371
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,259
Accept and trust Home School again

372
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,760
like you used to.

373
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,933
There's no way

374
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,920
I'll trust.

375
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Run.

376
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,369
If you continue behaving like this,

377
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,853
your sister will be in danger.

378
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:10,013
There's no way Master Amin will hurt my sister.

379
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,133
It's not Master Amin who will hurt her.

380
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,746
Hey, be careful.

381
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,799
Mek, won't you check on your twin brother?

382
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,225
Are you silly?

383
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:59,219
He punched him that much.

384
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,099
How do you want him to help?

385
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,666
But he must take responsibility, mustn't he?

386
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,969
Don't.

387
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,506
I don't need that.

388
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,719
Pennhung thinks Mek and Mork shouldn't be mad at each other.

389
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,239
Mek and Mork just followed Master Champ's order.

390
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,039
Mek and Mork followed the rule.

391
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,809
Don't hate each other.

392
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,280
Though Master Champ didn't order us to,

393
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
we still hate each other anyway.

394
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,720
He and I never wanted to be born twin brothers.

395
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,106
Why?

396
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,105
You're twin brothers,

397
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:37,106
so you're supposed to love each other, aren't you?

398
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:38,599
I've heard that

399
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,399
twins' minds are connected.

400
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,099
Connected minds? My ass!

401
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,779
There's no such thing.

402
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,720
The only feeling we share in common is our hatred toward each other.

403
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,999
Hey, I'm curious.

404
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,839
Why do you hate each other?

405
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,839
Dad loves him

406
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,026
but hates me.

407
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,359
Mom loves me

408
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,920
but hates him.

409
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,266
How is your mid-team exam result?

410
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,506
Well, it's good.

411
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
What do you mean by good?

412
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,539
I got 40 out of 50 in mathematics.

413
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,426
I got 43 out of 50 in science.

414
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,359
You performed better last time, didn't you?

415
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,012
Why are your scores worse?

416
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:01,626
With these scores, how could you even become a doctor?

417
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,329
Don't forget that

418
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,293
in the future, you must take over our hospital business after me.

419
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,499
Mek, how about you?

420
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,853
How are your scores?

421
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,850
I asked what your scores are.

422
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,850
My scores aren't as good as Mork's.

423
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,960
You know well I'm not good at studying.

424
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:34,640
In this world, there's no one who's bad at studying.

425
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,770
There're only those who lack effort.

426
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:40,339
If you continue behaving like this,

427
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,339
you'll grow up to be a good-for-nothing adult,

428
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,729
living your life aimlessly.

429
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,440
You'll become useless.

430
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,973
A person's value doesn't always depend on their career.

431
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,932
Though Mek can't perform as well as Mork,

432
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,639
that doesn't mean he will end up having an awful life.

433
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,266
That's why Mek is behaving like you.

434
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,479
Mek just can't study well as you could,

435
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,259
but you call him useless.

436
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,733
I don't want to waste my time with a good-for-nothing.

437
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,226
Keep this in mind.

438
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,640
Learn to teach our sons only good things

439
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,706
and do not think that your thoughts are good enough

440
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,653
to be passed on to our sons.

441
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,650
Ow!

442
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,519
What the hell are you doing?

443
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,160
Why?

444
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,799
Are you looking for trouble?

445
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,384
Dad, calm down.

446
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:36,960
It hurts!

447
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,853
Dad, don't!

448
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:39,529
Mek, stay away!

449
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,959
Dad, calm down.

450
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,689
Mork, look at your dad's true color.

451
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,051
Why?

452
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:43,704
Watch out.

453
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:44,776
You might grow up to be like him.

454
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,360
Shut up.

455
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,929
Dad, stop already.

456
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,480
Listen to me.

457
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,799
Hey, stop her!

458
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Stop, Dad.

459
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm begging you.

460
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,640
I understand your feelings well.

461
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,360
At first,

462
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:11,520
I had been wondering why Dad sent me to Home School.

463
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,769
I thought he just wanted to push me to become No.1

464
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,219
and study at a good school.

465
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,612
After graduating,

466
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:24,610
I could become a doctor as he has expected.

467
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,439
How about now?

468
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,239
Have you changed your mind already?

469
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,239
How could I not?

470
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
This place is seriously hell.

471
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,133
Right.

472
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:43,240
Why would parents want to send their kids to this kind of school?

473
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,419
This world is so damn shitty to me.

474
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,600
It is to everyone.

475
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,013
Well, can Pennhung say something?

476
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,739
Pennhung thinks

477
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,179
no matter how cruel this world is to us,

478
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,466
we don't have to hate each other

479
00:28:19,786 --> 00:28:21,780
because if we hate each other,

480
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:24,420
we'll be left with no one.

481
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,649
For all four of you who disobeyed Master's order,

482
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,999
we'll punish you

483
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,920
to make you feel remorse over your actions.

484
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,359
I told you already that

485
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,959
what we did wasn't wrong.

486
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,120
What Master Champ did was wrong.

487
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,906
For you, White,

488
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,680
you're indeed prone to getting an extra punishment.

489
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,133
How will you punish us, Headmaster?

490
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,680
You must go to the Tree of Remorse.

491
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,626
The Tree of Remorse?

492
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,620
What is it?

493
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,000
Follow me.

494
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:15,090
Where are we going?

495
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:17,530
I told you to follow me.

496
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,893
This is the Tree of Remorse.

497
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,773
It just looks like any ordinary trees out there.

498
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,779
It does, if you look at it with your unintelligent eyes.

499
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,546
What's special about this tree?

500
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,573
How will it punish us?

501
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,999
Or will it move

502
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,653
and hit our ass like a scene in a movie?

503
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,369
There's no such thing.

504
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,249
It's called The Tree of Remorse

505
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:11,019
because all of you must sit at this tree and reflect on your mistakes

506
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,026
until you admit what you did wrong.

507
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:19,320
We're going to sit there all day for sure.

508
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,439
Feel free to do so if you want.

509
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,969
I'll sit here, watching you

510
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,160
until all of you feel remorse over your actions.

511
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,733
Go ahead.

512
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,299
That's it?

513
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,139
Kneel down

514
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,000
and feel remorse over your actions!

515
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:24,479
The White Team, please start cooking.

516
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,079
I strictly forbid you

517
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,359
from sharing any ingredients with the Black Team.

518
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,119
But there're a lot of ingredients here.

519
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,849
There're only few of us.

520
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,106
We won't use them up.

521
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:36,939
It's alright

522
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,399
because what is left will be thrown away immediately.

523
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,640
You're strictly not allowed to store any for future use.

524
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,960
Why do you forbid us?

525
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,480
It's because you have to compete again

526
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,119
to fight over the ingredients for your next meal.

527
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,240
Huh?

528
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,579
How do we compete?

529
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,573
What is the competition?

530
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,339
You'll find out soon.

531
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,213
Hurry up and cook your meal.

532
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,079
Before this,

533
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,559
they kept forbidding me from eating,

534
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,360
but now that I get to eat it,

535
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,600
I don't feel like eating at all.

536
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,609
Do we have to compete again?

537
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,369
How can we beat them?

538
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,719
We aren't having our meal.

539
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm out of energy.

540
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:28,339
You're right.

541
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,826
I'm starving.

542
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,599
We're now totally at a disadvantage.

543
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,209
Look at Mork.

544
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,013
He's injured.

545
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,520
I don't think he can do anything.

546
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,640
White and Nai are also being punished.

547
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,849
We won't get to eat,

548
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,426
and we don't have enough people either.

549
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:45,699
Damn.

550
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,759
Shit.

551
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,933
The God is so cruel to us.

552
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:58,489
Well, can Pennhung say something?

553
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,746
Pennhung, when you want to say something,

554
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,933
you don't have to ask for permission.

555
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:04,506
Just say it.

556
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:12,339
Well, Pennhung has stored a small amount of food.

557
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,259
Do you want to eat it?

558
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,439
Really?

559
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
I want to.

560
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,291
Pennhung, did you secretly hide some food those Masters gave us?

561
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:26,292
Yes.

562
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,460
You're incredible.

563
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,345
Eh?

564
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:47,340
Why are there only croissants?

565
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,226
Pennhung really loves croissants.

566
00:34:52,493 --> 00:34:54,332
But if everyone doesn't want to eat,

567
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,459
Pennhung can keep them.

568
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,160
Hey.

569
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,064
Pennhung.

570
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:57,893
I'll eat it.

571
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:59,289
We'll eat.

572
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,719
We'll eat them.

573
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
Okay?

574
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,019
Thank you, Pennhung.

575
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,813
Thanks, Pennhung.

576
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,529
Can Pennhung say something again?

577
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,892
You asked again.

578
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:21,890
Just say it.

579
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,699
Well,

580
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,146
can I eat a croissant too?

581
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,649
They're yours.

582
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,504
Just take it.

583
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:31,559
You don't need to ask for permission.

584
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Come on.

585
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,240
I think Master Dilak has just walked past this area.

586
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,106
But why is she heading this way?

587
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:12,640
The exit from this forest is in another direction, isn't it?

588
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,359
She's running amuck now.

589
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,679
We must find her as soon as possible

590
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,160
before she gets in danger.

591
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,453
Yes, Master.

592
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,800
The footprints aren't the same.

593
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,400
Master Dilak isn't alone.

594
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,733
For our competition to win the ingredients this round,

595
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,720
I'm still ordering you to fight with each other,

596
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,089
based on the same rule.

597
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,840
Whoever drops the rope first will lose.

598
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,120
Who will you pick for this fight, Master?

599
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,706
This time, I'll let you draw lots

600
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,880
for the fight.

601
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,859
Wait.

602
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,720
But our team has fewer people.

603
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:22,559
That team has five members,

604
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,173
while there're four of us here.

605
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,466
How can we fight?

606
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,160
Mork, who is now injured, is exempted from joining this competition.

607
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,199
We'll have four pairs in total.

608
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:42,559
The team that earns more points will get the ingredients to cook their next meal.

609
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,039
I'll let the winning team from the last round draw lots first.

610
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Who will go first?

611
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,306
(Jingjai)

612
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,946
Jingjai.

613
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,373
But I'm a woman, Master.

614
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,719
In the real world,

615
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,959
women and men are equal.

616
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,609
If you want to survive,

617
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,173
you must fight.

618
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:40,139
If you're ready,

619
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,493
the competition starts in

620
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,439
three, two, one.

621
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Start!

622
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,879
Ow!

623
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,253
Hugo, don't!

624
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,813
Who will dare hurt this beautiful baby?

625
00:38:58,814 --> 00:38:59,826
Yuck!

626
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
I'll let you win.

627
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,172
Thank you, Handsome.

628
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:15,170
Super romantic.

629
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,170
One point for the Black Team.

630
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,985
The Black Team,

631
00:39:27,986 --> 00:39:29,980
please draw your opponent's name.

632
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,573
Fuji,

633
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,666
it's our fight.

634
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,920
Bring it on.

635
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,919
I'm sorry, Fuji.

636
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,533
I'm not a soft-hearted guy like Hugo is.

637
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,880
To me, women and men are equal.

638
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,103
Look at how much you're showing off.

639
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:11,719
I'll make you stay muted.

640
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
You, not I, will be muted.

641
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,399
Ouch!

642
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,680
Ow!

643
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,579
Fuji, you're cheating!

644
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,093
Master hasn't told us to start.

645
00:40:29,946 --> 00:40:31,940
What do you say, Master?

646
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,613
One point for the White Team.

647
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:36,133
It's a tie of 1:1 now.

648
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,369
Damn it!

649
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,813
What the hell?

650
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,699
Amazing, Fuji.

651
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,839
Alright.

652
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,139
The White Team,

653
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,786
it's your turn to draw lots.

654
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:01,159
(Biw)

655
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,259
Hey, Biw.

656
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,260
It's you.

657
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:11,973
It's going to be fun.

658
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,399
If you're ready,

659
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,819
start!

660
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,413
Drop it.

661
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:37,079
Drop it, Pheng.

662
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,920
Drop it.

663
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:40,386
I told you to drop it.

664
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:41,533
Drop it!

665
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,253
Drop it!

666
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
I said, drop it.

667
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,171
If you don't,

668
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,040
I'll slap you.

669
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,499
Pheng!

670
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,289
Drop the rope.

671
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,333
Drop it!

672
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,330
I told you to drop it!

673
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,599
Drop it!

674
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,279
Drop it.

675
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,026
Drop it, Pheng.

676
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Drop it.

677
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,720
Why are you doing this?

678
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,826
What's wrong with you, Pheng?

679
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,440
I told you to drop it!

680
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm not giving in.

681
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,640
Drop it.

682
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,586
Drop it already.

683
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,773
Biw,

684
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,080
can we become friends again?

685
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,773
I'm sorry, Pheng.

686
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,066
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,866
We're friends again now, right?

688
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,893
I'm sorry.

689
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,119
I'm sorry, Pheng.

690
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,133
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,009
Did it hurt?

692
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,000
No. It's alright.

693
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:36,560
It didn't hurt.

694
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,426
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:18,253
The last fight which will decide the result is

696
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:21,240
between Mek and Pennhung.

697
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:24,106
If you're ready, start!

698
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,613
Pennhung, you're ready, right?

699
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,786
Pennhung is ready.

700
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,853
Three, two, one.

701
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:16,099
Do you know that

702
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,346
by doing this, you'll be forbidden from eating your meal?

703
00:45:23,013 --> 00:45:25,009
We're willing not to eat

704
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,010
rather than fight among ourselves.

705
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,929
Fine.

706
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:30,293
That's your decision.

707
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,929
From this meal until Monday,

708
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,360
you won't get any ingredients to cook even for one meal.

709
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,239
So what?

710
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,459
We'll survive anyway.

711
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,773
Right.

712
00:45:43,813 --> 00:45:45,945
Yes. It's not a problem for us.

713
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:47,940
Yeah. It's so easy.

714
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,266
I'll wait and see that.

715
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,480
I'll wait and see that.

716
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,099
Hey, come.

717
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,173
Come.

718
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:11,346
Come on.

719
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,099
Pennhung, how're your balls?

720
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,259
They aren't Pennhung's.

721
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,186
They're Jean's.

722
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:18,266
Pennhung, you were acting cool.

723
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,129
From now, we must call her.

724
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,289
Iron-legged Fuji.

725
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,520
Oho.

726
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:24,546
You want a fight or what?

727
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:25,569
Hey, wait.

728
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,705
Jingjai won't allow you to.

729
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:28,700
One kick. Deal?

730
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,813
One.

731
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:41,306
Two,

732
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:42,893
Three.

733
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,013
Four.

734
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,920
Five.

735
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,690
Six.

736
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,866
Seven.

737
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,680
Eight.

738
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
Turn right.

739
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,880
One.

740
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,093
Two.

741
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,379
Three.

742
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,809
Four.

743
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,280
Five.

744
00:48:06,146 --> 00:48:07,506
Six.

745
00:48:07,906 --> 00:48:08,906
Seven.

746
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,693
Eight.

747
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,280
Nine.

748
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,666
Turn left

749
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:21,210
and keep walking.

750
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,960
White.

751
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:36,666
Are you okay?

752
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:38,399
Uh-huh.

753
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,969
How about you?

754
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,465
You're sweating all over your face.

755
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,459
I almost can't continue.

756
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,609
Tibet, are you okay?

757
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,440
Um. Are you?

758
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,129
Headmaster,

759
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,186
won't you let us eat anything at all?

760
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,026
If you agree to feel remorse over your actions,

761
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:08,306
you'll get to eat the food on the table.

762
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:12,186
I even brought a picnic basket for you.

763
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:19,020
I'm ready to die!

764
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,653
We won't.

765
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,680
There's nothing we have to feel remorse over.

766
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,506
That's up to you.

767
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:40,106
Ahhhhhhhhh!

768
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:42,680
Ahhhhhhhhh!

769
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,059
Stay here.

770
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,560
Don't go anywhere.

771
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,329
Ahhhhhh!

772
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,786
Is that Master Dilak's voice?

773
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:58,279
I think so.

774
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,013
Why is she screaming like that?

775
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,129
Where are you going, Maki?

776
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,293
We're searching for Master Dilak.

777
00:50:09,294 --> 00:50:11,106
Are you really going?

778
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,343
It's better than sitting here,

779
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:14,160
feeling remorse under this silly tree.

780
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,080
Let's go.

781
00:50:25,306 --> 00:50:28,859
Master Dilak!

782
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,946
Master.

783
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
Can you hear us?

784
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,329
Master.

785
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,133
Master Dilak!

786
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,146
Master!

787
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:44,460
Master Dilak!

788
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,680
Master!

789
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:55,210
Master!

790
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:01,240
Guys, I've found Master Dilak!

791
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,613
Master?

792
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,706
Master?

793
00:51:08,386 --> 00:51:10,120
Master Dilak.

794
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:14,769
What did you say?

795
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:15,480
Run.

796
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,720
Run.

797
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,160
Run is here.

798
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,346
Run is inside Home School.

799
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,373
Home School.

800
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,546
He's inside Home School.

801
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,853
Yes.

802
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:32,986
That's right.

803
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:49,179
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

804
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,919
So what really happened, Master?

805
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,413
What were you doing inside the forest?

806
00:51:52,414 --> 00:51:56,559
Master Dilak's condition is similar to Hugo's and Jingjai's.

807
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,303
Home School is not different from a prison.

808
00:51:58,304 --> 00:52:00,143
Are we escaping from Home School again?

809
00:52:00,144 --> 00:52:01,929
If 13 of us help each other,

810
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:02,866
we'll figure it out.

811
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:05,183
Get out of here like how we came in.

812
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:06,652
You must tell them the truth.

813
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:07,879
It's one of the lessons

814
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,019
all of them must learn.

815
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:10,853
Stop!

816
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:12,399
There's a fire in the hall.

817
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,211
We've found the key!

818
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:14,120
Let's quickly get out of here.

819
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,120
Let's go!
