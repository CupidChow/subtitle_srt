1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,830
What the hell is this?

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,520
They don't teach us at all.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,710
All they do is punish us.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,710
We didn't do anything wrong.

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,600
From today until your graduation,

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:17,600
I appoint Maki as GEN6 Class President at Home School.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,020
Why me?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,700
It's your duty as GEN4 Class President.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,020
You must know, Run, that I have high expectations for you.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,500
But what you're ordering me to do is not right.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Sometimes, we must do something that isn't right to change something.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,170
But you're asking me to kill someone.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,010
You must understand, Run,

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:06,010
that everything I do is for the future of everyone at Home School.

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,570
(DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO)

16
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,790
I invited you here today because I wanted to talk to you...

17
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,100
about your duty as Class President.

18
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:31,346
From now on, you must help all the Masters...

19
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:35,901
keep an eye on your friends and make sure they follow the rules.

20
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,710
In addition,

21
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,800
you must work with Master Phoban to keep Home School in order.

22
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,010
Any questions, Maki?

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,990
Why chose me to be Class President?

24
00:02:57,394 --> 00:03:01,954
Because you remind me of someone in the past.

25
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:04,564
Who?

26
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:08,444
He's your GEN4 senior.

27
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:11,924
His name is Run.

28
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,134
The one you asked me about recently.

29
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:20,444
He's Class President just like you.

30
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:29,954
Speaking of, you and Run have many things in common.

31
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:34,854
Where is he now?

32
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,964
Is he working or studying?

33
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:40,644
I want to meet him.

34
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:43,914
One day, you will definitely get to meet him

35
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:49,444
and I think he will want to know you as well.

36
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:04,534
(Attention, please.)

37
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:09,024
(All GEN6 students, please report to Home School's meeting room.)

38
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:14,644
(All GEN6 students, please report to Home School's meeting room.)

39
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:35,675
I know that you have been through hard times in the past few days...

40
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:39,821
adjusting to life at Home School.

41
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:42,754
Many of you are missing home.

42
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,344
Many of you are missing your family.

43
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:51,964
It makes me realize that I shouldn't make you miserable.

44
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:57,314
So I want to give you a special opportunity,

45
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:03,064
to go home this weekend.

46
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,664
Whoa.

47
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,304
- We're going home. - We can go home?

48
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:07,149
Yay!

49
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,687
We're going home.

50
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:11,964
But...

51
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:17,044
But only one of you will get that opportunity.

52
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:25,352
Who will be allowed to go home?

53
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,947
It depends on everyone's decision.

54
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:32,844
Your votes will determine the result.

55
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:40,016
The student who gets the most votes as deserving to go home...

56
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:45,914
will get to go home and relax this weekend.

57
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:57,914
All GEN6 students,

58
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:02,744
today Home School asks you to each write a letter home.

59
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:09,444
The school will deliver it to your family tomorrow.

60
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:15,044
But if any of you doesn't want to contact your family,

61
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:17,444
you're not required to write a letter.

62
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:19,343
Really, Master?

63
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:20,778
In this day and age,

64
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,363
why are you still making us write letters?

65
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:25,914
Why don't you use owls to deliver them?

66
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,319
Why don't we call, chat,

67
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:31,954
email, or send a direct message?

68
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,469
You were born in an era where communication is so easy,

69
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:38,764
that you sometimes may take it for granted.

70
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:43,144
Writing a letter will make you appreciate the characters,

71
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,659
and focus on communicating your feelings...

72
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,964
to the people you miss.

73
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,954
It will also help you realize...

74
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:56,644
the importance of waiting.

75
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:06,154
(Dear Mom,)

76
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:22,714
(I want to go home. This place is crazy. I want to go home.)

77
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:37,114
(Dear Pa,)

78
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:46,544
I earned money so you could go to school,

79
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,644
and this is how you repay me?

80
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:49,984
Huh?

81
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,189
I sent you to study, not fight with others.

82
00:07:53,214 --> 00:07:55,354
You've embarrassed me in the eyes of the teachers.

83
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:58,344
What do you care?

84
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,544
Have you even met them?

85
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,039
Don't talk back to me.

86
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,104
I'm just stating facts.

87
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:04,569
You're good at talking back.

88
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:06,534
Why don't you focus on your studies?

89
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:09,924
Try to behave like your little brother,

90
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:15,444
instead of spending your days causing me headaches and embarrassing me.

91
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,144
Having a daughter is like having a toilet in front of the house.

92
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:28,754
This is exactly why I didn't want to have one.

93
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:33,924
You blame women for everything.

94
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,344
Is being a woman so wrong?

95
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:37,714
How dare you talk to me like that?

96
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:39,979
Men like you should feel guilty...

97
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:43,954
for cheating, having countless mistresses,

98
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,529
and hurting Ma every day.

99
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:46,654
Stop!

100
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:06,354
(Dear Pa,)

101
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,360
Who wants to go home?

102
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,317
Since all of us want to go home,

103
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:23,277
how should we vote, Maki?

104
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:28,653
I suggest we vote for the one that has the best reason to go home first.

105
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,945
Those who don't get the opportunity this time...

106
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,417
can just wait for the next time.

107
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:39,244
I want to go home to see my dad.

108
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,982
He lives alone,

109
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:44,185
and I've never had to be away from him this long.

110
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:45,666
Please.

111
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,040
I can say that too.

112
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,047
My dad lives alone too.

113
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:58,749
I want to go home to see my mom.

114
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:02,218
I'm not very healthy.

115
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:03,963
You all see it.

116
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:09,923
If I get to see my mom, I think I'll get better.

117
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:14,701
Listen.

118
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:17,923
If we can't choose, we compete.

119
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,586
The weak ones lose.

120
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,124
That's it.

121
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,456
As simple as that.

122
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:26,579
I don't think that's fair.

123
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:27,985
How is it not fair?

124
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,455
It's the fairest way to go about it.

125
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:33,923
Men and women are not born equal.

126
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:36,647
No competition will be fair.

127
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,946
Everyone is good at different things.

128
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,345
You can't make small girls fight big boys,

129
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:45,923
or make people who suck at calculating compete with math geniuses.

130
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,963
It's not fair.

131
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,927
Hey, guys.

132
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:03,966
Listen.

133
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,884
Who will you guys vote for?

134
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,847
I will never vote for you, Mek.

135
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,105
Me neither.

136
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:13,924
I won't vote for you.

137
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,409
You idiots.

138
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:19,963
I won't vote for you two either.

139
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,744
Pennhung.

140
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,491
Would you vote for me?

141
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:35,483
You're quite heartless.

142
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,545
Hey, Jean.

143
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:39,433
How about you?

144
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,044
Who will you vote for?

145
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,158
Listen.

146
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,960
If anyone votes for me,

147
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,194
I will give them one million baht each.

148
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:03,437
That's cheating.

149
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,548
How the hell is it cheating?

150
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:13,352
It's called mutual benefit.

151
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,327
I get the votes.

152
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:16,751
They get money.

153
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,751
It's a win-win.

154
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,352
It's not cheating.

155
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,923
But if it was an election,

156
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,355
that would be considered vote buying, Jean.

157
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:30,552
There'd be legal punishment.

158
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,351
Pennhung,

159
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,601
this is not an election,

160
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,247
so I'm not doing anything wrong.

161
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:43,923
Fine.

162
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:47,926
Cheat shamelessly if you want.

163
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,274
But tell me.

164
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:53,964
What can you even do with one million at Home School?

165
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:56,949
You have to wait three years before you can use that money.

166
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,744
Your offer is so damn worthless.

167
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,598
Grow up.

168
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:19,114
The first time we ran, I almost died.

169
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,552
Same.

170
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,837
I almost died at the first point.

171
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:24,946
Hey, girls.

172
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,712
Are you tired?

173
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:27,923
Drink some water.

174
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:33,924
Pass it over.

175
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:39,348
Come on. Pass it over.

176
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:45,449
Do you want some more, Biw?

177
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:46,683
Hey.

178
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,963
What are you doing, Mek?

179
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:49,923
What do you want?

180
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:51,446
Nothing.

181
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:56,952
I saw that you girls were tired, so I wanted to bring you cool water.

182
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:01,444
Drinking clean water is good for your body, you know?

183
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:05,923
You brought us water because you want something.

184
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,921
I'll get to the point then.

185
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,656
I have an offer for you girls.

186
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,924
If you vote for me to go home,

187
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,252
I will be your slave for one semester.

188
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,791
Sounds good?

189
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:27,152
I will bring you water after your workout every day.

190
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,548
How's that?

191
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,055
I can get my own drink.

192
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:36,849
Mek, you're such a loser.

193
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:39,252
You don't have one million to give like Jean,

194
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,781
so you're offering to be their slave?

195
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:43,357
How embarrassing.

196
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,213
You shouldn't have been born as my twin.

197
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,986
Wow, Mork.

198
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:54,311
Have you ever thought to ask if I want to be your twin?

199
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,351
Hey. Enough.

200
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:57,941
Stop fighting like children.

201
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,145
Look at him. He started it.

202
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,989
Oh, you're complaining to a girl?

203
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:03,341
What a loser.

204
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,625
Jerk, have you ever been knocked out?

205
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,747
Stop. Both of you.

206
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:08,913
You're being noisy.

207
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:13,515
Hey.

208
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:17,924
What do you mean by Jean giving one million?

209
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:22,795
Jean is offering anyone who votes for him...

210
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,988
one million.

211
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,850
That's not right.

212
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:32,446
We should vote for the one who really deserves to go home.

213
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:36,455
Who is that?

214
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:39,963
I want to vote for Pennhung.

215
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:41,923
I feel sorry for him.

216
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:45,924
He's been through a lot of bad things.

217
00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:51,152
I carried the water here.

218
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:53,229
I can't believe you have the audacity to drink it...

219
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,801
when you just insulted me.

220
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:55,785
There are many bottles.

221
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:56,764
You can share them with me.

222
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,307
Why do you have to argue?

223
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,839
Yeah, why?

224
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,006
White.

225
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:10,250
Can we talk?

226
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:13,766
I have an offer for you.

227
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,155
If you're going to offer money in exchange for my vote,

228
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,964
I'm not interested.

229
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:21,926
Why not?

230
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,967
Is one million not enough?

231
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,450
Look.

232
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:29,924
I don't know how you grew up,

233
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,923
but not everything can be bought with money.

234
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:37,519
Have some shame.

235
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,449
Don't be like despicable adults.

236
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:40,474
Hey.

237
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Why?

238
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:43,296
Did I hit the spot?

239
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:44,363
Shut up.

240
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:45,567
You're the one who should shut up.

241
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:49,581
Mind your own business.

242
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,083
What the hell is wrong with you?

243
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:54,551
Get lost.

244
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,053
I said, get lost.

245
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:19,452
People like him are the reason our society is sick.

246
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,776
They're so desperate.

247
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,481
They think they can throw money at everything.

248
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:25,924
So stupid.

249
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:55,921
I feel sorry for him.

250
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:59,923
He's been through a lot of bad things.

251
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,449
Pheng, are you alright?

252
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:15,286
I'm fine.

253
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,964
Just a little headache.

254
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:21,242
If you're sick, you should go to the infirmary.

255
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,855
Master Praepon will give you medicine.

256
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,598
Don't push yourself if you're not feeling okay.

257
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,419
Why don't you sit down and get some rest?

258
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,047
Let me put this away for you.

259
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:36,568
Come on. Walk slowly.

260
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:38,461
Sit down here.

261
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:40,352
Okay.

262
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,923
This pile, too.

263
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:57,555
Guys, I'm sorry for not being able to help,

264
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:00,957
and for being a burden.

265
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,250
Don't worry about it, Pheng.

266
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,250
You're not a burden.

267
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:12,126
Because I've been unhealthy and weak since I was a child,

268
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,982
others have to worry and take care of me all the time.

269
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:28,655
But while I'm here, I'm determined to get stronger

270
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,552
so I don't have to bother everyone.

271
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,963
I want my parents to know that I can take care of myself now.

272
00:19:57,924 --> 00:19:59,466
Pheng!

273
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:00,658
Hey!

274
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:01,538
Pheng!

275
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:02,586
Are you okay?

276
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:04,016
The infirmary.

277
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,822
Let's go to the infirmary.

278
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:08,852
Pheng.

279
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:15,964
Mom, I want to go home.

280
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,751
I can't do this anymore.

281
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:25,249
I think I want to vote for Pheng to go home.

282
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:27,546
She looks really bad.

283
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:30,652
A trip home to relax should help her get better.

284
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,649
Let's go so she can rest.

285
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:36,649
Yeah.

286
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:38,649
We haven't finished cleaning.

287
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,450
The Masters could punish us.

288
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:44,792
The doctor told Pennhung that sick people should get a lot of rest,

289
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,573
so they can recover quickly.

290
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,963
Get well soon, Pheng.

291
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:49,022
(Dear Mom, I want to go home. This place is crazy. I want to go home.)

292
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:50,451
(This place doesn't teach anything. They only punish me. There's no class.)

293
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,799
(They make us run every morning for God knows what.)

294
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:54,594
(I can't stay any longer. I will die if I have to.)

295
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:57,751
Mom, I won the competition today.

296
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:00,551
What did our partner say?

297
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,425
No, we can't.

298
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,238
If we postpone it, everything will be ruined.

299
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,789
Mom, I won first place today.

300
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:08,900
I won the award you wanted me to win.

301
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,650
Excuse me for a moment.

302
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:13,961
Pheng, how many times have I told you already?

303
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:16,549
Don't disturb me while I'm on a work call.

304
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:18,864
Continue.

305
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,944
There will be no postponement.

306
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,377
Everything stays the same.

307
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,552
If we postpone it, we'll suffer damage.

308
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,923
Why can't you do something as easy as this?

309
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:29,409
Huh?

310
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,432
You made a commitment. You must follow through.

311
00:22:38,812 --> 00:22:39,966
Mom!

312
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:41,735
Pheng!

313
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:44,640
Does it hurt a lot?

314
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:46,191
It does.

315
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,946
Let me dress your wound.

316
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:27,087
- Pennhung. - Yes?

317
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:29,177
Do you think three eggs will be enough?

318
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:32,336
We can add one more.

319
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:40,306
Tibet, Pennhung,

320
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:44,452
I have a favor to ask.

321
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,452
What is it?

322
00:23:48,486 --> 00:23:52,348
I'm not feeling well today.

323
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:54,828
I can barely swallow.

324
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:59,659
Can you guys make me something light?

325
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:01,963
Sure.

326
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,375
Feel free to take a seat while waiting.

327
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,821
We'll let you know when it's ready.

328
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:06,723
Tibet.

329
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:07,891
- Do I crack the egg now? - Yes.

330
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,077
Okay.

331
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,963
Can I help?

332
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,080
No, it's alright.

333
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,211
We got this.

334
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:22,757
I feel bad.

335
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:25,964
You may cut the vegetables.

336
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:29,213
Tibet, can you get the rice?

337
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:30,238
Okay.

338
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:33,495
A little more.

339
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:36,450
You eat a lot, Pennhung.

340
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:38,501
Here.

341
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:40,234
Thank you.

342
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,403
Do you want omelet soup?

343
00:24:42,428 --> 00:24:43,591
Omelet soup?

344
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:45,472
I made it before.

345
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,597
Ouch!

346
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,121
What the hell?

347
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:08,561
Find a cloth.

348
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,250
Press it to stop the blood.

349
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,806
I got distracted.

350
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,252
I wasn't careful.

351
00:25:19,515 --> 00:25:21,960
I'm so useless.

352
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:24,649
I can't do anything.

353
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,355
Just rest.

354
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:30,160
I'll cook you something delicious.

355
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:41,345
Are you crying because your wound hurts?

356
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,920
No.

357
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,926
I'm crying because of what Tibet said.

358
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:51,061
It reminds me of my mom.

359
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,068
My mom always tells me to sit down and rest,

360
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:59,200
and that she will cook me something delicious.

361
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:01,407
I miss my mom.

362
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,458
I want to eat her congee again.

363
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:12,478
Pennhung and I will do our best.

364
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:13,503
Yes.

365
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:19,449
Pennhung.

366
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:27,551
How about we put the fried rice we made into the water to make boiled rice?

367
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:29,924
We can do that.

368
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:40,948
I think you should stop, Pheng.

369
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,050
I saw your bullshit.

370
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,850
What are you talking about, Fuji?

371
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:50,850
Do I have to spell it out?

372
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:53,075
You pretend to be weak,

373
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,680
and pitiful,

374
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,749
so our friends will vote for you to go home.

375
00:26:57,422 --> 00:26:59,053
What do you mean?

376
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:01,452
I'm not doing anything like that.

377
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:03,548
Oh, really?

378
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,921
But I saw what you did earlier.

379
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:09,924
Did you want our friends' sympathy so much that you had to hurt yourself?

380
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:11,963
Let me see your wound.

381
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,961
Let go of me, Fuji.

382
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:14,181
- You're hurting me.
- Stay still.

383
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,236
Let go of me, Fuji.

384
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:16,483
If it hurts, why did you do it?

385
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:18,182
You're hurting me.

386
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:20,632
- Fuji! - Stay still!

387
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:21,945
Fuji, what are you doing?

388
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:23,308
Stop!

389
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,449
Are you alright, Pheng?

390
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:27,966
Why did you do that?

391
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,771
Pheng is not feeling well.

392
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:30,999
Not feeling well?

393
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:33,921
More like she's suffering from a lying disease.

394
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:37,923
Biw, can't you tell she's fake?

395
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,952
What are you mad at me about?

396
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,323
What did I ever do to you?

397
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:44,948
You still won't stop pretending, huh?

398
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,195
Let's go, Pheng.

399
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,014
Ignore Fuji.

400
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:52,354
Don't think you can keep bullshitting forever, Pheng.

401
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:55,963
One day, people will see your true colors.

402
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,689
The answer to that question is D.

403
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:08,355
Cell wall and chloroplast.

404
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,478
Yes, because the question is only asking about the plant cell.

405
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:15,053
You got Question 4 wrong too.

406
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:16,764
How?

407
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:17,997
I thought I got it right.

408
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,646
If you don't believe me, ask Pennhung.

409
00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:23,471
- Pennhung. - Yes?

410
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:24,991
Did I get it wrong?

411
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:28,932
B is osmosis, the diffusion of water through a cell membrane.

412
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,160
C is facilitated diffusion,

413
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:35,988
the movement of substances through proteins across membranes.

414
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:39,966
Your answer D is irrelevant.

415
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,969
The correct answer is A.

416
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:44,478
Simple diffusion.

417
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,243
My bad.

418
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:49,621
Science is really not my cup of tea.

419
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,508
I'm scared just thinking about the exam.

420
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,634
This is so damn difficult.

421
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,166
Science is very fun, White.

422
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,120
No.

423
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,053
How can you say it's fun?

424
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:57,252
No.

425
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,961
Guys, has anyone seen Pheng?

426
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,951
I think I saw her walk that way earlier.

427
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:06,613
Why?

428
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:09,149
Pheng had a fight with Fuji.

429
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,764
She looked sad.

430
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:11,985
I'm worried about her.

431
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,462
I think she should still be around.

432
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,840
Go check.

433
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:17,946
Thanks.

434
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,862
Let's finish our revision.

435
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:28,034
Pheng!

436
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:30,360
Everyone, help!

437
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:31,385
Pheng!

438
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:36,850
Everyone, help!

439
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,007
Pheng!

440
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:45,644
I think she just hit her head.

441
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:47,272
Let's take her to the infirmary.

442
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:06,542
You're awake.

443
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,649
Do you have a headache?

444
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,452
Not so much anymore, Master.

445
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,252
Try to protect your wound from water.

446
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,149
Thank you.

447
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:31,978
Where are my friends?

448
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:33,988
They all went to bed.

449
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,924
I see.

450
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:39,924
I'll go back to the bedroom then.

451
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:44,148
Pheng, dear.

452
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:51,164
If you have something on your mind,

453
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:54,348
you know you can always tell any of the Masters, right?

454
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:00,946
About what?

455
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:03,452
About anything.

456
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,345
Anything you want to get off your chest.

457
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:27,921
I hate myself for being weak.

458
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:35,453
I hate that everything happens to me.

459
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:41,452
I can't stay here any longer.

460
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,746
If I do, I will surely die.

461
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:49,921
I want to go home, Master.

462
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,625
I want to go home to my mom.

463
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,252
I miss my mom.

464
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:57,352
I really can't stay here.

465
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,444
But your mom wants you to stay here, Pheng.

466
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:07,964
What do you mean?

467
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:18,952
Sometimes, accepting the truth and learning to live with it...

468
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:23,450
might help you get better, Pheng.

469
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:52,752
The person who received the most votes from their friends is...

470
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:04,487
Pheng.

471
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,449
You received six votes.

472
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:10,957
You can go home this weekend.

473
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:17,527
Congratulations, Pheng.

474
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,471
You're going home to see your mom.

475
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:23,964
Thank you all for voting for me.

476
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:31,963
I object.

477
00:33:32,152 --> 00:33:33,923
Pheng doesn't deserve to go home.

478
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:36,452
Fuji, what's wrong with you?

479
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,123
Everyone voted.

480
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:39,963
You must accept the majority decision.

481
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:43,278
How can I accept it when Pheng cheated?

482
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,923
What do you mean, Fuji?

483
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,228
How did she cheat?

484
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:49,893
Fuji, don't be a sore loser.

485
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:51,847
You guys know nothing.

486
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,267
Pheng is bullshitting.

487
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,682
She faked being sick and weak...

488
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:57,098
to get everyone's attention...

489
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:58,682
and make you vote for her.

490
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,149
Fuji, I did no such thing.

491
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,271
Why would I hurt myself?

492
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:06,835
I'm not crazy.

493
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,272
You can't slander me like that.

494
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:11,418
Look at her.

495
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,418
She still won't stop lying.

496
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:17,920
Headmaster, I think you must void the vote.

497
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,398
Hey.

498
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:24,951
How do I know you're telling the truth?

499
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:27,450
You might be slandering her.

500
00:34:27,643 --> 00:34:29,155
Hugo is right.

501
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,282
You need proof to accuse someone,

502
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:34,626
because anyone can just make it up.

503
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:39,382
Besides, Pheng didn't force or bribe anyone to vote for her.

504
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:43,655
Fuji, you're jealous...

505
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,555
and it shows.

506
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:50,629
You guys are so stupid.

507
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:53,459
All of you got fooled by her and instead of doubting her,

508
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,066
you're doubting me when I'm telling the truth.

509
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,006
Hey, why are you insulting us?

510
00:34:57,006 --> 00:34:58,613
What's wrong with you, Fuji?

511
00:34:58,613 --> 00:34:59,677
You want a fight?

512
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:01,921
Hey. Don't fight.

513
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:07,218
Fuji, I think what you're doing is not fair to Pheng.

514
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:09,924
Maki, I'm telling the truth.

515
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:12,066
No matter how much I want to go home,

516
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:14,272
I would never lie to my friends.

517
00:35:14,637 --> 00:35:15,961
Hey, Fuji.

518
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:18,227
Who would be so crazy to hurt themselves?

519
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:20,979
Pheng is not that kind of person.

520
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:22,979
Biw, you're the stupid of all.

521
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,793
You're a damn fool and you don't know it.

522
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:25,818
Fuji!

523
00:35:25,843 --> 00:35:27,250
Alright, everyone.

524
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,551
Stop fighting.

525
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:42,243
Fuji, you said Pheng lied.

526
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:45,152
Do you still stand by your words?

527
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:47,961
Yes, I'm telling the truth.

528
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:51,963
What about you, Pheng?

529
00:35:53,656 --> 00:35:57,444
Do you still insist that you didn't lie?

530
00:35:58,132 --> 00:35:59,966
I do, Master Amin.

531
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:01,566
See?

532
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:04,444
I told you Pheng is a lying witch.

533
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:19,253
You're lying, Masters.

534
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:20,916
I didn't do anything like that.

535
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:23,357
Why are you doing this to me?

536
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:27,899
Your parents informed Home School of your problem,

537
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:29,964
when they came to take the exam.

538
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:33,253
All Masters know what your problem is.

539
00:37:33,495 --> 00:37:39,058
You must accept the truth that you're not sick.

540
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,146
That's not true.

541
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,850
I'm really sick.

542
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:44,499
Why do you believe my mom?

543
00:37:44,524 --> 00:37:45,440
She lied.

544
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:46,883
I'm really sick.

545
00:37:48,545 --> 00:37:50,410
Biw, you believe me, right?

546
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,662
I swear I didn't lie.

547
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,432
Why would I lie to you?

548
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:54,915
Stop it, Pheng.

549
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,921
We're best friends.

550
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,355
Believe me. I didn't lie.

551
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,548
Pheng, this is not what you call being friends.

552
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,001
Stop it already.

553
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:05,924
Why would I lie to you?

554
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:08,446
Due to what happened,

555
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,569
today's voting is void.

556
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:15,563
No one is going home.

557
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:21,450
None of you are ready to see your parents again.

558
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:23,293
Master Amin,

559
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,229
this is not fair to the others.

560
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,080
You shouldn't disqualify everyone else.

561
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:30,951
I understand you don't agree with this, Nai,

562
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:35,919
and I'm willing to own up to this mistake.

563
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:43,549
That's it?

564
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:46,952
So we can't go home now.

565
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:50,252
This is all your fault, Pheng.

566
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:53,167
I can't believe that behind your innocent look,

567
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:54,977
you're even more fake than me.

568
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:57,310
I didn't do anything, Jingjai.

569
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,963
Why don't you believe me? I didn't do anything.

570
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,080
I wanted to go home, but I didn't do it.

571
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:05,105
I really didn't lie to you guys.

572
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:09,246
Biw, you believe me, right?

573
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:11,409
Why would I lie to you?

574
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:14,321
No matter how much I wanted to go home, I wouldn't lie to you.

575
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:15,948
Stop it already!

576
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,246
I really didn't lie.

577
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:22,114
I didn't do such a thing!

578
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,500
Stop being crazy already!

579
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:24,377
You're bullshitting!

580
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,966
Stop, Fuji!

581
00:39:26,421 --> 00:39:29,713
Even though Pheng is in the wrong, you have no right to hurt her.

582
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:35,926
I really didn't lie, White.

583
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:37,951
I'm telling the truth.

584
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:41,475
Biw!

585
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:44,764
White!

586
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:47,001
I really didn't lie to you guys.

587
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:49,026
Why won't anyone believe me?

588
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:53,964
Maki, you believe me, right?

589
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:57,964
Nai, I didn't lie.

590
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,572
Maki.

591
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:03,469
Believe me, Tibet.

592
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:05,961
I really didn't do it.

593
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:09,535
Tibet.

594
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:12,649
I really didn't lie.

595
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:18,942
Pennhung.

596
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:21,452
You believe me, right?

597
00:40:23,545 --> 00:40:25,797
I didn't lie!

598
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:28,861
Why won't anyone believe me?

599
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:11,923
Biw, can I explain?

600
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,465
Why am I the only one being hated?

601
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:33,963
Jingjai lied to everyone too, didn't she?

602
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:36,370
Why doesn't she get the same treatment?

603
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:39,923
Why do you act like I killed someone?

604
00:41:41,341 --> 00:41:43,053
Do you still not understand...

605
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,351
why everyone hates you?

606
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:49,604
It's because you refuse to accept the truth.

607
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:53,155
Get lost.

608
00:41:53,372 --> 00:41:55,924
This world has no place for a lying witch like you.

609
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:05,049
Pheng.

610
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:06,877
Pheng, wait. Pheng.

611
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:08,466
Why did you call her?

612
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:09,569
Let her go.

613
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:11,827
She's just an attention seeker.

614
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:13,158
Ignore her.

615
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,927
I know everyone's angry at Pheng,

616
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,387
and it's true that what she did was wrong,

617
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:23,152
but we shouldn't talk to her like that.

618
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:26,559
How do you want us to talk to her then?

619
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:29,964
Being direct couldn't even make her feel guilty.

620
00:42:30,283 --> 00:42:31,926
She didn't even apologize once.

621
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:35,924
Did you guys even give her a chance to apologize?

622
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:37,477
All you did was scold her.

623
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,452
We're all we have.

624
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,456
If we all hate her, how is she going to live?

625
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,452
Pheng.

626
00:42:56,718 --> 00:42:57,422
White.

627
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:58,532
Maki.

628
00:42:58,557 --> 00:42:59,709
What's going on?

629
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:01,373
Have you guys seen Pheng?

630
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:02,835
No.

631
00:43:03,324 --> 00:43:04,187
Is something wrong?

632
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:05,921
Pheng and Fuji had a fight.

633
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:07,666
We don't know where Pheng ran off to.

634
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:10,404
We've been looking for some time, but no luck.

635
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:12,951
I'm worried that something bad might happen to her.

636
00:43:13,198 --> 00:43:14,951
She didn't seem okay.

637
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:18,858
Let Pennhung help find her.

638
00:43:19,878 --> 00:43:21,963
Let's split up to search faster.

639
00:43:28,844 --> 00:43:30,244
Pheng.

640
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:33,963
Pheng.

641
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:36,121
Pheng.

642
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:38,453
Pheng.

643
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,246
Shall we look outside?

644
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:43,366
Okay.

645
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:47,963
Pheng!

646
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:52,145
Pheng!

647
00:43:52,915 --> 00:43:54,055
Pheng!

648
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:56,464
Pheng, where are you?

649
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:57,489
Pheng!

650
00:43:57,776 --> 00:43:58,776
Pheng!

651
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:01,705
Where is she?

652
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,271
We've looked everywhere.

653
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:04,938
White,

654
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,148
let's tell the Masters.

655
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:13,075
Maki!

656
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:14,686
Pheng!

657
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:16,927
Pheng!

658
00:44:20,046 --> 00:44:21,058
Pheng!

659
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:23,351
Pheng, calm down!

660
00:44:34,944 --> 00:44:40,394
(DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO)

661
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:42,329
This GEN is not like any other GEN.

662
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:44,909
We can't use the old ways with them anymore.

663
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:47,458
There will be an exam tomorrow.

664
00:44:47,483 --> 00:44:48,976
What freaking exam is it now?

665
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:52,907
You can choose to take the exam for the subject you're good at.

666
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:57,062
You can do it in any way.

667
00:44:57,453 --> 00:44:58,949
You may begin the exam.

668
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:02,829
Master!
