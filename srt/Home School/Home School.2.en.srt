1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,670
You're at Home School.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,290
This is your home.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,180
Who does that old bastard think he is?

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,360
Are you sure this is the right direction?

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,800
This forest is like a maze.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,970
We've been walking and getting lost in here for many hours.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,090
You planned the whole thing that happened today, didn't you?

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,420
What for?

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,710
To make all of you here remember that

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,970
from now, you're home for each other.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,180
Good morning, all GEN6 students.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,180
I'm Master Champ.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,810
I will be responsible for your morning workouts.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,570
Every Monday to Friday,

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,730
you all will meet here at this time

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,380
to work out with me.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,710
Since today is the first day of the semester,

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,380
I will let you start with something easy.

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,380
Running for points.

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,600
There will be 10 points to collect and 10 rounds to complete.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,730
What?

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,650
10 rounds?

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,370
Isn't that too much, Master?

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm ordering you to do the easiest thing.

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,250
Execute.

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,400
Go!

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Run!

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Run!

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Go!

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,340
Hurry!

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Hurry!

32
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,240
Why are you looking back?

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,420
Go!

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Faster!

35
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,420
Okay!

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,420
Faster!

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,530
Run!

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,590
Don't walk!

39
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,680
Hurry!

40
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,180
Faster!

41
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,300
Even faster!

42
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,780
Don't be a baby!

43
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,610
Pheng.

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,300
Are you okay?

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,620
I can't go on.

46
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,070
Get up.

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,250
Get up!

48
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,210
You can't stop unless I order you to.

49
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,610
If anyone stops, I will make you all run 5 more rounds each.

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,250
Go.

51
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,610
Come on.

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,650
Hurry!

53
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,400
Please enjoy your most delicious meal.

54
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,530
How delicious can it be?

55
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm telling you, my tastebuds are special.

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
Damn.

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,800
It's really good.

58
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,600
Really?

59
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,490
Master Phoban,

60
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,410
can I get one more?

61
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,410
Me too, please.

62
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,400
No one will get to eat more or less than each other.

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,460
Everyone will get the same amount of food.

64
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,540
Welcome all of you GEN6 students.

65
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,130
Today is the first day of the first semester

66
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,540
of your first academic year.

67
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,890
I would like to introduce Home School Masters

68
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,900
who will teach and discipline you all

69
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,890
to be the perfect Home School students.

70
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,370
First, Master Yani,

71
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,800
Headmaster of Home School.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,220
She teaches foreign languages.

73
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,290
Next, Master Praeporn.

74
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,550
Besides looking after the infirmary,

75
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,200
she teaches psychology,

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,210
nursing, and natural healing.

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
That's Master Prasath.

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,140
He teaches social science and history.

79
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,340
Master Dilak teaches mathematics

80
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,850
and science.

81
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,820
Master Champ teaches physical education,

82
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,450
sports, and physiology.

83
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,450
The last one is Master Phoban

84
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,920
who makes sure everything at Home School is in order.

85
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,370
Master Phoban will take care of all your essential needs.

86
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,700
These are the Masters who will take care of GEN6

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,380
throughout the three years from this moment onward.

88
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,000
For a week from now, there will be no classes,

89
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,930
but I will ask you all to take care of one thing.

90
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,380
Each of you must take care of one duckling well.

91
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,220
If anyone fails to do so and their duckling becomes sick,

92
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,650
hurt, or dead,

93
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,690
that person will be punished.

94
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,330
Why do I have to take care of these ducks?

95
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,550
Why?

96
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,020
If the ducks die under our care, we'll be punished.

97
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,300
Who even knows how to take care of ducks?

98
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,890
Does anyone here know?

99
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,330
First, I think we should brainstorm

100
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,050
what to do with these ducks..

101
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,610
Pennhung thinks we should start by finding them food

102
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,420
and a new home.

103
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,930
Food and home?

104
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,810
Let's divide into groups.

105
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,250
One group looks for food.

106
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,260
The other group looks for a home.

107
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Pennhung and I will look for food.

108
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,450
Who will take care of the home?

109
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,090
Any volunteers?

110
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,650
I'll do it	 with Nai.

111
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Really?

112
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,090
Since when did I agree?

113
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,890
Okay, I'll go with Maki.

114
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,660
Biw and I too.

115
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,770
Let's go, Pennhung.

116
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,010
Let's find food for our ducks.

117
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,460
Nai, let's go find some wood to build a duck coop.

118
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,100
I'm wondering

119
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,390
if I will be able to take care of these ducks.

120
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,450
I couldn't even keep my goldfish alive.

121
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,330
I think you can do it.

122
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,300
Really?

123
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,260
You think I can really take care of ducks?

124
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,970
At least, you will not kill them.

125
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,450
Are you coming or not?

126
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,870
Alright.

127
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,500
I'll help.

128
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,860
Let's go help them.

129
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,350
Bring the ducks, too.

130
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,740
Oh.

131
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,870
Are they heavy?

132
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,790
Oh, they're quite heavy.

133
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,160
Uh.

134
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
This is total nonsense.

135
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,360
The first subject is taking care of ducks?

136
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,450
Right?

137
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,850
We paid millions in tuition fee

138
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,440
and they're making us take care of ducks.

139
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,590
Come on.

140
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,250
Fine.

141
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,330
Does anyone know what ducklings can eat?

142
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,250
Pennhung read that ducklings should eat duck food pellets.

143
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,250
Is there anything else they can eat?

144
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,060
Ducklings should eat food that is easy to digest.

145
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,050
They can eat cooked rice mixed with minced vegetables.

146
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,250
We can mix them together,

147
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,610
adding more vegetables than rice.

148
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,610
Whoa, you're smart.

149
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,930
Nice, Pennhung.

150
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,400
Okay.

151
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,500
Let's follow his idea

152
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,500
and make food for our ducklings.

153
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,970
Come on, White.

154
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,370
Help me with rice.

155
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,230
Pennhung.

156
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,860
Yes?

157
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,370
Will this cucumber do?

158
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Yes.

159
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,640
So we have no choice but to fix this, right?

160
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,450
Why did you ask when you already knew the answer?

161
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,180
We have no choice but to fix it.

162
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,500
Will you die if you stop getting on my nerves for an hour?

163
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm not getting on your nerves.

164
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,700
I'm just telling you that it's no use complaining.

165
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm not complaining to your dad.

166
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,520
And I'm not cursing your mom.

167
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,460
Your mom is my mom.

168
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,910
Can you two stop playing around?

169
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,120
We're not playing around.

170
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,810
- We're scolding each other.
- Whatever.

171
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,340
Put the ducks down there.

172
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Over there.

173
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,620
Hey, guys.

174
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,200
Let's find wood to build a house for these ducks.

175
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,330
You're not helping me at all.

176
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,160
I am.

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,860
You can see that I am.

178
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,500
I'm helping.

179
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,660
Can you lift the other side?

180
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,770
Can you lift it alone?

181
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,050
Why don't the three of you get up and help me?

182
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,180
Help me choose the wood.

183
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,050
I came here to study,

184
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,650
not take care of ducks.

185
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,650
That's not an excuse to take advantage of others.

186
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,200
We're busy saving our energy.

187
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,070
My legs hurt.

188
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,300
I can't stand up.

189
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,220
My boots are pinching my feet.

190
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,170
There's the Headmaster.

191
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,730
If you're not happy about this, tell her.

192
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,730
Okay.

193
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,650
Headmaster.

194
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,680
Hugo's group is not helping us.

195
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,060
They're just sitting there taking advantage of us.

196
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,490
Why are you telling me this?

197
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,850
We will not punish anyone this week

198
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,570
unless someone's duck gets hurt,

199
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,810
sick, or die.

200
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,300
So from your friends not helping you,

201
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,770
you can learn about your duty and conscience.

202
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,780
You're quite skilled at this.

203
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,770
If Master Phoban's room had more paint colors,

204
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,770
I could make it even more beautiful.

205
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,400
White, are these aligned?

206
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,600
Can you help me check?

207
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,480
They are.

208
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Good job.

209
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,170
Be careful of the wood here.

210
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,680
It's broken.

211
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,090
I guess the last GEN broke it.

212
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,970
Pennhung, is this where we put the ducks?

213
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,970
No, no.

214
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,970
This is for food.

215
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,970
Pennhung read that we should add clean water here too.

216
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,470
Ducklings must drink clean water.

217
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,620
What happens if it's not clean?

218
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,080
Ducklings can get sick.

219
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,370
Oh, and there shouldn't be soil in the food.

220
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,370
Look at Pennhung.

221
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,370
He's so annoying.

222
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,380
Greet him.

223
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,560
The last GEN?

224
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,530
Yes, they broke it.

225
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,600
Ouch!

226
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,260
Sorry, Pennhung.

227
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,730
That was an accident.

228
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,050
Hey, did you bully him?

229
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,370
No.

230
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,930
He said it was an accident.

231
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,930
Let's help him.

232
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,610
Let me help.

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,870
Eat it.

234
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,720
Eat it!

235
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,900
Eat it, Pennhung!

236
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,060
I said, eat it!

237
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,310
No!

238
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,050
What an idiot.

239
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,970
He bullied him but ended up getting hurt.

240
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,430
Serves you right.

241
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,660
You deserve to eat duck food for taking advantage of us.

242
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,880
How dare you push me, weirdo?

243
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,470
- Pennhung apologizes!
- How dare you?

244
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:43,930
Don't hurt Pennhung!

245
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,500
Hey, stop!
Don't hurt Pennhung!

246
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,690
Pennhung apologizes!
Hey, stop!

247
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,950
Pennhung apologizes!

248
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,270
Pennhung apologizes! Don't hurt Pennhung!

249
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,330
Pennhung apologizes!

250
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,280
Don't lock Pennhung up!

251
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,880
Pennhung apologizes!

252
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,780
Don't hurt Pennhung!

253
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,740
Pennhung apologizes!

254
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,490
Don't lock Pennhung up!

255
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,470
Pennhung apologizes!

256
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,410
Don't lock Pennhung up!

257
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,370
Pennhung apologizes!

258
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,060
Don't lock Pennhung up! Pennhung apologizes!

259
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,720
Pennhung apologizes!

260
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,510
Don't lock Pennhung up!

261
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,740
Pennhung apologizes!

262
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,560
Don't lock Pennhung up!

263
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,270
Pennhung apologizes!

264
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,560
Pennhung doesn't want trouble!

265
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,460
Pennhung apologizes!

266
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,530
Don't lock Pennhung up!

267
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,540
Pennhung apologizes!

268
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,700
Don't lock Pennhung up!

269
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,620
Pennhung is such an attention seeker.

270
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
Why did you slap me?

271
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,070
Stay away from Pennhung.

272
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,210
Do you understand me?

273
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,450
You think I'm scared of you, White?

274
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,640
If you're looking for a fight, fight with someone with the same level of energy.

275
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,300
Are you insulting me?

276
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,800
Your whole family is foul-mouthed.

277
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,420
You want a piece of me?

278
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,220
Bring it on.

279
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,690
Hey. Don't fight.

280
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,340
You'll get punished by the Masters.

281
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,400
Can you stop acting like you're our leader?

282
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,110
Get lost.

283
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,900
This is none of your business.

284
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,460
It's time for lunch.

285
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,540
Please go to the dining room to eat together.

286
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,210
Assholes.

287
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
Are you hurt?

288
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,250
Please enjoy your meal.

289
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,700
Uh, why is this so salty?

290
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,790
This bread is so hard.

291
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,310
I can hit people's heads with it.

292
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,100
This tastes nothing like breakfast.

293
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,500
It's not okay.

294
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,090
Our parents didn't pay an expensive tuition fee for us to eat this.

295
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,090
You're clearly cheating us.

296
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,690
Who's responsible for this?

297
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,130
Can that person cook us new ones?

298
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,680
No one will get new food.

299
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,650
If you don't eat, you'll have to put up with your hunger until the next meal.

300
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,650
Will dinner be like this?

301
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,740
Food is all the same.

302
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,450
How can you guys eat it?

303
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,490
Like Master Phoban said,

304
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,610
if we don't eat, we'll have to put up with our hunger until the evening.

305
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,660
Look.

306
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,010
I can almost make a carving out of it.

307
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,900
Let me help, Tibet.

308
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,700
Can you hold it, White?

309
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,890
I'll get the food.

310
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,010
Ducklings are like humans.

311
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,600
They need to drink clean water.

312
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,620
Drink a lot so you can grow up quickly

313
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,810
and become strong.

314
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,220
You too, Baby Duck.

315
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,620
Hey, Pennhung.

316
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,220
Did you name your duckling?

317
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,420
Yes.

318
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,010
Pennhung named it.

319
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,660
Pennhung's duckling is called Baby Duck.

320
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,450
You all should name your duckling as well.

321
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,910
Why?

322
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,450
Everyone should have a name.

323
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,880
So should pets.

324
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,010
That's a good idea.

325
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,410
It's cute.

326
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,130
I'm going to name my duckling Cutie.

327
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,210
I'm going to name my duckling...

328
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,620
'Pierre'

329
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,010
It sounds handsome.

330
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,500
Come on, Pierre.

331
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,240
Eat.

332
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,200
I can't think of a name.

333
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,420
Is it necessary?

334
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,490
Tibet.

335
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,540
Hmm?

336
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,500
What's the name of your duck?

337
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,090
Let's call it Bo.

338
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,190
What?

339
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,350
Bo?

340
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,090
Yeah.

341
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,220
Why Bo?

342
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,510
I don't know.

343
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,780
My mom calls every animal Bo.

344
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,410
Can I call my duck Bo, too?

345
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,170
Sure.

346
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,660
My mom also distinguishes them.

347
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,170
Bo 1 and Bo 2.

348
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,970
My duckling will be called Bo 2 then.

349
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,630
Is that okay?

350
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,780
Yeah.

351
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,550
I think Bo 2 needs a shower.

352
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,930
It looks dirty.

353
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,930
What?

354
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,180
I'm coming for you, Bo 1.

355
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,820
Are you insulting my duck?

356
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,250
Hey.

357
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,170
Can you guys feed our ducks?

358
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,410
Sure.

359
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,690
Eat a lot of vegetables to get clever.

360
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,590
Your owner is stupid.

361
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,590
Don't be like him.

362
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,820
Eat up, Jingjai.

363
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,930
Boost your brain.

364
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,600
Hugo, too. So you can get tall.

365
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,890
You've been assigned to take care of the ducks for several days.

366
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,300
What have you learned from them?

367
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,690
Silence?

368
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,700
No one has learned anything from them.

369
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,700
In that case, you will continue to take care of them

370
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,570
until I get your answers.

371
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,090
I don't see any benefit from caring for those stupid ducks.

372
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
He's right.

373
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,090
You're not teaching us, but making us spend our days caring for ducks.

374
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,540
What for, Master Amin?

375
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,970
I don't see how I can benefit from it.

376
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,700
How about I offer you a special prize?

377
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,170
What prize?

378
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,610
If anyone can keep their own duck safe and sound until a specified date,

379
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,890
they will get special food for every meal.

380
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,730
They won't have to wake up early to exercise.

381
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:13,330
Lastly, they will get their own private bedroom.

382
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,010
We'll get all that just by keeping our duck alive?

383
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Yes.

384
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,410
Just keep your duck safe.

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,800
Now that's interesting.

386
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,270
Hey.

387
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,140
I pranked you too hard.

388
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,690
Sorry, friend.

389
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,690
Hey.

390
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,800
Where are you hurrying off to?

391
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,530
Don't go yet. We're not finished.

392
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,330
What do you want to say to Pennhung?

393
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,260
Can you take care of our ducks?

394
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,800
You like taking care of ducks, don't you?

395
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,260
Yes,

396
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,260
but those are your ducks.

397
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,720
You must take care of them yourselves.

398
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,480
We don't know how to do that.

399
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,330
If we do it ourselves, they will surely die.

400
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,330
Don't you feel bad for those little ones?

401
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,690
They're so small.

402
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,690
Will you let them die?

403
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,290
Huh?

404
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,650
Don't you feel bad for them?

405
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,400
What do you say, Pennhung?

406
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,500
Alright, Pennhung will take care of your ducks.

407
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,860
Pennhung doesn't want them to die.

408
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,500
That's my friend.

409
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,850
You're the best, buddy.

410
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,170
Come here.

411
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,170
You're hungry, right, Pierre?

412
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,740
Are you thirsty?

413
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,250
Do you want to eat this, Pierre?

414
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,780
How about you, Cutie?

415
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,540
Come on, Pierre.

416
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,680
Good job.

417
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,600
Biw, Pheng,

418
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,980
can you guys please take care of my duck?

419
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,530
My legs still hurt.

420
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,500
Once they're fully recovered, I'll take care of your ducks.

421
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,980
Fine.

422
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,190
Thank you so much.

423
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,450
You guys are so nice.

424
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,180
Hell!

425
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,340
That was scary.

426
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,090
It's pouring.

427
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,690
Is it a storm?

428
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,230
Nai, have you seen Pennhung?

429
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,250
Oh.

430
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,250
Where is he?

431
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,250
He was just there earlier.

432
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,030
The ducklings will get wet.

433
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,450
The ducklings will get sick.

434
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,540
Baby Duck.

435
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,410
This belongs to Hugo.

436
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,190
This is belongs to Jean.

437
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,020
Where is my Baby Duck?

438
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,890
Found you.

439
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,290
Wait here a second.

440
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,860
Come on.

441
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,060
It's going to rain soon.

442
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,690
Come.

443
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,150
Hurry.

444
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,330
Please cooperate.

445
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,640
It's about to rain.

446
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,540
Stay here.

447
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,980
You don't want to get sick.

448
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,400
Pennhung has to go.

449
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,450
Let's go.

450
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,570
Pennhung is going.

451
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,980
It's about to rain.

452
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,850
Hang in there, Baby Duck.

453
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,050
Where have you been, Pennhung?

454
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,800
Pennhung went to get the ducklings.

455
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,320
Pennhung read that ducklings get sick from the rain

456
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,610
and they could die.

457
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,100
Pennhung doesn't want them to die.

458
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,170
Oh, Pennhung.

459
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,520
The ducklings won't get wet.

460
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,950
We built them a house.

461
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,490
They won't get wet.

462
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,420
We don't know what could happen.

463
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,090
Because Pennhung put the ducks in the bedroom,

464
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,580
I couldn't sleep all night.

465
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,100
Yeah, they keep quacking all night.

466
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Yeah.

467
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,090
Oh, no!

468
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,670
What?

469
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,090
The duck coop broke down!

470
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,940
No!

471
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,270
Where are all the ducks?

472
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,250
Go find them.

473
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,840
Search over there.

474
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
I found nothing.

475
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,620
What do we do?

476
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,430
Let's go!

477
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,640
No way!

478
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,140
Hurry!

479
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,970
Those of you who lost the ducklings must find them.

480
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,330
You must take responsibility for your carelessness.

481
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,050
Those of you who still have your ducklings can stay for breakfast.

482
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,430
If you don't eat within the time given,

483
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,330
Master Phoban will take your trays away immediately.

484
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,450
Remember that if you can't find the ducklings,

485
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,820
you will be punished.

486
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,380
Pierre!

487
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,850
Where could they possibly be?

488
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,390
Pierre, my baby!

489
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,580
Asparagus!

490
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,770
Bo 2!

491
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,910
How can we find them in such a big forest?

492
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,900
Do you think they could've gone that way?

493
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,330
Let's look over there.

494
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,700
Pierre!

495
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,450
Little ducklings.

496
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,700
Where are you?

497
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,980
Have you found them?

498
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,620
Hurry up and find them.

499
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,340
It's your fault.

500
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,030
I shouldn't have asked you two to take care of my duck.

501
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,340
You're irresponsible.

502
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,930
Why are you staring at my face?

503
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,450
Hurry up and find them.

504
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,100
Little ducklings.

505
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,750
Quack! Quack! Quack!

506
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,970
Come out, baby ducks.

507
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,290
Hey, you're back.

508
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,450
Did you find the ducks?

509
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,530
No.

510
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,610
Where's the food?

511
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,100
Where is it all gone?

512
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,100
Master Phoban put it away.

513
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Seriously?

514
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,890
He didn't even think to keep some food for us?

515
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,290
We're 10 minutes late.

516
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,400
I guess Master Phoban had to follow the rules.

517
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,120
Seriously?

518
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,390
Are they going to let us kids starve to death?

519
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,410
Are they crazy?

520
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,850
Stop, girls.

521
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,850
Don't complain yet.

522
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,850
I've secretly kept you some bread.

523
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,610
There are 6 pieces, just enough for you.

524
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,270
Enough how?

525
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,480
You see there are 10 of us.

526
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,450
They're enough for the girls.

527
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,750
Sorry.

528
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,800
This is all we could hide.

529
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,180
You guys hang in there.

530
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,810
Thanks.

531
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,330
How about we share half our bread

532
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,330
so the guys could eat too?

533
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,170
Eating a little each is better than starving.

534
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,170
That way, we can have more energy to keep looking for the ducklings.

535
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,170
Sure. No problem.

536
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,180
Why would you share it with them? You're wasting it.

537
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,170
Here.

538
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,300
You can have it.

539
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,340
Thanks.

540
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,090
Thank you.

541
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,460
Let's eat quickly and get back to looking for the ducks.

542
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,130
See?

543
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,060
I told you to get Bo 1 and Bo 2 inside.

544
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,160
What were they thinking, naming them Bo 1 and Bo 2?

545
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,650
So stupid.

546
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,650
They're still better than you, idiot.

547
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,990
Who even names their duck Asparagus?

548
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,330
That's so difficult to pronounce.

549
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,090
You're so stupid, do you know that?

550
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,530
No more eating.

551
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,530
Why is it suddenly foggy?

552
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,530
Right?

553
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,330
It makes it even harder to look for the ducklings.

554
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,060
This forest is really scary.

555
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,330
The more we walk, the more we get lost.

556
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,040
I really don't understand

557
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,100
why the school is in the middle of this thick forest.

558
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,530
It's so damn inconvenient.

559
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,090
There. I found it.

560
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,170
Where?

561
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,900
Come here.

562
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,090
Whose duck is that?

563
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,780
Jingjai's.

564
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,760
Yeah!

565
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,260
I found it.

566
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,100
Oh, this is Bo 2!

567
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,970
How are you, baby?

568
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,930
I'll go back and wait for you guys at Home School.

570
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,870
I can't walk any longer.

571
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,710
My legs are killing me.

572
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,500
Can you take Bo 2 with you?

573
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
Sure.

574
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,570
I'll help the others look for their ducks.

575
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,000
Of course.

576
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,570
I'll take good care of your duck, Nai.

577
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,260
Daddy will be back soon.

578
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,520
Bye.

579
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,650
Bye-bye.

580
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,660
Bye.

581
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,330
Daddy will be back soon, okay?

582
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,330
After I find your friends.

583
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,890
Why are you smiling?

584
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,890
Let's find Bo 1 and Cutie.

585
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,550
- Lift your legs high.
- Come out, ducklings.

586
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,510
Cluck! Cluck!

587
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,730
That's not how ducks sound, White.

588
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,070
I've been saying quack for an hour but it didn't work.

589
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,950
Is it possible that the ducklings....?

590
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,020
Pheng.

591
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,570
Don't be discouraged yet.

592
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,700
I'm scared.

593
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,090
Don't think that way, Pheng.

594
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,090
We haven't looked everywhere yet.

595
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,850
We've been searching for some time.

596
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,860
If they're still alive, don't you think we would've found them already?

597
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,170
There are still many spots we haven't walked to.

598
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,610
Don't be discouraged yet.

599
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,090
If we haven't found their bodies,

600
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,610
there's still hope.

601
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,620
Maybe Tibet's group has already found our ducks.

602
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Who knows?

603
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,130
I only see trees everywhere I look.

604
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,530
There's not a single animal here.

605
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,100
And there's the fog.

606
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,530
Don't you think it's weird?

607
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,530
Damn it!

608
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,530
If I had done what Pennhung did last night,

609
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,280
we wouldn't have to walk in the forest like this.

610
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,410
Hugo and Jean are so damn lucky

611
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,170
they got Pennhung to take care of their ducks.

612
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Hey.

613
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,330
Why don't we ask Pennhung to help us search for the ducklings?

614
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,890
Good idea.

615
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,650
Pennhung, buddy.

616
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,210
Hey. Calm down.

617
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,650
Sit down.

618
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,100
Pennhung.

619
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,210
Could you help us look for the ducklings?

620
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,690
Please, Pennhung.

621
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,970
You know best about ducks.

622
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,050
You know how to look for the ducklings, right?

623
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,930
I don't want anything to happen to my duckling.

624
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,930
Please, Pennhung.

625
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,930
Please help us.

626
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,510
Actually, it's our responsibility.

627
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,500
We can't put it on Pennhung alone.

628
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,500
Come on, Fuji.

629
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,900
Do you know how to look for them?

630
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,500
I'm only saying that we shouldn't pressure Pennhung.

631
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,500
We should rely on ourselves too.

632
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,330
Pennhung wants to help,

633
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,410
but Pennhung is scared of failing to help.

634
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,010
Pennhung is scared his friends will be disappointed.

635
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,250
Do you have any idea how to look for the ducklings?

636
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,340
Is there a way to call them?

637
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,940
Like how we call the chickens.

638
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,600
Let's go.

639
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,720
They're really here.

640
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,130
Guys, they're over there!

641
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,550
The ducks!

642
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,380
- Are they?
- Yes.

643
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,690
Are they all there?

644
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,030
Pennhung guessed right.

645
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,970
Oh, babies.

646
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,410
Pennhung, you really are a genius.

647
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,010
Thank you, Pennhung.

648
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,300
From now on, I'm calling you God of Ducks.

649
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,100
Please don't run away from Mommy again, okay?

650
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Okay?

651
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,490
We almost got punished.

652
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,330
I wasn't scared of getting punished.

653
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,330
I was more worried about the ducks.

654
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,650
Thank you so much, Pennhung.

655
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,260
How did you know they'd be here?

656
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,590
Yeah, how?

657
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,810
It's duck nature.

658
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,540
How?

659
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,530
Ducks are animals that eat a lot

660
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,540
and get hungry all the time.

661
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,410
They just came back to eat where they knew they could find food.

662
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,940
Though it's not time to eat,

663
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,730
they will come back to wherever there's food.

664
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,730
Is there anything you don't know?

665
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,090
There are actually a lot of things Pennhung doesn't know,

666
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,010
but Pennhung knows about ducks because his mom taught him

667
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,020
that if one wants to take care of something,

668
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,570
one must do their best.

669
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,060
Also, if one can't take care of their pet,

670
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,020
how can they take care of themselves when they grow up?

671
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,140
I think I get what Master Amin is trying to teach us now.

672
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,220
I think we should build the ducklings a new house.

673
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Yes.

674
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,050
Let's find something we can use

675
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,010
and build it somewhere near us.

676
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,770
Let's see what can still be reused.

677
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,650
What about this roof?

678
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,320
- This, too?
- Here's the roof.

679
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,690
This should be good.

680
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,100
Be careful of the sticks.

681
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,220
What is this place?

682
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,730
Is it a forbidden area?

683
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,720
Maybe.

684
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,020
It could be a forbidden place

685
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,330
or a sacred place for the locals.

686
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,540
I don't think we should enter.

687
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,540
Or maybe the Masters built this place.

688
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,530
I don't see any locals around here.

689
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,570
Remember what White told us?

690
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,690
She said she heard someone crying in the forest.

691
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,690
Are you saying the voice came from inside this place?

692
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,410
Maki, are you saying there's a ghost in this forest?

693
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,890
Not a ghost.

694
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,820
I think it's a human voice.

695
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,210
How can you be sure?

696
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,410
This is not a sacred place.

697
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,890
It's just to keep people out.

698
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,090
You have a point

699
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,290
but I don't think we should interfere.

700
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
Stop right now!

701
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,180
This is a forbidden area.

702
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,330
It's dangerous in there.

703
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
Why do you want to enter?

704
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,770
We're just looking for the lost ducklings.

705
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,570
Let's go back to Home School.

706
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,490
Your friends have found the rest of the ducklings.

707
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,020
And remember not to come here again.

708
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,700
What's in there?

709
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,770
Why is the gate chained?

710
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,130
It's none of your business.

711
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,220
Are you hiding something, Master?

712
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,760
Maki.

713
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,300
I'm not hiding anything.

714
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,450
I'm protecting you nosey kids from danger.

715
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,010
What danger?

716
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,540
This is a forest.

717
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,490
What could possibly be here,

718
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,770
except for animals?

719
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,090
Please stop asking questions.

720
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,930
It's time to go back to Home School.

721
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,730
After you.

722
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,630
Hugo.

723
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,820
Come here.

724
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,860
Hey, beautiful.

725
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,140
Do you want to go see the ducks with me?

726
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,010
Now?

727
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,820
Yes.

728
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,740
My duck just got lost in the forest.

729
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,580
I think it's in need of love and care.

730
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:11,340
Hugo, you know I'm not serious, right?

731
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,340
Won't you be sincere like the meaning of your name?

732
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,370
If I wasn't sincere, I wouldn't be frank with you.

733
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,610
Good.

734
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,220
I like it this way.

735
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,210
Hugo, one of the ducklings died.

736
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,650
Where?

737
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,010
Maybe it's just sleeping.

738
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,460
Go check.

739
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,610
Now?

740
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,610
Yeah.

741
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,850
Hey.

742
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,290
It's really gone.

743
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,890
Whose duck is it?

744
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,010
I don't know.

745
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,660
Let me check the tag.

746
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
(Hugo)

747
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,170
No way!

748
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,410
It's mine!

749
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,090
How is this possible?

750
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,250
It was fine early this evening.

751
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,370
Why did Master Amin call us here at this hour?

752
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,270
I don't know.

753
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,940
I don't think it's good news.

754
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,490
Don't tell me he's going to teach us something again.

755
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,880
I understand that you might be surprised

756
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,420
as to why I called you to the meeting room at this hour.

757
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,420
I have something to announce to you all.

758
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:28,250
One student broke the rules and will be punished.

759
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,060
Who is that, Master Amin?

760
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,190
Who broke the rules and what did that person do?

761
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,260
This person broke the rules by being irresponsible,

762
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,690
by being careless,

763
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:53,140
by not taking care of and paying attention to what was assigned.

764
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,610
This duck belongs to Pennhung.

765
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,290
No.

766
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,620
This is not Pennhung's duck.

767
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,810
This is not Baby Duck.

768
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,420
The nametag clearly says it's yours,

769
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,160
so you will be punished.

770
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,260
No.

771
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,730
This is not Pennhung's duck.

772
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,440
Pennhung's duck is still alive.

773
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,720
This is not Baby Duck.

774
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,370
Baby Duck is still alive.

775
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,440
This is not Pennhung's duck.

776
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,560
How dare you still deny it?

777
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,420
You're impossible.

778
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,330
You will be grounded.

779
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,490
You will be locked up alone in the confession room

780
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,940
until you admit what you did.

781
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,620
No.

782
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,060
This is not Pennhung's duck.

783
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,320
This is not Baby Duck.

784
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,660
Baby Duck is still alive.

785
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,930
This is not Pennhung's duck.

786
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,290
Pennhung's duck is still alive.

787
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,300
This is not Baby Duck.

788
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,530
This is not Baby Duck.

789
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,930
Pennhung's duck is still alive.

790
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,290
No!

791
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,110
Don't lock Pennhung up!

792
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,340
Pennhung's duck is still alive!

793
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,700
Don't lock Pennhung up!

794
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,790
This is not Baby Duck!

795
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,900
Don't lock Pennhung up!

796
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,730
Master Amin.

797
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,900
I don't believe it.

798
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,400
Pennhung would never let his duck die.

799
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,250
Me neither.

800
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,930
Pennhung is the best caretaker of ducks among us.

801
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,550
There must be a mistake.

802
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,010
Could you please reconsider?

803
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:53,970
You guys don't need to talk about this again

804
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,580
because I've thoroughly examined it.

805
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,320
Unfortunately,

806
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,810
this duck was sick.

807
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:08,330
It didn't matter how well Pennhung took care of it.

808
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,450
It's part of human life.

809
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,420
Mistakes can always happen.

810
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:24,420
But we must be brave enough to admit to our mistakes.

811
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,270
It's impossible.

812
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,620
I don't believe it.

813
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,730
Pennhung would never let that happen.

814
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,470
Like he said, mistakes can happen.

815
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,460
That's Pennhung's duck.

816
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,450
Rin.

817
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:13,890
Rin.

818
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,090
I'm sorry.

819
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,220
I killed Dad.

820
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,330
I'm sorry.

821
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,980
Maki, what's wrong?

822
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,940
Bad dream?

823
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,890
No.

824
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,850
It's nothing.

825
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,580
Are you sure?

826
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,250
You don't look okay.

827
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,650
Go back to sleep.

828
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,260
Please enjoy your special meal.

829
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,140
How is Hamburg steak special?

830
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,830
This meal includes a special ingredient

831
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,610
and was carefully prepared

832
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,780
to be a reward for all of you.

833
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,610
(Pheng)

834
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,690
(Pheng)

835
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,700
These are our ducklings.

836
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,490
(White)

837
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,570

DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

841
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:34,551
Pennhung already told him that the duck that died wasn't Baby Duck.

842
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,420
I know what you're hiding

843
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,699
about the dead duckling.

844
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:40,343
What the hell is this?

845
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:42,160
They don't teach us at all.

846
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,511
All they do is punish us.

847
00:52:43,511 --> 00:52:45,075
We didn't do anything wrong.

848
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:47,469
What do you think we are, Masters?

849
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:50,205
Do you enjoy punishing us so much?

850
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:51,831
If you really love your friends,

851
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:54,343
don't get them in trouble.

852
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:55,939
Before you ask for anything,

853
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,182
make sure you're not causing trouble for others.
