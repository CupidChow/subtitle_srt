1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,299
Each of you must take care of one duckling.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,180
No!

3
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:05,229
It's mine!

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,199
This duck belongs to Pennhung.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,339
This is not Pennhung's duck.

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,459
This is not Baby Duck.

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,889
Pennhung's duck is still alive!

8
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,030
This is not Baby Duck.

9
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,930
These are our ducklings.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,930
Headmaster, why are our ducks' nametags put here?

11
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,940
The Hamburg steaks you're eating,

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,009
were made with your duckling meats.

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,290
Shit.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,770
(Maki)

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,610
Headmaster, don't you think you have gone too far?

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,559
Why did you have to do this much to us?

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,730
It's because this is a punishment for all of you.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,089
Punishment?

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,669
Why did you punish us?

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,630
What did we do wrong?

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,330
Right.

22
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,659
Master, tell us what we did wrong.

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,400
Stop asking already.

24
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,260
You'd better start eating now

25
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,770
because today is the first day of the term.

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,460
Come to class on time.

27
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,010
But...

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,810
Didn't you hear what the Headmaster said?

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,810
Or do you all want another punishment?

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,380
Do you think the Masters really killed the ducks we took care of?

31
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,900
Those Masters really did kill our ducks.

32
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,340
I can't stand this anymore.

33
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,620
I want to go home.

34
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,000
Damn.

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,619
They went too far, didn't they?

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,829
They killed the ducks we took care of,

37
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,250
and made us eat them.

38
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,249
I can't take it.

39
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,969
We haven't done anything wrong.

40
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,260
Though we did,

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,130
they mustn't give us such a harsh punishment, must they?

42
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,130
If anyone wants to take this crazy course, go ahead.

43
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,700
But I won't stand it.

44
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,700
What will you do then,

45
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,669
The Master told us to go to class,

46
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,129
so I won't go.

47
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,830
Right.

48
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,030
I agree.

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,419
I won't study.

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,849
But if we do that,

51
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,369
I think those Masters will punish us even more.

52
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,339
There can't be anything worse than this, Maki.

53
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,089
Can you really stand such a thing?

54
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,810
Those Masters have gone too far,

55
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,360
so we shouldn't yield.

56
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,610
Right.

57
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,450
Let's skip class.

58
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,180
But...

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,849
(Attention, please.)

60
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:01,620
(Every GEN6 student, please be present in the meeting room now.)

61
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,230
(Attention, please.)

62
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,090
(Every GEN6 student, please be present in the meeting room now.)

63
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,000
We have no right to force others.

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,610
Everyone can make their own choice.

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,339
This place is damn crazy.

66
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,669
They made such nonsense rules.

67
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,610
Isn't it illegal to treat students like this?

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,420
After I get out of this place,

69
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,799
I'll report this to the Ministry.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,930
Before you do that,

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,780
how about figuring out how to get out of here first?

72
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,859
How can we escape?

73
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,890
Last time, I almost died in the forest.

74
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,329
If we escape without a plan,

75
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,890
I think it's almost impossible.

76
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,730
In the end, we will end up getting lost in the forest again.

77
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,100
Look outside.

78
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,730
Wherever we look, there're trees all around.

79
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,100
Only those Masters know the route.

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,420
Damn it!

81
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,060
They seized our phones.

82
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,279
If we have a phone with us,

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,930
we can just check the map, and that's it.

84
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,000
Or should we try to find our phones?

85
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,710
At least, if we get our phones back,

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,820
we can make calls and ask for help from others.

87
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,930
But we have no clue where the Masters keep our phones.

88
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,540
Why aren't you in class?!

89
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,600
It's already class time.

90
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Come in.

91
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,170
I won't!

92
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,910
Let's go.

93
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,200
Ow!

94
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,430
Ow!

95
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,050
It hurts!

96
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,370
Please get back to class.

97
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,410
Nobody stays out of the line.

98
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,890
You treat us as if we were prisoners, Master.

99
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,390
Alright, everyone.

100
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,500
Today, you're taking a history class.

101
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,490
I want everyone to listen carefully.

102
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,490
Do listen carefully.

103
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,490
Are you going to teach while locking us up like this?

104
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,799
From now, if I don't ask, nobody can talk!

105
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,940
Got it?!

106
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,500
Alright.

107
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,410
What's the scary enemy of history?

108
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,800
Human.

109
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,130
Human is the scary enemy of history because human records history.

110
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,580
They can write whatever they want in the history.

111
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,490
They can write to make someone a hero,

112
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,050
or they can write to make someone a villain

113
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,780
in the eyes of all the people in the world.

114
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,780
That's also possible.

115
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,340
But do remember that,

116
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,730
in the end, the truth will always be revealed

117
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,450
because it will never disappear.

118
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,290
The first thing you'll learn in this subject is

119
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,050
facing the truth.

120
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,490
All of you must write down your confession about the faults you've made...

121
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,210
since you've been in Home School.

122
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,210
What about what Home School did wrong to their students?

123
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,300
Won't you write your confession also, Master?

124
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,610
Everything is under the rules...

125
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,050
your parents have been informed of from the start.

126
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,060
If you still want to be in Home School,

127
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,060
you must abide by our rules.

128
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,050
If my dad knew about these crazy rules,

129
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,049
he wouldn't stand it!

130
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,010
Shh!

131
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,700
I'm sorry,

132
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,700
but there's no way your dad will find out about this...

133
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,220
because all of you must live here for three years.

134
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,210
Forget your home,

135
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,220
and remember that this is your home.

136
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,980
If you don't want to write anything down, that's up to you.

137
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,490
All of you stay in this room.

138
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,490
Don't leave this room...

139
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,050
until your bedtime.

140
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,140
Our first subject's lesson has started.

141
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,739
Everything went as you expected, Master Amin.

142
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,560
I hope every GEN6 student will enjoy studying.

143
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,900
Master Amin,

144
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,900
I was informed by Master Phoban that,

145
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,889
Run's condition last night was quite worrisome.

146
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,580
I think we should...

147
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:44,410
I'll handle the matter about Run myself.

148
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,800
Master Amin, please don't forget that...

149
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,900
this is Home School,

150
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,800
not a hospital.

151
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,060
White.

152
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,560
Fuji.

153
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,360
Wake up now.

154
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:37,909
It's exercise time.

155
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,910
Everyone.

156
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,000
Pheng.

157
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,030
Pheng.

158
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,780
Biw.

159
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,260
Jingjai.

160
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:42,980
Wake up!

161
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:44,589
Why are you so loud?

162
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,119
I didn't hear the alarm.

163
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,260
I'll get back to sleep.

164
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,600
Right.

165
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,770
Why didn't they wake us up?

166
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,570
Pheng, wake up now.

167
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,330
It's our exercise time.

168
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,320
Forget about them.

169
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,450
Let's hurry up and take a shower.

170
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,449
Right. Hurry up, Maki.

171
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,450
Just forget about them.

172
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,289
Only you guys are here?

173
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,340
What about others?

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,320
We woke them up already,

175
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,519
but they didn't wake up.

176
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
You girls?

177
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
They also didn't wake up.

178
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,940
So, only we woke up, right?

179
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,619
We could be in trouble.

180
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,940
Don't jinx it.

181
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,500
You guys are here already.

182
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,500
Good.

183
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,010
Start running.

184
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,889
Master, but some of our friends aren't here yet.

185
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,890
I know.

186
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,900
That's why you must run for your friends who are late.

187
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,549
Why must we do that?

188
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,300
It's my order, so you must follow.

189
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,900
Keep running until all of your friends are here.

190
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Run!

191
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,300
I'll count from one to three.

192
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,900
The student who leaves last will be punished.

193
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,150
One!

194
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Two!

195
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,600
Damn you.

196
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,250
It took you ages.

197
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,250
We're dying.

198
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,540
Where are Mek and Jean?

199
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,910
They're pooping.

200
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,500
They'll be here soon.

201
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,050
I haven't told you to stop running.

202
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,699
Do not stop.

203
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,900
You must run for your friends who are late.

204
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,810
You sit down...

205
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,340
and watch your friends run.

206
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,039
Why do we have to watch them run?

207
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,550
Because you woke up late,

208
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,290
your friends are being punished.

209
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,020
Run.

210
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,430
Run.

211
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,900
Hurry up!

212
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,570
Run.

213
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,570
Faster.

214
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,010
Damn it.

215
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,739
I just don't get it.

216
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,290
Why was I punished?

217
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,290
I came to run on time.

218
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,250
I didn't wake up late like you did.

219
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,170
What?

220
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,130
Why are you complaining to me?

221
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,690
You should blame those Masters.

222
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,429
But it's because you were late, isn't it?

223
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,179
That's why we were punished.

224
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,810
There's usually an alarm, isn't it?

225
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,810
But today, there wasn't.

226
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,859
It's more because you're lazy, Jean.

227
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,559
Can you not fight now?

228
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,580
I'll eat.

229
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,970
White, do you feel like eating?

230
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The chicken is burned.

231
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,460
Is this fried rice or boiled rice?

232
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,970
It's damn wet.

233
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,829
Right.

234
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,500
Why is our meal unpleasant again?

235
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,540
Try running like we did today.

236
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,530
Though the food is worse than this, I'll eat it anyway.

237
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,699
But I think they have gone too far.

238
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,900
How could they cook such food for us?

239
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,039
We must do something about it.

240
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,039
Will we stand eating such food?

241
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,370
I agree with you.

242
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,870
Let's bring the food to the Masters.

243
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,380
Let them know that we can't eat it.

244
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm going with you.

245
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:04,900
I also can't stand this anymore.

246
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,010
Are you sure you won't eat it?

247
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,370
Master, do you yourself eat such food?

248
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,870
Fine.

249
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,930
If you insist on not eating it,

250
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,600
your friends will be punished.

251
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,110
They must eat yours.

252
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,409
If they can't eat them up,

253
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,600
we won't provide all of you with the next meal.

254
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,800
Why do we have to eat theirs?

255
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,939
If you're not happy to do so,

256
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,610
make your friends agree to eat.

257
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,290
If they don't,

258
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,820
you must eat it for them.

259
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,979
You're obviously forcing us to fight among ourselves.

260
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,129
This is against Home School's rule, isn't it?

261
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,930
You're teaching us to love each other, aren't you?

262
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,760
What's this?

263
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,850
If you love your friends

264
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,149
and don't want them to be punished,

265
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,970
eat your meal like your friends do.

266
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,940
If you really love your friends,

267
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,580
don't get them in trouble.

268
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,170
Before you ask for anything,

269
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,130
make sure you're not causing trouble for others.

270
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,760
There's no Master around here.

271
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,420
Here she is.

272
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,140
Headmaster,

273
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,980
we have something to ask for.

274
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,980
What is it?

275
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,510
We would like to know how Pennhung is doing.

276
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,980
Pennhung is receiving treatment now.

277
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,900
Treatment?

278
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,540
What treatment?

279
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,700
Right. What happened to Pennhung?

280
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,420
He's being mentally healed...

281
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,410
as a result of being locked up alone.

282
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,060
But don't worry.

283
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,050
Though Pennhung is being punished,

284
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,970
Home School will never leave him.

285
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,820
Can we visit him?

286
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,630
Yes.

287
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,690
But you can only do that after classes.

288
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,410
Classes?

289
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,250
It doesn't seem like we're studying anything.

290
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,350
Masters keep punishing us.

291
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,460
How can we call this studying?

292
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,250
Alright, everyone.

293
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,260
Today is your first lesson with me.

294
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,250
Should we start by answering easy questions...

295
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,690
to exercise your thought and mind?

296
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,010
But for each question in the paper on this table,

297
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,010
you have five minutes to answer.

298
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,310
They're this difficult.

299
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:07,310
Who could solve them, Master?

300
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,489
Oho. Each question is this long.

301
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,370
I'll run out of time just after I finish reading it.

302
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,900
I already started timing.

303
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,370
If you don't do it quickly,

304
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,180
you might be punished.

305
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,620
Master, is there a punishment again?

306
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,580
What is it?

307
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,810
Master Dilak's subject doesn't involve violence.

308
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,289
Anyone who fails to give the correct answer...

309
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:41,769
or can't come up with an answer just has to keep working on it until they get the correct answer.

310
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,650
Huh? What?

311
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:50,200
If anyone gets even one question wrong,

312
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,610
everyone won't get to leave this room.

313
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,719
What?

314
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,790
This is too much.

315
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,350
Do it. Go ahead.

316
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,070
Do it. Do it.

317
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,590
Do it. Do it.

318
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,740
Won't you do it?

319
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,210
Do it.

320
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,690
Do it.

321
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,410
Do it.

322
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,590
Do it.

323
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,420
Wow.

324
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,410
Some already got the correct answers,

325
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,840
but some haven't.

326
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,650
So, you must answer more questions.

327
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,260
Huh? What questions?

328
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,530
I haven't even written my name down.

329
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,100
I haven't even finished this one.

330
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,740
Do it.

331
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,450
Keep doing.

332
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,450
Keep doing until nobody gets the wrong answer.

333
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,010
If you fail to write your answer in time,

334
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,020
you must also keep solving new questions.

335
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,459
But this is very difficult.

336
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,130
How can we finish it in five minutes?

337
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,690
Let's think of it as a light punishment.

338
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,279
Did they send us here to study,

339
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,050
or to be punished?

340
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,409
How could they call this place the No.1 school?

341
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,940
They aren't teaching us anything.

342
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,860
Thinking it over,

343
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,140
I'm envious of Pennhung now.

344
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,629
He doesn't have to do anything.

345
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,319
He doesn't have to face such a thing.

346
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,140
I'm no longer sure now...

347
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,100
if Pennhung is being punished...

348
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,579
or we are.

349
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,400
You still don't get it?

350
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,610
It's we who are being punished.

351
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,700
But why?

352
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,180
What did we do wrong?

353
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,809
I don't know either,

354
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,000
but I really want to get locked up now.

355
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
No.

356
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,979
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up.

357
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,260
Pennhung is scared.

358
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,879
No. Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up.

359
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,010
Pennhung is scared.

360
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,090
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up in here.

361
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,269
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up.

362
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,459
Pennhung wants to go with you.

363
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,499
Pennhung wants to get out of here.

364
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,689
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up in here.

365
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,859
Pennhung is scared. Pennhung is scared.

366
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,500
Pennhung doesn't want to stay here.

367
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,060
Don't be scared.

368
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,050
Master Amin said...

369
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,770
you're receiving treatment.

370
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,250
Everything will get better soon.

371
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,730
You will certainly recover.

372
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,700
Pennhung apologizes.

373
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,220
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up in here.

374
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,840
Take this pill,

375
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,290
as Master Amin ordered.

376
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,139
I won't.

377
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,400
I don't want to see it.

378
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,499
Pennhung doesn't want to feel tortured.

379
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,690
Pennhung won't eat it.

380
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,389
Pennhung doesn't want to feel tortured.

381
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,390
Pennhung won't eat it.

382
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,690
Pennhung doesn't want to see it.

383
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,149
Pennhung doesn't want to see it.

384
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,450
Pennhung doesn't want to eat it.

385
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,970
Good boy.

386
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,900
You'll recover soon.

387
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,850
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up.

388
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,130
Pennhung doesn't want to stay here.

389
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,700
Pennhung doesn't want to get locked up.

390
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,170
Pennhung doesn't want to get locked up.

391
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,930
Pennhung is scared.

392
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,620
Pennhung already apologized.

393
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,980
Don't lock Pennhung up in here.

394
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,210
Pennhung already apologized.

395
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,810
Don't lock Pennhung up in here.

396
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,370
Pennhung already apologized.

397
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,059
Don't lock Pennhung up in here.

398
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,349
Pennhung already apologized.

399
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,649
Don't lock Pennhung up in here.

400
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,089
Pennhung already apologized!

401
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,220
Don't lock Pennhung up in here.

402
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,280
Pennhung already apologized!

403
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,170
How many times have I told you not to behave like this?

404
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,550
How many more schools must we move you to, huh?

405
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,170
How could you injure another child like that?

406
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,969
Do you know that your friend's parents wanted to go all out

407
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,249
making you pay for this?

408
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,999
Do you know how hard I had to try to clear up this trouble?

409
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,370
Can you just not cause trouble? Huh?

410
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,450
I'm so damn sick of this.

411
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,249
Damn it!

412
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,809
Don't blame Pennhung.

413
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,930
You know he didn't mean to.

414
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,050
You keep siding with him.

415
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,250
That's why he's behaving like this.

416
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,660
Pennhung didn't mean it.

417
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,610
Pennhung apologizes.

418
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
Hey,

419
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,020
if you keep behaving like this,

420
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,250
I'll send you to live somewhere else.

421
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,450
You know well that you aren't a normal kid like others, don't you?

422
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,260
Why can't you be aware of it, huh?

423
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,260
Why can't you bear with it?!

424
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,389
Pennhung apologizes.

425
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,849
Pennhung didn't mean to do it.

426
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,790
- Pennhung apologizes. - Come!

427
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:58,979
- Don't lock him up. - Get out of here.

428
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,549
- Please don't lock him up. - Come!

429
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,650
I'm begging you.

430
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,899
Pennhung apologizes.

431
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,319
- I can't stand him anymore. - Please.

432
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,329
Honey, don't lock him up.

433
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,699
- Pennhung didn't mean to do it. - Honey!

434
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,620
Don't lock Pennhung up.

435
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,980
Pennhung apologizes.

436
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,519
Pennhung didn't mean to do it.

437
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Don't lock Pennhung up.

438
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,650
Don't lock Pennhung up.

439
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,900
Pennhung apologized already.

440
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,319
Pennhung apologized already. - Pennhung!

441
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,120
Pennhung!

442
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,920
Pennhung.

443
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,660
- Relax, Pennhung. - Pennhung.

444
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,769
Pennhung, this is Maki...

445
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,600
and White.

446
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,860
Pennhung.

447
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,590
Relax, Pennhung.

448
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,700
Maki and White,

449
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,940
Pennhung's friends.

450
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,230
White.

451
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,010
Maki.

452
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,700
Are you two being punished too?

453
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,539
No.

454
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,580
We brought you the snack.

455
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,620
It's the croissant you like.

456
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,460
Wednesday's dinner is delicious.

457
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,740
Wednesday's breakfast isn't.

458
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,689
Pennhung, you remember it?

459
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,170
You have such a good memory.

460
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,890
Master Amin also said that.

461
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,330
He said I'm gifted.

462
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,620
My memory can be my weapon.

463
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,760
Why did Master Amin say that?

464
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,530
Pennhung doesn't know either.

465
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,010
Pennhung doesn't find it helpful.

466
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,770
Pennhung already told him that...

467
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,210
the duck that died wasn't Baby Duck.

468
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,220
What did you say, Pennhung?

469
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,020
My Baby Duck had a spot on its left leg.

470
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,410
White's Pierre had the most pointed beak.

471
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,820
It's the second largest after Mork's Asparagus.

472
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,540
Maki's Cutie was round.

473
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,690
It had a mark on its right wing.

474
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,940
Pennhung, do you know whom the duck that died belonged to?

475
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,980
Pennhung doesn't know.

476
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,650
Pennhung doesn't know.

477
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,250
Pennhung hasn't seen it before.

478
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,860
Pennhung, you haven't seen the duck that died before, have you?

479
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,300
I could remember.

480
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,540
It didn't belong to any of us.

481
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,330
It wasn't one of our ducks.

482
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,990
White, if it wasn't one of our ducks,

483
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,860
this was probably those Masters' plan.

484
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,210
How?

485
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:04,300
Everything was probably set up from the start,

486
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,180
both about our ducks...

487
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,890
and Pennhung.

488
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,170
Think about it.

489
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,060
When did those Masters start punishing us?

490
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,550
It was when Pennhung was punished...

491
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,639
because his duck died.

492
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,460
But Pennhung said,

493
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,730
the duck that died didn't belong to any of us,

494
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,460
which means it's the duck set up by the Masters...

495
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,530
just to come up with something to punish us.

496
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,140
Bullshit.

497
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,620
White!

498
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,240
White!

499
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,980
Who do you think we are, Master?

500
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,000
You keep agitating us.

501
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,019
What are you talking about?

502
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,749
Do you enjoy slandering us

503
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,769
and punishing us so much?

504
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,919
You have no right to raise your voice at your Master.

505
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,039
What right do you have to slander Pennhung?

506
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Hey, you.

507
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,080
Master Prasath, please calm down.

508
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,490
I'm sorry, Master.

509
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,030
White is upset because we got punished.

510
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,709
I'm upset because...

511
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,010
these crazy adults agitated and slandered us.

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
What kind of adults are you?

513
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,020
Is it that fun seeing your students get punished?

514
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,009
I have no clue...

515
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,010
what you Masters are planning to do.

516
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,010
But what I know for sure is,

517
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,009
we won't be in this crazy game.

518
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,579
If you don't stop being aggressive,

519
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,710
- I'll... - Do what?

520
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,090
Will you punish me?

521
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,089
Go ahead, Master.

522
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,890
Punish others...

523
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,290
because I know I won't get punished anyway.

524
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,010
Go ahead.

525
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,980
Master, there're quite a lot of quick-witted students among GEN6.

526
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,429
If you realize what the problem is,

527
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,010
you should take action to solve it.

528
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,930
What do you mean?

529
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,190
Wait.

530
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,500
Wait, Master!

531
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,900
What's going on?

532
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,250
It's about Pennhung's duck.

533
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,250
Why?

534
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,800
What did you find out?

535
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,570
Are you saying...

536
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,250
the Masters slandered Pennhung...

537
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,469
just to punish us?

538
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,470
Yes.

539
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,329
We can't let Pennhung get locked up like this,

540
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,180
while he didn't do anything wrong.

541
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,380
We must figure out a way to help him.

542
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,690
White, calm down.

543
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,090
I know you're furious,

544
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,410
but we must carefully help each other figure it out.

545
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,000
I just don't understand those adults.

546
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,940
Why do they enjoy slandering the younger ones so much?

547
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,100
Why are you this upset?

548
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,739
I think it's probably one of the lessons...

549
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,010
those Masters are trying to teach us.

550
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,150
Teaching?

551
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,180
What are they teaching?

552
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,979
They slandered someone like Pennhung.

553
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,500
What kind of teaching is that, Nai?

554
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,820
But what Nai said could be right.

555
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,690
Perhaps, those Masters are trying to tell us something.

556
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,530
I'm telling you,

557
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:51,170
some adults like to lie.

558
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,500
We can't trust them.

559
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,209
(I came to study at Home School)

560
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,210
(because I was slandered by those adults, )

561
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,610
(one of whom is someone I call my aunt.)

562
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,220
White,

563
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,210
I told you already not to go out, didn't I?

564
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,010
Why can't I?

565
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,620
I told you already that I'm not involved with my parents' deaths.

566
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,500
Why haven't you believed me?

567
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,340
It doesn't matter if I believe you or not,

568
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,690
but nobody in our family believes you.

569
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,940
What do you want me to do?

570
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,090
I already told you the truth.

571
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,970
The US police also concluded the case already.

572
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,570
What more evidence do you want from me?

573
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,090
Do you know that...

574
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,740
those media keep trying to attack us with this news all the time?

575
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,819
If I didn't bribe them,

576
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,739
our family would have already been defamed.

577
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,050
What are you afraid of?

578
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,820
It wasn't my doing.

579
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,130
It's not the truth.

580
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,370
Who would believe a liar like you?

581
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,409
You also had an unpleasant school behavior record.

582
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,340
I told you already that I was slandered.

583
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,970
That teacher lied.

584
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,530
I didn't agree to flirt with him,

585
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,359
so he slandered me.

586
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,979
Why don't you listen to me?

587
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,410
Did you try to throw yourself at him?

588
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,850
How could you say that?

589
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,410
Why do you believe everyone except me?

590
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,210
No matter how hard I struggle trying to explain,

591
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,610
you still choose to see me the way others talk about me.

592
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,210
I never threw myself at anyone,

593
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,850
and I love my parents a lot.

594
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,370
No matter what,

595
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,460
there's no way I would hurt my family

596
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,020
like you and those relatives are doing!

597
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,250
Believe me.

598
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,050
Study at Home School,

599
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,810
and everything will get better.

600
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,090
(Adults like to judge us.)

601
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,090
(They like to force us)

602
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,130
(and make us what they want us to be.)

603
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,370
Especially here at Home School.

604
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,740
That's why we must fight against that, White.

605
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,530
How can we?

606
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,670
We're just kids.

607
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,200
We can't do anything to those adults.

608
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,820
But we can question them.

609
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,990
What question?

610
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:20,410
We can question why those Masters did this.

611
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,970
Why did they set the scene that Pennhung's duck was dead?

612
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,109
If we can find the answers to these,

613
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,060
we'll probably understand those Masters' reasons.

614
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:37,200
What if those Masters didn't set it up,

615
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,300
but the duck belonged to someone else?

616
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,210
That sounds possible.

617
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,349
This could be the reason...

618
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,140
they set weird rules for us.

619
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,730
Because...

620
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,820
someone put the blame on Pennhung!

621
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,050
Please bring this food to Pennhung in the detention room.

622
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,479
Do that yourself, Master.

623
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,850
Why do I have to do it?

624
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,300
It's Master Amin's order.

625
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,650
From today, it's your responsibility...

626
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,950
to bring the food to Pennhung.

627
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,450
Pennhung doesn't want to stay here anymore.

628
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,450
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up anymore.

629
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,650
Pennhung,

630
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,980
I brought you breakfast.

631
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,200
Pennhung doesn't want to stay here anymore.

632
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,000
Pennhung doesn't want to be locked up anymore.

633
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,060
The duck that died didn't belong to Pennhung.

634
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,740
It wasn't Pennhung's fault.

635
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,340
It wasn't Pennhung's Baby Duck.

636
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,330
Pennhung doesn't want to stay here anymore.

637
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,249
It wasn't Baby Duck.

638
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Pennhung wants to get out of here.

639
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,530
Pennhung wants to get out of here.

640
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,300
You saw how Pennhung is doing now, didn't you?

641
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,390
Ow!

642
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,330
I know what you're hiding.

643
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,810
- What? - About the dead ducking.

644
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,790
What do you mean? I have no idea what it's about.

645
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,580
Let go of me!

646
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,850
Hey!

647
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
Let go of her!

648
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,500
Don't you understand?

649
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,340
If you don't speak the truth,

650
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,010
those Masters won't stop punishing us.

651
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
58.

652
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,150
59.

653
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,730
60.

654
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,009
Who told you to stop?

655
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,029
I didn't.

656
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,429
Keep doing pushups.

657
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,430
Ouch!

658
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,370
But we can't go on anymore, Master.

659
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,299
You boys do more pushups for those girls.

660
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,920
60 more each.

661
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,199
If any of you tries to avoid it,

662
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,380
all of you must be punished.

663
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,930
Do it now!

664
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:39,940
One.

665
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,940
Louder!

666
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,959
Two.

667
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,209
I can't hear you.

668
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,339
Three.

669
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Louder.

670
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,820
Four.

671
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,180
Ouch!

672
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,890
What the hell is this?

673
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,700
They don't teach us at all.

674
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,700
All they do is punish us.

675
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,500
We didn't do anything wrong.

676
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,490
This whole thing is happening...

677
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,930
because someone slandered Pennhung.

678
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,940
What do you mean, Maki?

679
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,940
Think about it carefully, guys.

680
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,500
Those Masters started punishing us,

681
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,470
since Pennhung's duck died, right?

682
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,500
We were also forced to eat our own ducks.

683
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,930
Weird punishments then kept coming up.

684
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,940
Those who did wrong didn't get punished.

685
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Try thinking about it, everyone.

686
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,370
What if Pennhung's duck didn't die,

687
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,090
but someone else slandered him?

688
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,460
We let Pennhung get punished unfairly.

689
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,210
Is this the reason...

690
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,500
those Masters keep punishing us?

691
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,450
How could we be sure that what you said is true?

692
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,010
Who slandered Pennhung?

693
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,900
Those who did it, take responsibility, okay?

694
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,969
How much longer are you going to get others in trouble?

695
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,410
Just confess...

696
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,660
before everything gets even worse.

697
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,460
What damn reason is this?

698
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,050
I don't get it.

699
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,050
Really?

700
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,600
I think Jingjai and you understand it best.

701
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
White.

702
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,740
Jingjai and you...

703
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,130
put the blame on Pennhung, right?

704
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,650
Damn you. Answer!

705
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,410
So, you did it, right?

706
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,970
Mek and Jean are totally drained now.

707
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,949
How much longer are you going to put us in trouble?

708
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,950
Huh?

709
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,170
Confess now.

710
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,019
It's because of you two, right?

711
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,189
You're the cause of this whole thing that put me in trouble, aren't you?

712
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,419
Hell. What's with you, Fuji?

713
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,480
Say it!

714
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,430
Let go of me!

715
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,060
- Say it! - Enough already!

716
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,550
Stop.

717
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,300
Let go.

718
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,420
You two can stop these punishments...

719
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,370
just by confessing.

720
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,300
We have something to confess.

721
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,220
I swapped the nametag of Pennhung's duckling...

722
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,950
with mine.

723
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,300
It wasn't Pennhung's fault.

724
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,570
It's my fault.

725
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,980
I have been aware of that.

726
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,540
Most importantly,

727
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,530
all of your ducks are still alive.

728
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,410
The dead duck didn't belong to any of you.

729
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,929
Why did you do this, Master Amin?

730
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,799
It's the first lesson I want to make you understand.

731
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,369
It's the lesson nobody has taught you before.

732
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:55,330
What's most important when creating a good society,

733
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,580
is that we mustn't let the innocent one be punished unfairly.

734
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,890
All of you must learn to question society's unfairness.

735
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,900
Don't ignore it...

736
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,690
when you see that something isn't right,

737
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,620
or else you'll get punished.

738
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:27,450
From now on,

739
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,970
we will stop all the punishments.

740
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,940
Pennhung will be free.

741
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,810
Hugo and Jingjai,

742
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,250
our punishment for you is that you must reflect on your mistake.

743
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,510
Do seriously realize...

744
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,580
how your action affected your friends.

745
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,820
Learn from your own mistake.

746
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,210
Remember your feeling of guilt this time,

747
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:09,890
because it will follow you for your entire life.

748
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,670
Alright.

749
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,370
Take some rest and go to bed.

750
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,409
Eat a lot,

751
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,940
so you'll grow up fast.

752
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,090
Hey.

753
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,130
Baby Duck.

754
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,200
Oho.

755
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,890
You've grown up a lot.

756
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,709
Hey, don't do that yet.

757
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,710
Pennhung,

758
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,940
we have something to tell you.

759
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,280
Well,

760
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,820
I'm sorry.

761
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,900
Do you want to eat some more?

762
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,280
That's it?

763
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,249
Um.

764
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,250
That's it.

765
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,260
You already forgave us, right?

766
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,609
Master once told me that...

767
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:48,690
apologizing is the first step of reflecting on one's mistake.

768
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,439
What's more important is

769
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,800
whether they will make the same mistake after that.

770
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,039
If they do,

771
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,290
it means they haven't truly reflected on their mistake.

772
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,610
Do you want some more?

773
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,369
(Attention, please.)

774
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,699
(Every GEN6 student, )

775
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,930
(please be present at Home School's meeting room now.)

776
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,270
(Every GEN6 student, )

777
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,600
(please be present at Home School's meeting room now.)

778
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,010
Why did the Headmaster call a meeting all of a sudden?

779
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:30,890
I'm also curious.

780
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,890
Did someone do something again?

781
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,410
I don't know either.

782
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,490
What's happening?

783
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,100
I have something important to inform you of.

784
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,600
Maki, stand up.

785
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,980
Yes, Master Amin.

786
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,279
From today until your graduation,

787
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:35,380
I appoint Maki as GEN6 Class President at Home School.

788
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,290
(DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO)

789
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,399
Who will be allowed to go home?

790
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,849
It depends on everyone's decision.

791
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:24,600
Your votes will determine the result.

792
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,769
Since all of us want to go home,

793
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,009
how should we vote, Maki?

794
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,400
Headmaster,

795
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,700
I think you must void this vote result.

796
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,419
You guys know nothing.

797
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,609
Pheng is bullshitting.

798
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,020
I didn't do such a thing!

799
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,319
Stop being crazy already!

800
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,020
You're bullshitting!

801
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,400
Fuji, stop!
