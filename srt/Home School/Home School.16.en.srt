1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:01,330
Master Praeporn,

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,330
are you betraying Home School?

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,180
Master.

4
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:04,790
Run.

5
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,000
No matter what happens,

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,510
you must protect every Home School student.

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,040
Can you promise me?

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,650
Yes.

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,100
Master.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,890
Master.

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,940
Master.

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,840
Master.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,970
I’m sorry.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,830
I’m sorry.

15
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,160
Oh, Master.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
You shouldn’t have to die at the hands of your favorite student.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,220
You should’ve lived longer.

18
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,940
This was your plan.

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,940
You did this on purpose.

20
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,560
Me?

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,100
Do I look like someone with a plan to do something like that?

22
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,660
You think I did this on purpose?

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,470
You chose that serum for her yourself.

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,120
You’re the one who killed Master Praeporn.

25
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,910
Remember this, Run.

26
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,480
Every choice and every action has consequences.

27
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,120
And this is the consequence of disobeying my order.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
You can’t force me.

29
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,650
At least today,

30
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,890
I could force you to kill someone in front of your own eyes.

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,330
No war is without blood on your hands.

32
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,130
If you want to beat me, you must use violence.

33
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,710
Now that you’ve killed once,

34
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,270
it’ll be easier the second time.

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,770
Please, Run.

36
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,440
Please avenge Master Praeporn.

37
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,020
Please, Run.

38
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
I won’t fall for your trick, Master.

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Please, Run.

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,070
This is your chance.

41
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,070
Avenge Master Praeporn.

42
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,730
I’m a bad guy.

43
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,000
You must get rid of me

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,720
so bad things won’t happen.

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,860
Please, Run!

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,560
No!

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,040
I will never give you what you want.

48
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,830
I will protect all the kids.

49
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,330
You? Protecting the kids?

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,320
I will protect everyone

51
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,740
from turning into a monster like you, Master Prasath.

52
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,500
I guess it’s too late, Run.

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,620
I’ve already created the new monsters.

54
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,480
It’s alright, Pheng.

55
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,150
I believe that Pennhung will be okay.

56
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,760
Master Phoban, how is Pennhung?

57
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,280
Mr. Pennhung is out of danger.

58
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,070
He’s getting treated in the infirmary.

59
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,550
Master Champ is taking care of him.

60
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,790
Master Phoban, you’ve been taking care of us all this time.

61
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,990
Can you help us escape?

62
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,920
I can’t do that.

63
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,340
But you’ve seen what happened to Pennhung.

64
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,240
Are you going to wait until bad things happen again?

65
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,810
Don’t you have a conscience at all?

66
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,630
Everything that happened was necessary.

67
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,450
I want you all to believe in Home School

68
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,210
like the other Masters and I do.

69
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:55,480
Do you know that Master Amin has been hypnotized by Master Prasath?

70
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,620
That’s Master Amin’s wish.

71
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,320
Wish?

72
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,700
What do you mean?

73
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,010
Master Amin is sick

74
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,520
and that caused him to become emotionally unstable.

75
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,270
Hypnotizing makes him better.

76
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,590
But does Master Amin really want people to die?

77
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,810
Are killing people and using violence really what Home School wants?

78
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,790
Master Phoban,

79
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,340
please help us.

80
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,590
Help Master Praeporn.

81
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,410
We don’t know how she’s doing right now.

82
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,940
Mr. Run will probably be back soon.

83
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Oh, Master Praeporn.

84
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
You shouldn’t have betrayed Home School.

85
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,290
What are you talking about, Master Phoban?

86
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,290
What happened to Master Praeporn?

87
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,390
Run, is Master Praeporn okay?

88
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,420
I’m so sorry to tell you that

89
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,210
the serum Run took was actually poison.

90
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,070
Master Praeporn is dead.

91
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,330
That can’t be true.

92
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,630
You’re lying to us, right?

93
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,670
Ask your senior.

94
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,650
Master Praeporn died under his hands.

95
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,620
I don’t want to be here anymore.

96
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,020
Please let me go.

97
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,690
This is getting too much.

98
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,410
No.

99
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,740
You guys can’t go anymore.

100
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,340
You must stay here!

101
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,080
Nai!

102
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,960
Don’t!

103
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,890
Nai!

104
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,310
Get yourself together!

105
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,210
Nai, stop!

106
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,940
You’re a murderer and a psychopath!

107
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,910
Is this so funny to you?

108
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,730
Get yourself together, Nai.

109
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,720
Calm down!

110
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,900
You hate me so much?

111
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,560
Is this the best you can do?

112
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,870
Please keep it coming.

113
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,550
This is your chance.

114
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,000
Keep it coming.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,530
Get yourself together!

116
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,400
Nai!

117
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,770
Calm down!

118
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,440
Nai, don’t play his twisted game.

119
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,260
The angrier you are, the more he wins.

120
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,610
Don’t turn into a monster like him.

121
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,180
Why?

122
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,560
Why are you guys such good people? Hmm?

123
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,840
Let’s go, guys.

124
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,060
Bye.

125
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,340
Hey!

126
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,730
You wanted to see us.

127
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,730
Is something the matter, Master Prasath?

128
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,400
Do you two still believe in Home School?

129
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,490
Of course, I do.

130
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,140
I believe in Home School.

131
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,420
And how do you feel about Master Praeporn’s death?

132
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,000
Master Praeporn betrayed Home School

133
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,650
and tried to jeopardize our project.

134
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,850
We had no choice but to stop her.

135
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,400
How about you, Master Phoban?

136
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,000
You looked sad when you found out she didn’t make it.

137
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,170
I never thought we’d have to lose a team member like that

138
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,590
and I’m sad that she betrayed Home School.

139
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,920
What would you do if someone else betrayed Home School?

140
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,920
I would handle them.

141
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,180
I would never let anyone get in the way of Master Amin’s

142
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,180
and Home School’s ideology.

143
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,870
Okay.

144
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,810
Both of you must get Mek, Mork, Master Dilak, and Headmaster

145
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,810
back to Home School.

146
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,610
Very well.

147
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,080
Hey.

148
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,370
Let me see.

149
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,600
Hmm?

150
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,120
My sister has grown up so much.

151
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:51,550
Has it been really tough?

152
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,830
I’m sorry for leaving you alone.

153
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,830
It’s totally fine, Run.

154
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,630
We’re together now.

155
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:41,830
But can you promise me that

156
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,530
from now on,

157
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,310
we won’t separate from each other again?

158
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,590
Yeah.

159
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,790
I promise.

160
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,000
By the way, what should I call you?

161
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,480
Rin or Maki?

162
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,100
Maki.

163
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Because you gave me that name.

164
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,850
Maki,

165
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,620
we must stop Master Prasath

166
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,980
or bad things will happen again.

167
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,590
What’s he doing with Project R?

168
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,500
I don’t know

169
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,170
but I guess someone will die.

170
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:14,310
Someone he wants to die like our dad.

171
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,540
Did Master Prasath kill Dad?

172
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,330
Dad was hypnotized to shoot himself.

173
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,700
Master Prasath was behind everything,

174
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,650
including what’s happened to Master Amin.

175
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,920
I’ve always thought that you did it for me

176
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,660
and felt so guilty about Dad.

177
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,920
Maki, if we fight violence with violence,

178
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,000
in the end, we’ll turn into monsters.

179
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,910
Master Amin taught me that.

180
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,570
How should we help Master Amin?

181
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,640
If he was here, I’m sure he’d be able to stop Master Prasath.

182
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,490
Oh, Praeporn.

183
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,200
I promise I will protect the kids like you wanted.

184
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,460
What should we do now, Headmaster?

185
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,900
We must stop Master Prasath.

186
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,800
Huh?

187
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,760
What did you say?

188
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,400
How are you going to stop me, Headmaster?

189
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,590
Huh?

190
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,660
I will do whatever it takes

191
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,290
even at the cost of my life.

192
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,810
Wow.

193
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,990
Awesome.

194
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,780
That’s our Headmaster.

195
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,050
You need to fight violence with violence.

196
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,510
If you stick with peaceful ways,

197
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,160
you’ll get taken advantage of by bad guys.

198
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,310
Peace is not the answer.

199
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,370
Oh, but first,

200
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,050
I must invite Master Dilak to get her attitude adjusted.

201
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,690
Move.

202
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,260
Master Champ!

203
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,140
Master Phoban! What are you doing?

204
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,850
Don’t move.

205
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:56,050
I knew that when you freaked out and ran to the forest,

206
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,900
someone helped you.

207
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,620
I saw the footprints

208
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,740
of our martyr Master Praeporn.

209
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,840
Go.

210
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:15,930
No.

211
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,370
Headmaster!

212
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,010
Headmaster!

213
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,670
Quiet!

214
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,520
Headmaster!

215
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,690
I know you and Master Dilak are thinking of destroying Home School.

216
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,900
I’m not going to destroy Home School.

217
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,600
I’m going to destroy you, Master Prasath.

218
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,850
That sounds scary,

219
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,860
but I think you should be scared of me.

220
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,540
What are you going to do to me, huh?

221
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,870
You can’t change me, Prasath.

222
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,340
The pills don’t work on me.

223
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,010
I don’t need to use any pills with you, Headmaster.

224
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Let’s make a deal, shall we?

225
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,410
I’m sure you won’t be able to say no.

226
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,490
I’m about to let monsters out.

227
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,780
I need someone to take care of them.

228
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,910
That’s where you come in.

229
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,130
What if I don’t do it?

230
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,470
Well, then I might have to kill Master Dilak and all the kids.

231
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,310
What do you mean by weird, Mek, Mork?

232
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,310
They came to visit us and acted weird.

233
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,200
But isn’t it normal for friends to visit friends?

234
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,400
You were sleeping, so you didn’t see what we saw.

235
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,870
Listen, Pennhung.

236
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,200
Out of the blue, Fuji said this to me.

237
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,120
“How are you, my dear Mek and Mork? Are you guys feeling better?”

238
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,310
Think about it.

239
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,610
When did Fuji ever speak like that?

240
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,500
And Jingjai was unusually nice.

241
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
She helped me with everything.

242
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,410
She almost fed me the medicine.

243
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,620
And Biw suddenly were strict about rules.

244
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,870
She acted like she was a soldier.

245
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,570
You know who was the scariest?

246
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
Jean and Hugo.

247
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,150
What did Jean and Hugo do?

248
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,960
Those two stared at us without blinking.

249
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,140
They didn’t speak, smile,

250
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,700
or do anything.

251
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,370
Besides, their eyes didn’t look like the eyes of Hugo and Jean we know.

252
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,400
It’s so scary.

253
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,230
That really sounds scary.

254
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,030
That doesn't sound like the friends Pennhung knows.

255
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,030
What’s wrong with all of them?

256
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,200
Right?

257
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,470
Why are there only four food trays?

258
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,470
There are seven of us.

259
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,080
Where are Nai and Tibet?

260
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,960
Master Phoban called them over early this morning.

261
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,690
Do you know where Pheng is, White?

262
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,610
She went to the toilet.

263
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,830
She’ll probably be here soon.

264
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,620
Where did that water dispenser come from?

265
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,500
It wasn’t here yesterday.

266
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,740
Why is it here?

267
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,690
Master Prasath wants all Home School students to drink clean water,

268
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,790
Ms. White.

269
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,000
Biw.

270
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,030
Hugo.

271
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,190
Jingjai.

272
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,190
Since when did you guys come back?

273
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,940
Now, now, Ms. White.

274
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,180
A girl shouldn’t be rude.

275
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,090
Huh?

276
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,730
Master Prasath created a new rule

277
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,750
that only allows us to drink from this dispenser.

278
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,130
If anyone wants to drink, please queue up.

279
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,720
Your turn, Mr. Hugo.

280
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,490
Thank you, Ms. Jingjai.

281
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,050
Please drink a lot of water.

282
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,450
Water is good for your body.

283
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,300
Maki, were the three of them always like this?

284
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,330
No.

285
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,320
They were not like this.

286
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,670
I don’t know what happened.

287
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:40,810
Do you know why humans are the most successful species in the world,

288
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,090
even though 70,000 years ago,

289
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,570
our ancestors were just ordinary animals

290
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,370
and nothing about them stood out?

291
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,940
What’s wrong with you, Hugo?

292
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,100
The answer is

293
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,300
because humans have evolved.

294
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:05,350
Humans improve, correct, and change all the time.

295
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,950
That’s why we’re the most successful species.

296
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,400
Aren’t you guys thirsty?

297
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,960
Why haven't any of you drunk the water?

298
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,660
You must be so thirsty.

299
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,880
Please come and get your water.

300
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,070
Oh.

301
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,020
Do we need to ask for permission to eat

302
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,310
or can we just eat?

303
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,780
You can just eat.

304
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,750
We’ve prepared the food for you.

305
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Let me get you water.

306
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Enjoy your meal.

307
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,030
Biw, you’re back.

308
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,320
How have you been?

309
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I’ve been so worried about you.

310
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,530
Hello, Pheng.

311
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,250
You’re okay, right?

312
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,260
I’m okay.

313
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,670
I have to go.

314
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,170
Where are you going?

315
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,930
Master Prasath asked me to put something in the courtyard.

316
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,540
Let me help.

317
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,500
No.

318
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,060
I can carry it myself.

319
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,120
What’s going on?

320
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,090
Hello, Headmaster.

321
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,710
Master Prasath asked me to put something in the courtyard.

322
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,440
Then hurry.

323
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,320
Okay.

324
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,420
Go now.

325
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,260
Headmaster,

326
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
what’s wrong with Biw?

327
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,130
Pheng, from now on, don’t be alone,

328
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,460
and you can’t be alone with Hugo, Jingjai, Fuji, Jean, or Biw.

329
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,880
What happened?

330
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,880
Don’t worry.

331
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
I’ll take care of you all.

332
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,370
Headmaster told you not to be alone with them.

333
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,900
Did she tell you why?

334
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,950
No, she didn’t.

335
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,290
She only said that she would take care of us.

336
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,970
Run, can we trust the Headmaster?

337
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,250
Yeah.

338
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,250
She may be strict with the kids,

339
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,460
but she loves all of them.

340
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,330
But now I’m worried about Nai and Tibet.

341
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,370
Master Phoban took them away for some time already.

342
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,190
Who knows what’s going to happen?

343
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Shall we search for them?

344
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,290
Good idea.

345
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:44,010
I’m worried they’ll come back like Biw and the others.

346
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,700
I don’t think you should go.

347
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,360
It’s too late.

348
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,810
What do you mean?

349
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,480
Master Prasath has probably made a move.

350
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,730
Those two are his next target.

351
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,630
Peekaboo, kids!

352
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,470
Were you gossiping about me?

353
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,170
Where are Tibet and Nai?

354
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,700
I don’t know.

355
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,050
You’re lying.

356
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,540
What have you done to them?

357
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,730
If something happens to them, I won’t stand for it.

358
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,230
White.

359
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,840
White.

360
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,260
Calm down.

361
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,730
How can you calm down, Maki?

362
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,800
You see that when they disappear,

363
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,520
they don’t come back the same.

364
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,980
Are you okay with that?

365
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,370
Don’t worry.

366
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,575
Someone like Master Prasath wouldn’t come up

367
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,293
with something so easy to guess.

368
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,710
Don’t follow his game.

369
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,660
I’m so touched by your sibling bond.

370
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,890
Every time I see it, it almost makes me cry.

371
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,460
Stop talking like that.

372
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,810
It’s fake.

373
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,110
How is it fake?

374
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,790
I’m not fake.

375
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,390
Run, Maki,

376
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,250
I’ve been rooting and waiting for you two to reunite.

377
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,320
Do you remember the first day you came to Home School

378
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,860
and walked into the forest to search for your friends?

379
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,680
Your friend heard someone’s scream.

380
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,620
Run.

381
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,500
Run.

382
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,240
Come on. Get up.

383
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,260
Get up.

384
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,700
Let’s make a sound, shall we?

385
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,010
What are you doing?

386
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,230
Your nails look a little long.

387
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,600
Louder.

388
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,380
Make it louder.

389
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,630
If you’d followed the sound to the forbidden area in the forest,

390
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,390
you would’ve found your brother.

391
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,910
Shall I cut your nails again, Run?

392
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,900
Maki.

393
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Maki. Hang in there.

394
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,920
Run, he’s such a psycho.

395
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,420
Why are you putting up with him?

396
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,980
Hang in there, Maki.

397
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,040
He’s messing with our heads

398
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,460
to make us follow his game.

399
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,070
Don’t play his game.

400
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,070
This is no fun.

401
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,530
That’s a gun sound.

402
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,090
What are you doing, Master?

403
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,030
Did someone get shot?

404
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:28,860
Actually, it’s just a part of Project R.

405
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,190
Bang! Bang!

406
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,190
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

407
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,540
That’s a gun sound.

408
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,540
It came from Home School.

409
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,300
Is something going on there, Master Phoban?

410
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,930
Nothing.

411
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,110
But that was a gun sound.

412
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,110
Something must be going on.

413
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,570
Please tell us

414
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,090
or we’ll go back to Home School.

415
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:49,710
I’m afraid that will put your friends and the others in danger.

416
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,480
Danger?

417
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,650
What exactly is Master Prasath trying to do?

418
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,100
And why did you bring us into the forest?

419
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,200
Can you please tell us?

420
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,720
What’s going on?

421
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,330
Everything is happening according to Project R.

422
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,610
Mr. Tibet and Mr. Nai,

423
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,090
you’re keys to the plan.

424
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,170
Keys?

425
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,620
How?

426
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,070
What exactly is Project R?

427
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,710
I can’t tell you

428
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,640
until you go to the treatment room.

429
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,430
You two will understand it then.

430
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,450
Let me repeat

431
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,470
that if you don’t follow the order, your friends will be in danger.

432
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,660
You wouldn’t want Ms. White and Ms. Maki to be in danger, would you?

433
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,920
Pennhung.

434
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,380
Pennhung.

435
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,640
Pennhung.

436
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,900
Get up.

437
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,970
Hey.

438
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,970
Let’s go get something to eat.

439
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,610
You want to eat now?

440
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,310
Yes, now.

441
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,290
I’m hungry.

442
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,320
What about Mek?

443
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,610
You two always sneak around to steal Pennhung’s croissants.

444
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,320
Oops.

445
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,690
Look at him.

446
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,190
He’s sleeping like a log.

447
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,820
Very good.

448
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,370
Let’s go.

449
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,270
Yes, Master.

450
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,270
Is Mek alright, Mork?

451
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,260
Be careful in the dark, Pennhung.

452
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,040
Yes.

453
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,450
Hey, Pennhung.

454
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,340
Yes?

455
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,970
I think we should ask the Masters to increase the food portion.

456
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,850
We’re growing.

457
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,390
We need complete nutrition.

458
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,690
What do you say?

459
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,760
Pennhung agrees.

460
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,140
Who’s that?

461
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Is that Jingjai?

462
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,890
Jingjai? What are you doing here?

463
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,210
Why are you carrying a knife?

464
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,210
Does your neck hurt, Jingjai?

465
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Seriously, Pennhung?

466
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,020
You guys broke the rules.

467
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,560
Do you know what the punishment for those who break the rules is?

468
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,120
Jingjai?

469
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,160
What’s wrong with you?

470
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,090
Hey.

471
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,670
Why are you coming closer?

472
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,890
You’re scaring Pennhung.

473
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,600
Hey.

474
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,130
People who break the rules must be punished

475
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,630
so they learn.

476
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,500
Hey.

477
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:58,970
Pennhung.

478
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,360
Jingjai.

479
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,980
Run!

480
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,220
Hey!

481
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,540
People who break the rules must be punished.

482
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,010
Hey!

483
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,080
Pennhung, wait!

484
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,030
Mork.

485
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,660
Mork.

486
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,300
Pennhung, what are we doing in this room?

487
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,000
Pennhung is scared to go to the infirmary.

488
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Pennhung doesn’t want Mek to become another target.

489
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,310
Oh god.

490
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,580
Why do you have to be a good person right now?

491
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,000
Let’s go.

492
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,910
Shit.

493
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,100
Jingjai is here.

494
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,180
Jingjai?

495
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,220
Jingjai.

496
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,110
Find a place to hide now.

497
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,490
She’s not going to see us in the dark.

498
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,430
A place to hide.

499
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,250
Go there.

500
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,330
Okay.

501
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,950
Are you hiding in here, kids?

502
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,970
Mork.

503
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,240
Pennhung.

504
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,520
Come out and let me punish you.

505
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,980
I know you guys are here.

506
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,530
Mork.

507
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,880
Pennhung.

508
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,700
Mork.

509
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,310
Come out.

510
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,800
(Oh, shit!)

511
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,700
What are you going to do, Pennhung?

512
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,960
Nothing.

513
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,500
Pennhung,

514
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,060
you did wrong.

515
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,060
You must be punished.

516
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,370
Pennhung apologizes.

517
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,200
People who do wrong must be punished.

518
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,160
No!

519
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,160
Jingjai!

520
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,470
Jingjai!

521
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,470
Pennhung!

522
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,360
We did it!

523
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,050
Yay!

524
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,460
Ouch!

525
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,100
Jingjai.

526
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,700
People who do wrong must be punished.

527
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,200
Pennhung.

528
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,970
People who do wrong must be punished.

529
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:50,620
Do you understand?

530
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,940
- Jingjai, I can’t breathe. - Do you understand?

531
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,320
- People who do wrong must be punished. - Jingjai, stop!

532
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,560
Let go!

533
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,740
Pennhung!

534
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,040
People who break the rules must be punished.

535
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,070
Do you understand?

536
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,070
People who break the rules must be punished.

537
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,600
Help me.

538
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,060
People who break the rules must be punished.

539
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:40,550
What happened to Jingjai was a side effect of the medicine.

540
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,450
It made her unable to control her behaviors and emotions.

541
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,380
If she doesn’t get the medicine on time or misses it for too long,

542
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,300
she will go mad.

543
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,950
The longer we let this continue,

544
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,560
the more violent she will get.

545
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,380
She may hurt other people

546
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,710
and end up killing them.

547
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:13,680
Does this mean the medicine is not working?

548
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,150
It doesn’t make us feel better.

549
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,420
Rather, it turns us into monsters.

550
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:26,120
This was why Master Praeporn tried to stop the use of the medicine.

551
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,380
Then why don’t you stop Master Prasath?

552
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,990
Why do you still let that crazy man stay in Home School?

553
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,150
If I do that,

554
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,140
Master Prasath will probably kill you all.

555
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,950
My first priority right now is to protect the lives of every GEN6 student.

556
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,770
Are we really going to leave Home School like this?

557
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,000
Can no one help us?

558
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,270
Right?

559
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,550
Won’t a hero come and save us?

560
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,140
There’s someone who may be able to help us

561
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,880
if they can turn the tables on Master Prasath.

562
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,900
That person might be the hero you ask for.

563
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,530
How much longer are you going to make me and my sister stand here?

564
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,100
Run,

565
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,950
I’ve been very kind to you.

566
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,950
I didn’t lock you up.

567
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,720
I allowed you to be with your sister

568
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,240
and gave you a chance to plot,

569
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,710
but I haven’t seen you two do anything.

570
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,520
Honestly, I’m very disappointed.

571
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,220
I thought you two would come up with something fun to play with me.

572
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,420
You’re so much crazier than I thought, Master.

573
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,600
But seriously,

574
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,720
don’t you have any plans to fight me?

575
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,950
If I told you, it wouldn’t be fun.

576
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,840
I’m excited to hear that.

577
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,700
I can hardly wait for you to see 	the result of my experiment.

578
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,160
It can be considered a masterpiece.

579
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,370
What if it fails?

580
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,000
You’ll find out soon.

581
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,820
Project R has started.

582
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,160
It’s time for revenge, Run.

583
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,290
Hey!

584
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,150
What’s this?

585
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,980
Let me go right now!

586
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,340
Hey, wake up!

587
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,410
Wake up!

588
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,050
Hey!'

589
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,280
What’s going on?

590
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,890
Hey!

591
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,890
What the hell is this?

592
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:16,970
Hey!

593
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,490
Who did this?

594
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,490
Help!

595
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,620
Somebody help!

596
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,620
Does anyone remember anything?

597
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,680
I don’t know.

598
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,390
I don’t remember anything.

599
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,630
Hey!

600
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,920
Let me go!

601
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,880
Can anyone hear me?

602
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,040
Let me go!

603
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,590
Don’t make a scene, kids,

604
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,600
or you’ll be punished.

605
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,790
Hey!

606
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,380
Was this your doing?

607
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,660
Huh?

608
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,660
It was you, wasn’t it?

609
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,210
Don’t you know who I am?

610
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,790
I donated money to this school.

611
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,700
Yes!

612
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,590
We’re the owners of the money that funds Home School.

613
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,280
How could you do this to us?

614
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,180
Let us go!

615
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,700
Or we’ll cancel all the donations.

616
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,770
Home School will not get a single baht from us.

617
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:25,710
Let us go!

618
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,140
Shh! Don’t be scared.

619
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,320
You know what, kids?

620
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,090
Your money is worthless right now.

621
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,830
You know why?

622
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,120
Because you’re all going to die.

623
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,140
Hey!

624
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,360
What the hell are you talking about?

625
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,040
Let us go!

626
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,620
What the hell are you talking about?

627
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,330
Do you know what connections I have?

628
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:52,360
Let us go!

629
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,180
Freaking let us go!

630
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,880
Can anyone hear us?

631
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Let us go!

632
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,800
Let me go!

633
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:08,530
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

634
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,500
We’re getting our revenge.

635
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
It will be the most fun day.

636
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,110
Welcome to the ice-breaking activity.

637
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,790
This game is called Revenge.

638
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,660
You guys have 99 seconds.

639
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,620
Once I finish counting,

640
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,960
the kids will start hunting for you.

641
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,370
How are we going to fight Master Prasath?

642
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,710
Leave that to me and Run.

643
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,180
How are we going to get them back to their old selves?

644
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,660
Only one person knows how.

645
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,260
Master Amin.
