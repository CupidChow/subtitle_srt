1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:02,702
Do you hear something?

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,769
You must run away today, Run.

3
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,039
There you are, Run.

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,829
I’ve been waiting for you.

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,419
Master,

6
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,179
when did you successfully hypnotize Master Amin?

7
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,589
Or was it since you knew Master Amin was sick?

8
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,119
Great job, Run.

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,059
Your answer is correct.

10
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,359
Finally, you’ve learned the truth.

11
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:45,189
All this time, I have tried imagining your facial expression

12
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,849
the moment you’ve found out the truth.

13
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,169
Now that I got to see it for real,

14
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:53,019
I’m feeling on top of the world, Run.

15
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,729
How could you betray Master Amin like this?

16
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,099
Me? Betraying Master Amin?

17
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,239
Who said that?

18
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:18,229
Master Amin wants Home School to turn students into new people

19
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:22,729
and create kids who can change our society.

20
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,139
I, as one of Home School Masters,

21
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:29,989
also want to make it successful,

22
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:34,399
so I’m adjusting the plan that hinders Master Amin’s success

23
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:35,709
a bit.

24
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,389
That’s it, Run.

25
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:41,079
That’s not what Master Amin wants.

26
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,789
Run,

27
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:50,289
no war is without violence.

28
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,089
This is natural in the society of disgusting humans like us.

29
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:58,529
If you want to win,

30
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,059
you must fight.

31
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:01,519
If you want to succeed,

32
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,089
you must sacrifice.

33
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,069
If you want to change,

34
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:09,719
you must trade your blood for it,

35
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,699
just like how your adoptive dad’s life was traded for Home School.

36
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:29,239
So this was your idea, wasn’t it?

37
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,379
You wanted me to kill Dad.

38
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:43,439
Do you want to know the whole truth, Run?

39
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,729
It’s the truth that will change

40
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,709
how you see Master Amin forever.

41
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:31,739
Hey.

42
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:34,959
Amin.

43
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,029
I asked for you today

44
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,029
because I want to talk about Home School.

45
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:43,119
What’s the matter?

46
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,579
I want a bigger profit.

47
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,149
Can you accept more than 13 students?

48
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,599
I’m really in the red this year.

49
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,939
Run is also studying there.

50
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,559
We wasted one student quota

51
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,869
without getting anything in return.

52
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:03,299
But our curriculum has been designed for only 13 students

53
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:04,829
to make it effective.

54
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:09,699
Just hire more Masters.

55
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:10,649
That’s easy, isn’t it?

56
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,649
Hire more of them.

57
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,089
If we can accept more than 100 students each year,

58
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,609
just think about how much money we will earn.

59
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,759
It’s probably not as easy as you think, Mr. Bodin.

60
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,149
I don’t care.

61
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,769
You promised me you’d make me richer than before.

62
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,339
I want more money.

63
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:35,929
If you can’t do that,

64
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,769
I’ll close down Home School.

65
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,079
(Run, do you know that)

66
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:56,419
(Master Amin’s serious illness started because of Bodin,)

67
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,879
(your adoptive dad,)

68
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,889
(who cared about nothing but money?)

69
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,029
Sure.

70
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,989
I will take your words into consideration

71
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:13,349
and rethink about it.

72
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,299
There you go.

73
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,299
That’s how it should be.

74
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,399
If you don’t have any other business to discuss with me,

75
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,779
please excuse me for now.

76
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,069
Master Prasath and Master Puth are waiting for me.

77
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:31,839
Hey!

78
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,789
Amin!

79
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:33,509
Hey!

80
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:34,679
Master Amin, what’s wrong?

81
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,429
What are you waiting for?

82
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,329
Take him to the hospital,

83
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,119
or else he could die.

84
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,839
- Master Amin, carefully get up. - Be careful.

85
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,109
Master Amin.

86
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,909
(And when death approaches out of the blue,)

87
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:54,839
(nobody can accept it,)

88
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,199
(even someone like Master Amin.)

89
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:01,209
Why?

90
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:04,029
Why?!

91
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,169
Why does it have to be me?

92
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,619
I’ve been helping every kid.

93
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:16,149
But why does God want me to die?

94
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,479
God doesn’t want me to help the kids anymore, right?

95
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,369
Huh?

96
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,779
Why?

97
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:30,249
And why has an asshole like Bodin been provided with everything?

98
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,669
This world is unfair.

99
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,299
It’s damn unfair!

100
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,039
Master Amin,

101
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:47,379
what’s going on?

102
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,289
Nothing.

103
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,409
Nothing is.

104
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,099
It’s just that

105
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,419
I’m nearly dead.

106
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:03,729
I will no longer be here at Home School

107
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,899
I founded on my very own.

108
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,579
Please calm down, Master Amin.

109
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,429
You can be cured.

110
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:14,789
But how many more years can I live for?

111
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,679
I’ll end up dying anyway!

112
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,009
Please keep your voice down.

113
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,749
If our students hear you,

114
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:23,089
they will be in shock.

115
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,029
You don’t want Run to see you looking like this, do you?

116
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,509
Run.

117
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:33,939
Run.

118
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,189
You’re right.

119
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:39,269
Run.

120
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,639
Never let Run find out about this.

121
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:50,439
Run has been hurt enough.

122
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:57,899
I don’t want him to be sad because of me.

123
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:02,399
You guys must be disappointed in me.

124
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:05,369
I’m not.

125
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,479
I’m never disappointed in you.

126
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,859
Thanks

127
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,859
for believing in me.

128
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:26,289
But I can’t continue being like this.

129
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:31,009
What are you planning to do?

130
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,039
You two must cure me.

131
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,039
What do you mean?

132
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,239
I’m saying

133
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,019
you must give me the jelly to cure me.

134
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,399
As for you,

135
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
you must hypnotize me

136
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,539
to turn me back into the same person

137
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,709
or change me into a better person.

138
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,839
But I’m afraid this is not necessary for now.

139
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,759
What’s most important is to make you recover from the disease.

140
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,779
I know,

141
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,569
but because of my mental condition now,

142
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:20,239
I can’t control anything.

143
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:27,289
It will take long for me to fully recover,

144
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:30,179
and I don’t have that much time.

145
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,569
I must secure Home School.

146
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,119
(Master Amin ordered me to hypnotize him.)

147
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:43,419
(It’s what he wanted.)

148
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,359
(I didn’t force him at all.)

149
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:47,979
Sure.

150
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,289
I’ll cure you the best I can.

151
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,699
You’d better receive the treatment at the hospital, Master Amin.

152
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,739
Don’t worry about that, Headmaster.

153
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,119
I’ll take care of myself the best I can.

154
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,829
But I’m most concerned about Home School students.

155
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:19,449
I think all of us should intensify our curriculum.

156
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,319
But won’t that be too harsh for the kids?

157
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,739
They aren’t ready for the treatment yet.

158
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:26,759
She’s right.

159
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,309
But the new medicine is still being tested.

160
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:31,599
But Master Puth confirmed that

161
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:34,089
the new medicine is effective.

162
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:36,519
What you said is right, Master Amin.

163
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:41,059
But I think the treatment process should be gradually carried out.

164
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,169
We can’t wait.

165
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,159
These kids are severely hurt by their own families.

166
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,149
We must help them to prevent them from getting hurt again.

167
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,109
I told you to befriend that boy Zero.

168
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,269
Why didn’t you do so?

169
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,039
Dad, Zero loathes me.

170
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,349
No matter how much I try to befriend him,

171
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:08,609
he won’t be friends with me.

172
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:09,499
Come on.

173
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,029
It takes time.

174
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,609
Hey, having a good friend will be an advantage for you.

175
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,839
But Zero sees me as his rival.

176
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,039
I guess that won’t do me any benefits.

177
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,139
Listen to me.

178
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,809
A good friend is someone who builds a connection for you.

179
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:35,089
Friendship can be bought with money and benefits.

180
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,489
If you can benefit him in some ways,

181
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,489
he’ll surely be friends with you.

182
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,879
Run.

183
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,679
Run, I haven’t finished that.

184
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,679
How could you walk away from me?

185
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,119
Run!

186
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,399
Come back here!

187
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,929
I think it’s Mr. Bodin

188
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:06,719
who obstructs your ideology.

189
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,769
Bodin only cares about money.

190
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:16,539
He wants Home School to accept more students to earn profits.

191
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,389
That’s right.

192
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,629
Mr. Bodin is a businessman.

193
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,169
He won’t care about what we’re doing.

194
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,209
That’s a regret.

195
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,219
I guess I will die before Bodin does.

196
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,059
Master Amin,

197
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:40,759
just make Mr. Bodin’s life shorter than yours.

198
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:44,609
What do you mean?

199
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:49,389
Without Mr. Bodin,

200
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:53,359
you will be the sole owner of Home School.

201
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,269
You can change Home School.

202
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,619
But that’s against my principle.

203
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,739
Getting back at violence by using violence will turn us into a beast.

204
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,259
But if we don’t kill the beast,

205
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,649
we ourselves will end up dying, Master Amin.

206
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:18,479
You want Home School students to get back at their parents.

207
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:24,619
Making them kill their parents is the best way to take revenge.

208
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,149
Are you saying

209
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,919
we should make Run kill Bodin by himself?

210
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:36,299
Isn’t that a good idea, Master Amin?

211
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,649
Run has been hurt by Mr. Bodin all this time,

212
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,379
not to mention how he treated Run’s sister.

213
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:44,379
Run will never do that.

214
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,379
Run strongly believes in you, Master Amin.

215
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,009
Master Prasath,

216
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:59,699
I’ll never ruin my own ideology.

217
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,549
Master Amin, you don’t have to do anything

218
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,859
because I’ll change it for you.

219
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,589
It’s such a regret you didn’t agree to follow the order.

220
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:26,349
You should have killed Mr. Bodin by yourself.

221
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:29,469
I didn’t follow your order,

222
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:32,829
so why didn’t you kill me?

223
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,959
Why did you lock me up?

224
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:34,979
Run.

225
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,149
Hey.

226
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,799
What did you just say?

227
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,799
Did you even think before saying that?

228
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,919
Whoa. I’m sad.

229
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,569
I never wanted to kill you at all, Run.

230
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,609
You must continue living.

231
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,139
You’re the challenge in my life.

232
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,699
Until I can finally change you,

233
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,729
you have no right to die or go anywhere.

234
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:04,819
You can never beat me, Master.

235
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,399
You can never hypnotize me.

236
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,589
But that’s not the only way for me to win, Run.

237
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,629
You’ve already forgotten that your sister is also here, right?

238
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,389
What are you planning, Master?

239
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,389
Stay away from my sister.

240
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,599
Your sister is part of Project R.

241
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:45,339
Go ahead, Run.

242
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,529
Kill me.

243
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:47,989
Kill me, Run.

244
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:50,029
Kill me in front of Master Amin.

245
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,339
You can do it, Run.

246
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,379
Believe me, Run.

247
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,229
Run!

248
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:01,989
Mek and Mork will be okay, right?

249
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,309
I don’t want them to get hurt.

250
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:08,089
Now, everything is getting worse.

251
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,439
Other friends are still missing.

252
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:15,429
I don’t know what else is going to happen.

253
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:18,389
Don’t overthink.

254
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:21,389
It’s still a relief we found Mek and Mork early.

255
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:22,469
That’s right.

256
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:23,789
If they perform stomach pumping for them on time

257
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:24,729
before their bodies absorb the toxin,

258
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:26,209
I think they should be fine.

259
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,639
If they couldn’t do that on time,

260
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:32,449
what will happen to Mek and Mork?

261
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,709
I went to take care of the kids for just a couple of days,

262
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,599
but such a big problem occurred?

263
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:48,699
Not yet.

264
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,349
His condition has gotten worse.

265
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,179
He has to take some rest for now.

266
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:55,849
What should we do now, Headmaster?

267
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,459
We must take Mek and Mork to the hospital.

268
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:02,759
Our infirmary doesn’t have the equipment needed for curing them.

269
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,309
Okay.

270
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:10,989
Let’s take them to the hospital.

271
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,179
I’ll take them there.

272
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:12,889
No.

273
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:14,839
You mustn’t go.

274
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:17,989
Dilak and I will take Mek and Mork to the hospital.

275
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:18,999
But…

276
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,989
You must take care of it here.

277
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,869
You still have an important task to complete.

278
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:26,859
Run must be in the treatment room now.

279
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,759
You must set him free to end this whole thing.

280
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:31,979
Yes.

281
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:42,979
You can do it.

282
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,189
Go ahead.

283
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:50,369
Kill me.

284
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,639
Just kill me, Run.

285
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,909
I’ll call this a success of my life.

286
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:55,669
Please, Run.

287
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,839
You can do it.

288
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,069
You can do it, Run.

289
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,659
You can do it, Run.

290
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:02,339
You can do it.

291
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,319
Believe me, Run.

292
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,149
Run.

293
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,399
What’s wrong, Run?

294
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:24,399
You must get back at violence by using violence, mustn’t you?

295
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,019
That’s the right thing.

296
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,209
Go the bed already.

297
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:52,749
Don’t worry about Mek and Mork.

298
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:58,369
Headmaster and Master Dilak can handle everything.

299
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,149
But you will keep us updated, right?

300
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,649
Sure.

301
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,999
Don’t worry, Pheng.

302
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,319
Hang on, Master.

303
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:15,239
Yes?

304
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,499
I picked up your knife.

305
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,179
When I met you,

306
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,019
where were you heading to?

307
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:41,569
You were going inside the forest, right?

308
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,649
What’s inside the forest?

309
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,179
Why did you have to bring a knife with you?

310
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,839
It’s my business.

311
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,169
Alright.

312
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:00,539
Please go to bed.

313
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,989
You’re acting suspicious.

314
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,789
You will find out about everything tomorrow.

315
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,879
Please trust me,

316
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,599
especially you, Maki.

317
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,319
I’ll protect you guys.

318
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:28,419
Go to bed.

319
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:48,419
Master Amin,

320
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:52,469
help me.

321
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:56,469
Please wake up.

322
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,469
Master Amin can’t hear you, Run.

323
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,839
He’s now going deep down, so deep,

324
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,509
into his subconscious.

325
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:14,259
If I don’t wake him up,

326
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:16,259
he won’t wake up.

327
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,649
Accept it already, Run.

328
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,439
Just follow Project R’s plan.

329
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,139
Then your sister and you can stay together.

330
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:49,079
I won’t!

331
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,369
My sister and I will quit Home School.

332
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,179
Ouch!

333
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:54,419
Who’s that?

334
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,089
It’s me, Master.

335
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:01,009
We’re in trouble now, Master.

336
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,259
Run already ran away.

337
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:20,929
Maki.

338
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,639
Why are you following me?

339
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:27,089
We’re worried about you.

340
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:27,789
Yes.

341
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,289
Let’s go together.

342
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:30,439
But it’s dangerous.

343
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,449
That’s why

344
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:32,689
we have to go together.

345
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:36,419
You guys are going too?

346
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,489
I’m actually very sleepy,

347
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,099
but Tibet is worried about you.

348
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:41,849
Hey.

349
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,829
But thank you so much.

350
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:47,829
Friends mustn’t leave each other behind.

351
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:49,819
Let’s hurry up,

352
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:51,689
or else we won’t catch Master Praeporn up.

353
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,329
Run!

354
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,069
Maki.

355
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:31,529
Run!

356
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:21,409
Maki, listen to me.

357
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:25,089
We must escape from Home School now.

358
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,299
Master Amin is being hypnotized by Master Prasath.

359
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:30,299
Something terrible is about to happen.

360
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:40,139
Let’s go.

361
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:41,529
Hurry up.

362
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,769
This is totally impressive.

363
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:06,999
The siblings who have been separated for six years finally reunite.

364
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:09,999
I’m almost crying.

365
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:13,349
Don’t worry.

366
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,859
I won’t hurt you.

367
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,309
I mean, I won’t do it now.

368
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,149
Master, you’re by yourself,

369
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:20,539
but many of us are together.

370
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,799
What should we be afraid of?

371
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,069
But I have this.

372
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,449
Just in case you think it’s fake.

373
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:43,649
But I have an option for you.

374
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,939
Let’s play a game.

375
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:52,979
If the A side shows,

376
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:56,489
one of you will be shot,

377
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:57,929
but if it’s B,

378
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:00,249
I’ll give you time to escape.

379
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,099
Wait.

380
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:03,759
How are these kids involved with this?

381
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,759
You just want me, don’t you?

382
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:07,339
Run.

383
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,659
These kids broke the rule.

384
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,279
They left their room at night,

385
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,959
so they must be punished, mustn’t they?

386
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,669
But do you have to go this far by shooting us?

387
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:15,769
Yes.

388
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:17,379
To get this into your head.

389
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:20,909
You’re seriously insane.

390
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,049
That’s what my name means.

391
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,309
Let’s flip the coin now.

392
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,099
Wow.

393
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,519
It’s B.

394
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,269
You have

395
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,099
ten, nine.

396
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:51,919
Run.

397
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,879
Eight.

398
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,939
Seven and a half.

399
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,009
It’s already seven.

400
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,119
Stop now.

401
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,119
All of you aren’t allowed to go anywhere.

402
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,119
You want another punch?

403
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,469
Ouch!

404
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:10,209
I warned you already that I’m being serious this time.

405
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,509
All of you aren’t allowed to run away.

406
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:19,839
Damn it.

407
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,449
You don’t have the pen used to hypnotize me with you, right?

408
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:23,769
Please give in,

409
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,769
so everyone won’t get hurt more.

410
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:54,319
Master Champ,

411
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,929
free the kids now.

412
00:29:56,489 --> 00:29:58,139
If you hurt them,

413
00:29:58,139 --> 00:29:59,879
I won’t set Master Phoban free.

414
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,929
Master Praeporn,

415
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:04,269
are you betraying Home School?

416
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:05,989
I’m not.

417
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:08,929
I’m protecting Home School.

418
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:13,859
Kids, run away.

419
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:38,869
All of you aren’t allowed to go anywhere,

420
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:46,349
or else Master Praeporn is saying hi to death.

421
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:57,549
Kids, run away.

422
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,009
I told you to run away!

423
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:04,209
Run away!

424
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:08,579
Kids, run away!

425
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,579
I said, run away!

426
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,869
Go!

427
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,479
Go now!

428
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:16,189
Go!

429
00:31:16,189 --> 00:31:17,559
I’m giving in.

430
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,359
Tonight will certainly last in my memory forever.

431
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:14,439
What exactly is the Master planning to do?

432
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,669
Why is he keeping us locked up like this?

433
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:20,279
Or is Master Prasath punishing us

434
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,829
by locking us up in here

435
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:24,189
and providing us with no food and water?

436
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,269
That’s not all he’s planning.

437
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:30,459
Master Prasath has a much crueler way to punish us.

438
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,599
I’m Tibet.

439
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,519
Tibet?

440
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:53,939
You’re Master Puth’s son.

441
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,119
Yes.

442
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,019
You were close with my dad, right?

443
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:19,499
Do you have any clue about what happened to my dad?

444
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:24,619
He didn’t commit suicide, right?

445
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:31,129
I don’t know either,

446
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:37,459
but I think it wasn’t suicide.

447
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,309
Good morning, kids.

448
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:57,099
Have you guys become closer already?

449
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:59,099
What exactly are you doing to us?

450
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,429
Kids these days keep nagging.

451
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:06,379
Set them free, Master.

452
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:09,249
Master Amin certainly won’t be satisfied with what you’re doing.

453
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:14,739
I’m afraid I can’t set you guys free.

454
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:16,609
You broke the rule,

455
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:18,999
so you must be punished.

456
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,409
Whatever the punishment is,

457
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,769
just go ahead, Master.

458
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:31,679
Fine.

459
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,389
But I’ll punish only one of you.

460
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,389
Punish me then, Master.

461
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:40,709
Run.

462
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,479
I won’t.

463
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,369
It’s boring.

464
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,459
It’s not fun.

465
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:48,379
So which way will you use, Master?

466
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,649
I’ll randomly pick one.

467
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:56,519
That’s the fairest way.

468
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,109
Eeny, meeny,

469
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,709
miny, moe.

470
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,799
Eeny, meeny,

471
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,499
miny, moe.

472
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:11,449
Eeny, meeny,

473
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:15,039
miny, moe.

474
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,329
Oh, I can’t remember it.

475
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,639
I’ll choose Pennhung then.

476
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,639
How could you say this is a random pick?

477
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,949
Don’t ask too much.

478
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,829
Get up.

479
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:24,769
Get up!

480
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:25,879
Pennhung won’t go!

481
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:27,019
- Get up! - Pennhung won’t go!

482
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,159
I said, get up!

483
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,349
Pennhung won’t go!

484
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,999
Get up!

485
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,079
I said, get up!

486
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,259
Pennhung won’t go!

487
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:34,019
Get up already!

488
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:36,389
Pennhung won’t go!

489
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,889
What the hell are you doing?!

490
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:49,379
Pennhung.

491
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:50,779
Pennhung.

492
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:52,139
Come.

493
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:53,269
Get up.

494
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:01,179
Great job, Pennhung.

495
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:03,759
This way.

496
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,759
Walk!

497
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:25,839
Ms. Pheng, please come with me.

498
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:30,779
Why did he choose Pheng?

499
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:32,779
What is Master Prasath going to do to Pheng?

500
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:34,579
I don’t know either.

501
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:37,219
Master Phoban, will you let Home School students be in danger?

502
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:39,219
Does Master Amin know about this?

503
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:41,339
I’m doing my duty.

504
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:43,789
Ms. Pheng, please follow me.

505
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:49,469
Pheng, don’t go.

506
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:55,689
Please follow me, Ms. Pheng.

507
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:00,219
Don’t go, Pheng.

508
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:16,289
It’s alright, White, Maki.

509
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:20,399
Let me go.

510
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:22,609
I’m not scared of Master Prasath.

511
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,168
Pheng.

512
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:32,178
This way, please.

513
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:35,068
Pheng.

514
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:39,598
Pheng.

515
00:37:41,238 --> 00:37:42,948
I told you not to go.

516
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,948
It’s alright.

517
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,188
Pheng.

518
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,938
It’s alright, Maki.

519
00:38:13,878 --> 00:38:18,688
One of you must inject this poison into your body.

520
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,428
Poison?

521
00:38:20,828 --> 00:38:23,438
Do you have to go this far?

522
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:25,318
Hey.

523
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:27,868
You should feel grateful that I’m not injecting you both.

524
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:29,328
Or do you both want to be injected?

525
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:30,378
I can bring it for you.

526
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:30,748
Do you want it?

527
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:31,868
No!

528
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,978
Pennhung will do it.

529
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:45,978
No, Pennhung.

530
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:47,978
You can’t do that.

531
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:51,428
Pennhung and Pheng,

532
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:53,078
you two must play a game with me.

533
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:54,608
What game?

534
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:58,778
Coin flipping.

535
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:00,248
It’s the same game we played.

536
00:39:00,248 --> 00:39:02,108
It’s so fun.

537
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:09,758
Last time, you guys won.

538
00:39:09,758 --> 00:39:12,928
Do you know that it made me so upset?

539
00:39:13,758 --> 00:39:17,788
Is this the reason you picked us two?

540
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:22,078
You can say that again.

541
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:23,788
What’s the rule?

542
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:28,358
Here’s the rule.

543
00:39:29,558 --> 00:39:31,048
If the A side shows,

544
00:39:31,048 --> 00:39:32,258
Pennhung will get injected.

545
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:36,048
If it’s B, then Pheng will.

546
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:36,928
Okay?

547
00:39:39,558 --> 00:39:41,558
Master, just inject me.

548
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:43,728
Don’t hurt Pheng.

549
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,868
Pennhung, don’t worry.

550
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:51,148
One of you will get injected,

551
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:54,518
and the other will be tied up together.

552
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:58,638
Why are you doing this, Master?

553
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:00,638
For some matters,

554
00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:02,638
I don’t have any reason.

555
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,788
Let’s start the game now.

556
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:09,738
Okay?

557
00:40:13,398 --> 00:40:17,738
Kids, here’s your punishment for today.

558
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:21,538
I’ll allow you to help your friend

559
00:40:21,848 --> 00:40:25,118
who has just got a poison injection.

560
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:28,358
Have you gone too far, Master?

561
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:30,058
Relax, Run.

562
00:40:30,058 --> 00:40:31,348
Relax.

563
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:34,468
Do you see these four serum bottles right here?

564
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:39,328
Two of them are the antidote.

565
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:42,158
How about the other two bottles?

566
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:46,878
Oh.

567
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:47,668
Saline solution.

568
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,688
How could we know which bottles are the serum?

569
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:56,508
But the fun doesn’t end here

570
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:59,398
as you can only pick two bottles.

571
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:01,398
Why only two?

572
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:06,248
Alright.

573
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,578
A or B?

574
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,538
A or B?

575
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,488
Wanna see?

576
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:17,828
A or B?

577
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:23,908
A or B?

578
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:24,798
Boom!

579
00:41:25,598 --> 00:41:27,598
Two people have been poisoned.

580
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,578
One is Master Praeporn,

581
00:41:31,578 --> 00:41:34,198
and the other is Pennhung, your buddy.

582
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:56,198
Pennhung.

583
00:41:56,198 --> 00:41:57,748
Pennhung, are you alright?

584
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,458
Hang in there.

585
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,678
Pennhung, don’t sleep.

586
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:04,538
Pennhung will tolerate it.

587
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,748
Don’t sleep.

588
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:08,938
Pennhung, keep listening to my voice.

589
00:42:08,938 --> 00:42:10,598
You must be alright,

590
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:12,318
or I’ll be mad at you.

591
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:14,318
You must survive

592
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:16,318
or else I’ll really get mad at you, Pennhung.

593
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:19,788
Run,

594
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,098
how could we know which one is the serum?

595
00:42:30,588 --> 00:42:32,838
Pennhung, you must be safe.

596
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:36,118
Think of your favorite croissants.

597
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:38,118
Do you want to eat croissants?

598
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:41,668
Pennhung likes croissants.

599
00:42:41,668 --> 00:42:44,998
Pennhung wants to eat croissants.

600
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:47,068
Then you must be safe.

601
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:50,288
Eat croissants with me, okay?

602
00:42:50,288 --> 00:42:52,338
Don’t die, Pennhung.

603
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:54,338
Can you promise me?

604
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:59,048
Where are Master Praeporn and Pennhung?

605
00:42:59,588 --> 00:43:03,368
Master Praeporn is in the treatment room.

606
00:43:03,368 --> 00:43:07,488
Mr. Pennhung and Ms. Pheng are in Home School.

607
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:09,278
So where is the treatment room?

608
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:12,408
I won’t tell you.

609
00:43:12,408 --> 00:43:14,148
You must search for it on your own,

610
00:43:14,148 --> 00:43:16,668
or you can choose to leave Master Praeporn behind

611
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:19,588
and help your buddy Pennhung.

612
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,658
What should we do?

613
00:43:27,658 --> 00:43:29,988
He’s obviously forcing us to split up and help them.

614
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:32,168
Pheng is with Pennhung.

615
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:33,748
We don’t know how they’re doing now.

616
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:37,488
But we mustn’t forget that

617
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:40,028
the biggest problem for now is the serum.

618
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:42,918
We have no idea 	which bottle is the antidote.

619
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:47,298
We must try our luck.

620
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:48,868
If we don’t hurry up,

621
00:43:48,868 --> 00:43:50,868
Pennhung could be in danger.

622
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:55,808
You guys go help your friends.

623
00:43:56,778 --> 00:43:59,678
I’ll take care of Master Praeporn.

624
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,678
I know where the treatment room is.

625
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,388
Let’s do that.

626
00:44:04,388 --> 00:44:06,388
Let’s quickly choose the serum.

627
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:17,278
I’ll do it.

628
00:44:22,068 --> 00:44:24,068
Please remember that

629
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:26,908
you can either save both

630
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:29,798
or fail to save any.

631
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:34,158
This 50:50 chance is super exciting.

632
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:39,158
Anyway, good luck.

633
00:44:39,858 --> 00:44:41,858
Master Praeporn’s life

634
00:44:41,858 --> 00:44:44,788
and Pennhung’s life are in your hands now.

635
00:44:56,358 --> 00:44:57,758
Wow.

636
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:22,498
Eh?

637
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:46,008
818.

638
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:49,338
819.

639
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:50,388
820.

640
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:51,368
821.

641
00:45:51,368 --> 00:45:52,218
822.

642
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:53,348
Ouch!

643
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:54,118
White!

644
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,058
Pennhung!

645
00:45:55,058 --> 00:45:57,058
Pennhung, wake up!

646
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:57,958
Just go!

647
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:58,548
Go!

648
00:45:58,548 --> 00:45:59,108
Go now!

649
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:00,298
Damn it!

650
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:01,168
Pennhung.

651
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:02,408
Answer me.

652
00:46:02,408 --> 00:46:04,388
Pennhung, wake up.

653
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:05,858
Don’t sleep.

654
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:07,838
Pennhung!

655
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:09,838
Pennhung, don’t sleep.

656
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:12,408
You said you wanted to eat croissants with me, didn’t you?

657
00:46:12,408 --> 00:46:14,408
Don’t leave me like this.

658
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,478
1001.

659
00:46:15,478 --> 00:46:16,468
1002.

660
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:17,418
1003.

661
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:18,548
1004.

662
00:46:19,388 --> 00:46:20,388
1005.

663
00:46:20,398 --> 00:46:21,368
1006.

664
00:46:21,368 --> 00:46:22,258
1007.

665
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:31,098
Pennhung, don’t break our promise!

666
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:32,618
Wake up!

667
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:33,818
Pennhung!

668
00:46:33,818 --> 00:46:36,098
Pennhung! Pheng!

669
00:46:36,098 --> 00:46:37,358
Can you hear me?

670
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,668
I’m here!

671
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:39,538
Pennhung!

672
00:46:39,538 --> 00:46:40,398
I’m here!

673
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:41,608
Can you hear me?

674
00:46:41,608 --> 00:46:42,548
I’m here.

675
00:46:42,548 --> 00:46:44,028
Help Pennhung!

676
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:44,698
I’m here.

677
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:45,528
Can you hear me?

678
00:46:45,528 --> 00:46:47,458
- Help Pennhung! - Pennhung! Pheng!

679
00:46:47,468 --> 00:46:48,348
Can you hear me?

680
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:48,958
I’m here!

681
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:49,868
Help Pennhung!

682
00:46:49,868 --> 00:46:50,458
Pennhung is…

683
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,218
Pennhung, Pheng!

684
00:46:52,218 --> 00:46:54,218
Help Pennhung!

685
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:55,388
Don’t be scared.

686
00:46:55,388 --> 00:46:56,458
I’m untying you.

687
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:57,388
Pennhung!

688
00:46:57,388 --> 00:46:58,608
Pennhung, wake up!

689
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,688
Pennhung, don’t sleep!

690
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:02,198
Pennhung!

691
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:03,328
Master!

692
00:47:05,108 --> 00:47:06,428
Master Praeporn.

693
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:08,328
Hang in there.

694
00:47:09,018 --> 00:47:09,978
Run?

695
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:11,688
Is that you?

696
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:12,968
Yes.

697
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:14,458
I’m helping you, Master.

698
00:47:15,028 --> 00:47:16,118
No.

699
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:19,158
Don’t.

700
00:47:22,288 --> 00:47:24,288
You must help those kids.

701
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:25,988
Don’t worry, Master.

702
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:28,398
Maki and others are helping Pennhung.

703
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:37,718
Pennhung!

704
00:47:38,128 --> 00:47:39,338
Pennhung!

705
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:44,088
Pennhung!

706
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:45,098
Pennhung, wake up!

707
00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:47,738
Pennhung.

708
00:47:47,738 --> 00:47:49,128
Pennhung!

709
00:47:49,128 --> 00:47:51,838
Pennhung, wake up!

710
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:53,948
Pennhung, can you hear me?

711
00:47:57,698 --> 00:47:59,898
Is this bottle really the serum?

712
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:03,298
What if it’s the saline solution?

713
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,758
What will we do?

714
00:48:22,468 --> 00:48:23,978
Pennhung!

715
00:48:24,928 --> 00:48:26,308
Hang in there, Pennhung.

716
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:29,558
Pennhung, can you hear me?

717
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:32,588
I got this serum to cure the poison from Master Prasath,

718
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:35,298
but I’m not sure if it’s the right one.

719
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:40,598
Pennhung.

720
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:42,598
Pennhung, relax.

721
00:48:42,598 --> 00:48:44,108
Pennhung.

722
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,758
Pennhung!

723
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:59,278
Run, listen to me.

724
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:05,518
No matter what happens,

725
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:13,498
you must protect every Home School student.

726
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:18,738
Don’t let anyone die, Run.

727
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,938
Can you promise me?

728
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:27,168
Yes.

729
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:37,338
You told me you wouldn’t leave us, didn’t you?

730
00:49:41,338 --> 00:49:42,578
Pennhung.

731
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:46,458
Inject it, Tibet.'

732
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:53,558
It will hurt a bit, Pennhung.

733
00:50:33,758 --> 00:50:35,088
Pennhung!

734
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:37,298
Can you hear me?

735
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:38,148
Pennhung.

736
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:51,958
Pennhung!

737
00:50:53,568 --> 00:51:00,578
Pennhung!

738
00:51:00,578 --> 00:51:03,578
Pennhung, wake up!

739
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:04,538
Pennhung!

740
00:51:04,538 --> 00:51:06,038
Pennhung, wake up!

741
00:51:06,038 --> 00:51:06,928
Pennhung.

742
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:07,958
Pennhung, wake up.

743
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,108
Pennhung!

744
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:12,288
Pennhung!

745
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:14,588
Pennhung.

746
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:15,818
Pennhung, wake up.

747
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:16,868
His pulse is absent.

748
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,268
Pennhung!

749
00:51:20,268 --> 00:51:21,128
Pennhung, don’t give up.

750
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:22,168
I’m begging you.

751
00:51:22,198 --> 00:51:25,048
Please.

752
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:25,788
Pennhung.

753
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:27,788
Please.

754
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:35,968
Don’t break our promise, Pennhung.

755
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,418
We promised each other, didn’t we?

756
00:51:37,418 --> 00:51:38,268
Hey.

757
00:51:38,658 --> 00:51:39,918
Wake up.

758
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:41,658
Pennhung, wake up.

759
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:44,158
Pennhung.

760
00:51:45,538 --> 00:51:46,918
His pulse!

761
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:48,698
Pennhung!

762
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:50,368
Pennhung is safe now!

763
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:52,848
His pulse is back.

764
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,288
Pennhung is safe now.

765
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:58,158
Pennhung!

766
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:01,578
Pennhung is safe now, Pheng.

767
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:39,328
Master.

768
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:41,328
Master.

769
00:52:42,308 --> 00:52:44,418
Master.

770
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:07,408
I’m sorry.

771
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:11,818
I’m sorry.

772
00:53:12,298 --> 00:53:13,728
I’m sorry.

773
00:53:23,298 --> 00:53:26,408
I’m sorry.

774
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:10,688
Amin, I’m disappointed

775
00:54:13,768 --> 00:54:15,448
that, in the end,

776
00:54:16,328 --> 00:54:19,598
you’ve turned into a beast like me.

777
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:23,768
To be frank,

778
00:54:24,768 --> 00:54:33,128
I want to know why you created me 	in your subconscious

779
00:54:33,128 --> 00:54:36,338
while you actually hate me like poison.

780
00:54:37,098 --> 00:54:38,518
Why?

781
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:46,818
You probably feel guilty that you made me die,

782
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:49,088
but do you know that

783
00:54:49,088 --> 00:54:53,988
you’ll feel even more guilty if you don’t wake up?

784
00:54:59,988 --> 00:55:01,498
Wake up already.'

785
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,718
Amin

786
00:55:07,188 --> 00:55:09,588
Wake up.

787
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:12,858
Wake up, Amin.

788
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:16,158
Wake up, Amin!

789
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:48,498
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

790
00:55:48,498 --> 00:55:50,688
Master Amin, do you really want someone to die?

791
00:55:50,688 --> 00:55:52,908
Is this really what Home School wants?

792
00:55:52,908 --> 00:55:54,908
Please take revenge for Master Praeporn.

793
00:55:54,908 --> 00:55:56,698
I won’t fall for your trick, Master.

794
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:58,058
Run, I guess it’s too late

795
00:55:58,058 --> 00:56:00,148
because I’ve already created the new beasts.

796
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,318
When did you guys come back?

797
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:02,968
Let’s make a deal, shall we?

798
00:56:02,968 --> 00:56:04,368
What if I don’t do it?

799
00:56:04,368 --> 00:56:06,258
I might have to kill Master Dilak.

800
00:56:06,848 --> 00:56:08,618
Run, can you promise me that, from now on,

801
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:12,558
we won’t separate from each other again?
