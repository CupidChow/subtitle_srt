1
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:02,493
It's like we've been driving in circles.

2
00:00:02,494 --> 00:00:04,159
This place is seriously a maze.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,379
Help us!

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,079
Officer, can you please drive us to town?

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,859
I'll give you a ride then.

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,413
Both of you were brought here because

7
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:15,880
you broke the 7th rule of Home School.

8
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,026
Hugo.

9
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:50,586
Jingjai.

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,973
Are you ready to change yourselves?

11
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:59,626
I realized my mistake now.

12
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,089
I won't do it again.

13
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,253
Please let me go, Master Amin.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,169
I promise I will change.

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,539
I beg you.

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,879
Please let us go.

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,919
The fact that you two are saying that

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,720
means you're not ready.

19
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,053
Because if you really have changed,

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,409
you will not beg me

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,419
but you will believe in me

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,040
and believe in Home School.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,320
Master Phoban,

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,186
Hugo and Jingjai must take the special course

25
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:44,026
until they're able to change themselves.

26
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:45,851
No.

27
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:46,976
- No, Master Amin. - Master Amin!

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,560
No!

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,520
Master Amin!

30
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,546
- Master Amin! - Let us go!

31
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,369
Master Amin!

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,359
Let us go!

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,489
Don't do this!

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,490
Let me go!

35
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:08,705
I have something to inform you.

36
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:13,232
After Hugo and Jingjai broke the rules

37
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:16,615
and ran away from Home School several days ago,

38
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:18,352
I've been punishing them

39
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:26,419
and hoping they will realize they shouldn't do the wrong things.

40
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:32,432
Unfortunately, the results are not as they should be.

41
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:38,526
Therefore, Hugo and Jingjai will continue to be punished.

42
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:41,566
But I think you've punished them enough already.

43
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,432
How much longer are you planning to lock them up?

44
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,419
Until they change.

45
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,095
Change?

46
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,152
Change what?

47
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:56,232
Isn't what you Masters doing to them illegal?

48
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:59,945
We must get Hugo and Jingjai out.

49
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:02,925
What the Masters are doing is not right.

50
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:05,485
But those two broke the rules, Maki,

51
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,735
and it's not their first time.

52
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:09,885
If you think about it,

53
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:12,979
they're rightly punished.

54
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:16,305
Biw is right.

55
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:21,712
Without those two, things are pretty peaceful.

56
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:28,911
I understand that Hugo and Jingjai are troublemakers

57
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:30,745
but they're our friends.

58
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:36,179
Getting punished for this long is too much.

59
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:52,151
Why did you want to see me, Master Amin?

60
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:54,146
I think it's time for us

61
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:59,015
to start The Lizard Game.

62
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:03,965
But this time, I want you to make some adjustments

63
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:08,632
and make it harder than every time before.

64
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:13,905
But won't it be too soon, Master?

65
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:16,455
I think the kids are not ready.

66
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,046
Master Praeporn,

67
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:23,726
don't underestimate this GEN.

68
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:30,939
The GEN6 kids have more potential than we think.

69
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:36,385
They always go beyond our expectations.

70
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:41,379
I believe they're our hope.

71
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:46,466
They're the ones who will change our society.

72
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,466
Alright.

73
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:54,696
I will start the course immediately.

74
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:27,552
Why is there a phone here?

75
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:42,805
It's not working.

76
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:44,219
I didn't hear anything.

77
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:47,205
A phone without a keypad.

78
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,206
Pennhung never saw one before.

79
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:54,625
Good morning, GEN6.

80
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:57,815
I have a fun game for you to play today.

81
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:01,825
This game is called The Lizard Game.

82
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:03,765
The Lizard Game?

83
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,925
What is it about?

84
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,219
It's a game I specifically designed for all of you.

85
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,085
I guarantee you will enjoy it.

86
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,632
Do you see the phone over there?

87
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,565
Here are the rules.

88
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,735
You each have to pick up a call

89
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,925
to find out which animal you are assigned to be.

90
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:28,985
One of you will become a lizard.

91
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:31,605
The lizard will have the power to order other animals

92
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:33,605
to do anything,

93
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:37,295
but the lizard cannot reveal itself.

94
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:40,205
It's the other animals' responsibility

95
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:43,865
to find out who the lizard is.

96
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:49,405
The game will only be over when someone finds out who the lizard is

97
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:50,899
within three days.

98
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,745
Whoa, what kind of game is that?

99
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,366
It doesn't sound fun.

100
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:59,425
What if we don't play, Master?

101
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:06,272
You just won't get updates about the letters you sent home.

102
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,086
I don't want to know anyway.

103
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:11,686
I won't play this.

104
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:13,975
I mean,

105
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:16,445
if any of you doesn't play,

106
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:20,659
all your friends will lose the chance to know about the letters.

107
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,615
So if you want to know,

108
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,806
all of you must play the game with me.

109
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:29,345
What do we do?

110
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,975
Let's play The Lizard Game.

111
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:34,165
I want to get a letter from my dad.

112
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,646
I want a letter from my family too.

113
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,246
Me too.

114
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,699
Alright.

115
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:47,366
We will play The Lizard Game with you, Master.

116
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:53,085
I promise you will learn much more than you think from it.

117
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:58,086
The game starts as soon as you hear the phone ring.

118
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,886
The animal you're assigned to be is...

119
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:52,832
Now that you all know what animal you are,

120
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:57,619
I hope you enjoy playing the game.

121
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:02,632
Oh, don't forget that you have three days.

122
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:07,766
If you can't find out who the lizard is within that time,

123
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,105
you will lose

124
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:13,806
and the losers will be punished.

125
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:18,575
Just reveal to us if you're the lizard

126
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,215
so we can end the game.

127
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:23,992
Then we'll get updates about the letters from our families.

128
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:26,855
Ah.

129
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:28,632
Don't tell your friends yet

130
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,745
that you're the lizard.

131
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:37,135
If the lizard is caught before three days, it will be punished.

132
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,105
You must follow the rules.

133
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:45,255
Please remember that playing The Lizard Game

134
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:47,126
is one of the important lessons for you.

135
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,552
Pass them to your friends.

136
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:45,685
In the next class, you all must hand in your homework.

137
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,686
You must complete every page.

138
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:54,352
If you don't complete it, you know what's going to happen.

139
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,886
Special homework for you.

140
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:11,866
Special?

141
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,055
Why special?

142
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:17,952
Because it's the lizard's order.

143
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:19,659
What?

144
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,206
Really?

145
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,459
(Dog: Get double the homework.)

146
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,446
Damn it!

147
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,885
Why do I have to be a dog?

148
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:34,299
I knew I would be the first to get played.

149
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,455
Who was it?

150
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,205
Who ordered this?

151
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:39,739
Who was it?

152
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,019
Who ordered this?

153
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,485
Hey, it's the lizard's order.

154
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,272
Complete it, stupid dog.

155
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:49,775
So stupid.

156
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,579
When you complete it, I'll give you pellets.

157
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,165
Thank God.

158
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,819
I love Swedish meatballs.

159
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,295
If I remember correctly,

160
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:08,779
today's meal is always delicious, right, Pennhung?

161
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,645
Well,

162
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:12,345
this meal is delicious

163
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:14,705
but dinner is not.

164
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:18,979
At least there's something good on a bad day.

165
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:31,819
You get a special meal, Miss Fuji.

166
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,912
(Squirrel: Skip this meal.)

167
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:43,418
Who is it?

168
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:45,416
Who is the lizard?

169
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:50,725
Master Phoban,

170
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:51,885
bring me the food.

171
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:53,232
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:58,139
I can only serve you that special meal per the lizard's order.

173
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:05,165
Fuji, you can share my food.

174
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,352
No.

175
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:11,935
All of you must follow the lizard's orders.

176
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,745
Miss Fuji is ordered to skip a meal.

177
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:16,819
She won't get to eat.

178
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:23,592
Just confess that you're the lizard.

179
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:31,139
Don't let me find out.

180
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:35,459
If I do, I'll make sure you pay.

181
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:36,895
Someone is hangry.

182
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:37,992
F*ck off!

183
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:44,126
Now tell me who the lizard is already.

184
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:53,792
I think Mork is the lizard.

185
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:57,112
What the hell are you talking about?

186
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,566
I'm not.

187
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:02,625
You were laughing when I was punished earlier.

188
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,509
And I saw your shocked face when you answered the phone.

189
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,032
I've been with you all my life.

190
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,505
I can tell you don't know how to lie.

191
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,125
I was shocked because I was assigned to be a tick.

192
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:12,806
A tick!

193
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,805
You're the lizard.

194
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,338
Why the hell are you accusing me?

195
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:17,549
Accusing you, my ass.

196
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,125
I was the first to get bullied.

197
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:19,966
I'm a dog.

198
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,405
Who would even be assigned to be a tick?

199
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:22,046
Me!

200
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:22,619
I'm a tick!

201
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,752
I don't believe you.

202
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:31,745
Is that your answers, Mek and Mork?

203
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:33,295
Yes.

204
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:36,105
Yes, I'm sure Mork is the lizard.

205
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:37,935
I said I'm not.

206
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:38,737
I don't believe you.

207
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,326
You're the lizard.

208
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:39,966
Do you think I'm stupid?

209
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:40,777
Yes, you're stupid.

210
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:41,299
I don't believe you.

211
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,385
You're stupid.

212
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:43,072
I'm smarter than you.

213
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:44,699
Let me ask you one more time.

214
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:47,905
Do you confirm your answers?

215
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,099
Yes.

216
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:54,592
Your answers are wrong.

217
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:58,899
The punishment for the ones who get the answer wrong

218
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:01,945
is being locked up until the game is over.

219
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:03,665
Mister Mek, Mister Mork,

220
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,099
please follow me to the detention room.

221
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,535
This is all your fault, dog tick.

222
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,645
Oh, it's not like you're right, mangy dog.

223
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:14,775
Don't fight.

224
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,606
Actually, you look like a tick.

225
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,505
We can't just give random answers.

226
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:33,459
If we get it wrong, we get locked up.

227
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:38,192
At least, we got to see the true colors of the locked-ups.

228
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:40,872
Mek and Mork are definitely not lizards.

229
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,419
Don't you guys think

230
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,645
that I might be the lizard?

231
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:51,825
You can't be the lizard, White.

232
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:53,258
Why not?

233
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,256
I'm good at acting.

234
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:00,105
Don't you realize at all

235
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:04,625
that your face always shows everything you think?

236
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,312
That's not true.

237
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,019
Really?

238
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,326
Yes.

239
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,245
The lizard wants me to give you these. (White)

240
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:21,659
(Maki)

241
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:28,825
(Deer: Be a janitor.)

242
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:30,472
(Cat: Be a janitor.)

243
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:37,016
Both of you must clean every nook and cranny of Home School.

244
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:41,792
If you haven't finished, you can't go to bed.

245
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:46,592
(Sweep)

246
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,925
(Mop)

247
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:51,232
(Mop, sweep)

248
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:54,406
(Sweep sweep, mop mop)

249
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:59,145
Oh, no.

250
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,592
We received the order.

251
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:05,339
I knew you're not the lizard.

252
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,526
Cleaning the whole of Home School?

253
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,259
That's crazy.

254
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,816
I won't get any sleep tonight.

255
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,686
Nai and I will help you girls.

256
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,365
Really?

257
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,366
Since when did I agree?

258
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:27,456
Won't you help?

259
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,305
Alright, I'll help.

260
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,405
Yeah.

261
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,139
Be a gentleman.

262
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:42,846
Alright.

263
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,615
Let's go.

264
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,166
Now?

265
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,286
Don't you want to sleep tonight?

266
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,019
Come on.

267
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:05,285
The whole of Home School, man.

268
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:06,845
Exactly.

269
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,366
Gentleman much?

270
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,752
I'm a cat.

271
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:26,766
You're a deer.

272
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,726
What about you guys?

273
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:35,178
I'm a lion.

274
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,176
I'm a shark.

275
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:02,419
(Maki = Cat, White = Deer, Tibet = Lion, Nai = Shark)

276
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,735
Fuji, Mek, and Mork are.

277
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:09,552
Squirrel, dog, and tick.

278
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:18,859
Mek is a dog.

279
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:22,825
Mork is a tick.

280
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:27,166
Fuji is a squirrel.

281
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:39,899
That leaves Pheng, Biw, Jean, and Pennhung.

282
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,619
We still don't know what animals they are.

283
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,885
That means one of them is the lizard.

284
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:49,526
But who?

285
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,016
We have to find out, Nai.

286
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:18,886
It's time to run laps, Pennhung.

287
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:20,499
What?

288
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:43,565
Rabbit: Run around the field for two hours.

289
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:44,886
Oh.

290
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,725
Does Pennhung have to run now?

291
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,886
Yes, now.

292
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:54,736
Tibet, Nai,

293
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:57,145
helping White and Maki

294
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:59,895
was against the lizard's order.

295
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:01,766
Both of you will be punished too.

296
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,139
Get up!

297
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:06,606
Gather in five minutes.

298
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:08,606
The one who is late will be caught.

299
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:16,726
So much for being cool.

300
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:27,886
Beaver, are you alright?

301
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:32,425
I can't believe the lizard would be this mean to me.

302
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:34,766
I'm the only girl who's ordered to run.

303
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:37,525
Hey.

304
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:38,606
Pheng.

305
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:45,735
Ride on my back.

306
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,215
I'll carry you.

307
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,059
Okay.

308
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,655
Not you, Pennhung.

309
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:51,446
He means Pheng.

310
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:55,905
Are you sure, Tibet?

311
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:58,179
You could get more punishment by doing this.

312
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,205
If you don't fulfill the lizard's order,

313
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:02,886
you will get it worse than me.

314
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,246
Get on, Pheng.

315
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:10,726
Pennhung is fine.

316
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:27,886
Let's go, Pennhung.

317
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:53,185
(Cat: Sort books by genre and alphabet.)

318
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:55,099
(Lion: Sort books by genre and alphabet.)

319
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:58,366
(Deer: Skip this meal.)

320
00:23:58,366 --> 00:23:59,446
(Squirrel: Skip this meal.)

321
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,055
Again?

322
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,335
Are you going to make me diet, lizard?

323
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:04,179
Damn it!

324
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,338
I'm so hungry.

325
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:07,335
I'm freaking thin enough as it is.

326
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:09,166
I'm so pissed!

327
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:12,006
You think I'm so fat?

328
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:15,176
Here.

329
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:18,006
Thank you.

330
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,192
Here it is.

331
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:35,966
Come on.

332
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,899
I'm so damn hungry!

333
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:49,269
The lizard didn't let me eat

334
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,099
and now it's making me do labor too.

335
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:11,245
I can't stand this anymore, Fuji.

336
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:12,565
I know.

337
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:16,455
We weren't allowed to eat and we had to do so many things.

338
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:18,566
Who the hell is the lizard?

339
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,565
Jean, Biw,

340
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,135
you're the lizard, aren't you?

341
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,295
No.

342
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,895
I'm not the lizard.

343
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,175
I'm not either.

344
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:37,305
Then why do both of you never get punished by the lizard?

345
00:25:37,306 --> 00:25:39,951
I have no idea why I don't,

346
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:41,946
but I swear I'm not the lizard.

347
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:53,019
You know, you look the most suspicious, Jean,

348
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,858
because I know who you are.

349
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,855
What are you talking about, Fuji?

350
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,005
Judging from your personality,

351
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:03,726
you wouldn't have a problem punishing your friends.

352
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:09,152
You were capable of burning your dad's factory before.

353
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:26,166
How do you know that?

354
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:29,725
My dad knows your dad.

355
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:34,966
That's why I know you set the fire to your dad's factory on purpose.

356
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:39,085
What does that have to do with this?

357
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:41,325
This is a completely different story.

358
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:43,805
Our friends deserve to know what kind of person you are.

359
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:46,086
You can't be trusted.

360
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,696
I had my reason.

361
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:53,906
Stay out of my business.

362
00:26:57,546 --> 00:27:01,775
That factory killed a lot of people.

363
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:05,512
I did the right thing by burning it down.

364
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:16,495
It's impossible for the workers to finish this in just a few days, Dad.

365
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:18,272
It's too much.

366
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:22,832
Why are you making a fuss about this, Jean?

367
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:30,179
If you keep ordering them to do it non-stop, they will all die.

368
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:35,665
How is sewing going to make them die?

369
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,749
We need the work finished and delivered quickly.

370
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,045
If we can't make it in time, we lose money.

371
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:41,818
But it's too much for them.

372
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:44,085
They have all been getting sick these past few days.

373
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:46,345
At least, give them a break.

374
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:51,895
Jean, if you're going to take over my factory in the future,

375
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:54,831
you must learn to look at the big picture.

376
00:27:54,832 --> 00:27:56,825
Focus on the big results

377
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,325
instead of spending your time on nonsense.

378
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:03,346
Who would want that kind of factory?

379
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:08,005
Oh, others are dying to get my factory,

380
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:12,495
but you, my only son, don't give a damn about it.

381
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:14,059
Because you're greedy.

382
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:19,175
You don't want your money to go to other people.

383
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:20,512
Jean!

384
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,525
I'm your father!

385
00:28:23,526 --> 00:28:26,179
How dare you speak to your father like that?

386
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,325
Let me remind you that

387
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:31,312
you got where you are because of me!

388
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:40,925
You keep reminding me that I owe you.

389
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:46,431
Have you ever asked if I wanted to be born?

390
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,426
You ungrateful brat!

391
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:58,911
My dad wouldn't stop.

392
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:00,906
The only way I could stop him

393
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:03,806
was to burn it all down.

394
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,655
Oh,

395
00:29:23,656 --> 00:29:28,566
you were trying to be a hero by burning your dad's factory?

396
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:31,886
Your excuse is lame.

397
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:36,006
Your dad said you spent your days making trouble.

398
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,866
Don't judge me, okay?

399
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:43,976
You don't know me.

400
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,726
I don't want to know a guy like you.

401
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,045
Don't fight, children.

402
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:03,712
Don't forget that you have to find out who the lizard is.

403
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:07,966
It's obvious who that is.

404
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:12,979
Fuji, do you confirm your answer?

405
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,445
It's just a fun game.

406
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,605
What's the point of fighting?

407
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,272
You may be enjoying this, Master,

408
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:29,646
but I'm not.

409
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:50,325
I still think Jean is the lizard.

410
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,965
Someone like him can't be trusted.

411
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:55,538
He betrayed even his own dad.

412
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,536
Who are we to not get betrayed by him?

413
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:02,685
I think you might misunderstand him, Fuji.

414
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:07,665
What Jean told us makes sense.

415
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,526
Why are you protecting him, Biw?

416
00:31:11,256 --> 00:31:15,025
We're friends

417
00:31:15,026 --> 00:31:17,072
so we should trust each other, right?

418
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,895
You're suspicious too, Biw.

419
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:23,045
Besides Jean,

420
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:24,779
you're the only one not getting punished by the lizard.

421
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,895
But I'm not the lizard.

422
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,726
I'm a horse.

423
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:37,086
Fuji, I'm really not the lizard.

424
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:41,752
I don't trust anyone until we can find proof.

425
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:43,886
Just you wait.

426
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:49,046
I will find out who punished me.

427
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:58,779
Damn it! I'm so hungry.

428
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,445
I'm freaking tired.

429
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:03,295
I want to eat.

430
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,709
(Beaver: Skip this meal.)

431
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,978
(Cat: Skip this meal.)

432
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:07,419
(Deer: Skip this meal.)

433
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,458
(Rabbit: Skip this meal.)

434
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:19,749
(Squirrel: Skip this meal.)

435
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,166
(Lion: Skip this meal.)

436
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,166
(Shark: Skip this meal.)

437
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,095
Wow.

438
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:30,646
I just ran and I have to skip this meal?

439
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:37,205
Pennhung didn't keep the croissant.

440
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,095
This is very bad.

441
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:42,939
Isn't it obvious now who the lizard is?

442
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,829
How many more times do I have to tell you?

443
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,058
I'm not the lizard.

444
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,055
I'm not the lizard either, Fuji.

445
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:53,686
Then why do you two never get punished?

446
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:09,552
Since no one else gets to eat, I won't eat.

447
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:13,706
Yeah.

448
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:15,552
I won't eat either.

449
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:51,178
I believe you, Jean.

450
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,176
You're not the lizard.

451
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,616
Why do you believe so?

452
00:33:58,192 --> 00:34:01,726
From what you told us,

453
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:05,255
I don't think you can be the lizard.

454
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:07,619
I mean,

455
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:13,646
burning your dad's factory.

456
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,512
I don't blame you.

457
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:19,386
I understand.

458
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:31,539
How can someone who grew up in a good family like you understand?

459
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:37,286
How do you know my family is good?

460
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:41,339
My dad is no different from yours.

461
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:47,872
My dad killed people too.

462
00:34:56,165 --> 00:35:00,221
But you seem to love him so much, don't you?

463
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,655
I love my dad.

464
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:08,485
I love him so much.

465
00:35:09,915 --> 00:35:14,221
But he's the reason the villagers suffered

466
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:19,381
and took their own lives.

467
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:23,814
(Village Chief Cheats)

468
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:26,555
(Villa Chief "B." Cheats Villagers Out Of Money and Farmland)

469
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:33,888
Is something the matter?

470
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:36,774
I saw this news on Facebook

471
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:39,014
about a village chief whose name starts with B.

472
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,234
He cheated the villagers out of farmland and got them bankrupt.

473
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:45,275
The victims' whole family committed suicide.

474
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:51,621
Whoa, he's a really bad village chief for doing that.

475
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:53,914
He's not like my dad.

476
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:56,435
My dad never causes anyone trouble.

477
00:35:57,435 --> 00:36:03,195
Well, I think the news talks about Chief Bird, your dad.

478
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,614
That's crazy.

479
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:08,114
There's no way it could be my dad.

480
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:10,114
My dad is not that kind of person.

481
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:13,168
You girls know how kind my dad is.

482
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:18,528
Actually, there have been rumors among the villagers

483
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:22,334
that your dad Chief Bird really did bad things.

484
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:24,644
Rumors are just rumors.

485
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,084
My dad loves helping those in need.

486
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,314
He donates tons of money to people.

487
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:31,524
He sacrifices a lot for others.

488
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:33,214
My dad is a good man.

489
00:36:33,215 --> 00:36:35,538
I know you love your dad very much, Biw,

490
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:38,328
but you can't be blindly optimistic all the time.

491
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,341
I think you know who your dad truly is.

492
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:46,168
If you don't believe me, get out of my house.

493
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:50,248
Get out.

494
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:55,075
Don't come back.

495
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:09,684
To be honest, I already knew my dad was not a good man.

496
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,728
He took advantage of the villagers.

497
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:15,488
He made them struggle.

498
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:24,795
But I love him so much that I tried to turn a blind eye.

499
00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:32,595
I pretended to not know that he's a bad person.

500
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:39,754
He will be my kind dad forever.

501
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,755
But your dad is in the wrong.

502
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,205
I know,

503
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:53,075
but I'm not brave enough to do what you did.

504
00:37:57,965 --> 00:38:04,854
I think it's really cool that you're brave enough to stand against your dad

505
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:06,541
for the right thing.

506
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:18,381
Before I was brave enough,

507
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,605
it took time.

508
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:27,715
It's not easy at all to admit that my own family

509
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:31,155
is not good.

510
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,888
But sometimes you must choose to do the right thing.

511
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:44,128
It's better than doing nothing, letting the wrong things continue,

512
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,045
and lying to yourself every day.

513
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:15,154
Jean, Biw,

514
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:17,315
we want to talk to you about something.

515
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,035
Let's find a way to end this game.

516
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:23,795
How can we end it?

517
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:29,315
Can you guys tell us what animals you are?

518
00:39:38,181 --> 00:39:39,181
(Biw = Horse, Jean = Rat)

519
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:42,528
Now we know what animal everyone is.

520
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:46,044
Jean said he's a rat.

521
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:48,421
Biw confirmed that she's a horse.

522
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:51,808
No one is a lizard.

523
00:39:52,805 --> 00:39:55,581
Could someone be lying?

524
00:39:56,725 --> 00:40:00,334
But Biw and Jean are the only ones with no proof

525
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:02,221
that they're really a horse and a rat.

526
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:08,543
Maybe someone who confirmed faked punishing themselves

527
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:11,043
to draw suspicion away.

528
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:15,477
Lizards can always change colors.

529
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,957
You're right.

530
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:25,574
Everything seems to point to Jean and Biw.

531
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,813
It seems too much like a setup to make us suspect those two.

532
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:34,270
You're right.

533
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:36,268
I wonder about that too.

534
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,067
It seems too easy for Master Praeporn.

535
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:44,151
I think her plan to trick us would be more complicated than that.

536
00:40:46,348 --> 00:40:49,764
That means someone is really lying.

537
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,507
But who is lying?

538
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:56,244
Did Fuji pretend to be hangry?

539
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:58,444
Or is it Pennhung?

540
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:01,747
That's unlikely.

541
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:04,897
In the end, we're back to doubting each other.

542
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:08,804
Master Praeporn must enjoy seeing us like this.

543
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:10,877
Yes.

544
00:41:10,878 --> 00:41:12,577
You're right, Nai.

545
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:16,364
We wanted to know who among us is the lizard so much

546
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:18,630
that we started doubting each other.

547
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:21,444
Maybe there's no lizard from the beginning.

548
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:27,797
Are you saying none of us is the lizard?

549
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:31,377
Then why is the Master doing this?

550
00:41:31,378 --> 00:41:33,378
Who is the lizard?

551
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:36,417
I think I get it now.

552
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:39,097
Master Praeporn wants us to doubt each other.

553
00:41:39,098 --> 00:41:40,717
Yes.

554
00:41:40,718 --> 00:41:45,204
Every lizard's order comes from the Masters.

555
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:50,911
The only one who has known since the beginning what animals we are

556
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:58,031
and has been keeping an eye on our every move is.

557
00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:01,138
Master Praeporn.

558
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:18,090
(Master Praeporn)

559
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,098
The real lizard is.

560
00:42:20,962 --> 00:42:22,404
Master Praeporn.

561
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,188
Master Praeporn.

562
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,188
We found the lizard.

563
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:51,431
You only have one chance to answer.

564
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:53,804
Think carefully before you do.

565
00:42:57,938 --> 00:43:00,151
Our answer is,

566
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:03,191
the lizard is

567
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:07,418
you, Master Praeporn.

568
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:12,298
What about these two?

569
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,187
We already asked them.

570
00:43:15,188 --> 00:43:18,111
Jean and Biw are a horse and a rat.

571
00:43:20,938 --> 00:43:22,637
How can you be sure?

572
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:27,044
Lizards are known for their ability to change colors.

573
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,457
The lizard might be lying to you right now.

574
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:33,674
We're very sure that everyone is telling the truth.

575
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:35,377
No one is the lizard.

576
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:39,098
I believe none of us would hurt our own classmates.

577
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:41,557
Since we got here,

578
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:44,283
we've been through a lot together.

579
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:46,277
Even though we fight sometimes,

580
00:43:46,278 --> 00:43:49,258
at the end of the day, we're still friends.

581
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:53,924
So the only one who dares to do this to us

582
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:56,828
is you, Master.

583
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:59,418
Do you confirm your answer?

584
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:05,268
Yes.

585
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:13,831
Your answer is correct.

586
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:26,827
Congratulations to all of you for winning this game.

587
00:44:26,828 --> 00:44:28,627
Master Praeporn.

588
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:30,924
What about the letters from our families

589
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:33,671
that you promised us?

590
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:38,551
I will tell you about that when you're all together.

591
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:52,037
Hey, White.

592
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:53,737
Who's the lizard?

593
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:55,350
Master Praeporn.

594
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:57,348
She's behind everything.

595
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,230
See, idiot?

596
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,227
I told you it's not me.

597
00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:04,321
I figured that out since you were locked up with me.

598
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:05,777
You didn't have to repeat it.

599
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:06,898
Take your seat.

600
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:18,357
Hey, Hugo.

601
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:19,658
Come sit here.

602
00:45:26,078 --> 00:45:29,578
Hugo, Jingjai,

603
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:31,298
are you okay?

604
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,578
Hugo? Jingjai?

605
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:41,044
What's wrong?

606
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:54,997
Everyone is here, right?

607
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:57,837
What have you done to Hugo and Jingjai?

608
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,107
Why are they like that?

609
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:06,271
Hugo and Jingjai are only being punished for their mistakes.

610
00:46:07,038 --> 00:46:12,444
When it's time, they will be released.

611
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:17,388
Right, Hugo? Jingjai?

612
00:46:22,188 --> 00:46:22,818
But...

613
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:24,764
Everything that is happening

614
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:27,378
is under the rules of Home School.

615
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:33,524
Where are our letters, Master?

616
00:46:37,178 --> 00:46:41,604
What you want to know is in there.

617
00:46:57,868 --> 00:47:00,084
Where are all the letters gone?

618
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:05,458
There was never a letter

619
00:47:06,378 --> 00:47:11,538
because none of your families replied to your letters.

620
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:15,907
That's not true.

621
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:18,947
My dad would certainly write to me.

622
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:21,204
I don't believe you, Master.

623
00:47:22,878 --> 00:47:25,157
I don't believe you, either.

624
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:27,751
There's no way my mom wouldn't reply to my letter.

625
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:30,097
You're right.

626
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:32,990
You shouldn't trust the lizard about everything.

627
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:35,964
It might be messing with your heads right now.

628
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:43,587
Maybe your letters were never sent

629
00:47:43,588 --> 00:47:49,698
or maybe the lizard is hiding the letters from your families.

630
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:52,498
No one knows what the lizard will do.

631
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:58,237
But this is all just a game.

632
00:47:58,238 --> 00:48:00,044
Don't take it seriously.

633
00:48:01,718 --> 00:48:06,538
I hope you enjoyed The Lizard Game.

634
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,441
Enjoyed it, my ass!

635
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:21,844
I almost starved to death.

636
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,711
Master Amin.

637
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:52,283
This GEN is developing exponentially.

638
00:48:52,284 --> 00:48:54,278
It's so impressive.

639
00:48:55,238 --> 00:48:57,378
Do you agree with me, Master Champ?

640
00:48:58,588 --> 00:49:00,277
I do.

641
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:02,404
This GEN is really something else.

642
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:07,587
That's why I want you to start the new course right away.

643
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:11,778
I wonder if the kids will be able to pass it.

644
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:15,957
I'll get right on it, Master Amin.

645
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:19,258
I promise I will not let you down.

646
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:28,751
I hope the game you created will make our kids

647
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:32,898
remember it for the rest of their lives.

648
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:47,999
DIRECTED BY KANITTHA KWUNYOO

649
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:51,645
I knew Master Dilak wasn't ready.

650
00:49:51,646 --> 00:49:53,672
But Master Amin doesn't think so.

651
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:57,705
After being released,

652
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:00,752
I think Hugo and Jingjai are acting weird.

653
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,245
To test your ability,

654
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:05,629
I'm ordering you to punch each other.

655
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,979
Whichever team drops the rope first, that team loses.

656
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,305
Punch him!

657
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:11,365
Punch him, Mek!

658
00:50:11,366 --> 00:50:12,459
This rule is crazy!

659
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,486
We won't do it!
