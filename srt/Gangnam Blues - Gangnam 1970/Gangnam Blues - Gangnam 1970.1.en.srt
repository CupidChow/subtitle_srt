00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:55,734
- It's yours.
- Just eat.

189
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:04,307
Where the hell is he?

190
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:12,532
So nice and warm.

191
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:25,978
- Son of a bitch!
- Boss!

192
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,034
Goddammit!

193
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:31,218
Daddy!

194
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:34,179
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Sun Hye, run!

195
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,119
Sun Hye, get away!

196
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,619
Get away!

197
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:46,165
- Just go!
- Daddy!

198
00:15:55,883 --> 00:16:00,179
Daddy!

199
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,958
Boss!

200
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,002
Boss, are you okay?

201
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,860
- Daddy!
- Boss!

202
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:38,926
Your leg okay?

203
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:40,047
Yes.

204
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,801
Thank you for coming to see Don Nam off.

205
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,395
Who was it?

206
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,523
Could be our rival gang.

207
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:50,333
Cops are looking into it, and some are in hiding.

208
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:54,588
Probably enforcers from the opposition party.

209
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,391
A retaliation for the party convention.

210
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,227
I could've been offed too.

211
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,938
Come see me in Seoul.

212
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,072
This way, sir.

213
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,460
Our boys.

214
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,291
Where did they all go?

215
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,667
They packed up and left.

216
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,174
Our don's dead and with your retirement rumor,

217
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:30,133
they all fled.

218
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:35,022
It's better this way.

219
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,399
You should leave too.

220
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,118
What?

221
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:42,028
Find a better way of life.

222
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,572
This is not the way to live.

223
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,958
[Three years later]

224
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:03,008
Mr. Yoon...

225
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:04,676
Don't! Don't kill me!

226
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,762
I'll sell! Please!

227
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,305
No, no! Please don't!

228
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,182
Don't kill me!

229
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:12,600
I'll sell it!

230
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:35,290
You're very proficient for a young man.

231
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,959
Thank you, sir.

232
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:41,129
He's a great candidate to run the hotel.

233
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:44,674
Don't let hooligans come in and go.

234
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:50,430
I'll settle things with Jang, so don't worry, sir.

235
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,267
Yong Gi.

236
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,228
Put the package in his car.

237
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:56,728
Yes, sir.

238
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:03,542
What is it?

239
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,836
Leftover cash after taking over Daewong Hotel.

240
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,502
Without greed, you'll go far.

241
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,748
She was probably lonely.

242
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:24,878
I can understand falling for a gigolo,

243
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:29,007
but she handed over our property deed, that bitch!

244
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,885
Consider yourself lucky.

245
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:36,598
She could've sent you poison-soaked food.

246
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:41,770
Don't joke about it,
my ancestors are buried in it!

247
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,657
Family issues should be dealt in the family.

248
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:47,451
I'm ashamed to face my ancestors!

249
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,822
I worked in the Saudi desert for this.

250
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:55,701
Please get it back.

251
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,953
Hey!

252
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,453
Come out for a sec

253
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:02,667
I'll get to the point.

254
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,752
Wrap up your business here.

255
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,755
What's the matter now?

256
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:11,050
If you got eyes, look around you.

257
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,179
This place's gathering dust
can't even cover the electricity bills.

258
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,970
I didn't put you in charge
to run chores for chump change.

259
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,772
We're hiring good dancers,
so the sales will go up soon.

260
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:30,069
No, I'm dropping the cabaret, so look elsewhere.

261
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:34,908
You know we're here to pay you
the laundromat debt.

262
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:40,496
Before I tell Mr. Kang
about what you do here, pack up.

263
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:52,216
Oh honey! Baby!

264
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,427
- Feels good?
- So good!

265
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,599
Let's sell more land!

266
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,518
- Look at that swindler.
- We'll do great things!

267
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:06,688
Holy shit! What the fuck?!

268
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,526
- Who... are you?
- Hello there.

269
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,829
I'm your father, asshole!

270
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:13,943
You piece of shit!

271
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:18,367
Her husband's earning dollars for our country!

272
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,371
And what do you do, you filthy...

273
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:23,498
I'm gonna fucking kill you. Come with me!

274
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:26,208
Hold still, asshole!

275
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,521
Where's the deed?

276
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:28,711
What?

277
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:32,214
You got it from her. Where is it?

278
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:33,841
What do you mean?

279
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,509
Oh yeah?

280
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:38,720
What should we do with him?

281
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:43,309
We gotta follow the Saudi law.

282
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,937
An eye for an eye, a dick for a dick.

283
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,398
Fucking douchebag!

284
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:54,361
Do you still call yourself a fucking man?

285
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:00,910
Pull it out.

286
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,077
Why are you doing this...

287
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:04,580
Let me see your balls, asshole!

288
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,760
Sir! Sir! I don't have the deed!

289
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,928
I sold it...

290
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:15,132
Excuse me, ladies and gents.

291
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:17,676
Who's Madame Min?

292
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:19,220
What's this about?

293
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,389
I'm from the Gimhae Kim gang.

294
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:26,727
I'd hate to ruin this brunch.
Should we talk elsewhere?

295
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:34,234
Heard about the missing hotel owner?

296
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:38,696
Was it you?

297
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:46,163
The ownership of Daewong Hotel
was changed to your boy.

298
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:47,663
Coincidence?

299
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:54,380
I'm a businessman now. I don't order hits anymore.

300
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,925
You insubordinate bastard!

301
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,638
Businessman?

302
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:08,143
I created a monster by giving a hooligan a suit.

303
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:14,942
Look here, Yang.

304
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:20,322
Even a prick like you
shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you.

305
00:23:20,322 --> 00:23:24,243
I won't say it again. Revert the hotel ownership.

306
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:26,662
I wish I could,

307
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:29,832
but it's out of my hands now.

308
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:33,127
Heading up MD clan was an ego booster, huh?

309
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:36,254
Should I pull out my knife for once?

310
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:45,306
Councilor Suh.

311
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:49,977
The one took over the hotel is Councilor Park.

312
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:51,770
Councilor Park?

313
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,074
I'm back.

314
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:05,784
Welcome.

315
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:08,662
Have you had dinner?

316
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:11,665
Not yet. I was waiting for you.

317
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,669
Where's Sun Hye?

318
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,170
Off for the night.

319
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:19,632
Things okay on your end?

320
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:22,551
Factories are shutting down due to recession.

321
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:26,012
We're okay.

322
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:28,556
That's good.

323
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:31,935
Not easy finding work nowadays.

324
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,273
Oh yeah.

325
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:38,984
Today was payday.

326
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:43,280
Even got bonus this month.

327
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,295
Don't give me that anymore.

328
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:50,078
Start thinking about your future.

329
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:52,913
I'm good.

330
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:04,551
What's with the feast?

331
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:07,221
On the best table, no less.

332
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:09,932
Today's your birthday.

333
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:11,266
Birthday?

334
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:13,227
I don't have one.

335
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:14,937
There's nothing to it.

336
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:17,939
It's a chance for a family to share a meal.

337
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:22,611
You joined our family on this day.

338
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:28,492
You were born at some point
and I felt bad about skipping it.

339
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:31,203
You didn't have to.

340
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:33,622
I know things aren't good.

341
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:37,209
Come on, try the seaweed soup.

342
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,709
Okay.

343
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:44,341
Delicious!

344
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:48,679
I put my heart into it, so eat every last drop.

345
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,765
You're ready to be a housewife.

346
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:57,062
When will you and Chang Bae get a promotion?

347
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:59,282
I'm not sure yet.

348
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,151
Is that meat?

349
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:11,326
If you wanted to start over,
then do it in the boonies.

350
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:16,540
Why come to Seoul and
start a cleaner with my money?

351
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,833
You're a thorn in my side!

352
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:24,465
I helped you out for the sake of Don Nam,

353
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:27,050
but even my patience has an end.

354
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:31,972
The way you look now, you'll never repay that debt.

355
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:37,644
I'll get another loan if I have to,

356
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:39,313
give me some time.

357
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:43,566
Gangsters shouldn't wash clothes.

358
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:47,362
If you don't clear out by next week,

359
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:50,991
I'll burn everything here!

360
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:52,659
Just wait and see.

361
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:35,674
Couldn't we...

362
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:39,255
go live down in the south?

363
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,638
Anything will be better than now.

364
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:51,476
People are coming to Seoul
because there's nothing else.

365
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,394
So what then?

366
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:57,316
Just be patient.

367
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:05,681
Councilor Suh's one thing,
but Jang will not let this slide.

368
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:08,005
- Don't drop your guard.
- Yes, Boss.

369
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:12,114

00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,303
Honey, I have to go.

550
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:01,808
Already?

551
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:04,101
Yang's coming in today.

552
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:07,814
Eat everything there.

553
00:40:07,814 --> 00:40:09,357
I'm off.

554
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,638
Yong Gi.

555
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,138
Been a while.

556
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,838
Good night.

557
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:29,311

558
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,232
Oh, hey.

559
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:35,276
Coming home now? It's late.

560
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:38,612
I was at Jung Min's place.

561
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:43,868
Why didn't he drop you off at home?

562
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,414
I wanted to get off here.

563
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:52,084
I didn't tell him about the laundromat.

564
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:58,132
It'll all come out eventually.

565
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:03,763
I should delay the wedding.

566
00:42:05,098 --> 00:42:06,598
Why?

567
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:12,088
We're so much in debt
and I don't want to burden him.

568
00:42:14,773 --> 00:42:19,528
Just focus on the wedding.
I'll take care of the debt.

569
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:23,950
Came for a show?!

570
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,618
Don't leave anything!

571

Get the furniture too.

Get everything out!

575
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:37,923
Sure.

576
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,716
Go back to your fucking life!

00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:41,718
Go away! I'll fucking beat you!

00:42:41,718 --> 00:42:43,303
Get everything out!

Don't you ever bother us again.

592
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,117
If you do,

593
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,328
I will kill you.

594
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,128
It's not Chang Bae's fault.

595
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:02,715
I convinced him to leave the factory with me.

596
00:44:04,384 --> 00:44:07,553
I'm sorry for deceiving you all this time.

597
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,850
But now that you know trust me with this,

598
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,855
I'll rebuild our clan and bring you back.

599

Why do you think I left that life behind?

600
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:29,366
I was cuffed and stabbed in front of my daughter.

601
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:34,747
How can I call myself a father?

602
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:41,295
Even if you're penniless, live like a human first.

603
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:44,518
That is all.

604
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:49,357
Boss, laundry will earn you $5 a day.

605
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,474
When will we live like humans?

606
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:09,990
Welcome, Boss!

607

Get him out.

614

00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:40,498
Stop wasting our time and spill it.

621
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:44,418
Did you kill Daewong Hotel's Yoon?

622
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:46,337
I saw him a few times.

623
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,047
What?

624
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:49,882
Let me go.

625
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,193
I'll look the other way.

626
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:55,278
You son of a bitch!

627
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,432
Boss.

628
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:00,935
He's got Suh's support. Why not let him go?

629
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:03,729
Okay, bring him out.

630
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,367
We got everything. Let's jet.

631
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:19,537
I gotta see this through. See you back home.

632
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:20,914
- What the hell!
- I'll be back.

633
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:23,917
Where are you going, Jong Dae?

634
00:47:26,918 --> 00:47:28,921
I'm breaking sweat, thanks to him.

635
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:31,090

Whatever happens, it'll get solved quickly.

650
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:50,335
You disobedient bastard!

651
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:54,339
You have the balls to utter those words?!

652
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:56,800
Go look for him!

- Jong Dae!

654

655
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:18,322
I'm fine, sir.

656
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:21,825
It's late. Please head back.

657
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:31,388
Even if you go back to MD, don't mention Jong Dae.

658
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:33,878
Of course not.

659
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:38,633
Good evening.

About what?

662
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:59,238
How could you also be in a gang?

663
00:49:59,238 --> 00:50:02,033
Be thankful that I'm not a bank robber.

664
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:04,117
Same shit.

665
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:08,998
Why were they after you?

666
00:50:08,998 --> 00:50:11,250
It's a feud over some land. Don't worry.

667
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,127
Did you look for me?

668
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,133
I held memorial services for you.

669
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,828
I thought you were dead.

670
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:24,638
Fucking bastard, you prayed for me to disappear.

671
00:50:24,638 --> 00:50:27,182
Where the heck did you go?

672
00:50:29,351 --> 00:50:31,395
I took the wrong bus.

673
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:34,606

Didn't want to die as a ragman.

676
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:43,783

678

I'll give you half.

681

Fuck you. You haven't changed.

682
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:09,308
I'm serious, I'm not the same man.

683
00:51:09,308 --> 00:51:12,187

Sure.

He's really well-known in real estate.

736
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,314
It's time for you to spread your wings.

737
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,507
Those in power won't easily give that up.

738
00:54:51,726 --> 00:54:54,773
I got into politics unexpectedly,

739
00:54:54,773 --> 00:54:58,619
but the ardor one can overwhelm it.

00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:06,017

741
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:08,814
Councilor Suh?

742
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:13,046
Our country's going to shit.

743
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:16,661
You sons of bitches!

744
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:20,138
Is this the cocktail revolution?

745
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:26,801
While the country sleeps,
you're sucking on whore tits?!

746
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:35,416
Who suggested using the gang
to trash the convention?

747
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,692
I took the heat for the entire ordeal!

748
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:42,455
You should at least feel grateful
for what I've done!

749
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:45,619
So what do you want?

750
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:49,374
Let Jang go, if you don't want trouble.

751
00:55:52,247 --> 00:55:54,435
As your friend, I'll make this clear.

752
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:58,901
Don't align your business with petty gangsters.

753
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:03,254
You won't rejoin the party,
let alone secure a nomination.

754
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:13,304
Hey Park, you ain't the only with clout in Gangnam.

755
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:17,130
Stop investigating him.

756
00:56:34,988 --> 00:56:40,117
When I came across Yong Gi, I saw him.

757
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:43,037
Who?

758
00:56:44,743 --> 00:56:47,621
The one who stabbed you.

759
00:56:48,543 --> 00:56:51,879
He was under Jang.

760
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,637
Jang killed Don Nam, didn't he?

761
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:05,852
Wasn't Suh supposed
to hand out the business permits?

762
00:57:05,852 --> 00:57:07,270
What're you implying?

763
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:12,525
Is that why Jang and Yang killed Don Nam?

764
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:18,323
That's bullshit. Why do you care?

765
00:57:18,323 --> 00:57:20,449
How could I not?

766
00:57:21,534 --> 00:57:24,078
Who led us to this shithole?

767
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:28,833
You knew, didn't you?

768
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,658
It's all in the past.

769
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,659
Let it go.

770
00:57:39,886 --> 00:57:41,887
We need our debt back.

771
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:48,894
Aren't you even mad about your leg?

772
00:57:51,856 --> 00:57:58,863
You must really be mad
now that you've tasted money.

773
00:57:59,655 --> 00:58:00,745
Mr. Kang!

774
00:58:00,745 --> 00:58:04,417
If you keep at it, you and I are done.

775
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:22,707
What a load of bull!

776
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,709
What's wrong with a laundromat?

777
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:28,379
If they're so ashamed, why bother?

778
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:31,424
I won't send you off like this.

779
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,801
Call it off!

780
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:35,011
Daddy.

781
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,347
It's not an unreasonable request.

782
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:43,853
We just don't have to mention it
during the wedding.

783
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:48,274
You must be so desperate to leave.

784
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,453
It's hard enough with the debt.

785
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:51,954
Call it off!

786
00:59:32,707 --> 00:59:36,544
You know you're not supposed to be here.

787
00:59:36,544 --> 00:59:40,214
You were unreachable for days, how could I not?

788
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:43,217
What's this about?

789
00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:47,096
Yang wants me to move in.

790
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:51,142
He bought an apartment under my name.

791
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:54,395
Just say you won't.

792
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:56,605
Tell him yourself.

793
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:00,567
Why?

794
01:00:01,568 --> 01:00:03,278
Are you scared?

795
01:00:04,822 --> 01:00:11,078
You're the one who seduced him.
This is your problem.

796
01:00:12,664 --> 01:00:14,164
What?

797
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:20,216
Mr. Baek, you're a real bastard.

798
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,261
Hey.

799
01:00:22,261 --> 01:00:23,715
Hey!

800
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,885
So Jung!

801
01:00:25,885 --> 01:00:28,596
- What's with you?
- Like you don't know?

802
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:34,102
I'm sorry. I have plans, so be patient.

803
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:35,353
Forget it!

804
01:00:35,353 --> 01:00:37,355
So Jung.

805
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:38,939
Honey!

806
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:46,512
Hey, Yong Gi.

807
01:00:53,268 --> 01:00:55,521
Why's it so hard to see you?

808
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:56,607
What's up?

809
01:00:56,607 --> 01:01:01,947
We never finished our last conversation.

810
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:04,701
Now there's another wrinkle.

811
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:05,925
What wrinkle?

812
01:01:05,925 --> 01:01:08,219
Who does she belong to?

813
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:09,767
Is So Jung...

814
01:01:10,554 --> 01:01:14,058
our boss's bitch? Or yours?

815
01:01:14,058 --> 01:01:15,851
What exactly is she?

816
01:01:17,462 --> 01:01:20,090
Should I ask the boss?

817
01:01:31,575 --> 01:01:33,202
Yong Gi...

818
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:36,038
Don't be so greedy.

819
01:01:36,038 --> 01:01:39,125
Us, henchmen, have to stick together.

820
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,084
I'm on your side.

821
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,629
What do you want?

822
01:01:43,629 --> 01:01:47,608
Keep managing the hotel. I'll count the money.

823
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:54,752
Hard hat for you, Gucci for me.

824
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,132
I'm a fucking gangster!

825
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,444
You fucking dope fiend!

826
01:02:02,444 --> 01:02:06,041
Are you nuts? This is insane.

827
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:11,401
Listen. How long must we go after the little guys?

828
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:15,924
Let's remove Jang and go to the major league.

829
01:02:15,924 --> 01:02:20,508
Chauffeuring the madame gave you ideas?

830
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:23,143
You think YDP clan is a kiddie club?

831
01:02:23,143 --> 01:02:26,706
How can we accomplish that?

832
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:29,000
I heard that Jang's captured.

833
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,295
I didn't see his minions either.

834
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:34,964
I can't believe what you're saying!

835
01:02:34,964 --> 01:02:37,467
What do you propose?

836
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:40,135
We can't go head-to-head.

837
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,847
This is our best shot.

838
01:02:54,425 --> 01:02:57,053
Hey, what's going on?

839
01:02:57,053 --> 01:02:58,888
Why didn't you come in?

840
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:04,684
What is it?

841
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:07,938
What's with your hand?

842
01:03:14,209 --> 01:03:16,024
I'm fucked.

843
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,238
I killed my own.

844
01:03:21,238 --> 01:03:23,115
What?

845
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:25,492
I must have snapped.

846
01:03:26,326 --> 01:03:29,497
When I came to, I thought of you.

847
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:31,415
What do I do?

848
01:04:01,362 --> 01:04:03,113
What now?

849
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:06,242
Gotta find a way.

850
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:09,245
Maybe join you.

851
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:12,832
Shit, it's so fucked up.

852
01:04:12,832 --> 01:04:15,960
I've reached so far...

853
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,629
Join me.

854
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:20,465
You can't handle me.

855
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:26,095
If Yang finds out, he won't let you breathe.

856
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,595
Bro.

857
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,226
Let's go to YDP.

858
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:39,691
If we join Suh, even Yang can't touch us.

859
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:10,343
I heard you have a career-minded son.

860
01:05:14,068 --> 01:05:18,447
He's supposed to come. He must be running late.

861
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,018
What the fuck...

862
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:28,653
What the fuck!

863
01:07:46,205 --> 01:07:50,584
I know you're good at reading people.

864
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,977
How about him?

865
01:07:53,977 --> 01:07:56,938
Doesn't have a traitor's eyes.

866
01:07:56,938 --> 01:07:58,439
Right?

867
01:07:59,315 --> 01:08:02,861
I really like how he handled my jobs.

868
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:06,989
I'll let you two talk alone.

869
01:08:10,493 --> 01:08:12,161
Kim Jong Dae, is it?

870
01:08:13,496 --> 01:08:15,373
- Have a drink.
- Yes, sir.

871
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:17,041
Thank you.

872
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,425
We've crossed paths once, sir.

873
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:26,925
Where?

874
01:08:27,718 --> 01:08:30,096
At Don Nam's funeral, sir.

875
01:08:30,096 --> 01:08:33,899
I serve Mr. Kang Kil Su.

876
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:35,817
Kang Kil Su?

877
01:08:36,519 --> 01:08:38,980
You're one of his?

878
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,982
Yes, sir.

879
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:43,693
Then you must know Jang.

880
01:08:43,693 --> 01:08:45,715
A little bit, sir.

881
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:53,369
Will you be okay? He'll be hard to handle.

882
01:08:54,454 --> 01:08:56,539
He's already taken care of.

883
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:57,613
What?

884
01:08:57,613 --> 01:09:03,672
He won't be dragging you down anymore.

885
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:07,592
Sir, please give me a shot.

886
01:09:08,885 --> 01:09:12,889
Gangsters are used and tossed, am I right?

887
01:09:35,453 --> 01:09:37,414
You idiot...

888
01:09:37,414 --> 01:09:40,125
Who asked you to do this?

889
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,085
Got a death wish?!

890
01:09:42,085 --> 01:09:44,587
Son of a bitch...

891
01:09:44,587 --> 01:09:47,757
You really tied my hands.

892
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:53,680
If you're so desperate to be a gangster, leave.

893
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,473
Get the hell out!

894
01:10:02,605 --> 01:10:04,190
Mr. Kang.

895
01:10:06,609 --> 01:10:11,781
As a member of your clan, I'll be working for Suh.

896
01:10:12,699 --> 01:10:18,204
Please forget this shop and join YDP with me.

897
01:10:32,801 --> 01:10:37,807
He's succeeding Jang as head of YDP,

898
01:10:37,807 --> 01:10:39,609
so play nice.

899
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:41,151
Yes, sir!

900
01:10:41,936 --> 01:10:43,772
Now!

901
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:47,859
For Councilor Suh and our new boss!

902
01:10:47,859 --> 01:10:50,069
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

903
01:10:55,075 --> 01:10:57,327
Where's Kil Su?

904
01:10:57,327 --> 01:10:59,453
He'll join us shortly.

905
01:11:09,088 --> 01:11:10,673
Yes, very good. Great!

906
01:11:10,673 --> 01:11:13,009
The friend behind the groom.

907
01:11:13,009 --> 01:11:15,011
Polka dot lady, point your chin a bit.

908
01:11:15,011 --> 01:11:17,055
Turn your face a little.

909
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:19,766
Great, here we go! Smile!

910
01:11:19,766 --> 01:11:22,977
One, two, three!

911
01:11:22,977 --> 01:11:26,022
Okay, here we go!

912
01:11:26,022 --> 01:11:28,525
Look happy!

913
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:31,361
The groom looks too happy!

914
01:11:31,361 --> 01:11:35,031
One, two, three!

915
01:11:35,031 --> 01:11:37,033
Lovely!

916
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:54,050
They don't suspect a thing.

917
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,802
They're all busy with the Councilor Park job.

918
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:02,391
It's not safe, you're stepping on a mine.

919
01:12:03,268 --> 01:12:06,563
While at it, let's hit Yang too.

920
01:12:06,563 --> 01:12:07,594
What?

921
01:12:07,594 --> 01:12:10,733
We're already knee deep in shit.

922
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:14,445
We can take over MD businesses.

923
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:17,948
I'm not interested in that.

924
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:23,742
I didn't join YDP for a turf war.

925
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:25,915
Then what?

926
01:12:25,915 --> 01:12:29,502
Remember how hard it was without a room?

927
01:12:29,502 --> 01:12:35,424
I'm gonna help Suh and buy up tons of land.

928
01:12:37,427 --> 01:12:40,013
So join me.

929
01:12:40,013 --> 01:12:44,184
You can build a nice condo there.

930
01:12:44,184 --> 01:12:47,978
All right. I'll think about it.

931
01:12:49,647 --> 01:12:52,525
Bro, watch me.

932
01:12:55,111 --> 01:13:00,157
It'll be my land, as far as I can reach!

933
01:13:02,784 --> 01:13:04,204
All right!

934
01:13:04,204 --> 01:13:08,625
Land for you money for me! Let's go all the way!

935
01:13:31,355 --> 01:13:33,233
Slow and smooth.

936
01:13:33,233 --> 01:13:35,151
Quick!

937
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:36,945
Quick!

938
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,654
Stop!

939
01:13:41,156 --> 01:13:45,453
You guys need a bootcamp training!

940
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:47,163
You call that dance?

941
01:13:47,163 --> 01:13:49,791
You got blue balls?

942
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,793
You need pelvic thrust!

943
01:13:51,793 --> 01:13:55,338
How will you seduce Gangnam cougars like this?

944
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:57,340
Feel the mood.

945
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,634
And down she goes.

946
01:14:01,552 --> 01:14:03,763
Next up!

947
01:14:03,763 --> 01:14:06,099
Use your thigh!

948
01:14:06,099 --> 01:14:08,393
Rub into her crotch and boom!

949
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:10,687
Ow!

950
01:14:10,687 --> 01:14:12,813
Now.

951
01:14:16,484 --> 01:14:19,820
Put one of these in your pocket.

952
01:14:20,863 --> 01:14:22,364
And hit it.

953
01:14:23,865 --> 01:14:27,670
Out comes her deed.

954
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,705

Heard of Chairman Hur at Husam Construction?

Yes.

971
01:15:56,876 --> 01:16:01,506
You can't go to Gangnam
without stepping on his land.

972
01:16:01,506 --> 01:16:07,595
This is his Yeoksam lot. The deal isn't going well.

973
01:16:08,637 --> 01:16:14,143
Since it's City Development division's,
it'd be weird if it wasn't.

974
01:16:18,314 --> 01:16:24,695
I'll hand over any troubling deals to you,
so take care of them.

975
01:16:24,695 --> 01:16:26,464
Yes, Boss.

976
01:16:26,464 --> 01:16:29,299
If you don't own the land, you must vacate!

977
01:16:30,476 --> 01:16:33,979
You have to defect before it's too late.

978
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,649
One false move and it's all over.

979
01:16:38,516 --> 01:16:40,603
Let's just stay.

980
01:16:40,603 --> 01:16:41,970
Sir?

981
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:44,982
Kyung Pyo's incident will be buried.

982
01:16:44,982 --> 01:16:47,485
There's no good reason to work for Jong Dae.

983
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:51,989
I'll just become one of his damn minions.

984
01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:56,118
But we have to use him to snap Yang's neck.

985
01:16:57,495 --> 01:17:00,665
Yang ain't that easy.

986
01:17:00,665 --> 01:17:05,670
Then will you give up removing him?

987
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:08,339
Gotta use Jong Dae for that.

988
01:17:08,339 --> 01:17:11,008
He's crazy about lands,

989
01:17:11,008 --> 01:17:16,305
so he'll take Yang's seat
if we slip him Park's insider info.

990
01:17:17,682 --> 01:17:19,225
Sir, wake up!

991
01:17:19,225 --> 01:17:22,228
Get up! Come on! Wake the fuck up!

992
01:17:22,228 --> 01:17:24,737
Get up! Now!

What the fuck did you do?

995
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,578
Good work.

996
01:17:37,578 --> 01:17:40,456
Stay out of sight for a while.

997
01:17:49,179 --> 01:17:51,890
Your son did a lot of drugs.

998
01:17:52,808 --> 01:17:57,813
This could interfere with our shop,
so we'll keep it under wraps.

999
01:18:01,445 --> 01:18:05,367
Have you contacted her family?

1000
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:07,744
She doesn't have any.

1001
01:18:08,437 --> 01:18:10,524
How much will do?

1002
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:14,611
Chairman Hur, didn't you buy some Yeoksam lands?

1003
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,875
[Ownership Certificate]
You did better than Jang.

1004
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:20,337
How did you get to Hur?

1005
01:18:20,337 --> 01:18:23,948
He loves his son more than anything.

1006
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:25,533
Great work.

1007
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:30,452
But it's still not nearly enough.

1008
01:18:37,885 --> 01:18:44,351
It's gotta be significant to
convince the party to take me back.

1009
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:48,064
Real estate is still the best way
to make big bucks.

1010
01:18:48,064 --> 01:18:50,467
I'll try my best.

1011
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,971
There's no time.

1012
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:58,602
If we had some leads, we could go all in.

1013
01:18:58,602 --> 01:19:00,250
Leads, sir?

1014
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,420
An insider info! Firm source!

1015
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:05,004
Let's go.

1016
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,109
Who has Hur's deed?

1017
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:27,652
Kang Kil Su?

1018
01:19:27,652 --> 01:19:30,321
Speak, you fuck!

1019
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:37,078
How dare you pull the rug under us!

01:19:37,078 --> 01:19:38,830
Where's Kang?

1021
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:43,459
After offing Jang,
what deal have you made with Suh?

1022
01:19:44,459 --> 01:19:46,838
It's in Suh's hands already.

1023
01:19:46,838 --> 01:19:48,924
There's no point in finding Kang.

1024
01:19:48,924 --> 01:19:51,510
You fucking piece of shit!

1025
01:19:55,847 --> 01:20:00,921
Call YDP and tell them to bring Hur's deed.

1026
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,434
They'll bring it to save one of their own.

1027
01:20:04,434 --> 01:20:05,935
Yes, Boss.

1028
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,058
- Is Jong Dae safe?
- Yes.

1029
01:20:15,058 --> 01:20:17,018
I got a call from them.

1030
01:20:17,018 --> 01:20:18,937
Why are they asking for a deed?

1031
01:20:18,937 --> 01:20:22,941
I slipped real estate tip. It must've turned bad.

01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:47,382
Sure, I'll make a fresh pot.

1036
01:20:47,382 --> 01:20:50,893
Not for me. We have to treat our guest.

1037
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:54,977
- Eat and get ready.
- Yes, Boss!

1038
01:20:59,978 --> 01:21:03,314
Get the tools. It's almost time.

1039
01:21:03,314 --> 01:21:05,024

1040
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,318

What?

1074
01:24:59,383 --> 01:25:03,888
He may've offed Kyung Pyo
and leaked info to Kang.

1079

I'm working on it, so please be patient.

1080
01:25:23,241 --> 01:25:28,642

I won!

1097
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:41,277
Bra off! Here we go!

1098
01:26:41,277 --> 01:26:43,362
Mr. Moon.

1099
01:26:43,362 --> 01:26:46,698
Have a drink. I can't bear to watch.

1100
01:26:48,743 --> 01:26:52,204
You're more modest than I expected.

1101
01:26:54,081 --> 01:26:57,877
By the way, Jamsil is a sandy field.

1102
01:26:57,877 --> 01:27:00,004
Just buy it up.

1103
01:27:00,004 --> 01:27:03,799
Sandy fields become gold fields.

1104
01:27:03,799 --> 01:27:09,263
Your pen moves mountains, so I'll hold you to that.

1105
01:27:09,263 --> 01:27:13,399
Sometimes, valleys too!

1106
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:15,693
Sweetie!

1107
01:27:25,713 --> 01:27:27,754
Where's Yang?

1108
01:27:27,754 --> 01:27:29,339
He just left.

1109
01:27:35,146 --> 01:27:37,273
Don't make me do this again.

1110
01:27:39,327 --> 01:27:40,828
So Jung.

1111
01:27:42,547 --> 01:27:46,115
Wasn't this Park's private business?

1112
01:27:46,115 --> 01:27:48,888
He's working under an order.

1113
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:51,810
And I'm the architect.

1114
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:56,481
It'll all turn to gold when the plan is announced.

1115
01:27:56,481 --> 01:27:58,941
If this leaks, we're both dead.

1116
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,362
Shit...

1117
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:05,156
So they're finally coming to Gangnam.

1118
01:28:07,218 --> 01:28:09,261
Let's not touch Park.

1119
01:28:10,923 --> 01:28:13,425
I think he's got powerful connections.

1120
01:28:15,376 --> 01:28:17,920
Risky moves pay off big.

1121
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,215
But it's too dangerous.

1122
01:28:21,215 --> 01:28:23,801
Join us before it's too late.

1123
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:27,953
Mr. Kang's joining YDP.

1124
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:36,563
I wanted to do this properly,
but I dragged him in.

1125
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:40,798
Boss, it's me.

1126
01:28:42,737 --> 01:28:46,824
We got a situation. The cops rounded up everyone!

1127
01:28:46,824 --> 01:28:48,618
What?

1128
01:28:48,618 --> 01:28:50,369
It's probably because of Suh.

1129
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:51,537
Where's Mr. Kang?

1130
01:28:51,537 --> 01:28:53,331
He turned himself in in your place.

1131
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:55,708
You have to take off!

1132
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:57,208
Hey!

1133
01:28:58,544 --> 01:29:00,087
- Calm down!
- Move aside.

1134
01:29:00,087 --> 01:29:03,007
- And do what?!
- I gotta go to the station.

1135
01:29:03,007 --> 01:29:04,967
You fuck!

1136
01:29:07,428 --> 01:29:10,931
Bastard, what will that do?

1137
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:15,144
I even got stabbed to get to where I am!

1138
01:29:20,873 --> 01:29:24,418
- Turn around.
- Hurry up!

1139
01:29:25,696 --> 01:29:27,406
Raise your heads.

1140
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:30,659
Yo, Kang Kil Su.

1141
01:29:36,332 --> 01:29:38,751
Shame on you.

1142
01:29:38,751 --> 01:29:43,214
Leeching off honest farmers at your age.

1143
01:29:43,214 --> 01:29:45,507
Stand up straight, assholes!

1144
01:29:50,492 --> 01:29:53,828
[20 Kang Kil Su clan members arrested]

1145
01:29:56,957 --> 01:29:59,084
[Prolific politicians involved
in real estate corruption.]

1146
01:29:59,084 --> 01:30:02,837
[Kang Kil Su]

1147
01:30:13,807 --> 01:30:15,307
Who is it?

1148
01:30:22,315 --> 01:30:23,858
Sun Hye?

1149
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:28,211
What's wrong?

1150
01:30:28,211 --> 01:30:30,532
What happened to your face?

1151
01:30:30,532 --> 01:30:32,325
Sun Hye.

1152
01:30:32,325 --> 01:30:34,202
Who was it?

1153
01:30:34,953 --> 01:30:36,579
Who did this to you?

1154
01:30:37,588 --> 01:30:39,297
Jong Dae...

1155
01:30:50,075 --> 01:30:54,418
If she's from a gangster family,
at least be obedient.

1156
01:30:54,418 --> 01:30:56,713
My company isn't doing well.

1157
01:30:56,713 --> 01:30:59,425
What's wrong with getting her to get some money?

1158
01:30:59,425 --> 01:31:02,177
I got fed up and slapped her!

1159
01:31:06,276 --> 01:31:08,486
This will calm you down.

1160
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:10,989
What is it?

1161
01:31:10,989 --> 01:31:15,118
A small contribution to your business.

1162
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:18,813
Brother-in-law.

1163
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:20,564
Don't ever...

1164
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:24,127
hit her.

1165
01:31:26,922 --> 01:31:28,464
Boss.

1166
01:31:29,961 --> 01:31:31,838
Councilor Suh's out.

1167
01:31:38,683 --> 01:31:41,102
Taxi! Taxi!

1168
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:47,233
This is far more dangerous than Hur's son job.

1169
01:31:48,318 --> 01:31:53,448
If we can get a solid lead,
Suh will help free Mr. Kang.

1170
01:31:53,448 --> 01:31:55,200
- No mistakes.
- Are you okay?

1171
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,077
What the hell!

1172
01:31:57,077 --> 01:32:00,080
I didn't see you there.

1173
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,749
I'm sorry, are you hurt?

1174
01:32:02,749 --> 01:32:04,501
Are you okay?

1175
01:32:04,501 --> 01:32:08,213
Ma'am, I'll take care of this. Please go ahead.

1176
01:32:08,213 --> 01:32:09,381
You'll be late.

1177
01:32:09,381 --> 01:32:12,592
How can I just leave when a man is hurt?

1178
01:32:12,592 --> 01:32:15,344
Tell them I'm not coming.

1179
01:32:18,431 --> 01:32:22,310
I bumped up the amount on the contract by 10%.

1180
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:24,312
Here is the difference.

1181
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,690
Good.

1182
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:30,819
Have them under my boy's name.

1183
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:32,153
Yes, sir.

1184
01:32:32,153 --> 01:32:34,572
It'll have a nice view.

1185
01:32:46,344 --> 01:32:48,003
Here.

1186
01:32:48,003 --> 01:32:49,838
Park's bank statement.

1187
01:32:49,838 --> 01:32:51,798
Great work.

1188
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:40,733
Take the picture.

1189
01:33:43,528 --> 01:33:46,114
Wake up, fuckers!

1190
01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:47,824
Holy shit!

1191
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,245
What's going on!

1192
01:33:55,874 --> 01:33:58,334
Who are you?!

1193
01:34:02,881 --> 01:34:05,967
What a piece of work.

1194
01:34:07,052 --> 01:34:09,888
A man's wife is not enough,
you take the driver too?

1195
01:34:09,888 --> 01:34:15,227
I apologize for the madame,
but I didn't sleep with the man!

1196
01:34:15,227 --> 01:34:17,627
I'm not into men, I swear!

1197
01:34:17,627 --> 01:34:21,839
You did the drugs but I hallucinated?

1198
01:34:23,455 --> 01:34:26,738
Report him to the police,

1199
01:34:26,738 --> 01:34:29,241
and send these to his wife and the city hall.

1200
01:34:29,241 --> 01:34:30,909
Yes, sir.

1201
01:34:30,909 --> 01:34:32,577
Please don't!

1202
01:34:32,577 --> 01:34:35,330
Don't do this. I'll be slaughtered!

1203
01:34:36,415 --> 01:34:39,250
Please, I'm begging you!

1204
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:43,863
Conniving bastards...

1205
01:34:43,863 --> 01:34:46,824
They've been playing monopoly by themselves.

1206
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,600
We kept a low profile
there won't be any repercussion.

1207
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,545
- Good job.
- Not at all, sir.

1208
01:34:55,684 --> 01:35:02,065
When do you think Mr. Kang
and my family will be out?

1209
01:35:02,065 --> 01:35:05,754
You caught a big one and I'll do my part.

1210
01:35:05,754 --> 01:35:08,258
I'll get on it right away.

1211
01:35:08,258 --> 01:35:10,051
Thank you, sir.

1212
01:35:11,055 --> 01:35:13,645
Goddammit...

1213
01:35:13,645 --> 01:35:16,649
After the party donation, my funds are dry.

1214
01:35:16,649 --> 01:35:20,069
Madame Min, pick one.

1215
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:24,963
How about Dogok by Yangjae stream?

1216
01:35:24,963 --> 01:35:26,715
Buy that one first.

1217
01:35:26,715 --> 01:35:28,425
Why there?

1218
01:35:28,425 --> 01:35:33,263
A feng shui expert told me
he felt mighty force from there.

1219
01:35:33,263 --> 01:35:37,851
Even a shack there could become a palace.

1220
01:35:37,851 --> 01:35:39,063
Say what?

1221
01:35:39,063 --> 01:35:41,980
It's a treasure cove of a land.

1222
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:43,648
Once in a lifetime chance.

1223
01:35:43,648 --> 01:35:45,650
Is that so?

1224
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:51,823
I'll empty my pockets
and buy up this region then.

1225
01:35:51,823 --> 01:35:57,579
But MD's already working on the best lands.

1226
01:35:57,579 --> 01:36:01,291
Park won't let it slide if we snatch them up.

1227
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:05,323
Let's deal with this problem
and face the consequences later.

1228
01:36:05,323 --> 01:36:08,492
If we get the capital, there's no backlash.

1229
01:36:17,116 --> 01:36:19,202
Hey.

1230
01:36:19,202 --> 01:36:24,290
Cream of the crop belongs to Yang.
What will you do?

1231
01:36:27,502 --> 01:36:31,172
If you want the goods, you'll have to face him.

1232
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:38,254
Once my boys get out, let's get on it.

1233
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:44,852
Sources of the fund are unknown,

1234
01:36:44,852 --> 01:36:47,961
and he's been siphoning party funds.

1235
01:36:49,857 --> 01:36:51,985
Where did you get this?

1236
01:36:51,985 --> 01:36:54,856
Park has numerous enemies.

1237
01:36:54,856 --> 01:36:56,556
Heard of "10-Man Association"?

1238
01:36:57,584 --> 01:37:01,297
They're already scheming the next election.

1239
01:37:01,297 --> 01:37:04,300
With Park at the helm.

1240
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:09,482
Director.

1241
01:37:09,482 --> 01:37:12,569
One can get into business with gangs,

1242
01:37:12,569 --> 01:37:15,323
but one mustn't sell his soul doing it.

1243
01:37:15,323 --> 01:37:21,750
With my loyalty to you,
I'll clean up this mess and win the election.

1244
01:37:29,374 --> 01:37:31,334
Thank you for toughing it out.

1245
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:33,378
Let's drink.

1246
01:37:33,378 --> 01:37:35,158
Cheers.

1247
01:37:35,158 --> 01:37:36,951
Cheers!

1248
01:37:46,856 --> 01:37:51,110
Listen to me carefully.

1249
01:37:51,778 --> 01:37:53,696
You've endured so much.

1250
01:37:53,696 --> 01:38:00,536
You've functioned as my family,
but I never acted like the boss.

1251
01:38:00,536 --> 01:38:03,331
Some of you may have heard in the joint,

1252
01:38:03,331 --> 01:38:05,666
but as of today,

1253
01:38:06,793 --> 01:38:08,419
we're done.

1254
01:38:09,587 --> 01:38:12,631
I'm handing over the business to Suwon.

1255
01:38:13,424 --> 01:38:15,843
You're all free to move.

1256
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:19,263
Whose name is it under, asshole!

1257
01:38:19,263 --> 01:38:21,557
Please, stop it!

1258
01:38:24,393 --> 01:38:28,439
Boss, we don't need to work these minions.

1259
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:32,026
I'm certain Kang took Moon's lot number.

1260
01:38:32,026 --> 01:38:35,071
They covered up the land owner identities.

1261
01:38:35,071 --> 01:38:37,907
Names were relayed a few times, so it wasn't easy.

1262
01:38:37,907 --> 01:38:40,243
But Kang's locked up.

1263
01:38:40,243 --> 01:38:42,995
It must be his minion Jong Dae.

1264
01:38:42,995 --> 01:38:45,456
And Kang's out.

1265
01:38:45,456 --> 01:38:47,542
Goddammit...

1266
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:50,002
Where's the leak?

1267
01:38:50,002 --> 01:38:54,923
Boss, before Park finds out,
why not finish off YDP?

1268
01:38:56,925 --> 01:39:01,264
What are you doing? Why kick them out now?

1269
01:39:01,264 --> 01:39:03,933
You wanted me back in command.

1270
01:39:03,933 --> 01:39:06,477
The boss can do whatever he pleases.

1271
01:39:06,477 --> 01:39:10,857
Mr. Kang, this won't make any difference.

1272
01:39:10,857 --> 01:39:15,986
This Suh job will be my last,
so please help me out.

He'll move in.

1452
02:01:10,302 --> 02:01:13,722
I already have a plan in motion.

1453
02:01:19,310 --> 02:01:20,942
It's been a while.

1454
02:01:21,819 --> 02:01:23,695
Boss, how are you?

1455
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:39,220
Sir.

1456
02:01:40,035 --> 02:01:42,079
He's inside.

1457
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:43,831
Have your weapons ready.

1458
02:01:43,831 --> 02:01:48,169
He's a sneaky fuck, so we get one shot.

1459
02:01:48,169 --> 02:01:49,670
Money?

1460
02:01:52,673 --> 02:01:55,884
I was in a rush, so I couldn't get much.

1461
02:02:00,764 --> 02:02:02,598
So...

1462
02:02:03,433 --> 02:02:06,145
are you under Kang's men?

1463
02:02:06,145 --> 02:02:07,439
What?

1464
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:10,692
I should've listened to my men.

1465
02:02:13,194 --> 02:02:17,072
Never thought you'd betray me.

1466
02:02:18,657 --> 02:02:21,203
Backstabbing motherfucker...

1467
02:02:21,203 --> 02:02:23,037
Don Yang.

1468
02:02:53,567 --> 02:02:56,486
Let's move him to the washroom.

1469
02:03:04,078 --> 02:03:05,912
Come on, help me.

1470
02:03:11,752 --> 02:03:13,920
Your boys are there.

1471
02:03:20,261 --> 02:03:21,929
- What was that?
- Shit!

1472
02:03:21,929 --> 02:03:25,098
You sons of bitches!

1473
02:03:34,567 --> 02:03:35,443
Motherfucker!

1474
02:03:35,443 --> 02:03:38,153
Fucking backstabber!

1475
02:03:40,781 --> 02:03:44,451
What the hell is the matter with you?

1476
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:46,287
Why did you kill Mr. Kang?

1477
02:03:46,287 --> 02:03:50,332
What? Why'd I take him out?

1478
02:03:51,458 --> 02:03:54,837
They're not coming!

1479
02:03:54,837 --> 02:03:56,963
Why did you do it?

1480
02:03:57,722 --> 02:03:59,515
Why kill him?

1481
02:04:01,343 --> 02:04:04,221
That fucking cleaner...

1482
02:04:05,848 --> 02:04:07,850
I did it for my survival!

1483
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:11,020
If I didn't off him, I'd be six feet under.

1484
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:15,399
If you didn't bring Kang clan into YDP,

1485
02:04:15,399 --> 02:04:18,527
we wouldn't be in this fucking mess, asshole!

1486
02:04:18,527 --> 02:04:20,321
Motherfucker!

1487
02:04:20,321 --> 02:04:22,823
Jong Dae, listen!

1488
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:25,200
I'm sorry!

1489
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:28,579
Jong Dae, it's my fault!

1490
02:04:28,579 --> 02:04:31,498
I'm still your brother!

1491
02:04:31,498 --> 02:04:34,209
We only have each other!

1492
02:04:34,209 --> 02:04:36,921
Don't kill me.

1493
02:04:36,921 --> 02:04:39,756
Please don't kill me...

1494
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:48,640
Baek Yong Gi.

1495
02:04:52,937 --> 02:04:54,855
Disappear.

1496
02:06:04,633 --> 02:06:06,426
Mr. Kim Jong Dae.

1497
02:08:18,642 --> 02:08:21,270
Next chapter of Seoul!

1498
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:24,273
For Gangnam's future!

1499
02:08:24,273 --> 02:08:27,067
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1500
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:27,002
Bro.

1501
02:09:27,002 --> 02:09:33,008
What'd have happened
if our old shack wasn't demolished?

1502
02:09:33,008 --> 02:09:35,093
Isn't it obvious?

1503
02:09:35,093 --> 02:09:37,804
Hugging a light bulb till the end.

1504
02:09:50,484 --> 02:09:52,445
Let's go a round. It'll warm us up.

1505
02:09:52,445 --> 02:09:54,530
I'm already warmed up.

1506
02:09:55,989 --> 02:09:58,075
Get up!

1507
02:09:58,075 --> 02:09:59,868
The winner takes the whole blanket.

1508
02:09:59,868 --> 02:10:02,203
Don't fuck around.

1509
02:10:03,497 --> 02:10:04,623
Jab.

1510
02:10:04,623 --> 02:10:06,124
Jab.

1511
02:10:06,124 --> 02:10:07,251
Jab!

1512
02:10:07,251 --> 02:10:10,128
I'll fucking knock you out!

1513
02:10:10,128 --> 02:10:13,257
Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!

1514
02:10:13,257 --> 02:10:15,175
- Sting!
- Hey now!

1515
02:10:15,175 --> 02:10:17,218
I'm Joe fucking Frazier!

1516
02:10:18,762 --> 02:10:19,722
You hurt?

1517
02:10:19,722 --> 02:10:21,807
Joe fucking Frazier!

1518
02:10:21,807 --> 02:10:24,518
Uppercut!

1519
02:10:24,518 --> 02:10:26,770
Kim Jong Dae wins!

1520
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:28,396
Son of a bitch!

1521
02:10:35,279 --> 02:10:37,697
His stamina's dropping!

1522
02:10:38,615 --> 02:10:40,116
What the...

1523
02:10:41,201 --> 02:10:42,786
What the hell!

1524
02:10:46,096 --> 02:10:49,376
Suh Tae Gon! Suh Tae Gon!

1525
02:10:49,376 --> 02:10:50,794
[Gangnam Candidate 1, Suh Tae Gon]

1526
02:10:50,794 --> 02:10:55,966
Born and bred right here in Gangnam,

1527
02:10:55,966 --> 02:11:00,178
I will devote my life to this land!

1528
02:11:00,178 --> 02:11:03,681
I am the son of Gangnam!

1529
02:11:06,226 --> 02:11:07,311
Suh Tae Gon! Suh Tae Gon!

1530
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:12,983
If you give me one last chance,

1531
02:11:12,983 --> 02:11:19,531
I will bring prosperity to Gangnam!
