1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,636
Want me to walk you out?

2
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,888
Nah, I'm late.

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,931
I’ll grab a taxi.

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,645
Oh, got one.

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,604
I’m heading out!

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,732
Be safe, I’ll call you.

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,943
Bye, Jjae-yul. Come again!

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,487
Hey, Jjun-su…

9
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,702
You’re always like this!

10
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,954
Huh?

11
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,999
How can you fool people so perfectly?

12
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,376
Are you really my friend?

13
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:26,836
Wait, what…

14
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,588
Did you sleep with him?

15
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,131
You did?

16
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,341
Did you?!

17
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,637
What the hell are you on about?

18
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,515
Phew…

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,642
I got way too into character.

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,728
So, what’s the deal with you two?

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,898
How could you keep it from me?

22
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,859
Both of you are too much.

23
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,446
Both…

24
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,073
It’s just me.

25
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,451
What do you mean?

26
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,875
…It’s one-sided?

27
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,926
Then you’re crazy—he was asleep!

28
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,303
I know.

29
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,638
But…

30
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,559
I can’t help it. I like him too much.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,437
Since when?

32
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:27,939
I dunno.

33
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,275
First year of high school?

34
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,234
What?!

35
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,987
That’s years, man!

36
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,450
So that’s why you never dated?

37
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,704
Why didn’t you tell Jjae-yul?

38
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,956
He’s my friend.

39
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,836
I was scared we’d drift apart.

40
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,382
I wanted to keep seeing him like this.

41
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,759
Even if that’s all I get.

42
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,845
Then what about me?

43
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,348
You’re my friend too.

44
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,519
You might feel awkward about it.

45
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,813
And I…

46
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,149
didn’t wanna lose you either.

47
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,862
…Damn. That’s touching.

48
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,577
So wait—

49
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,913
The reason you study so hard is…

50
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:31,169
To transfer to KU, so you can be with Jjae-yul.

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,755
Wow…

52
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,965
That’s real love.

53
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,136
Alright.

54
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,722
Finally in love, huh?

55
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,308
Ju Do-wan?

56
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,144
Okay.

57
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,520
I’ll help you out.

58
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,899
You will?

59
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,530
But…

60
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,033
uh…

61
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,245
Have you always liked guys?

62
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,960
Don’t tell me… me too?

63
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,295
Ugh!

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,966
Hey, that hurts, man.

65
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,052
What?

66
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,179
Everyone’s got their own taste.

67
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,057
Fair point.

68
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,559
That one’s on me.

69
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,272
But hey—

70
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,526
Don’t you think I’d be pretty popular with older guys?

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,298
Hello?

72
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,632
Yo, Jjae-yul.

73
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,551
Noh Joon-su?

74
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,468
What’s up?

75
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,262
See the car down there?

76
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,471
Get in, quick!

77
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,097
Huh?

78
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,475
Car?

79
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,903
Hurry up and get in!

80
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,456
Alright, let’s go!

81
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,168
It’s a long drive, buckle up.

82
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,711
Where are we going?

83
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,256
To hang out!

84
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,185
Here, this one—

85
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,853
No, this one’s yours, Jjae-yul.

86
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,604
What?

87
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,815
You carry this.

88
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,573
Wow, nice place.

89
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,199
Yeah, it is.

90
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,004
So pretty.

91
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,089
Right?

92
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,340
Yeah.

93
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,636
That won’t cover it.

94
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,470
Aren’t you hot?

95
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,472
I am.

96
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,101
Hey.

97
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,602
Let’s play!

98
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,585
Hurry up!

99
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,767
Feels so good!

100
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:16,769
What?

101
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,229
You just dove right in?

102
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,772
Come on, hurry!

103
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,859
Cheers!

104
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,825
We should’ve done this more often.

105
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,497
Yeah.

106
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,207
This place is nice.

107
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,794
Let’s come again.

108
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,047
Ooh, Jjae-yul.

109
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,341
Sounds like you had fun today.

110
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,220
Once it gets hotter, it won’t be as fun.

111
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,055
Now’s perfect.

112
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,181
Yeah, perfect.

113
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,892
It’s my first time at a place like this.

114
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,103
Really?

115
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,647
Not even with family?

116
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,440
Nope.

117
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,489
Let’s take a picture together.

118
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:34,949
Good idea.

119
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,717
Is that good?

120
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,177
Nope.

121
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
Sigh…

122
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,099
Guess I’ll go shower.

123
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,646
I’ll take my sweet time.

124
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,150
So you two can hang out a bit longer.

125
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,664
Ju Do-wan.

126
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,416
Yeah?

127
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,339
Anyone you’re close with besides Noh Joon-su?

128
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,718
Hmm…

129
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,845
Classmates?

130
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,891
But not as close as you two.

131
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,060
Oh…

132
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,019
I see.

133
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,819
Chae Seong-hun.

134
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,949
How’d you meet him?

135
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,326
Seong-hun sunbae?

136
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,661
Yeah.

137
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,871
At orientation.

138
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,624
I was sitting alone.

139
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,878
He came up and looked after me.

140
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,091
Tch.

141
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,050
That’s nothing special.

142
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,095
Hey, he’s a good guy.

143
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,140
It’s either him or us.

144
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,267
What’s that supposed to mean?

145
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,771
Of course it’s you guys.

146
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,775
Thank God.

147
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,121
Can I…

148
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,961
be the one to take care of you instead?

149
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,547
Huh?

150
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,092
I mean…

151
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,678
What do you mean?

152
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,892
Not him—

153
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,105
I want it to be me.

154
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,190
For you.

155
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,538
I couldn’t deny it.

156
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,417
It was hot, sweat dripping, cicadas buzzing.

157
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,343
Jjae-yul…

158
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,845
I like you.

159
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,113
It’s okay if you push me away.

160
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,455
That summer…

161
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,627
I felt it for real.
