1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,551
Jjaeyul

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,177
I’m here again

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,143
Do you know you’ve been here 12 times already?

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,311
You counted that?

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,816
This is your 11th stamp

6
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,027
One more drink today, and next time you get one free

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,322
You kept mine separately?

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,491
Just...

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,869
I remembered later and saved it for you

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,162
You’ll have an iced Americano, right?

11
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,007
Oh right, Jjaeyul

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,674
What are you doing later?

13
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,052
Me?

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,179
I’ll stop by school, then head home

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,098
Want to come over to my place?

16
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,558
Your place?

17
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,562
I told No Jun-su

18
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,731
He kept nagging, saying he wants to see you

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,149
Ah~

20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,817
You’ll come, right?

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,111
Yeah

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,782
I’ll wait for you at the main gate

23
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,806
Campus feels nice

24
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,641
It’s the same as always

25
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,725
Where’s Jun-su?

26
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,685
He’s cleaning the place ‘cause you’re coming

27
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,812
Shall we?

28
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,818
Yes, sunbae

29
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,778
That dinner we planned

30
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,116
This guy was coming too?

31
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,537
Ah, right..

32
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,915
Sorry, sunbae, I must’ve been out of it

33
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,960
Sorry, Do-wan

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,211
I made plans first...

35
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,963
If it’s okay with you

36
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,090
Would you like to join us?

37
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,512
What?

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,068
Whoa..

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,406
Why’s Korea U’s water so good?

40
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,449
Can I call you hyung?

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,166
Wow, hyung, you’re seriously super handsome

42
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,043
It’s like every handsome guy in town is here

43
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,879
Including me

44
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,672
Why are you included?

45
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,592
Why are you always so mean to me?

46
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,679
He’s cute, though

47
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,140
Right?

48
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,020
I actually hear that I’m cute a lot

49
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,315
Hyung, speak casually with me

50
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,317
Our super handsome hyung

51
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,320
Treats us to good food

52
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,031
And clearly has good taste too

53
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,578
Here, let me pour you a drink

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,377
Cheers!

55
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,898
But

56
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,234
You three were close, right?

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,569
Why didn’t you meet in college?

58
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,239
The campuses aren’t far

59
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,698
Come on, hyung

60
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:04,535
This guy started studying like crazy in college
when he never did back in high school

61
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,747
But you could still meet friends, right?

62
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,666
Or...

63
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,757
Too busy with a girlfriend?

64
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,636
Do-wan doesn’t have a girlfriend, hyung

65
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,764
His standards are crazy high

66
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,975
Hey

67
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,685
Stop talking nonsense

68
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,561
Well

69
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,815
Having high standards… seems about right

70
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,861
What about you, hyung?

71
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,947
Are your standards high too?

72
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,032
Huh?

73
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,328
Uh.. I guess so

74
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,915
Oh...

75
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,209
Definitely living up to your looks

76
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,421
Must’ve dated a lot, huh?

77
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,758
Do I look like it?

78
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,140
What about you, Yul?

79
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,808
What was your first impression of me?

80
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,771
You, sunbae?

81
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,607
Hmm...

82
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,657
Like… someone cool,
that kind of vibe?

83
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,034
Really?

84
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,410
Hmm...

85
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,537
So you don’t want to date?

86
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,913
That’s a waste

87
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,041
A waste?

88
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,669
Yeah

89
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,379
You’re too pretty for that

90
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,176
Wow

91
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,262
This hyung’s flirting game is insane

92
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,807
They should teach this in college

93
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,143
So?

94
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,358
You’ve dated a lot then?

95
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,030
Not like I haven’t

96
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,783
I just prefer to be honest with my feelings

97
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,789
And you?

98
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,750
Is opening up about feelings...

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,668
hard for you?

100
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,144
I don’t say things
if I don’t have to

101
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:44,654
Whoa... feels like that hit a nerve

102
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:50,118
Hyung, that’s just Jjudo’s style

103
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:54,747
This guy always pretends not to listen but catches everything

104
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,929
Oh, that type?

105
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,890
Thought he was quiet

106
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,560
but maybe he’s not so simple inside

107
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,731
You’re really good at reading people

108
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,406
Guess I pick up on things fast

109
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,582
Sunbae, isn’t it getting late?

110
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,423
Hmm... should I get going?

111
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,177
Aw, that’s a shame

112
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
I’ll come again next time

113
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,598
Let’s go, Yul

114
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,099
Yes

115
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,519
What, Jjaeyul, you’re leaving too?

116
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,188
No way

117
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,075
Thanks for having me today
I’ll treat you guys to something better next time

118
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,246
Thanks for the food, hyung

119
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,338
I’ll come again

120
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,308
Don’t go

121
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,894
Hm?

122
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,440
Can’t you stay over?

123
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,193
Yeah, Jjaeyul

124
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,529
It’s been a while

125
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,658
When else would we drink with the Insta-famous handsome café guy?

126
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,997
Wait a sec

127
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,538
I’ll stay over

128
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,376
I told sunbae I was sorry

129
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,086
Yes!

130
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,783
I feel hot, but Shin Jjaeyul must be cold

131
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,245
Even in the same space, we’re different

132
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,748
That’s why I get restless and uneasy

133
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,711
What if you...

134
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:15,132
are living at a different temperature from me?

135
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,615
I like you

136
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,421
What the...
