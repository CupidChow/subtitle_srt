1
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,237
Ah

2
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,948
Jjaeyul, toss me the ball

3
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,283
Yeah

4
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,874
Thanks

5
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,683
Hey, wait a sec

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,646
Hold on, I’ll be right back

7
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,736
Where are you going?

8
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,336
Anyway, think about it

9
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,804
Ah

10
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,389
You’ll be here, right?

11
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,015
Go on

12
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:21,975
I’m going, I’m going

13
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,926
Thanks

14
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,889
If you hid in the PE storage, you should rest

15
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,432
Are you studying here too?

16
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,478
Isn’t it weirder for seniors not to get self-study time in PE?

17
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,567
That’s why I like our PE teacher

18
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,778
They say you need stamina to study too

19
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,947
Is that so?

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,752
By the way, earlier...

21
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,298
What were you talking about with No Jun-su?

22
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,716
Hm?

23
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,051
Earlier?

24
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,596
Oh, I... uh...

25
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,473
Yeah

26
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,059
I just came over here to grab a ball for a sec

27
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,435
Ah~

28
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,979
What you two talked about here?

29
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,774
What was it?

30
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,108
Just...

31
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:58,529
He said we should hang out with the girls from Class 5 this weekend

32
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,035
Ah, that bastard No Jun-su

33
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,622
Never studies, always...

34
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,462
So...

35
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,713
Are you going?

36
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,845
Mm...

37
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,140
Don’t go

38
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,767
Why?

39
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,775
Just don’t go

40
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,613
Jun-su said you were going too

41
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,366
I’m not going

42
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,787
He didn’t even tell me in the first place

43
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,416
You’re not going, right?

44
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,422
We’re seniors, we should study

45
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,676
If you don’t go, I won’t either

46
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,470
Alright

47
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,221
Let’s not go

48
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,977
Making a promise like kids...

49
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,937
Ah, hurry up

50
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,896
Forget it

51
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,940
Come on

52
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,048
Get off

53
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,304
Promise me

54
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,306
Only hang out with me

55
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,896
Are you an elementary schooler?

56
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,506
Crazy

57
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,721
Ju Do-wan’s pinning down Shin Jjaeyul!

58
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,265
Hey, you crazy bastard, keep it down

59
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,352
Hey, Shin Jjaeyul’s mine

60
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,438
Yeah, bullshit. I’m going to the same college as Shin Jjaeyul

61
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,649
Yeah, bullshit. I’m gonna live together with Shin Jjaeyul

62
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,484
Yeah~

63
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,276
Huh?

64
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,279
Really?

65
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,450
Ugh, stop saying weird stuff

66
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,285
Why would I be yours?

67
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,830
That hurts my feelings

68
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,248
Hurts mine too

69
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,466
Hey, Jjudo, later we’re playing soccer with Jun-gyeom’s group, you in?

70
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,844
He’s a senior, so he’s studying with Jjaeyul

71
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,222
Yeah, but you still won’t get into Korea University, right?

72
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,391
That’s crossing the line

73
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,309
Yeah, I think that’s crossing the line

74
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,230
Ah

75
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,359
I didn’t realize I was a celebrity

76
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,654
and ended up making a slip of the tongue

77
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,448
I apologize to the entire nation

78
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,660
Alright, reflect and delete your whole channel

79
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,037
I’ll reflect for six hours

80
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,538
Before that

81
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,417
Tell me if you wanna film a challenge

82
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,253
I said get lost, now

83
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,510
Anyway

84
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,474
What kind of videos does Jun-su make?

85
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,766
Just...

86
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,394
pointless stuff

87
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,688
Pointless stuff?

88
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,661
Wow, the Han River looks nice here

89
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,123
After the CSAT’s over

90
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,541
wanna come over to my place?

91
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,335
Your place?

92
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,838
Yeah

93
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,597
I wish the CSAT would end soon

94
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,255
Hey

95
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,172
Hey, why are you two still here?

96
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,841
Math just pissed me the hell off

97
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,343
Hey, I snuck this out, so hurry up and put it on

98
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,469
Put it on and come out

99
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,971
I’m heading out first

100
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,650
Honestly, I wish the CSAT wouldn’t end too soon

101
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,200
I don’t even want to graduate

102
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:26,955
Because I’m afraid this summer with you might never come again

103
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:29,082
That scares me
