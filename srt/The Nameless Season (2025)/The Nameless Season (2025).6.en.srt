1
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,800
Jaeyul

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,346
Why are you zoning out like that?

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,931
Did someone confess to you?

4
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,018
Huh?

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,977
Yeah

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,272
Huh?

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,109
Yeah

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,654
I knew it, you punk

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,907
How?

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,540
Geez..

11
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,754
So, what do you want to do?

12
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,591
Well..

13
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,762
Guess you don’t hate it

14
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,557
Joo Dowan’s kind, you know

15
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,100
Kind?

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,022
Yeah, I guess he is

17
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,482
At least to you

18
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,946
Hold on

19
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,618
So you do have some feelings, huh?

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,289
I don’t know

21
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,293
You guys are the only friends I’ve got

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,673
So what, then?

23
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,926
You’re confused ‘cause we’re your only friends?

24
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,435
Could you do something like this with me?

25
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,190
Ugh

26
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,068
See?

27
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,528
Hold up

28
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,864
Guess I’m the only one getting hurt here

29
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,657
Ow ow ow

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,201
Ow! That hurts!

31
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,370
Be honest

32
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,287
You’ve got other feelings, don’t you?

33
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:02,997
Hey, Jaeyul

34
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,209
I don’t think he’s the one

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,545
Think it over again

36
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,900
I’ll go talk to him

37
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,710
What’d Jaeyul say at the café?

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,962
Well..

39
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,673
Said he couldn’t kiss me

40
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,553
What the hell

41
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,447
That bastard!

42
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,461
I’ll get going

43
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,017
I got confessed to

44
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,101
What?!

45
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,187
So?

46
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,524
I thanked him, but said I liked someone else

47
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,944
And then?

48
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:01,449
He said he already knew, but was grateful I told him first

49
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,077
And he hoped I’d feel at ease

50
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,383
Wow.. that’s badass

51
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,807
He said you’re really cute and that he likes you

52
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,726
Cute?

53
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,771
Huh?

54
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,192
What is this feeling?

55
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,655
Figure that out yourself, we’re leaving

56
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:46,202
Hey! Wait up!

57
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,779
Ah, damn

58
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,164
Guess I should leave if I don’t wanna see that

59
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,208
No Junsu, eat with us

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,295
I’m good. I’ve got plans

61
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,383
Hey, why not start a couple’s channel?

62
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,010
Get out, now

63
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,849
If you change your mind, cut me in 50-50

64
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,106
Jaeyul, enjoy your date

65
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,152
I’m off

66
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,200
Date?

67
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,661
Wanna go on one?

68
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,081
Anywhere you wanna go?

69
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,793
I’d be fine anywhere

70
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,965
Oh, wait. Let me go change real quick

71
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,851
Jaeyul, come here a sec

72
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,111
Ta-da, couple look!

73
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,657
What’s that? So cheesy

74
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,242
Am I cute?

75
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,410
Yeah

76
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,290
Go get ready. I’ll tidy up here

77
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,097
Jaeyul

78
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,474
You do like me, right?

79
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,396
Yeah, I guess

80
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,817
You told me twice already,

81
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,069
but I never said it back

82
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,198
Twice?

83
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,910
That time in the living room

84
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,954
I wasn’t asleep then

85
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,166
I like you

86
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,012
So, to be fair

87
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,931
I like you

88
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,102
I like you, Joo Dowan

89
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,053
Here

90
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,304
Thanks

91
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,402
Nothing you wanna do?

92
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,947
No, I’m happy just being here

93
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,208
I wanna hold your hand

94
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,459
Hand?

95
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:46,669
Yeah

96
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,285
Better?

97
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:42,141
Sometimes, even on sunny days, it rains

98
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:47,063
When that happens, you wonder if you should bring an umbrella

99
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:53,235
I hesitated for so long in that nameless season

100
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,362
But now I know

101
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,407
That season wasn’t spring

102
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,242
Or summer,

103
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:08,417
It was just a season where I wanted to be with you
