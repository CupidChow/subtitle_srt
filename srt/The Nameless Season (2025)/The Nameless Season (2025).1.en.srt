1
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,030
Jjaeyul, what are you doing?

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,257
The exams are over.
Wanna go hang out?

3
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,761
Nah, I'm just gonna head home.

4
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,805
Seriously, this guy...

5
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,515
You're sulking again 'cause you missed one question, huh?

6
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,517
No, I'm not.

7
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,935
This time...

8
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,313
I really messed up.

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,490
Oh wow...

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,076
That's not the face of someone who missed just one.

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,827
Wait... three?

12
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,918
Two...

13
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,214
Wow, seriously?

14
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,174
You're doing this on purpose, right?

15
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,092
What are you talking about...

16
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,555
With grades like that, you could easily get into Korea Uni.

17
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,933
You fraud.

18
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,978
I have to do well.

19
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,483
What more does a top student need to do well at?

20
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,738
I’ve got nothing going for me except studying.

21
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,949
Huh?

22
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,829
You and No Jun-su are good at so many things.

23
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,749
You’re athletic—

24
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,626
—and have tons of friends.

25
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,838
Why would you say you’ve got nothing?

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,630
You do.

27
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,509
Like what?

28
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,180
Your... well...

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,561
Anyway, a lot.

30
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,228
A lot.

31
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,232
Whatever...

32
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,813
Yeah?

33
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,609
I'm still in class.

34
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,487
What was that?

35
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,364
No Jun-su?

36
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,993
Jjaeyul!

37
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,747
Let's film a TikTok together!

38
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,540
Hey, hey, move over!

39
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,416
What now?

40
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,043
Just move! Come on!

41
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,965
This one's trending like crazy these days.

42
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,345
Kiss or Slap!

43
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:41,638
Huh?

44
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,308
No, I mean—

45
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,310
Kiss! Or! Slap!

46
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,062
What is he even saying...

47
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:54,984
Kiss!

48
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,070
You psycho!

49
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,696
Ow ow ow—

50
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,906
It hurts!

51
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,449
It hurts!

52
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,369
Do it to me too! Kiss or Slap!

53
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
Not doing it to you.

54
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,415
That jerk's always like this to me!

55
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,629
Let’s go home.

56
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,799
Wanna go sing?

57
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,384
Or PC café?

58
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,762
I have to go home and review my mistakes.

59
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,431
Let’s go.

60
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,645
Wow...

61
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,440
The future of Korea is freaking bright!

62
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,568
Hey, wait up!

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,891
No way...

64
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,394
The video we posted of Jjaeyul—

65
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,229
—it already got tons of likes!

66
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,398
Why’d you post that?

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,819
People are asking for your Instagram. Can I drop it?

68
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,031
I don’t really use Instagram though.

69
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,119
Let’s hop on the Jjaeyul bus~!

70
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,707
Just focus on studying.

71
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,959
And don’t come crying again

72
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,879
saying you’re deleting your channel over hate comments.

73
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,509
Ugh, Jjudo’s so damn mean to me.

74
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,180
Jjaeyul, tell me. Isn’t this guy being too much?

75
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,808
Yeah... maybe a little.

76
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,269
What did I do?

77
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,898
You're the one always stirring things up, No Jun-su.

78
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,658
Me?

79
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,744
I’m kinda jealous of No Jun-su.

80
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,459
You’ve got so many things you want to do.

81
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,714
Jjaeyul~!

82
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,108
Hey, you—

83
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,070
You should treat me better, you know?

84
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,452
When I get famous, don’t act like we’re close.

85
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,881
So hot...

86
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,650
So?

87
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,278
What else?

88
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,946
What do you wanna do exactly?

89
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,953
First, I’m gonna blow up on TikTok!

90
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,080
TikTok?

91
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,081
And then?

92
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,876
And then...

93
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,004
Uh...

94
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,841
I’ll get a YouTube Silver Button!

95
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,135
What’s a Silver Button?

96
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,644
Wait—are you serious? You don’t know?

97
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,154
Only super famous creators get them!

98
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,949
Better start treating me right now.

99
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:19,040
You’re at 500 subs now, so you just need... 99,500 more!

100
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,792
Fighting.

101
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,419
So encouraging.

102
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,384
Jjudo is so damn mean to me, seriously.

103
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,514
So what? After the Silver Button, then what?

104
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,101
Then I’ll start getting loads of PPL deals—

105
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,895
—and...

106
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,065
I’ll become a famous influencer—

107
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,025
—and get invited to all the parties!

108
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,109
Oh~!

109
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,362
I even practiced something new!

110
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,196
Let’s see it!

111
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,697
Here it comes!

112
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,199
Okay...

113
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,910
Make a heart with your hands!

114
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,870
Watch closely!

115
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,872
🎵 We fell in love~

116
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,666
🎵 When we first met~

117
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,750
🎵 Can’t erase it~

118
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,418
What the heck is that...

119
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,711
Nice, nice!

120
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,504
Well?

121
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,297
Might look cooler solo, honestly.

122
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,883
Come on, do it with me.

123
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,512
(It was just a regular day.)

124
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,723
(The final exams were over.)

125
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,059
(Jjaeyul was a little down from messing up.)

126
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,229
(No Jun-su was excited about his dreams.)

127
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,314
(Just the usual.)

128
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,858
(But then…)

129
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,903
(Why do I feel so restless and anxious?)

130
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,697
(I just...)

131
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,121
(kept looking at Jjaeyul.)
