1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:02,711
Senior year, winter

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,006
One year later

3
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,059
Hey, Jjudo, are you really not gonna take that blind date?

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,813
College students are supposed to study

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,815
Huh?

6
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,611
Hey

7
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,824
College is the most brilliant
and most irresponsible time of our lives

8
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,619
If not now, when else
are we gonna burn through our youth?

9
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,662
Am I wrong?

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,290
Drinking all night long

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
Falling in love

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,838
Talking nonsense until morning

13
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,764
Come on

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,640
Say it

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,477
Reports go to GPT

16
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,812
Romance goes to...

17
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,899
the one and only Cupid, No Junsu!

18
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,780
So that’s your new channel concept? Cupid?

19
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,240
Not bad

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,619
No, I mean—

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,662
Not me, you

22
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,039
Like...

23
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,042
Isn’t there someone who makes your heart race?

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,005
There is

25
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,013
What? Who is it?

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,932
Is it someone I know?

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,858
Can you not?

28
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,863
I need to focus, don’t distract me

29
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,781
Sorry

30
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,119
And what’s with this needlessly romantic music?

31
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,371
Music?

32
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,376
Oh—must’ve clicked on a reel

33
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:13,967
Huh?

34
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,387
What?

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,180
Now what?

36
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,182
Isn’t this Shin Jaeyul?

37
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,767
What?

38
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,688
It’s an account that introduces hot part-timers

39
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,064
This is Jaeyul, isn’t it?

40
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,039
Where are you going?

41
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,337
Coffee

42
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,881
I’m gonna grab a coffee

43
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,592
At 1 a.m.?

44
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,096
Welcome

45
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,224
Oh?

46
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,811
Jaeyul

47
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,793
Thanks

48
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,294
Mind if I study here a bit?

49
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,546
Of course not

50
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,507
But… how did you know about this place?

51
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,509
Well, you know...

52
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,678
I have my ways

53
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,679
How have you been?

54
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,848
Mm, just... you know

55
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,935
Made any new friends?

56
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,439
You know me, I’m shy around people

57
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:35,900
Ah...

58
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,444
Oh!

59
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,947
That reel of you hit over a million views

60
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,031
A reel?

61
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,537
Oh, that. The boss asked me to film it

62
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,580
People were going crazy, saying you’re handsome

63
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,499
They’re just being nice

64
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,209
No, seriously, even I think—

65
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,961
Welcome

66
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,755
Yul-ah!

67
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,925
Seonghun sunbae...

68
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,727
Oh, he’s my high school friend

69
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,895
Ah~

70
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,191
Hello, Yul’s friend

71
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,365
Jaeyul

72
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,285
Yul-ie

73
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,079
Sunbae, could you wait a moment?

74
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,164
Yul-ie...

75
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,498
I’ll bring you your coffee

76
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,375
Shall I?

77
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,759
How about we have a cup together?

78
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,219
Ah... sure

79
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,565
Since you’re Jaeyul’s friend...

80
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,608
you’re quite good-looking

81
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,284
Thank you

82
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,245
Well...

83
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,039
You’re good-looking too

84
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,502
What are you two doing right now...

85
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,356
(sighs)

86
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,328
Hm?

87
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,456
Uh...

88
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,042
There’s... a mosquito. Yeah, a mosquito

89
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,460
Really?

90
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,505
Maybe because the window’s cracked open?

91
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,344
A mosquito? Isn’t that pushing it a bit?

92
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,888
I’m sorry

93
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,931
Do you like Jaeyul?

94
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:12,849
What?

95
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,565
Isn’t that the kind of thing you do
when you want someone to notice?

96
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,531
It was a strange feeling

97
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:33,119
Not because a stranger suddenly asked if I liked you

98
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,541
But because the feelings I hid so carefully from you

99
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,961
were so obvious to someone else

100
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,478
What should I do...

101
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,316
It’s me too

102
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,655
Like a season that was neither spring

103
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,284
nor summer, our vague relationship

104
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:19,540
was reaching the time when it had to be defined
