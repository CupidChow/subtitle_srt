1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,230
How could she die
in the blink of an eye?

2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,070
Yeah.

3
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,200
And her body looked so weird.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,200
Could it be possible

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,920
that evil took her spirit?

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,880
Here come officials
from the Ministry of Justice.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,320
- Move. Get out of the way.
- Move.

8
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,070
The Ministry of Justice is looking into
this case.

9
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,150
Seal off this area.

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,350
Bai He.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,950
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,400
Is any suspect on the scene?

13
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,430
Sir,

14
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,680
not yet.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,640
But,

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,920
guests who saw this said

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,790
Miss Chu died very oddly.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,000
It seemed like her body was frozen

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,950
and her spirit was taken by evil.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,120
Evil froze her and took her spirit?

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,510
Nonsense.

22
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,920
What is the cause of death?

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,920
Well...

24
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,760
Poison.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,510
Dilated pupils and black nails

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,000
say she was poisoned.

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,350
What poison is so bizarre

28
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,790
to kill a person momentarily?

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,120
It also hardens and cracks her skin.

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,400
Anything else?

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,430
Although you're talented in the autopsy,

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,120
there's still a long way to go.

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,640
Do you see this smoke instrument?

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,950
Since she was performing smoke art,

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,000
the killer could have put poison
in the smoke.

36
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,310
When she was performing,

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,230
it was smoky.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
But if the smoke was poisonous,

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,280
it would be impossible
that Chu Qi'er died

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,400
and everyone else was fine.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,870
We can ask them.

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,230
Mr. Wei.

43
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,590
Excuse me.

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,430
When Chu Qi'er was performing,

45
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,960
did you feel any discomfort?

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,150
I didn't

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,000
stay long.

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,470
I didn't feel a thing.

49
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,080
I was just here to deliver a jar of wine.

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,030
And then I left.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Ask around.

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,260
=A League of Nobleman=

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
=Episode 6=

54
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,400
I just made some inquiries.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,560
This case is quite tricky.

56
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,800
She didn't think
it would be such a big deal.

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
We have to be careful.

58
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,840
She also said

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,360
that she was afraid

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,080
that she might have left behind evidence
that could lead to her.

61
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,030
Take care of it as soon as possible.

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,750
Yes.

63
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,030
Do we need

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,680
to Mr. Wang in advance?

65
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,870
I can't

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,680
drag him down with me again this time.

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,030
Come on, everybody.

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,870
Move. Get out of the way.

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,150
Zhang Ping?

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,240
What is he doing here?

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,710
Something bad could happen again
because of him.

72
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,000
Did you come here together?

73
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,590
Yes.

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,240
I'll ask him to leave.

75
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,150
I'll distract him.

76
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,960
Take care of that matter
as soon as possible.

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,430
Don't leave any trace behind.

78
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:07,870
Yes, sir.

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
I had a headache after the performance.

80
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,360
I felt my head spinning.

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,480
I also had some palpitations.

82
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,120
Is there anything else wrong?

83
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,160
When Chu Qi'er was dancing,

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,630
it looked so strange.

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,190
Yes.

86
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,680
It seemed that everything around her

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,120
was flowing.

88
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,480
There is something wrong
with the smoke block.

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,560
Bai He,

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,950
find out where this smoke block came from.

91
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,510
Yes, sir.

92
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,270
Please follow me, ladies.

93
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,000
It sounded more like a hallucinogen
was put into the smoke.

94
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,800
But hallucinogens aren't lethal.

95
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,920
We haven't started our investigation
and you already know it?

96
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,310
I haven't reached a conclusion yet.

97
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,070
Haven't reached a conclusion?

98
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,800
You're just arguing
for the sake of argument.

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,560
Mowen.

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,680
Peizhi?

101
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,560
What are you doing here?

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,160
I heard that Mr. Wei was about to
paint his last painting here,

103
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,070
so I came to see.

104
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,160
I didn't expect

105
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,070
this to happen.

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Zhang Ping, you're also here.

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
He was also looking into the case

108
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,270
in Banyue Pavilion,

109
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,950
so I asked him to come here with me
this time

110
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,240
(Grape Wine)
to see what he can do.

111
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,680
If I win,

112
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,800
he'll work for me without complaints.

113
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,510
There's no need for him to work
in the Court of Judicial Review.

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
I even had a nickname for him.

115
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,560
He'll be called Black Eagle.

116
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
What if he wins?

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Are you going to

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,070
work for him?

119
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,800
This kid really can brag.

120
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,800
He said his noodle stand

121
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,950
needed someone
to boil the water and knead the dough.

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,950
I wasn't born to sell noodles anyway.

123
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,560
Peizhi,

124
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
you're a perfect witness.

125
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,830
I don't want to see this kid

126
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,800
lose the bet and try to get away.

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
If you want a real contest,

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
what about me joining Zhang Ping?

129
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,360
You have so many officials

130
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,040
working for you.

131
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,310
But Zhang Ping is alone.

132
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,560
Even if you win,

133
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,800
you just win

134
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,160
an unsuccessful battle.

135
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,630
That's

136
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,270
a good idea.

137
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,360
I can investigate this case by myself.

138
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,680
Kid, don't be ungrateful.

139
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,680
There are only ladies

140
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,720
and important guests here tonight.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,070
You're just a commoner.

142
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:14,950
Can you really get information
from them?

143
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Let Peizhi help you

144
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,240
in case you don't admit that I win.

145
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,480
Bai He,

146
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,800
have you found out the origin
of the smoke block?

147
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,720
Sir,

148
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,560
Mr. Lan.

149
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,430
I've made some inquiries.

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
This smoke art came from
nomadic people in the western region.

151
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
And they would add hallucinogens

152
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
to present a wonderful performance.

153
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,800
I can't believe you're right.

154
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,510
But how could Miss Chu know
how to perform this nomadic art?

155
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,870
She learned it from an acrobat

156
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,040
called the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke.

157
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,160
Miss Chu's smoke block

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,720
was also made by
the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke.

159
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,040
Find a doctor who knows about
the properties of medicines

160
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,560
to find out the ingredients
of the smoke block.

161
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,070
Yes, sir.

162
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,390
Have all the other statements
been taken?

163
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,800
It's almost done.

164
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,390
Mr. Lan,

165
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't need your help.

166
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,430
Don't be so overconfident.

167
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,510
(Chu Qi'er died so oddly.)

168
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
(She can't be killed
by some common poison.)

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480

(This...)

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,920
What's this?

176
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,720
If she was killed by poison,

177
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,270
the murderer wouldn't be stupid enough
to leave any evidence on the scene

178
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,750
and wait for it to be found.

179
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,430
Zhang Ping,

180
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,070
There's something wrong
with Chu Qi'er's forehead makeup.

181
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,120
Chu Qi'er's forehead makeup

182
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,390
was in the shape of a tree peony.

183
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,600
But the makeup on her dresser is in
the shape of a herbaceous peony.

184
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,840
Could it be possible

185
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,480
that the murderer poisoned
her forehead makeup?

186
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,510
After it happened,

187
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,080
the murderer must be afraid of
leaving any evidence,

188
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,150
so he replaced the toxic makeup.

189
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,080
It is different.

190
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,550
Is everything taken care of?

191
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,790
You must be more careful.

192
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,440
Zhang Ping was close to finding you
at the underdrain.

193
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,630
I managed to distract him.

194
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,870
Thank you, sir.

195
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,390
I was careless.

196
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,030
What did you find?

197
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Officials at the Ministry of Justice
checked it.

198
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,390
The forehead makeup is not toxic.

199
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,390
That's fine.

200
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,630
We can find other clues.

201
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,360
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

202
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,440
But,

203
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
I still want to look into this by myself.

204
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,670
Be my guest.

Sir,

216
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,240
the doctor has found

217
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,080
there is jimsonweed pollen

218
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,360
in Miss Chu's smoke block,

219
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,030
much more than the common dosage.

220
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,550
But even so,

221
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,390
it should not have killed Miss Chu.

222
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,390
Everyone else on the site
are safe and sound.

223
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,910
Did the doctor find anything else?

224
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,510
Not yet.

225
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,750
Could it be

226
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,270
that they added other medicines

227
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,790
to Chu Qi'er?

228
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
Yeah, you've reminded me of that.

229
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,150
When jimsonweed work
with other medicines

230
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,150
its toxicity

231
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
will be multiplied.

232
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,630
Mr. Wang,

233
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,910
I've found something new.

234
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,720
I found this rouge

235
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,910
at the entrance of the underdrain

236
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,000
by the dresser.

237
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,270
Rouge was scattered around

238
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,000
and formed an apparent circle.

239
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,550
I guess the circle was the original
rouge box.

240
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,790
Someone picked it up later.

241
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,320
But oddly enough,

242
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,000
I just asked those ladies,

243
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,360
and no one said
they dropped a rouge box.

244
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,000
What does that have to do
with this case?

245
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
It means one of them is lying.

246
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,670
If she just dropped a rouge box,

247
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,840
she might as well admit that.

248
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,000
Why does she need to hide this?

249
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,480
There must be a problem with this rouge.

250
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,360
It is highly possible

251
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,360
that this rouge box relates to this case.

252
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,390
It makes sense.

253
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,120
You and I had a bet
on who'd solve this case first, right?

254
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,120
Why are you telling me so much?

255
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,200
I just want to know the truth
as soon as possible.

256
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,790
Since

257
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
you've shared so much with me,

258
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,510
to be fair,

259
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,870
I won't hide clues from you.

260
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,750
The doctor just checked and found

261
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,510
that the dosage of
the jimsonweed in the smock block

262
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,390
is much more than the common dosage
of hallucinogens.

263
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,670
The Immortal of Nomadic Smoke
is the most suspicious one.

264
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,960
How would you explain this rouge then?

265
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,480
This rouge

266
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,960
might be left there earlier on.

267
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,630
Everyone here wouldn't have known
about it.

268
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,360
But when I was checking
the forehead makeup,

269
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,750
I saw there was a flash of fire

270
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,790
at the entrance of the underdrain.

271
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,320
Did anybody else see

272
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,440
there was firelight
at the entrance of the underdrain?

273
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,360
You must be mistaken about this.

274
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,790
Everyone, get back!

275
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,150
Get back!

276
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,750
Get them all
back to the Ministry of Justice.

277
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,200
Go! Hurry!

278
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,750
Go!

279
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,030
Sir,

280
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,670
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

281
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,360
I just took the rouge box

282
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,320
and didn't notice there was some rouge
scattered in the underdrain.

283
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,960
What's more, I didn't expect Zhang Ping

284
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,720
to see the light from the firelighter.

285
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,670
I've found a reason for that.

286
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,630
Mowen didn't further look into it.

287
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,960
Go and clear the trace.

288
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,390
Don't let Zhang Ping

289
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,320
find more clues about the rouge.

290
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,080
Zhang.

291
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,910
It's toxic.

292
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:47,910
Oh,

293
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,360
I've heard about the bet about the case

294
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,320
between you and Mr. Wang.

295
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,200
What are you doing now?

296
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,390
I believe

297
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,960
this rouge has something to do
with that murder.

298
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,960
It's not toxic.

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,870
What should we do then?

300
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm telling you.

301
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,120
Every casino in the capital has started
a bet on you two.

302
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,360
If Mr. Wang wins,

303
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,440
the odds are ten to one.

304
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,870
If you win, the odds are one to ten.

305
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,270
Say something to me.

306
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,910
I bet eighty copper coins on you.

307
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,240
You

308
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,240
won't let me

309
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,240
lose, right?

310
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,270
I don't know.

311
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,510
Chen Chou,

312
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll try my best.

313
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,320
Zhang Ping.

314
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,200
Mr. Wang.

315
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,120
Are you still looking into the rouge?

316
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm going to Flying-Flower Pavilion
again.

317
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,240
Don't bother.

318
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,320
I've cracked the case.

319
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,600
The murderer is
the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke.

320
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,030
What is the evidence?

321
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,630
When Chu Qi'er died,

322
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
she was wearing these bells
around her neck.

323
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,600
Guess what?

324
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,600
These bells were full of yellow azaleas.

325
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
Yellow azaleas are highly toxic.

326
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,960
When they work with jimsonweed,

327
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,270
they can cause people
to lose consciousness and die.

328
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,480
Can they kill people momentarily?

329
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,670
When people die from this,

330
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,120
would their skin be hardened
and cracked?

331
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,390
You can try it on someone.

332
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,750
Anyway, yellow azaleas

333
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
can kill a bull.

334
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,360
I've got the evidence.

335
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,750
I'll go and catch the killer now.

336
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,910
I know I would win.

337
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,630
Sir, you are indeed very wise.

338
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,200
I know Zhang Ping

339
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,150
can never compete with you.

340
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,200
Right, guys?

341
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,080
Yes.

342
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,200
Mr. Wang's wisdom is a model for us.

343
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,440
Mr. Wang's wisdom is a model for us.

344
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,270
Zhang,

345
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,670
didn't you tell me that you were
going to Flying-Flower Pavilion?

346
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,670
Why are you back?

347
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,720
Mr. Wang has found the real culprit.

348
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,200
Five maces of jimsonweed

349
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,590
and three maces of yellow azaleas

350
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,310
could cause people to lose consciousness
and tremble.

351
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,590
Five maces of jimsonweed.

Chen Chou?

357
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,550
You're here.

358
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,480
Chen Chou!

359
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,590
Chen Chou!

Chen Chou!

361

Do me a favour.

362
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,240
Zhang,

363
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
the eighty copper coins I bet on you

364
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,680
is our rent next month.

365
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,920
We would have to live on the street

366
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,310
a couple of days later.

367
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,590
Maybe there is still a favourable turn.

368
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,510
Really?

369
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,880
Really.

370
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,640
But you have to do me a favour.

371
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,550
I'll do everything you tell me.

372
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,480
It's right in front of us. Hurry! Hurry!

Zhang,

374
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,680
can it really

375
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,000
win our rent back?

376
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,110
It's possible.

377
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,680
Okay.

378
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,920
Mr. Rat,

379
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,750
please bless Zhang and me

380

(15 minutes later)

382
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,000
When Chu Qi'er was dancing,

383
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,920
her body suddenly turned rigid
and she died momentarily.

384
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,310
And it takes about 15 minutes

385
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,960
for the poison to take effect

386
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,030
in a rat.

387
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,960
What's more,

388
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,350
Chu Qi'er died with her body
turning rigid.

389
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,240
But the rat

390
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,200
died in convulsions.

391
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,350
These two died

392
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,960
differently.

393
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,750
S... so?

394
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,550
So,

395
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,240
Mr. Wang made a mistake.

396

Or,

397

the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke

398
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,510
is not the only one
who wanted to poison Chu Qi'er.

399
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,480
Zhang,

400
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,790
the odds are one to ten.

401
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,640
We may end up with 800 copper coins!

402
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,880
We underestimated him.

403
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,750
We walked into
his tactical deployment of poisons.

404
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,110
That's right.

405
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,070
We were this close to getting screwed
by him.

406
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,590
Let go of me!

Behave!

Do you want to be beaten up again?

409
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,750
Give my smoke instrument back!

410
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,550
You have no remorse
after killing someone.

411
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,400
And you tried to use this thing

412
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,200
to poison me.

413
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,510
Are you tired of living?

414
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,830

415

Chu Qi'er killed my daughter!

She deserved to die!

419
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,480
So what if I killed her?

420
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
I only regret that I didn't kill her
with a thousand cuts.

421

Move!

422

Don't say this to me.

I'm not an outsider.

441
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,440
I heard

that the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke
pleaded guilty.

443

when will you start working for me
in the Ministry of Justice?

Mr. Wang,

452
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,550
actually, I want to say...

453
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
Sir, your capability to crack cases
is not your only shining spot.

454
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,350
Your noble moral principles also
deserve our admiration.

455
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,830
You really are a role model for us.

456
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,270
Mr. Wang!

457
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,240
A role model!

458
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,350
Mr. Wang!

459
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,400
A role model!

460
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,680
I don't like to hear

461
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,680
such flattering words.

462
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,440
Mr. Wang,

463
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,960
the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke
did poison Chu Qi'er.

464
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,240
But it was someone else who killed her.

465
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,310
Zhang Ping,

466
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,550
don't you think

467
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,200
you're overthinking this?

468
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,510
The Immortal of Nomadic Smoke
has confessed his crime.

469
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,350
This is just a simple poisoning case.

470
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,350
How many murderers can there be?

471
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,790
Maybe the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke

472
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,270
does believe he succeeded
in poisoning Chu Qi'er.

473
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,830
But I did an experiment at home.

474
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,590
I found after a rat took jimsonweed

475
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,160
and yellow azaleas,

476
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,720
it did die.

477
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,680
But the way it died

478
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,440
and the time when the poison
started to take effect

479
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,590
are completely different
from Chu Qi'er's.

480
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,680
It means

481
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,510
that Chu Qi'er died of another poison.

482
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,110
Humans and rats are different after all.

483
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
It's natural

484
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,550
that they would die differently.

485
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,960
What's more,

486
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,400
when it comes to dosimetry,

487
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,480
a miss

488
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,750
is as good as a mile.

489
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,350
You don't know about the dosage

490
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,110
and the compatibility of medicines.

491
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,750
The situation of the body and the time
of the poison surely won't be the same.

492
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,720
Whatever you say,

493
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,510
they wouldn't be so different.

494
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,590
And

495
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,030
the rouge in the underdrain...

496
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,960
Zhang Ping,

497
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,640
why are you still talking about
the rouge?

498
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,880
It has nothing to do with this case,
right?

499
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,440
But...

500
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:09,960
Zhang Ping,

501
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,550
do you have other arguments?

502
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,400
If not,

503
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,070
since the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke
has confessed his crime,

504
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,920
as a witness,

505
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
to be fair, I'm here to say

506
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,350
you lost

507
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,480
this contest.

508
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,510
You're a scholar after all.

509
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,000
Don't you have the courage

510
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,480
to admit your defeat?

511
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,590
No. You...

512
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,160
Mowen,

513
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,200
in my opinion,

514
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,590
this case can be closed now.

515
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,920
No.

516
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,160
There are still some doubts.

517
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,200
You can't close this case so rashly.

518
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,960
Give me more time.

519
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,960
Hey, kid,

520
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,350
is that difficult to admit your defeat?

521
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,110
It's not about winning or losing.

522
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,200
If Mr. Wang is unwilling
to further look into this,

523
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,240
I'll look into it myself.

Zhang,

540
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,720
What are you thinking?

541
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,270
What on earth is it for?

542
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,640
It has been several hours.

543
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,310
You didn't sell one bowl of noodles.

544
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,720
And you're kneading the dough
so nonchalantly.

545
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,440
Zhang, I truly admire you.

546
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,310
How did you know

547
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,830
that I didn't sell one bowl of noodles?

548
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,350
You forgot your noodle strainer.

549
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,680
What can you sell?

550
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,000
Zhang, I'm not judging you.

551
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,790
But some battles you win,
some battles you lose.

552
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,720
It's common. Stop fixating on that.

553
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,350
It doesn't matter whether I win or lose.

554
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,550
What's important is

555
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,000
that the murderer is still on the loose.

556
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,830
I'm not mad at you.

557
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,270
I'm mad at myself

558
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,270
because I didn't catch the murderer.

559
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
That's right.

560
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,310
I wanted to start a business
of writing plays

561
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,790
to earn our rent back.

562
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,960
I've been to every theater
in the capital, big or small,

563
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,440
but I didn't get a job.

564
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,830
All I got

565
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,270
was just laughter.

566
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,830
They said my plays

567
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,030
were too childish.

568
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,400
They don't get me.

569
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,310
Forget about it.

570
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,830
We can live on the street.

571
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,830
Or,

572
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,680
I can sell more noodles

573
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,830
and earn more money.

574
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,720
Zhang,

575
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,070
do you know

576
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,880
where you put your noodle stand today?

577
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,160
Is this our place?

578
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,400
I...

579
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,550
I...

580
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,510
Recently, all I thought about
was the case.

581
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,510
But Chen Chou,

582
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,070
how did you find me?

583
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,200
I've eaten your noodles for so long.

584
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,200
I can even smell your noodles
when I'm having a dream.

585
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,270
Not to mention this place.

586
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,070
Even if you put your stand
in some covert corner,

587
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,510
I can still smell your noodles
and find you.

588
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,590
Smell?

589
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,880
The underdrain has passages
in all directions,

590
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,000
just like an underground labyrinth.

591
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,960
Even the well lids are the same.

592
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,350
It's not easy to find the specific exit.

593
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,200
The fragrance of that rouge

594
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,750
is intense and long-lasting.

595
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,830
Could it be that the murderer used it

596
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,440
to find direction by smell?

597
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,030
I have to go to rouge shops.

598
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,750
Hey,

599
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,640
do you sell this rouge?

600
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,590
No.

601
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,960
Can you have a look at it

602
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,920
and tell me if there's anything special
about this rouge?

603
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,720
I don't know.

604
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,830
I haven't seen it before.

605
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,720
This...

606
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,960
Do you want to buy rouge or not?

607
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,480
I don't know.

608
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,510
I've asked around every rouge shop
in the capital.

609
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,960
Why did everyone tell me
that they didn't know about it?

610
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,030
How could I know?

611
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,070
This is just a common rouge.

612
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,830
Every shop has it.

613
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,830
Who knows where did you get it?

614
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:57,880
Thank you.

615
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,920
Sir,

616
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,000
have a cup of tea.

617
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,400
Thank you.

618
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,750
Excuse me.

619
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,270
Are you making rouge?

620
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:44,960
Yes.

621
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,720
We often supply flowers
to the rouge shops in the capital.

622
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,640
I've learned a bit
from what I hear and see.

623
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,790
Can you have a look

624
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,000
at this rouge

625
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,000
and tell me who made it?

626
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,480
I don't know.

627
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,200
But it's a little special.

628
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,960
Special? Why?

629
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,830
When you're making rouge,
you need to add some alum

630
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,590
to leave the color on the skin.

631
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,000
But you see,

632
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,720
this rouge can easily be wiped away.

633
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,070
There must be no alum added
to this rouge.

634
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,880
This rouge

635
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,830
is definitely not good then.

636
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,440
You don't know about this.

637
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,880
Girls' skin is very delicate.

638
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,880
And alum can easily cause allergies.

639
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,240
It may cause redness and swelling
on some girls' skin.

640
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,160
So, many rouge shops also sell

641
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,240
this rouge without alum.

642
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,240
Many?

643
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,960
This rouge is very common then.

644
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,240
And

645
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,440
it would be easy to tell, right?

646
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,440
Of course.

647
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,750
Even I can tell,

648
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,720
let alone those rouge shopkeepers.

649
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,680
(It looks like someone knows
I was looking into the rouge,)

650
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,440
(so rouge shopkeepers)

651
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,830
(were all bought off.)

652
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,790
Chen Chou.

653
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,200
Zhang,

654
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,510
how's it going?

655
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,200
Can we get our rent back?

656
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:07,790
Maybe.

657
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,240
But

658
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,110
you need to do me a favour.

659
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
You can get all the information
you want in the capital, right?

660
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,790
Do me a favour

661
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,640
and find out who,
among the ladies in the contest,

662
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,720
has the most sensitive skin

663
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,550
and can only use rouge without alum.

664
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,030
That's easy.

665
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,920
I'll show you

666
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,920
what I'm capable of.

667
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,110
Be quick.

668
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,240
Don't miss it if you're passing by.

669
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,880
Have a look at these!

670
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
Hot wonton!

671
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,270
Hey, have a bowl of wonton.

672
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,820
(Hanhui Pavilion, Ning'an)

673
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,830
Hot wonton!

674
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,400
Zhang,

675
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,240
I've made some inquiries.

676
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,000
On the day of that contest,

677
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,880
the ladies asked a makeup shop

678
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,160
to send a dozen of hairdressers
to dress them.

679
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,790
But the shop owner told me

680
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,750
that only Lady Yuzhen
has sensitive skin.

681
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,550
She brought rouge by herself that day.

682
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,510
Lady Yuzhen?

683
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,400
Yes.

684
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,240
The granddaughter
of the Minister of Rites.

685
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,270
Gong Yuzhen

686
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,750
is amazing.

687
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,310
She's good at every instrument.

688
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,270
Guzheng, flute, drum, xiao,

689
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,070
pipa, guqin and se.

690
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
There's not an instrument
that she can't play.

691
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,920
And she looks so sweet.

692
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,400
She was the perfect choice

693
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,880
to be drawn in the last painting
by Painter-sage.

694
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
But strangely enough,

695
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,590
she said she wanted to quit the contest

696
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,790
and turned to play for Chu Qi'er.

697
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,200
I also heard

698
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,750
that after the contest
in the Flying-Flower Pavilion that day,

699
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,070
Lady Yuzhen never came back home.

700
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,830
The granddaughter
of the Minister of Rites.

701
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,030
What?

702
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
Is there something wrong?

703
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,240
Except for officials
of the Ministry of Justice,

704
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,400
the only one who knows
I am looking into that rouge

705
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,640
is Mr. Lan.

706
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,590
And Mr. Lan was always,

707
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,400
intentionally or not,

708
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,550
leading Mr. Wang to
the Immortal of Nomadic Smoke.

709
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,480
That day,

710
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,790
the one who misled me
in Flying-Flower Pavilion

711
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,790
was also Mr. Lan.

712
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,270
Zhang Ping,

713
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,240
Chu Qi'er's forehead makeup
was replaced.

714
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,960
Mr. Lan?

715
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,480
Why did he have to get himself involved?

716
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,270
Could it be

717
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,030
that he wants to cover up
for Minister Gong's family?

718
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,440
How come it's you?

719
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,830
I thought you were Zhang Ping.

720
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,160
Go. Go. Go.

721
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,310
It's a trap.

722
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,440
(If Mr. Lan did interfere in this matter,)

723
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,270
(he must know)

724

(Lady Yuzhen's whereabouts then.)

725
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,640
(I'll keep an eye on him.)

726

(Maybe)

727
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,110
(I can find some clues.)

728
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,110
Miss Gong.
