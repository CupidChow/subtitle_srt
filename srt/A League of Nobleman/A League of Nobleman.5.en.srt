1
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,750
He... He...

2
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,920
Zhang.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,480
Are you a human being or a ghost?

4
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,740
=A League of Nobleman=

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,780
=Episode 5=

6
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,630
Zhang, what happened to you?

7
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,400
Every time I cast Water Illusion,

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,480
I fall asleep for two days.

9
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,710
It's nothing special.

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,400
What happened?

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,270
This situation is unheard of.

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,630
It's good that you are fine.

13
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,790
Zhang Ping.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,480
Rest in my house.

15
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,790
Sir.

16
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,600
What?

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,110
There is no more Li Niang

18
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,760
in this world, right?

19
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,070
She died at the grave of her father and brother

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,550
on the Sentry of Loyal Spirits,

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
a worthy death,

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,630
spared the torment of heart.

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
Those insiders of Banyue Pavilion

24
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,480
Mr. Jia

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,280
and Miss Zhi Xia

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,950
have also been silenced by you, right?

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,350
To make a living in the entertainment field,

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,630
being cautious in words and deeds

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,880
is the foundation.

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
Since all the clues have been broken by Mr. Lan,

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,550
there is no more proof.

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,440
I am leaving.

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,320
Sir.

34
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,670
The goldfish you have raised
for many years

35
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,830
has been fed to death.

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,500
(A moment ago)

37
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,830
Little fish.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,110
Why is Zhang's

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,390
fate so rough?

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,040
Mr. Chen.

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
Your friend is dying.

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,320
Take a look.

43
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,760
Fish don't know whether
they are hungry or not,

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,670
and eat when there is food.

45
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,350
You fed so much

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
that the five-year-old goldfish

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,390
died shoring.

48
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,040
Sorry...

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,320
Sorry...

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,920
I was in a hurry just now.

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,200
Where did you buy this goldfish?

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I will compensate him.

53
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,110
Do you know how much
this goldfish is worth?

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,920
Ten taels?

55
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,830
One hundred taels?!

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,790
So expensive!

57
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,630
Yes.

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,720
Even if I sell my whole family,

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't afford it.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,720
Forget it.

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,000
It happens that some jobs

62
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,320
in my house require coolies.

63
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,830
How about you work

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,950
to pay off your debts?

65
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you want me to clean the yard

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,040
or cook in Lan's Mansion?

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,070
As...

68
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,280
As long as Mr. Lan

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,110
is willing to accept me.

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,110
You have to work for a long time
to earn 100 taels.

71
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,480
Is there anyone in your family

72
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,550
who can work with you to pay off the debt?

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,280
It happened because of me.

74
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,520
I will accompany Chen Zhao to stay
and work to pay off the debt.

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,640
What a deep brotherhood.

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,750
The rest

77
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,310
will be left to Xu Dong.

78
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,310
Yes, sir.

79
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,600
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,750
As soon as I went out,

81
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,640
I found two goldfishes overfed.

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Chen Cho had been lingering
in front of the fish tank.

83
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,480
I thought

84
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,350
I could use it to keep the two of them.

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,720
It's just been resolved.

86
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,750
If the two of them spread rumors,

87
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,110
it is hard to guarantee that

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,870
there will be no more disturbances.

89
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,350
Just keep them stuck for a while.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,230
From today onwards,

92
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,720
the wood shed will
be your responsibility.

93
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,550
These

94
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,640
all have to be chopped off?

95
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,310
Do it clean and tidy.

96
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,080
Mr. Lan is very particular

97
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,670
about food.

98
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,110
Well.

99
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,350
Where will we stay?

100
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,870
Here of course!

101
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:27,960
Zhang.

102
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,400
It's all my fault.

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,600
And you are stuck here because of me.

104
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,400
If I don't stay,

105
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,350
you have to work for the rest of your life.

106
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,020
(Fruitwood is suitable for smoking)

107
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,990
These jobs should take more than ten days.

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,350
Fruitwood is suitable for smoking.

109
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,670
Pine is suitable for stir-fry.

110
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,480
Oak

111
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,840
is suitable for stewing meat.

112
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,480
And here.

113
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,340
(Rice ears are suitable for steaming cakes)

114
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,020
(Reed is suitable for decocting)

115
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,740
(Acacia wood is suitable for making soup)

116
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,500
(Mulberry wood is suitable for burning)

117
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,260
(Cypress branches are suitable for smoking bacon
Oak is suitable for stewing meat)

118
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,980
(Reed is suitable for decocting
Rice ears are suitable for steaming cakes)

119
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,600
Here comes Mr. Lan.

120
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,840
Zhang Ping.

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,190
What do you mean?

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,310
Different dishes

123
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,920
should be cooked with different firewood,

124
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,400
so that the taste will be better.

125
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,920
Mr. Lan.

126
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,280
What Zhang meant was that

127
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,080
he continued to study food carefully

128
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,670
while chopping and washing firewood,

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,230
and discovered that different dishes

130
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,870
need to be paired

131
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,960
with different firewood.

132
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,670
So he classified the firewood

133
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,480
to improve the food quality of Lan's Mansion.

134
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,080
I see.

135
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,480
Great.

136
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,720
Great.

137
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,040
Zhang Ping.

138
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,520
I just know you like investigating cases.

139
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,480
I didn't expect you to be

140
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,670
so talented in handyman.

141
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,990
The wood shed

142
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,960
is in your element.

143
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,350
It's okay.

144
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,720
So I

145
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,280
have to thank you?

146
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,190
You are welcome.

147
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,480
Just a piece of cake.

148
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,870
If you are satisfied,

149
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,230
can we leave now?

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
The two of you

151
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,920
split so much firewood

152
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,310
in just a few days?

153
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,040
Mr. Lan, look.

154
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,960
This is

155
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,670
wood-chopping

156
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,600
Artifact

157
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,750
Zhang created.

158
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,520
Zhang Ping.

159
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,310
You demonstrate,

160
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,280
and I explain.

161
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,670
Come on.

162
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,760
As long as the firewood
is put into the artifact,

163
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,640
this part

164
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,760
will frame the wood,

165
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,710
making its range of motion very small.

166
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,000
When the hammer hits down,

167
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,240
the bottom of the log
will touch the ax momentarily,

168
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,310
splitting it in two.

169
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,790
Zhang Ping.

170
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,710
Show them more

171
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,590
what efficiency is.

172
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,120
Mr. Lan.

173
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,550
It's for you.

174
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,070
You can use it later in your mansion.

175
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,070
It is labor-saving

176
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,000
and efficient.

177
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,310
What I said to use wood shed work
to pay off debts

178
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,670
is calculated by the number of days.

179
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,640
You have only been working for a few days.

180
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,400
Don't you feel ashamed
to charge it for one hundred taels?

181
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,880
But you said earlier that...

182
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,240
Mr. Lan.

183
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,160
If there is any work in your house,

184
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,400
just let us know.

185
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,710
Follow me up.

186
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,240
Wait....

187
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,070
From today onwards,

188
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,640
all the latrines in Lan's Mansion
will be in your charge.

189
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,550
What?

190
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,400
We are going to clean the latrines?

191
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,190
Zhang.

192
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,120
Why do I feel that

193
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,590
Mr. Lan is deliberately messing with us now?

194
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Just finish our work and leave.

195
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,190
Zhang Ping has been obedient
in the past few days.

196
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,830
He has been working hard

197
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
with Chen Chou.

198
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,550
Just to sharpen his temper.

199
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,360
One by one.

200
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,400
One more.

201
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,830
Well.

202
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,880
Really nice.

203
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Why did they come to the back kitchen?

204
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,400
It smells good.

205
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,920
One by one, please line up.

206
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,240
One more.

207
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Everyone will get it.

208
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,240
It tastes so good.

209
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,040
One more for me.

210
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,950
Good?

211
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,070
- Sir.
- Sir. - Sir.

212
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,550
Sir.

213
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,070
Mr. Lan.

214
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,760
What are you doing here?

215
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,160
Make porridge.

216
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,430
Mr. Lan.

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
The past few days have been dry.

218
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,880
Rice is sweet and mild in nature,

219
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,280
perfect for invigorating the vital energy.

220
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,240
I've reserved a portion for you,

221
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,550
and I'm about to send it to you.

222
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,280
Please take a try.

223
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,310
Take a seat.

224
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,550
Zhang Ping.

225
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,590
The jujube is sweet and delicious.

226
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,190
Why did you make porridge with it?

227
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,430
I found that silk handkerchiefs
and rice paper

228
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,790
are used in the toilet,

229
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,950
and jujube is used to plug the nose.

230
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,520
It stands to reason that
silk and satin should be used as clothes,

231
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,590
paper should be used for writing,

232
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,830
and food should be used to fill the stomach.

233
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,640
I think you are

234
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,400
using them wrong.

235
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,400
So

236
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,670
I replaced the silk handkerchief
and rice paper

237
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,040
with bamboo chip and coarse cloth,

238
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,760
and the jujube with silkworm cocoons.

239
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,950
Then I cooked this porridge
with the replaced jujube.

240
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,550
What are you doing?

241
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,000
You!

242
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,950
Why?

243
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,160
Why?

244
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,950
Zhang.

245
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,360
Zhang Ping.

246
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,280
Are you humiliating Mr. Lan so much

247
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,550
because you don't want to leave?

248
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Humiliating?

249
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,920
I took two bowls of porridge myself.

250
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,070
If it weren't reserved for you,

251
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,070
I'd have taken it.

252
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,190
After what happened in the wood shed,

253
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,430
I did realize that

254
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,070
you wanted to keep me here on purpose.

255
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm not interested in your means.

256
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,430
I have no more evidence

257
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,280
to expose you.

258
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,190
You don't have to worry about me.

259
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,280
But if it happens again next time,

260
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,670
I'll still check it out.

261
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,400
Why did you come back to save me

262
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,000
at the Sentry of Loyal Spirits

263
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,920
now that you assumed
I had ulterior motives?

264
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,550
You were a victim at that time.

265
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
I couldn't just watch Li Niang
murder and break the law.

266
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,880
This is the first time

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,310
I've met someone like you.

268
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,880
Forget it.

269
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,430
As long as you promise to keep secret,

270
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,590
everything else

271
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,670
will be written off.

272
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,950
You can leave now.

273
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,880
You have to pay me back the five cents
you owe me for the noodle.

274
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,280
If you pay back the money,

275
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,000
we will be completely even.

276
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,360
So many things have happened,

277
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,710
but what you are thinking about
is the five cents?

278
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,070
Give him five cents.

279
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,830
One missing.

280
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,430
Mr. Lan.

281
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,430
Goodbye.

282
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,520
Peizhi.

283
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,760
You said to invite me for tea
after the matter is over.

284
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,470
I've been waiting for a long time.

285
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,670
Mowen, forgive me.

286
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,470
I just finished dealing with last night.

287
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,470
Zhang Ping's matter has been resolved?

288
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,280
I got tranquility for now.

289
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
When I saw Zhang Ping,

290
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,000
I thought of you ten years ago.

291
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,520
Back then...

292
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
When I was young,

293
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
I was never as straightforward as he is.

294
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,040
Weren't you?

295
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,470
If not, how could we get to know each other?

296
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,190
Pancakes.

297
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,360
Sir, want one?

298
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,600
This is a reward from our young master.

299
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,640
Hold on.

300
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,270
This is the money I gave him

301
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,270
to mend his clothes.

302
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,600
What a

303
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,160
ignorant poor!

304
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,560
How dare you provoke the son
of the current Grand Commandant?

305
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,750
Weren't you straightforward?

306
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,470
But

307
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,270
if it weren't for this coin,

308
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,990
we wouldn't be friends.

309
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,160
Mr. Wang.

310
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,400
Tea, please.

311
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,430
Tea, please.

312
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,270
Your tea.

313
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,080
What I mean is that

314
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,710
you actually

315
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,430
admire Zhang Ping.

316
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,160
I just don't appreciate his stubbornness

317
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,560
and want to see him bow his head.

318
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,750
But

319
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I have to admit that

320
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,600
he's kind of capable.

321
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,710
That day I went to Banyue Pavilion
to take care of the aftermath.

322
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,920
I heard from Mr. Jia that

323
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,800
Zhang Ping used thaumaturgy

324
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,360
to find the real culprit

325
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,430
soon after he returned.

326
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,750
What thaumaturgy?

327
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,670
Do you remember that crazy dancer?

328
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,600
That day, Zhang Ping applied

329
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,710
Water Illusion to her,

330
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,990
saying that it could look into people's hearts

331
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,990
and create flashback.

332
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,880
As he said, he found clues

333
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,320
from her memory

334
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,400
and found the real murderer,

335
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,080
Li Niang.

336
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,800
Flashback?

337
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,800
Haven't you been looking for

338
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,750
the woman who took your father away?

339
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,470
With such thaumaturgy,

340
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,880
it may be possible

341
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,640
to remind you of more details.

342
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,880
I am leaving.

343
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,880
If you have time,

344
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,080
go to my place for mutton soup.

345
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,800
Okay, uncle.

346
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,270
I am leaving.

347
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,080
Mr. Lan, you also came for bathing?

348
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,880
I came for you.

349
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,270
I just went to your house.

350
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,400
They said you are here.

351
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,560
Aren't we even?

352
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,990
Mr. Lan.

353
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,120
Let's talk about it

354
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,360
at your house.

355
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,710
Zhang.

356
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,920
You got the book upside down.

357
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,990
Do you know

358
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,510
where Guo Yun is now?

359
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,600
Normally,

360
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,950
he should be exiled to

361
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,920
Jiannan,

362
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,990
Ling'nan

363
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,120
or Qixi.

364
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,080
I am the son of a criminal.

365
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,470
He pinpointed my weakness

366
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,470
and tried hard to frame me.

367
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,840
If I don't fight back,

368
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,320
the end

369
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,640
will only be a hundred times
more miserable than his.

370
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,320
I'm not interested in court affairs.

371
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,600
Just get to the point.

372
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,920
To be honest,

373
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,220
I came here today

374
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,640
because I heard that you have thaumaturgy,

375
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,840
which can bring back memories.

376
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,710
I'd like to find out.

377
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,920
No problem, sir.

378
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,750
I am an orphan.

379
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,950
When my master picked me up,

380
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,990
this water vessel was with me.

381
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,670
Although I can't remember what happened
in my childhood,

382
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,800
I am

383
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,800
very close to it,

384
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,320
as if

385
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,080
I can interact with it naturally.

386
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,190
But I don't know

387
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,800
where the origin of it is.

388
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,470
Water Illusion

389
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
is a name given by my master.

390
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,990
The master said that

391
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
it can allow people

392
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,560
to see their original mind

393
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,510
in the virtual reality of the mirror image.

394
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,670
What do you need to explore

395
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,360
with it?

396
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,400
I want you to

397
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,710
help me find someone.

398
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,360
Zhang Ping.

399
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,160
If you don't want to help me,

400
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,920
I won't force you.

401
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,320
It's fine with me.

402
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,270
It's just a matter

403
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,190
of your will.

404
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,080
What do you mean?

405
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,920
If you are applied with Water Illusion,

406
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,320
it is tantamount

407
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,470
to being honest with me.

408
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,600
All secrets

409
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,360
will be kept unreserved.

410
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,120
What if

411
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,990
I have other secrets

412
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,270
and cannot be honest?

413
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,430
Then Water Illusion won't work.

414
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,510
Forget it.

415
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,080
Just pretend I haven't been here.

416
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,710
Sir.

417
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,640
What's going on?

418
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,880
He left angry.

419
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,500
(Twenty days later)

420
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,260
(Pingkang Community, Feihua Pavilion)

421
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,950
Is this lady qualified?

422
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,920
(Painter-sage, Wei Mao)

423
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,990
Her singing is so beautiful

424
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,120
that I am mesmerized.

425
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,510
No?

426
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,470
What kind of talent

427
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,270
can impress him?

428
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,080
I'd like to know.

429
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,600
Wine.

430
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,320
Where is my wine?

431
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,560
Painter-sage is such a heavy drinker.

432
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,190
Several carts of wine have been delivered.

433
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,470
What is he going to paint?

434
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,670
I heard that

435
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,840
he wanted to select a talented and skilled

436
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,600
official lady in the whole capital

437
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,470
to paint on his final work.

438
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,120
The whole capital?

439
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,080
What are you talking about?

440
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,750
Offer him the wine.

441
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
The wine

442
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,030
is coming.

443
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,400
Sir.

444
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,080
It's been a whole night.

445
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,750
The beauties competed with each other.

446
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,360
You enjoyed more than thirty performances

447
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,120
and drank dozens of jars of wine.

448
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,360
But why

449
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,560
didn't you paint anything?

450
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,080
Beauties?

451
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,470
All boring.

452
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,230
The silk of E'xi

453
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,990
is so rare.

454
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,560
There is only

455
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,030
this one piece of silk of E'xi.

456
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,510
If I painted now,

457
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,880
wouldn't it be a waste of this piece of silk?

458
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,320
It seems that

459
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,950
the Painter-sage's final work

460
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,320
will be

461
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,190
a blank paper.

462
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,400
a blank paper.

463
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,510
