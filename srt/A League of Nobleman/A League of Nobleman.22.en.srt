No.

I can give you a discount.

Ten pennies for a piece.

41

The words worth thousands of gold

42

suffered such bad luck.

43
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,750
What a pity.

do you mean?

46

You will pass the imperial exam

47

next year for sure.

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,800
By then, these calligraphy and paintings

can't be bought

even with thousands of gold.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Your writing is generous,

52
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,800
casual and detached.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,240
But your poems

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,430
are all seven-character octaves,

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
like shackles in a cage,

56
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,430

calligraphic vigour and style.

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,710
Your sincerity

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
is difficult to display.

60
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,000
What suits you best

61
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,280
is not verses,

62

but ancient poems.

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,430
For example,

64
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,040
if you slightly adjust the two
characters in this sentence

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,830
and change it to

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
"Kunlun comes to Yanran from the west",

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
it will be more in line
with your calligraphic style.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
If you do pass the exam,

69
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,390
I'll congratulate you.

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,070
It's just that

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,270
I can't help feeling sorry
for the trapped true temperament.

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
That being the case,

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,480
it is I who took advantage of you.

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,040
Hold on.

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,430
I am not

76

selling this calligraphy.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,120
I did write a poem

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,390
on this subject.

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,310

ask your name?

You can call me Shulin.

86

I've been admiring the seven sages
of the bamboo grove since childhood.

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,870
I even stole my father's wine,

88
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,950
drank in the bamboo grove

89
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,070

Later,

92
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,430
in order to reverse my father's case,

93
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,720
I had to be an official,

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,950
and I had to study Confucianism

95
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,830
and the system

96
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,950
to imprison myself.

97
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,160
I didn't expect him

98
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,270
to see through me when we first met.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,830
It is rare to meet

100
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,310
such a confidant in life.

101
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,390
People who can see through you

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,600
are rare indeed.

In short,

104

Shulin and I became good friends

105

after we got acquainted.

106
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,870
Since the sudden change in my family,

107
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,870

of time for me.

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,480
why practicing regular script
in small characters?

174
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,150
I got some advice today

175
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,600
that my handwriting is too sloppy,

176
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,600
and I need to practice more
regular script and clerical script

177
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,630
to improve it.

178
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,960
Who made this review?

179
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
Master of calligraphy,

180
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Minister Sun.

181
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,630
Nonsense.

182
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,270
Just because he likes regular script,

183
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,270
the whole world has to write it?

184
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,960
Peizhi.

185
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,510
You are throwing the gem
into the frying pan,

186
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,870
and chopping the fine wood
into a coffin.

187
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,550
Peizhi.

188
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,670
Peizhi.

189
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,840
Peizhi.

190
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,550
Peizhi.

191
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,510
Shulin.

192
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,840
Sorry.

193
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,200
Peizhi.

194
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,080
In fact, I know that

195
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,480
Minister Sun is not only
a master of calligraphy,

196
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,510
but also the chief examiner
of this year's imperial examination.

197
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,120
But with your talents,

198
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
you don't have to be like this

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,510
to be on the list.

200
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,510
There are millions of people
in the world.

201
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,320
No one can cover all the bases.

202
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,670
Always pandering

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,390
will cost you more than you gain.

204
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,550
I had always felt ashamed

205
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
in front of Shulin.

206
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,390
So I decided to

207
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,600
focus on the present

208
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,440
and temporarily alienate him.

209
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,840
What about later?

210
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,960
Forget it.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,030
Everything ends in smoke.

212
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,840
One finished, all is finished.

213
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,200
(Xinfeng wine)
(After the imperial exam that year,)

214
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,270
(I was shocked to hear that)

215
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,120
(the order of the examiners was changed.)

216
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,720
(I have made the article)

217
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
(simple and rigorous.)

218
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,390
(But the new examiner)

219
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,840
(liked fresh and elegant essays the most.)

220
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
(I felt desperate.)

221
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,960
(I bought food and drink
with the remaining money)

222
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,000
(and put rat poison in my tass.)

223
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,080
Peizhi.

224
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,840
I didn't expect Shulin,

225
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
who hadn't returned for many days,

226
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,360
to come to our rented house that night.

227
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,320
Peizhi.

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,150
Even if your article

229
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,120
is so simple

230
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,870
and rigorous that

231
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,000
you cannot be ranked
among the top three,

232
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,550
at least you

233
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,390
can be on the list.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,550
Peizhi.

235
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,030
In the worst case,

236
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,550
if you failed the exam this time,

237
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,630
you can try it again

238
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,840
next year.

239
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,750
(He knew that I was in a bad mood,)

240
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,030
(so he came to relieve me.)

241
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,320
(But I was determined to die then)

242
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,270
(and I didn't care about anything.)

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,000
Cheers.

244
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,270
(I thought)

245
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,720
(it was all over.)

246
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,630
(I didn't expect that)

247
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,750
(the next day I was awakened
by the harsh sunlight.)

248
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,720
(Shulin)

249
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,480
(had disappeared.)

250
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,240
(I didn't expect myself)

251
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,080
(to be so ill-fated that)

252
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,270
(even the rat poison I bought was fake.)

253
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,550
But later

254
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,270
you still got into
the official position smoothly.

255
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
Because Minister Liu suddenly fell ill

256
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,320
and couldn't go over examination papers.

257
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,550
My article was gone over

258
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,440
by the original Minister Sun.

259
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,670
I finally got the third place

260
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,150
and entered the court as an official.

261
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,750
My only regret is that

262
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Shulin left without saying goodbye

263
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,910
and I've never heard from him.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,240
Now that you're all right,

265
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,790
I am leaving.

266
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,750
I will think about the case.

267
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,440
Go to bed early, sir.

268
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,580
=A League of Nobleman=

269
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
=Episode 22=

270
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,040
Zhang, what have you been doing
after the exam?

271
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,590
I could hardly find you.

272
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,630
Well...

273
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,110
You are out of your mind

274
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,920
even when you eat.

275
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,440
Chen Chou.

276
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,630
Do you remember

277
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,830
the first time we met?

278
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,680
Well.

279
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,720
Who would remember this?

280
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,070
It seems that...

281
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,350
It seems that someone said that

282
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,480
a scholar from Xichuan County

283
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,070
has a strange temper

284
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,110
and almost

285
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,590
doesn't talk to others.

286
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,350
I ran into you.

287
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,720
So I said hi.

288
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,200
And we got to know each other.

289
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,110
How familiar do two people need to be

290
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,590
to become confidants?

291
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,390
Zhang, have some tea.

292
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
A confidant

293
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,480
is

294
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,630
hard to come by.

295
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,240
Some people can't become confidants

296
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,200
even after being friends for a lifetime.

297
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,920
Are we confidants?

298
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,240
We...

299
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,000
Of course.

300
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,070
Of course we are.

301
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
(Sir, are you still hesitating)

302
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,440
(whether to meet that Mr. Gu?)

303
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,550
I have to see him anyway.

304
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,550
Why should I be hesitant?

305
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,280
Peizhi.

306
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,720
Ten years on,

307
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,480
everything has changed.

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,350
I didn't expect the flowers

309
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,110
to be as prosperous
as they were back then.

310
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,040
That year, on a whim,

311
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,920
we stole his sampan

312
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,200
and had a boat ride on a lake
while the old fisherman was asleep.

313
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,040
That's how we found this cottage

314
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,350
in the middle of the lake.

315
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,630
At that time, we fled in the boat.

316
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,070
In fact, even if he found out,

317
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
we just needed to apologize.

318
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,310
I don't understand why we fled.

319
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,790
Peizhi.

320
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,870
It's too late to realize it.

321
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,590
You still remember?

322
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,680
Of course I do.

323
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,480
At that time, you always forgot
to bring the key

324
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,960
and were locked out many times.

325
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,390
It was my idea.

326
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,070
It's the same here as it was back then.

327
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,390
This...

328
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,590
After I became an official,

329
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I was in better condition,

330
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,760
so I bought this place.

331
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,480
We rented such a humble room

332
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,000
because it was cheap and quiet.

333
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Why did you buy it?

334
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
The good times we had here

335
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,000
were precious.

336
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,870
I bought the house as a consolation.

337
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,000
I wonder if the jar of wine is still there

338
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,920
after ten years.

339
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,590
We buried it together

340
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
ten years ago

341
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,200
and agreed to drink it
after the palace examination.

342
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,870
It's still there.

343
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
Would you like to drink it?

344
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,200
Sure.

345
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,280
Let's get hammered.

346
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,630
What's up?

347
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,150
I would like to ask Mr. Lan

348
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,240
how is the torn page going.

349
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,870
He went to meet someone.

350
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,240
He will be right back.

351
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,240
Just wait here

352
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,310
for a while.

353
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,200
Cheers.

354
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,550
Shulin.

355
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,350
Why did you leave
without saying goodbye?

356
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,830
I didn't leave without saying goodbye.

357
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,110
I just fell ill suddenly

358
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,830
and had to leave.

359
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,280
I remember you
were always in good health.

360
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,520
Back then when we swam in the cold lake
and slept in the wind,

361
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,070
you never got sick.

362
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,720
Why were you sick all of a sudden?

363
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,310
It was an emergency.

364
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,720
Shulin.

365
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,590
You didn't tell me the truth.

366
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,590
Why bring it up again?

367
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,630
I have been brooding over this matter.

368
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,390
I think that if I can meet you
again one day,

369
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,960
I have to ask you about this.

370
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,870
Remember

371
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,110
the last time we met?

372
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,520
Of course I do.

373
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,310
At that time,

374
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I thought I was going to fail the exam,

375
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,040
so I got very drunk.

376
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,310
I knew that you were determined to die.

377
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,200
So in desperation,

378
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,830
I exchanged the wine glasses of ours.

379
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,960
I drank the poisoned wine.

380
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,960
Later, seeing that you were drunk,

381
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,790
I pretended to go out,

382
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,440
vomited the poisoned wine,

383
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,680
and immediately went to the doctor.

384
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,480
Although I was out of danger,

385
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,550
I couldn't treat the root

386
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,920
and left behind a chronic disease.

387
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,680
Why didn't you tell me?

388
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,000
I saw that you were so sad,

389
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,830
and I was afraid
you would be more worried,

390
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,110
so I chose to leave alone,

391
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,590
hoping to slowly
heal this chronic disease.

392
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,110
How could you do this?

393
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,310
Over the years, I have searched
all over for detoxification,

394
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,310
and gradually cleared my poison.

395
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,390
It is precisely because of this

396
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,870
that I became attached to the plants

397
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,760
and learned some medical skills.

398
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,590
Otherwise, I couldn't make
an antidote for you.

399
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,280
It's true that

400
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,040
everything has an intrinsic connection.

401
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,590
Shulin.

402
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,390
You've suffered

403
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,520
all these years.

404
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,630
We got along with each other sincerely

405
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,630
and became confidants.

406
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,000
Back then, you should have told me

407
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,760
how depressed you were.

408
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,240
I was burdened with the shackles
as the son of a criminal minister,

409
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,240
and everything I did

410
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,110
was for the sake of becoming an official
through the imperial examination

411
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,310
and overturning my father's case.

412
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,440
I didn't explain to you

413
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,870
because I was afraid of
dragging you down.

414
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,550
Peizhi.

415
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,150
I got you.

416
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,870
Why did I fall asleep?

417
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm starving.

418
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,760
Zhang Ping.

419
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,070
So early.

420
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,830
Let me introduce.

421
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,520
This is my old friend.

422
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,830
Gu Qingzhang,
or you can call him Shulin.

423
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,720
This is Zhang Ping.

424
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,520
Nice to meet you.

425
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,070
Shulin is knowledgeable

426
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,310
and understands herbal medical science.

427
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,000
Zhang Ping.

428
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,760
If you don't understand anything
in this regard,

429
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
ask him for advice.

430
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,630
By the way,

431
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,790
did you come looking for me

432
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,200
because of any progress of the case?

433
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,760
No, so I'm here to ask

434
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,040
how is the torn page going.

435
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,830
The words on it are very
involved and abstruse.

436
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,070
I have searched all over the ancient books
and compared them word by word,

437
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,200
but it is still difficult to form a sentence.

438
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,520
I have collected a few ancient books,

439
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,040
which may be of some help.

440
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,240
In this case, thank you in advance.

441
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,200
Zhang.

442
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,280
Zhang.

443
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,200
Zhang.

444
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,480
Why are you here?

445
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,040
You haven't come home all night,

446
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,590
and I guess you're here.

447
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,350
I have good news for you.

448
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Come home with me.

449
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,350
I have to investigate the case
with Mr. Lan.

450
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,390
Put the case aside for now.

451
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,310
Look at you.

452
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,350
You don't care about anything else.

453
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,630
Are there two people

454
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,830
with very similar voices in this world?

455
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,110
Of course.

456
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,760
Why are you asking this?

457
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,200
Come home with me
to hear the good news.

458
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,070
Zhang.

459
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,000
What's the good news?

460
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
Don't worry.

461
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,520
Look.

462
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,150
What did I cook for you today?

463
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,310
Eggs.

464
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,000
Then think about

465
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,350
why I cooked eggs.

466
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,760
No idea.

467
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,150
Because they are round.

468
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,870
This is called
the Banquet of the First Scholar.

469
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,590
Wait.

470

(The 20th Year of Yongxuan's
Palace Examination Selected List)

471
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,280
(10th Place Zhang Ping)
Zhang, you entered the palace examination.

472
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
Ma Lian was dismissed for cheating.

473
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,480
You, as number eleven,

474
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,680
became number ten.

475
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,830
This imperial list

476
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,630
is posted all over
the streets and alleys.

477
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,790
I just took one back as a souvenir.

478
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,350
It's such a wonderful thing.

479
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,630
You have to seize the opportunity.

480
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,720
After taking this meal,

481
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,870
in tomorrow's palace examination,

482
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,350
you will definitely win the first place.

483
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,870
But I don't want to
take the palace examination.

484
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,440
Why?

485
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,390
I took the imperial examination

486
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,280
to follow in the footsteps of Mu Yesheng.

487

Mr. Tao's end now,

489
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,720
I don't know

whether should I become
an official or not.

Which scholar

493
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,310
didn't persevere in his studies
in spite of hardships,

494
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,310
and came to the capital
after suffering a lot?

495
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,240
Anyone who has this chance

496
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,440
would be grateful.

497
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,550
But you want to give up.

498
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,390
Have you ever thought about the feelings

499

of someone like me who failed the exam?

500

Chen Chou, I didn't mean that.

501
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,150
That being the case,

502
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,070
don't take this meal.

503
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,720
You won't need it anyway.

(you were very much like me back then.)

509
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,040
(But the reality is so.)

510
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,000
(If you were me,)

511
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,790
(what would you do?)

512
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,520
Shulin, here you are.

513
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,720
Do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

514
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,920
How did you know it's me?

515
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,390
You are the only one

516
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,280
who comes and goes without permission.

517
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,590
No.

518
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,150
So does Zhang Ping.

519
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,520
What are you hiding?

520
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,790
Could it be...

521
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,070
It's chestnuts.

522
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,390
I didn't know chestnuts back then,

523
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,920
so I ate a big bag of it

524
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,000
and drank cold tea.

525
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm afraid it's
the laughingstock of my life.

526
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,070
You are the first one I have ever seen

527
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,760
who ate so many chestnuts that
you had to take digestive medicine.

528
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,520
Sir.

529
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,830
Zhang Ping.

530
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,720
Come on.

531
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,110
You came just in time.

532
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,480
Don't you also like chestnuts?

533
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,280
Presumably you came here

534
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,630
for the torn page again.

535
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,350
Although there is no breakthrough
in the sentence,

536
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,110
there is a new translation today.

537
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,240
Read it

538
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,830
to see if there are new clues.

539
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,310
What?

540
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,000
Anything in your mind?

541
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,520
It is easy to stagnate liver qi

542
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,310
if you keep it all inside.

543
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,110
You might as well speak out

544
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,040
to release yourself.

545
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,760
What happened?

546
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,830
Peizhi.

547
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,480
Every autumn and winter,

548
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,960
my cough gets worse.

549
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,110
I'll be fine after taking the medicine
for a few days.

550
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,720
It's okay.

551
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,120
