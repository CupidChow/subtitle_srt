1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,350
You are the Empress Dowager
of the Yong Kingdom,

2
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,000
with supreme power in your hands.

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,750
Since you could sacrifice
your own child

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,790
for power and all,

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,920
watch them crumble
before your own eyes.

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,200
Mother.

7
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,470
Don't you love power most?

8
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,510
After all these people are dead,

9
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,310
how about you

10
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,430
go underground

11
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,790
to be the supreme Empress Dowager?

12
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,480
Power is inherently ruthless.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't you want me to bow my head.

14
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,200
Even at this moment,

15
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,640
you still don't admit your mistakes

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,790
and regret it?

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
Mother.

18
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,120
I just want to hear you say

19
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,350
you regret it.

20
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,150
Have you ever

21
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,760
cared about me?

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,470
I never regret it.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,910
And I have to thank you.

24
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,630
After tonight,

25
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,000
all the people in the whole city
will be dead.

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,150
Then no one will know my secret,

27
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,840
and I will still have
an everlasting name.

28
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,590
Okay.

29
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,190
Since you are still so stubborn,

30
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,150
die

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
with your power.

32
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,750

from a serious illness.)

33

Your nickname

44
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,950
is Tan'er.

Thank you.

Hold it tight.

It's for you.

51
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,840
Come on. It's for you.

52
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,990
Thank you.

53
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,910
Take it.

54
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,790
Here you are.

55
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
We have spent so much effort

56
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,550
just to stop it all,

57
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,080
but we still cannot escape it.

58
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,960
We'd better run.

59
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,550
Save as many people as we can.

60
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,040
Otherwise we all have to die here.

61
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,350
I got it.

62
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,520
Rain.

63
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,840
As long as it rains,

64
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,350
the pollen doesn't get airborne.

65
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,870
Good idea.

66
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,230
Before or after Grain Rain,

67
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,470
when the clouds become like this,
the rain will fall.

68
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,040
It looks like

69
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,550
it's going to rain.

70
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,430
But we don't know when.

71
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,520
Use a rain catcher.

72
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,790
Just sprinkle a lot of salt
into the rain catcher,

73
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,110
ignite it with gunpowder,

74
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,200
sprinkle the salt high into the sky,

75
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,430
and it will turn clouds into rain.

76
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,640
Generally, the rain catcher
is built on a high place.

77
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,790
And the rain catcher in the capital

78
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,720
is on Yunxiao Mountain.

79
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,350
The Ministry of Rites

80
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
has documented the use of rain catcher.

81
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,280
It's just that it hasn't been
used for years,

82
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,910
and it's probably obsolete.

83
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,400
Cannons can be used instead.

84
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,310
Okay.

85
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,640
Let's split up.

86
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,280
There are cannon and ammunition
at the gate of the city.

87
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I'm sending someone to fetch them now.

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,840
I will escort the people.

89
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
I am familiar with the terrain
of the capital,

90
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,760
and I can assist Mr. Lan.

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,080
Then I'll get the salt.

92
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,160
I need some helpers.

93
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,470
I am willing to go.

94
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,230
In front of the disaster,

95
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,160
I am willing to make my humble effort.

96
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,430
I am also going.

97
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,910
It's just that

98
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,910
we need to move much salt
up the mountain.

99
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,470
I'm afraid that you...

100
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
We are going.

101
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,990
Sir.

102
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,670
Xu Dong.

103
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,600
You...

104
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
This is the first time
we have disobeyed your will.

105
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,310
But we are willing to

106
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,870
live and die with you.

107
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,520
Yes.

108
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,310
We will be wherever you are.

109
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,550
Okay.

110
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,790
Okay.

111
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,110
Sirs,

112
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,040
please help me

113
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,080
evacuate the people

114
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
and escort them up the mountain.

115
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,480
The terrain there is high,

116
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,070
and it may be safer.

117
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,790
Go.

118
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,670
Let's split up and save people.

119
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,950
Let's go find salt.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,640
Come on.

121
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,040
This way.

122
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,310
Here.

123
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,670
This...

124
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,040
That's far from enough.

125
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,550
Yes.

126
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,360
Look for more.

127
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,710
Not these ones.

128
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,280
Let's go to another place.

129
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,280
I am a salt merchant.

130
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,550
What do you need salt for?

131
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,830
We will bring rain with salt.

132
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,880
As long as it rains,

133
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,120
the capital will be saved.

134
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,520
The salt from my shop

135
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,550
has just arrived at the wharf,

136
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,910
and it weighs 600 catties.

137
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,790
I am willing to contribute
the entire inventory.

138
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,640
I can take you there.

139
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,360
Thanks so much.

140
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,120
Here.

141
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,040
Come on.

142
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,070
Zhang Ping.

143
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,400
Come on.

144
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,160
We have enough people.

145
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,880
Go help Mr. Lan.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,520
Yes.

147
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,760
Okay.

148
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,880
Take care.

149
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,640
Don't worry.

150
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,120
Let's go.

151
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,550
Go.

152
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,950
Go.

153
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,520
Everyone.

154
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,360
Everyone.

155
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,550
Put on a face towel
to cover your mouth and nose.

156
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,430
Hurry up to Yunxiao Mountain,
don't stay in a low place.

157
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,760
Hurry up to Yunxiao Mountain.
Put on a face towel

158
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,710
to cover your mouth and nose.

159
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,120
Grandpa.

160
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,520
Grandpa Yang.

161
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,120
The capital is so large.

162
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,790
But I am all alone.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,760
What about those who cannot hear?

164
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,240
Everyone.

165
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
Don't be afraid of the poisonous mist.

166
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,310
Don't linger in the low places.

167
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,360
Go to Yunxiao Mountain
as soon as possible.

168
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Xu Lu, Wang Cheng, why are you here?

169
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,830
You can't be a hero alone.

170
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,120
If we see the people suffer
and stay out of it,

171
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,640
our study will be in vain.

172
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,760
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

173
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,280
Everyone.

174
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,790
Everyone.

175
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,550
Put on a face towel
to cover your mouth and nose.

176
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,160
You should go there.

177
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,280
Cover your mouth and nose.

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,190
Put on a face towel
to cover your mouth and nose.

179
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,430
Put on a face towel
to cover your mouth and nose.

180
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
Everyone, hurry up.

181
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,310
We are almost there.

182
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,280
Go.

183
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,590
My revenge succeeded.

184
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,590
My revenge succeeded.

185
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,360
My revenge succeeded...

186
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,910
The scarlet mist...

187
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
The scarlet mist is coming again.

188
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,670
The scarlet mist...

189
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,670
The scarlet mist is coming again.

190
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,310
Run!

191
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,830
The scarlet mist is coming.

192
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,240
Bros, come on.

193
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,910
Hurry up.

194
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,640
Hurry up.

195
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,760
Take care.

196
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,040
Hurry up.

197
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,590
Come on.

198
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,790
Put it here.

199
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,520
Come on.

200
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,950
- Here.
- Be gentle.

201
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,430
Hurry up.

202
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,040
Come on.

203
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Mix them well.

204
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,790
Be careful.

205
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,590
Mix the salt and gunpowder.

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,950
Load them into shells.

207
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
Hurry up.

208
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,910
Come on.

209
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,070
Pour it.

210
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,160
Hold tight.

211
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,520
Reload

212
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,000
and induce rain.

213
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,670
Reload.

214
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,040
Baby.

215
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,310
My baby.

216
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,190
Baby.

217
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,400
Thank you.

218
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,880
Reload. Once more.

219
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,880
General.

220
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,070
The salt bomb has run out.

221
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,880
Then

222
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,520
it's up to God's will.

223
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
What to do?

224
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,520
Why hasn't Mr. Lan arrived?

225
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,070
Mr. Xu.

226
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,040
Where is Mr. Lan?

227
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,480
He insisted on leaving

228
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,360
after everyone went up the mountain.

229
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,670
He is probably behind.

230
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,760
Where is Zhang?

231
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,480
He's with Mr. Lan.

232
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,200
Zhang.

233
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Why don't you come up?

234
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,590
Mr. Lan is back.

235
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,110
Zhang.

236
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,350
Take care.

237
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,440
Sir.

238
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,720
How is it?

239
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,240
Sir.

240
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,280
I'm glad you are fine.

241
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,920
Are you okay?

242
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,680
Yes.

243
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,150
Zhang Ping.

244
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,350
If I'm going to die today,

245
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't want to have

246
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,150
anything to do with you in the next life.

247
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,920
I don't believe in ghosts and gods,

248
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,760
nor do I believe in an afterlife.

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,240
You are still a spoiler.

250
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,150
It's raining.

251
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,520
Yes.

252
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,680
It's raining.

253
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Great.

254
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,280
Finally.

255
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,590
Mr. Lan.

256
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,720
This orchid sachet

257
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,960
was given to me

258
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,520
by your father 20 years ago.

259
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,480
Now

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,870
I'm returning it to its original owner.

261
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,590
Hurry up.

262
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,070
Let me.

263
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
One for me.

264
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,280
Okay.

265
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,000
Take care.

266
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,070
Granny.

267
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,390
Grandpa Yang is gone.

268
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,440
But you still have me and Zhang Ping.

269
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,150
Don't worry.

270
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,070
From now on, Zhang and I

271
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,550
will come to help you every week.

272
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,630
It's my fault.

273
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,590
Mr. Wang.

274
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,150
It's my fault.

275
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,110
Look at you...

276
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,040
News of victory!

277
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,070
News of victory!

278
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,390
His Majesty

279
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,680
came back in triumph.

280
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,590
- Victory!
- It's victory!

281
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,590
I heard that the capital
was in great trouble,

282
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,550
so I led an elite trooper to support.

283
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,110
Mr. Liu.

284
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,520
Are you fine?

285
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,070
Your Majesty.

286
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,960
I...

287
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,070
Welcome Your Majesty
to come back in triumph.

288
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,630
Welcome Your Majesty
to come back in triumph.

289
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,150
Arise.

290
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

291
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,920
My son.

292
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,480
My son.

293
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,390
Great.

294
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,310
Ziyi.

295
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,280
Ziyi.

296
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,350
Dad.

297
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,590
My son.

298
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,390
Dad.

299
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,040
My son.

300
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:44,140
(Hanhui Pavilion, Ning'an)

301
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,200
For the past 20 years,

302
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,630
the Empress Dowager
ruled the government,

303
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,390
and the common people
were full of grievances.

304
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,960
I have always worried about

305
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,870
whether I can be a good emperor.

306
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,960
But now

307
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,720
I don't worry about it anymore.

308
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,920
I am going to create a new look

309
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,350
and return the beloved motherland
to the people.

310
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,830
Don't you care whether my bloodline
is true or not?

311
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,070
I only know that

312
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,040
the one who can make the people
live and work in peace and contentment,

313
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,310
and free the world of crimes

314
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,790
is a good emperor.

315
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,960
Do you know

316
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,000
why I sent you to be the magistrate
of Yiping County?

317
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,870
Why?

318
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,310
Right now, the aftermath of the capital
is not over yet.

319
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,630
The Empress Dowager's remnant party
hasn't been totally eliminated.

320
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,760
You are upright.

321
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,760
If you are involved in it,

322
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,830
it will be very dangerous.

323
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,790
You'd better be trained outside

324
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,870
for a few years first.

325
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,520
A few years?

326
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,310
I expect a lot from you.

327
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,280
In the future,

328
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,960
you will be the Minister of
the Court of Judicial Review.

329
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,040
Of course.

330
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,040
You will even be prime minister.

331
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,630
But I...

332
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,720
You still want to go to
the Court of Judicial Review.

333
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,760
I know.

334
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,520
Yes,

335
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,680

336

Zhang.

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,680
You are about to become
the county magistrate,

343
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,110
why are you still frowning?

344
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,150
This is an opportunity

345
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,440
that countless scholars dream of.

346
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,920
Don't worry.

347
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,310
After arriving in Yiping County,

348
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,110
I will definitely help you

349
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,310
manage the accounts clearly.

350
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,590
I was thinking that
I could only investigate cases.

351
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,550
As for being the county magistrate...

352
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,720
His Majesty said that

353
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,790
you can even be prime minister.

354
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,520
A mere county magistrate
would be easy for you.

355
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,550
Our life will definitely
get better and better.

356
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,390
Everything will be better

357
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,310
when you become prime minister.

358
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,100
(Court of Judicial Review)

359
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,830
My mother is so good at cooking.

360
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,630
Yes.

361
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,720
It's your turn.

362
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,070
I wonder

363
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,590
who is

364
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,630
the new Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

365
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,070
Just enjoy ourselves

366
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,870
as usual

367
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
no matter who comes.

368
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,280
Yes.

369
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,480
Mr. Wang.

370
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,040
Mr. Wang.

371
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,590
Could it be that you are

372
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,200
the new Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review?

373
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,440
Could it be you?

374
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,040
Someone.

375
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,040
Yes.

376
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,000
Move out all the files backlogged

377
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,150
in the case archive.

378
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,920
Yes.

379
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,440
Sir.

380
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,630
Now your father
was cleared of wrongdoing.

381
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,040
You can finally relax.

382
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,870
You can also take the young master

383
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,110
back to the mansion for reunion.

384
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,590
Over the years,
I had been in deep crisis

385
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,150
to clear my father's grievances.

386
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,830
I was afraid of hurting Lan Hui,

387
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,790
so I fostered him in the countryside,

388
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,590
which made him suffer a lot.

389
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,550
The young master said that

390
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,200
he has grown up

391
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,240
and will clean up the world
with you from now on.

392
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,310
(It's a pity that Congrou left too early)

393
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,000

I don't understand.

399
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,280
You are now the county magistrate.

400
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,830
Why are you still selling noodles?

401
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,760
It's my hobby.

402
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,280
Sir.

403
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,040
Are my noodles ready?

404
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,830
Coming.

405
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Your noodles.

406
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,590
- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.

407
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,000
Mr. Lan.

408
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,240
Why are you here?

409
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,310
Mr. Lan.

Zhang Ping.

Mr. Zhang.

414
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,830
Xu Dong, why are you here?

415
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,350
Mr. Lan is now transferred
to be the governor,

416
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,790
to patrol the counties
on behalf of the Emperor.

417
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,790
Wherever he went,

418
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,630
he proclaimed the imperial edict,

419
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,790
praised virtue and punished vice,

420
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,760
understood the sufferings
of people's livelihood,

421
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,920
and solved outstanding cases.

422
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,960
Is this your first time in Yiping County?

423
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,000
I will show you around.

Look.

So lively.

428

I was passing through Yiping County,
