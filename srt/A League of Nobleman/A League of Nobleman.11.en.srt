1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,000
Where is

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,800
the traitor?

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,230
Hanging at

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,000
Father.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,920
the market entrance.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,000
Father.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,440
Who is the traitor?

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,390
Father.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,710
Either a pig

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,190
or a dog.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:30,960
Father.

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,560
Where is the traitor?

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,880
Mr. Lan,

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,430
you must settle your mind.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,750
Who is...

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,640
Father.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,710
the traitor?

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,350
Either a pig or a dog.

19
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,280
Where is the traitor?

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,350
Hanging at the market entrance.

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,280
Father.

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,790
You're not a traitor.

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,030
Who is the traitor?

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,960
Either a pig or a dog.

25
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,710
Father.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,670
Father.

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,310
Mr. Lan.

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,310
Mr. Lan.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,280
Sir.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,790
Orchid.

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,120
Orchid.

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,120
Mr. Lan.

33
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,870
Mr. Lan.

34
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,960
Jue.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Do you know

36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,800
why did I give you this name?

37
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,630
The gentlemen of flowers

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
remain faithful.

39
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,120
This is Lan, meaning orchid.

40
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,560
The sound of jade
hitting each other is clear.

41
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,430
This is Jue, meaning jade.

42
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,080
You want me to be

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,360
a gentleman of high moral character.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
What characters

45
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,870
should a gentleman hold?

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,030
I forgot it.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,870
You forgot it?

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,590
How dare you forget it?

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,310
How dare you?

50
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,630
Did you forget it?

51
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,240
Did you?

52
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:11,960
I still remember.

53
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,560
I still remember.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
A gentleman's actions must be justified.

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,310
A gentleman's speech...

56
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,150
Must be

57
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,470
reasonable.

58
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,590
A gentleman's

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,560
pursuit

60
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,870
must be righteous.

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
A gentleman's

62
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,750
behavior

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
must be upright.

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,080
Great.

65
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,560
Mr. Lan.

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,750
It's best not to stay here for too long.

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,430
You have overcome the demon
inside your heart.

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,800
Can you recall

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
the scene back then?

70
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,190
Yes.

71
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,080
To lead a country capable of dispatching
thousands of troops,

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,840
one should be cautious and single-minded
in dealing with affairs,

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,750
and also keep one's word.

74
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,070
That day,

75
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,800
my father and the exotic woman

76
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,430
seemed to have
a secret matter to discuss.

77
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,800
I happened to be studying
in the courtyard.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,630
Mr. Lan, when will you leave?

79
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,560
The sooner the better.

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,560
Every day of delay

81
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,870
means more risk.

82
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:41,920
At that time,

83
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,120
I heard from my father

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,800
that he was going to leave home.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Out of curiosity,

86
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,560
I looked towards the study.

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,920
But only a quick glance.

88
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,000
Afterwards,

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,830
I recalled it countless times,

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,310
but I couldn't remember

91
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,750
the figure and appearance of that woman.

92
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,480
Sir.

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,750
Now carefully recall

94
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,830
the woman's appearance,

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
figure

96
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,600
and dress.

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,430
Who's that?

99
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Sir.

100
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,070
What did you see?

101
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,000
Come on.

102
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,270
Get me a brush pen and paper.

103
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,870
Yes, sir.

104

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,750
What is this?

107
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,190
She wore a pottery accessory
on her chest,

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,430
which was simple in style.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
But I only saw its outline.

110
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,190
It's like a whistle.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,950
How do you know?

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,430
I seem to

113
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,800
have seen it somewhere.

114
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,480
It looks familiar.

115
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,870
Give me the pen.

116
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,270
Are you okay?

117
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
Don't worry, Mr. Lan.

118
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,560
I'll be fine after sleeping for a while.

119
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,160
Done.

120
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,120
So weird.

121
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,630
I can't even remember this accessory.

122
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,000
But you restored it so completely.

123
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,270
Maybe I've seen it

124
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,600
in a book.

125
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,800
I'd check it out later.

126
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,950
Its pattern

127
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,190
is simple and mysterious.

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Print a few copies

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and send someone to check in the South.

130
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,190
See if it is related to Moluo Village.

131
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll be on it.

132
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,720
Zhang Ping, today...

133
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,510
Xu Dong.

134
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,840
Move the orchid next to his pillow.

135
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,960
Sir, orchid only has the effect
of calming the nerves for you.

136
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,030
It may not be useful to others.

137
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,030
Better to fall asleep
with the scent of flowers

138
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
than nothing.

139
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,750
Take it as a consolation.

140
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,550
Yes.

141
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,080
Sir.

142
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,910
I often look after this orchid,

143
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,360
and I have smelled it
thousands of times.

144
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,840
I didn't find anything special about it.

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,360
I didn't expect it

146
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,630
to work for Zhang Ping as well.

149
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,200
Zhang.

150
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,750
Why don't you rest in Mr. Lan's mansion

151
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,550
for a few more days?

152
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,150
I'm fine.

153
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,000
It's weird.

154
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
You didn't have a nightmare this time,

155
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,030
and recovered after a peaceful sleep.

156
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,600
I also find it strange.

157
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,270
Nectarines.

158
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,750
Sir, my nectarines are very fresh.

159
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,270
How much is it?

160
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,750
One penny for each.

161
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,270
It's sour.

162
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,600
I also have persimmons.

163
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,080
Take a try.

164
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,840
Miss.

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,750
Hot wontons.

166
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,510
Take a try.

167
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,870
Are you Detective Noodle?

168
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,510
Yes.

169
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,390
He's the famous Detective Noodle.

170
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,440
Sir.

171
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,960
If you have any questions,
order a portion of noodles

172
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,840
and let's chat while eating.

173
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,030
Plain noodles with a soft-boiled egg.

174
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,150
Sure.

175
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,030
You just come here out of curiosity,

176
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,550
so you don't need to order noodles.

177
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,270
How do you know that
I'm here out of curiosity

178
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,790
but not for your noodles?

179
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,790
You buy everything

180
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,550
along the way.

181
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,120
It shows that you are rich.

182
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,870
If you came here out of curiosity

183
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
and take a bite and spit it out,

184
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,840
why should I cook for you?

185
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,320
Zhang Ping.

186
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,600
He has already ordered the noodles.

187
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,320
Just cook for him.

188
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,550
Why don't you satisfy him?

189
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,080
No.

190
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,080
I don't serve

191
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,870
people who waste food.

192
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,120
Why do you think all the rich waste food?

193
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,390
It doesn't make sense.

194
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,390
I just want to eat noodles.

195
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,480
Step aside.

196
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,750
If you don't cook for me,
I'd do it myself.

197
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,510
Sir.

198
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,870
Step aside.

199
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,360
This way, it won't stick on the knife.

200
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,440
Let me make another one for you.

201
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,080
No need.

202
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,550
The noodles don't taste good.

203
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,320
But the soft-boiled egg is perfect.

204
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,720
I ate the noodles sincerely.

205
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,550
And I didn't waste food.

206
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,390
May I ask you a question?

207
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,150
Why are your noodles

208
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,840
cheaper than others?

209
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,120
Is there

210
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
any trick?

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
Not really.

212
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,870
The flour

213
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,670
is collected by myself from farmers.

214
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,870
Seasonal freshly ground flour

215
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,200
is five pennies cheaper per catty
than those in grain stores.

216
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,480
This saves a penny
per portion of noodles.

217
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,550
As for the eggs...

218
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,600
I helped Granny Liu make a chicken coop.

219
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,320
So she sells me eggs cheaper than others.

220
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,630
Interesting.

221
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,630
What's interesting?

222
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,630
You.

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,600
I misread you at first.

224
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
I thought you were just
pretending to be noble

225
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,960
in order to gain attention.

226
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,480
So did I.

227
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,870
I just saw you spit it out

228
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,870
after taking a bite of a nectarine,

229
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,840
and I thought you are a fop.

230
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,600
So I refused to cook noodles for you.

231
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,870
Because of the heavy rain this year,

232
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,910
the quality of the nectarines is poor.

233
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I took a bite

234
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,480
and found the nectarine core was rotten.

235
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,670
So I threw it away.

236
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,390
However,

237
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,960
no discord, no concord.

238
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,000
Now

239
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,840
we are friends.

240
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,960
My name is Qi Zhu.

241
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,550
Qi means lush and soothing.

242
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,630
Zhu means scarlet.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,670
My name is

244
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,670
Zhang Ping.

245
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,200
Sir.

246
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,960
It's been late.

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
We have to go home.

248
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,510
Zhang Ping.

249
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,510
See you.

250
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,210
Freshly picked nectarines.

251
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,300
Nectarines.

252
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,030
Zhang Ping.

253
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,750
Although I am not as good as you
at cooking noodles,

254
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,910
not necessarily so with other things.

255
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,030
Let's compete again

256
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,910
next time.

257
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,630
What an unusual man.

258
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,270
Qi Zhu.

259
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,340
(Hanhui Pavilion, Ning'an)

260
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,550
Which of you two

261
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,790
is Zhang Ping?

262
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,790
Him.

263
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,670
He is.

264
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,080
Sir.

265
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,390
What do you want me for?

266
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,790
I'm the secretary of
Court of Judicial Review.

267
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,240
Mr. Tao wants to see you.

268
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,550
Zhang, it's Court of Judicial Review.

269
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
Pack your things up

270
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,120
and come with me.

271
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,550
Hurry up.

272
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,000
Go.

273
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,910
Go! It's Court of Judicial Review.

274
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,180
(Court of Judicial Review)

275
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,630
Here is Court of Judicial Review.

276
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,790
Let's go.

277
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,390
♪A dull purple♪

278
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,750
♪A beautiful yellow♪

(Silence)

280
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,070
Mr. Tao.

281
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Here comes Zhang Ping.

282
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,480
Stand still.

283
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,880
Excuse me.

284
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,550
Mr. Tao.

285
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,070
What can I do for you?

286
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,030
Hush.

287
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,790
Here you are.

288
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,960
Mr. Tao.

289
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,750
You know about

290
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,240
the recruitment of
Court of Judicial Review, right?

291
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,270
Yes.

292
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,680
I called you here today

293
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,070
to ask you

294
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240
to work for the Court of Judicial Review.

295
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,790
Although you have no fame,

296
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,790
you are already
the well-known Detective Noodle.

297
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,550
With your help,

298
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,720
the Court of Judicial Review
may be revived.

299
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,830
I am willing to!

300
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,000
No worries.

301
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,110
By the way, Mr. Tao,

302
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,160
I've always

303
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,270
had a question for you.

304
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,310
Say it.

305
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,350
Did Mu Yesheng

306
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,070
really work in
the Court of Judicial Review before?

307
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,640
What is his real name?

308
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,550
Where is he now?

309
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,590
You mean the one

310
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,680
who wrote Strange Night Talk?

311
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,790
Yes.

312
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,750
The folk tales

313
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,550
are all fabricated indiscriminately.

314
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,680
I've never heard of him

315
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,790
in the Court of Judicial Review.

316
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,590
Yes.

317
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,070
But

318
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,830
the Court of Judicial Review

319
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,510
and those cases in the book

320
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,550
are so real.

321
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,160
If he hadn't experienced them himself,

322
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,030
how could he be

323
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,640
so clear about the details?

324
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,270
I have been an officer of
the Court of Judicial Review for decades.

325
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,960
If there is such a person,

326
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,160
how can I not know at all?

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,550
You don't have to be disappointed.

328
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,270
Let the secretary

329
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,110
take you to the case archive first.

330
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,920
Let's go.

331
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,830
Zhang Ping.

332
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,510
Your background must be powerful.

333
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,480
Listen.

334
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,350
There are many people

335
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,510
who want to work here.

336
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,270
Even the nephew of
the Minister of Works

337
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,550
was not chosen.

338
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,720
Come on.

339
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,880
Let's go.

340
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,440
Here is the case archive.

341
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,720
You will work here

342
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,110
from now on.

343
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,270
Here is the case archive?

344
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,240
Yes.

345
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,590
This is the key to the case archive.

346
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200

00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,040
Go.

518
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,170
Move to the right side.

519
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,690
Sure.

520
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,390
All right.

521
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,940
Put it here.

522
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,690
Okay.

523
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,670
Slow down.

524
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,110
Where are my clothes?

525
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,000
I...

526
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,200
I didn't see your clothes.

527
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,270
They're supposed to be here.

528
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,240
Did you take them away?

529
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,440
Why should I do this?

530
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,720
Sorry.

531
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,160
Stop.

532
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,920
After going up, tell the captain

533
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,110
to change shifts at three o'clock
in the afternoon.

534
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,310
Sure.

535
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,410
Okay.

536
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,410
Hard work for you.

537
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,820
(Uneven color)

538
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,980
(Traces of stitching)

539
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,400
Hurry up.

540
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,110
Okay.

541
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,830
Speed up.

542
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,680
You will suffer if
the construction period is delayed.

543
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,880
Man, come here.

544
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,640
What?

545
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,480
Come here.

546
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,030
Is this the Empress Dowager's
phoenix head?

547
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,720
Look at what you asked.

548
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,310
Of course.

549
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,640
I mean

550
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,240
is this the phoenix head
made of pure gold

551
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,400
by the Empress Dowager's order
with rubies from Lingnan District

552
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,110
as the eyes?

553
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,350
Of course.

554
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,350
There's something wrong with it.
