I hid it under the water.

reverence for nature.

My mother

she would die soon

to use Water Illusion on her.

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,270
Why did she still ask me

106

to go under the water
and find what made her troubled?

107

Since your mother said it,

108

she must have meant something.

109

But where could it be hidden

It means puppy

174
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,380
in our language.

175
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,180
But why would they

176
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,780
call him Xiaolong?

177
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,420
Xiaolong.

178
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,860
What does it mean?

179
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,620
It's a custom of our village.

180
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,260
All the kids in the village

181
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,420
are named

182
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,700
puppies or kittens.

183
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,860
The kids are easy to raise
under such names.

184
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,500
But what does

185
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,100
Xiaolong mean?

186
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,740
30 years ago,

187
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,260
the Empress Dowager used the
Resurrection Array to switch the prince.

188
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,740
I remember it.

189
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,180
The pronunciation of Xiaolong
in our language is

190
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,500
"Qingzhang".

191
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,260
What?

192
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,420
But the real prince she switched

193
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,740
didn't die.

194
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,420
He is still alive

195
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,860
and sitting in front of you.

196
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,220
It started with Zhang Ping.

197
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,780
(The Enlightened Mind
is Like the Hidden Hade)

198
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,140
At that time, Zhang Ping's mother

199
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,100
knew how to use Water Illusion

200
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,100
and was taken by Xuan Ji

201
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,300
from Moluo village
to the Department of Incantation

202
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,180
and became an incantation practitioner.

203
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,380
My mom had a habit
of writing things down.

204
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,020
Maybe she wrote something about it.

205
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,780
I think it's hidden

206
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,300
here.

207
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,260
In the first month
of the 15th year of Qingfeng,

208
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,380
the late emperor and Concubine Li
asked Xuan Ji

209
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,780
to set up the Resurrection Array
to save the little prince.

210
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,780
(It lasted two days and two nights.)

211
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,340
(It surprised me)

212
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,220
(that the little prince
actually came back to life.)

213
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,580
(When the ceremony was over)

214
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,300
(and everyone was about to leave,)

215
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,700
(I saw Xuan Ji holding a baby)

216
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,580
(and leaving in a suspicious manner.)

217
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,860
Then my mom wrote

218
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,860
that she followed him all the way

219
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,340
and finally realized

220
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,220
that Xuan Ji switched the little prince.

221
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,220
He took the little prince

222
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,260
to the Yunxiao Mountain

223
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,260
(and was going to bury
the dying little prince)

224
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,660
(and the secret)

225
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,940
(in the ground.)

226
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,860
Little prince.

227
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,460
Don't blame me.

228
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,780
(Maybe the true dragon
showed his power,)

229
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,180
(or God protected him,)

230
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,860
(just before Xuan Ji
was about to bury the little prince,)

231
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,900
(there was lightning and thunder.)

232
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,220
(A strong wind was blowing.)

233
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
(Xuan Ji)

234
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,940
(fled in fear.)

235
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,940
(Jing Qizhe,
Emperor Qingfeng's eldest son)

236
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,140
(At that moment,)

237
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,380
(Zhang Ping's mother only saw me)

238
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,980
(as an innocent child.)

239
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,020
(Out of kindness,)

240
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,580
(she took me away
from the capital overnight)

241
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,700
(Ning'an)

242
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,460
(and hurried to Moluo Village,
a secret place in the south.)

243
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,900
(She kept me alive)

244
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,540
(with herbs on the way)

245
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,660
(and took good care of me.)

246
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,260
(When we got back to the village,
I was treated by the clan leader.)

247
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,700
(I don't know if the medicine worked)

248
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,100
(or I was fated not to die,)

249
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,420
(I was miraculously cured.)

250
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,620
(Later,)

251
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,100
(she became my godmother.)

252
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,260
Ten years passed in a flash

253
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,580
and I grew up to be a teenager.

254
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,220
She saw me spend my days with books,

255
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,220
and I was smart and studious.

256
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,420
Perhaps she thought

257
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm a prince after all

258
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,820
and I should go back
to the place where I belong,

259
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,780
so she told me where I came from

260
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,020
and wanted to take me back
to the capital.

261
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,300
But she was too kind

262
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,340
to imagine

263
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,700
that it was the Empress Dowager

264
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,460
who ordered Xuan Ji
to switch the prince.

265
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,460
She always thought

266
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,780
Xuan Ji was ordered to

267
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,620
to perform magic
to bring me back to life

268
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,820
but failed to do so.

269
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,300
He was afraid to be punished
by the late emperor,

270
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,500
so he switched me with a fake prince.

271
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,180
(Godmother asked me about my opinion.)

272
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,380
Do you want to meet your real mother?

273
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,740
(I was young and arrogant.)

274
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,460
(Of course I wanted
to go back to the capital)

275
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,500
(and meet my real mother.)

276
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,140
(She didn't say anything else.)

277
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,820
(She only told me)

278
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,490
(that it was too important)

279
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,860
(to be done rashly,)

280
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,260
(and she would go to the capital first)

281
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,660
(to discuss it with Mr. Lan Lin,
the most righteous man.)

282
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,740
(The next day,)

283
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,700
(she was going to leave alone,)

284
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,460
(but Zhang Ping cried so hard)

285
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,460
(that she had to take him with her.)

286
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,180
(So they left together.)

287
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,540
(I was anxiously)

288
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,940
(waiting for them to come back,)

289
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,980
(but the people who came...)

290
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,620
It's not hard to guess

291
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,860
what happened next.

292
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,460
Back then,

293
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,580
my mom went to the capital
to see Mr. Lan's father

294
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,500
because she was trying to help Qingzhang

295
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,620
go back to the Empress Dowager.

296
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,780
Out of his duty as a subject,

297
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
your father believed that he should

298
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,100
bring the prince back to the court
as soon as possible.

299
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,460
That's why he went to the palace

300
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,740
right after he learned the news

301
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,740
and informed
the Empress Dowager in person.

302
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,940
At that time,

303
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,500
the late emperor just passed away

304
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,180
and Mrs. Li became the Empress Dowager

305
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,220
by giving birth to
the late emperor's only son.

306
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,900
If it got out,

307
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,820
she would stand condemned
through the ages.

308
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,980
She just got a taste of power.

309
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,340
Of course she didn't want to give it up

310
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,580
and lose everything.

311
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,420
So,

312
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
she gave Xuan Ji a secret order

313
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,820
to follow Mr. Lan's father

314
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,980
to the village

315
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,940
and kill her own son

316
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,900
and everyone in Moluo Village

317
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,620
who knew about it.

318
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,260
Later, your father was brought back
to the capital by Xuan Ji.

319
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,940
Only then did he realize

320
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,420
that all this was a conspiracy
of the Empress Dowager.

321
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
My father was a loyal and righteous man,

322
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,220
but the Empress Dowager
made such use of him.

323
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,620
It's more than that.

324
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:08,980
Peizhi.

325
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,300
Have you ever thought about this?

326
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,180
If it wasn't your father
who colluded with the enemy,

327
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,580
who leaked the military information?

328
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,020
I've looked into the army and the court,

329
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,980
but I found nothing.

330
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,660
Of course you found nothing.

331
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,860
Because

332
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,020
it was the Empress Dowager's crony
who did it.

333
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,860
But the Empress Dowager

334
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,860
was afraid of causing public outrage

335
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,220
and implicating herself,

336
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,660
so she blamed it

337
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,540
on your father.

338
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,140
That doesn't explain

339
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,100
why he pleaded guilty
to the charge of treason.

340
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,180
How do you think you survived?

341
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,100
The Empress Dowager
threatened him with your life.

342
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,980
What other choice did he have

343
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,740
but to plead guilty?

344
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,540
85 people in Lan's Mansion,

345
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,380
all the villagers of Moluo,

346
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,820
and those in the know
of the Department of Incantation

347
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,940
were all killed by her

348
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,220
just to satisfy her greed
and lust for power!

349
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,180
That's why I'm back in the capital.

350
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,740
I've planned and prepared

351
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,540
just to take revenge
on the Empress Dowager.

352
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,860
Shulin.

353
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,900
What's your plan?

354
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,580
To reveal her crimes

355
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,540
on the ceremony
of the Immortal Instrument

356
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,980
and make her fall

357
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,380
from the top of power.

358
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,860
She sacrificed me

359
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,660
for power,

360
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,540
I'd like to show her

361
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,060
that the thing she cares about the most

362
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,180
is nothing but a plaything for me

363
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,780
to be toyed with.

364
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,540
I'm gonna make

365
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,820
those fools

366
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,300
fight to the death

367
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,500
for the illusory power.

368
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,500
The world will fall into chaos
at that time.

369
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,620
They will be disillusioned with

370
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,420
power and status.

371
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,020
Can you say

372
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,340
it's not gonna be a good show?

373
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,940
I'm not just gonna watch it.

374
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,700
I'm gonna invite her
to watch it with me.

375
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,820
Peizhi.

376
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,220
We've known each other for a long time.

377
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,500
I'm officially inviting you

378
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,780
to join me in the pageant.

379
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,900
Come and find me at the palace

380
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,940
when you make your decision.

381
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,980
Mr. Jinghu is a man of the past.

382
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,580
Starting tomorrow,

383
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,300
I'll be Dr. Gu in Hanyuan Hall

384
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,260
who treats the Empress Dowager's burns.

385
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,220
Thank God you found
your clan's prescription for miasma.

386
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,060
It worked pretty well.

387
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,460
The Army for Southward Crusade
will be saved.

388
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,260
The prescriptions are all written
in our language.

389
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,380
I've copied the ones
that could be used in the army.

390
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,140
Please take them with you.

391
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,420
If you insist on leaving,

392
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,820
I won't keep you.

393
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,460
Stay safe on the road.

394
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,380
I'll wait for your triumphant return

395
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,460
