00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,870
Since Mr. Lan has handed over
the Examiner Seal,

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,760
the examination will continue.

on behalf of the Ministry of Rites.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,350
Wait.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,640
What's happening?

is under Mr. Lan's command.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,560
There still might be fraud

if they act on his orders.

13

What do you want?

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,430
If the examination is to continue,

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,470
it must be guaranteed

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,350
that there's no possibility of fraud,

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,920
especially in the drawing process

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,320
which has to be done impartially

19

with no possibility of
any kind of interference.

If you don't trust us,

you can elect someone
to draw the question.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,150
The three ministers and everyone
in the Ministry of Rites

24

have no objection.

25

We've just discussed it.

If we choose an examinee
to draw the question,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,150
it'll still be hardly convincing.

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:15,920
How about this,

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,560
we'll choose an irrelevant person

He isn't an official.

He doesn't have a stake in this matter.

it was strange that Chen didn't show up

for the exam.

142
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,080
Therefore,

143
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,870
I handed in my exam paper early

144
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,790
and went to his house.

145

I found Chen Zishang

lying dead by the well

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,080
for a while.

(Looks like)

149
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,030
(he fell to his death while bathing.)

150
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,510
In that case,

151
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,000
there is something suspicious about it.

152
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,000
The strange thing is

153
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,910
that if you fall while bathing,

154
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,720
your body will instinctively arch up

155
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,510
to protect your head and neck

156
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,750
by landing on your hips and waist first,

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,630
but there are no injuries

158
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,550
on Chen Zishang's waist, back and hips,

159
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,630
which means
he already lost the ability to react

160
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,240
when he fell.

161
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,080
So,

162
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,750
I think the murderer killed him first,

163
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,240
then faked the bathing scene

164
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,320
and made him pose like
he was tripped up and fell.

165
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,200
Unfortunately,

166
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,630
the scene was washed by the rain

167
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,550
and most of the traces

168
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,480
were ruined.

169
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,510
Who do you think

170
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,910
the killer might be?

171
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,320
I don't know yet.

172
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,360
But

173
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,790
I found other clues.

174
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,840
I went into Chen Zishang's room

175
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,720
and found that he had packed

176
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,750
all his luggage.

177
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
It didn't look like

178
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,600
he was going to Exam Hall,

179
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,720
but rather like he was going far away.

180
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,510
I felt confused

181
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,120
and looked through his bookcase.

182
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,750
There were some drafts in there

183
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,390
besides books.

184
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,860
(Rule the Country by Virtue)

185
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,840
Chen Zishang's draft

186
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,960
is exactly the same
as Ma Lian's answer sheet.

187
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,150
Is the topic of the examination

188
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,670
"Rule the Country by Virtue"?

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,910
How do you know it?

190
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,750
During the last two days in prison,

191
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,200
I pondered Mr. Jinghu's

192
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,720
prophetic poem.

193
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,750
There is something

194
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,840
hidden in it.

195
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,790
Do you have a brush and paper?

196
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,840
Common people may come out on top.

197
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,030
Remove the radical "Ren"
from the character "Si",

198
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,360
and it will be the character "Yi" left.

199
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,840
Traveling the same journey
can clear one's mind.

200
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,270
Combine the characters
"Xing", "Xin", and "Mu",

201
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,120
and it will be the character "De".

202
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,790
If there is not enough gold
inlaid with jade.

203
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
The character "Ding"
without the radical "Jin"

204
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,080
becomes the character "Ding".

205
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,030
The borderland can't be ruled
and the people will be disappointed.

206
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,440
The first half of this line

207
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,320
means there is no borderland to rule.

208
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,390
The character "Yu"

209
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,270
without the radical "Tu"

210
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,150
is the character "Huo".

211
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,320
The character "Kou" is a square.

212
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,750
Combine these two characters,

213
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,670
and it will be the character "Guo".

214
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,670
On the surface,

215
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,320
this poem satirizes the fraud
of the imperial examination,

216
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,240
but if you

217
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,270
break down the poem,

218
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,440
you'll find that it implies
the topic of the examination,

219
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,510
which is "Rule the Country by Virtue".

220
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,900
(Rule the Country by Virtue)

221
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,600
I didn't expect

222
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,390
Mr. Jinghu

223
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,840
to hide the message so well.

224
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
I heard from Chen Chou

225
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,440
that Chen Zishang made money
as a ghostwriter.

226
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,840
I guess

227
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,030
(Suzhou Government, Jiangnan County)
Ma Lian was informed of the topic in advance

228
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,840
and paid Chen Zishang to write an essay.

229
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,600
The draft

230
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,630
is the evidence that Ma Lian cheated
in the examination.

231
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,500
(Rule the Country by Virtue)

232
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,200
Why didn't you

233
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
hand over such important evidence
to the Court of Judicial Review

234
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,120
instead of coming to me?

235
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,870
It concerns the imperial examination.

236
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
Mr. Jinghu also got involved in this.

237
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,750
So,

238
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,870
for the sake of justice

239
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,440
and the history between our fathers,

240
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,200
I prefer to give it to you.

241
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,550
To this end,

242
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,550
you got yourself in jail.

243
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,390
Well,

244
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,240
it was just a misdemeanor.

245
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,320
I talked back to the officer

246
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,550
and was charged with

247
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,870
lawlessness

248
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,630
and put in jail for two days.

249
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,600
Thank you.

250
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,960
Since Mr. Jinghu

251
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,270
was able to predict that
"something will be wrong with Guiyou"

252
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,750
before the draw,

253
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,480
it means

254
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,840
Chen Zishang's death

255
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,440
and the leak of the topic
have something to do with him.

256
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,160
Maybe we should

257
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,720
start with these two cases.

258
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,030
If we find out the truth,

259
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,000
we might be able to draw him out.

260
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,640
Zhang Ping.

261
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,070
I appreciate it

262
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,200
that you came to the prison

263
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,680
to tell me the truth.

264
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,110
But

265
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,350
we're in different positions.

266
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,510
Do you still hate me

267
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,680
for what happened before?

268
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,920
What happened to my father

269
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,070
is not your fault.

270
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,070
I won't blame you.

271
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,880
But it still

272
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,110
had something to do with your mother.

273
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,270
It's hard for me

274
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,200
to be your friend.

275
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,200
I understand.

276
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,310
I'll look into it myself.

277
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,790
Mr. Lan.

278
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,480
The Empress Dowager summons you.

279
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,830
Please.

280
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,440
As the chief examiner,
I should be held responsible

281
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,000
for such a mistake

282
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,310
during the imperial examination.

283
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,640
But

284
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,640
Chen Zishang was absent from
the examination for no reason.

285
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,160
I was worried,

286
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,110
so I sent someone

287
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,350
to his residence

288
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,790
who found that Chen Zishang

289
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,590
had been killed the night
before the examination.

290
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,960
The draft found in his room

291
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,310
corresponds to the topic
drew on the day of the examination,

292
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,110
which is "Rule the Country by Virtue".

293
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,960
Your Majesty.

294
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,960
I was asked by Mr. Lan to acquire

295
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,590
(Rule the Country by Virtue)
Ma Lian's answer sheet from Exam Hall.

296
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,440
It's exactly

297
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,200
the same

298
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,510
as Chen Zishang's essay.

299
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,030
I also

300
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,030
interpreted Mr. Jinghu's prophetic poem

301
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,920
during my time in prison

302
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,200
and found that the poem

303
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,350
also implies the topic,

304
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,790
which means

305
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,110
there were fraudulent examination

306
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,160
indeed.

307
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,510
I hope this case can be
thoroughly investigated, Your Majesties.

308
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,030
Since you're innocent,

309
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,310
you don't have to go to
the Court of Judicial Review.

310
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

311
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:58,960
I dare

312
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,200
to ask

313
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,400
who should

314
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,160
take on the case of fraud.

315
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,750
It will be discussed.

316
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,270
Mother.

317
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,350
In my opinion,

318
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,790
it's urgent

319
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,880
to find out

320
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,350
who is manipulating

321
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,510
the imperial examination

322
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,070
and killing people lawlessly.

323
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,920
Do you want to make it worse?

324
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,680
How would it make the court look

325
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,030
if we admit there were

326
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,240
fraudulent examination?

327
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,350
Your Majesty.

328
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,590
I think...

329
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,550
Mr. Liu.

330
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,680
The prophetic poem
implies the topic you wrote.

331
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,270
If this is to be investigated thoroughly,

332
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,070
you won't be able to get away with it.

333
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,750
I'm not afraid of being investigated.

334
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,440
I believe that Commandant Wang
and Minister Dou

335
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,920
are not afraid, either.

336
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,640
- I'm not afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

337
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,240
But I think

338
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,400
this matter has provoked much discussion.

339
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,270
We should smooth things over

340
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,000
and save face for the court first.

341
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,000
After it subsides,

342
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,960
we can take our time to investigate it.

343
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,070
You...

344
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,070
Mother.

345
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,270
Ma Lian is the ideal
son-in-law of your brother,

346
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,790
your niece's future husband.

347
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,640
How will it make

348
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,000
the royal family look

349
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,480
if he is found guilty
of cheating and murdering?

350
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,510
They might even think

351
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,790
we are covering up for them.

352
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm afraid

353
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,270
it will undermine your prestige.

354
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,310
His Majesty is right.

355
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,310
The case must be
thoroughly investigated, Your Majesty.

356
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,240
Fine.

357
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,680
In that case,

358
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,350
let's investigate it thoroughly.

359
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,510
Those who participated in
the imperial examination,

360
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,960
including all the officials,
question writers,

361
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,070
chief examiners,

362
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,590
and invigilators,

363
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,070
are all suspected

364
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,480
and will be confined to their homes.

365
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,750
They won't be allowed to go out
without permission.

366
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,270
Mother, you're wise indeed.

367
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,270
But

368
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,030
Minister Dou

369
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,310
and Commandant Wang

370
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,510
are both question writers.

371
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,400
The Ministry of Justice should
avoid arousing suspicion.

372
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,200
Then the case should be handed over to...

373
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
The Court of Judicial Review.

374
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,070
Your Majesty.

375
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,550
I've been ill lately. I fell lightheaded

376
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,200
and can't even read clearly.

377
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,750
I'm too weak to lift a brush.

378
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,070
If the investigation is delayed because of me,

379
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,270
I'm afraid it will damage the reputation
of our important officials.

380
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,880
Are you declining it?

381
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,240
Do you want me to investigate it?

382
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,920
Your Majesty, please don't be mad.

383
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,400
I'll obey the order.

384
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,880
You can go home.

385
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,960
Don't

386
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,270
talk back to an officer again.

387
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,960
Thank you.

388
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,720
Sir.

389
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,790
You've suffered in prison

390
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,270
over the last few days.

391
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,640
I didn't expect

392
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,200
the His Majesty would back you

393
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,310
in the court today.

394
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,880
Looks like it was His Majesty's intention

395
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,790
to make me the chief examiner.

396
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,590
I think His Majesty

397
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,550
read my letter carefully.

398
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,510
Sir.

399
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,880
I heard

400
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,350
that Mr. Tao acted quickly this time.

401
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,200
He has taken Ma Lian into custody.

402
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,880
But Ma Lian is having a great time there.

403
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,240
He is eating well and drinking well.

404
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,550
He hasn't been arraigned yet.

405
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,550
Considering Ma Lian's background,

406
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,030
Tao Zhoufeng won't
make things difficult for him.

407
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,480
It's hard to count on him

408
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,000
to solve the case.

409
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,200
What should we do?

410
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,550
We're not good at investigation.

411
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
Commandant Wang and Mr. Dou

412
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,070
are also involved in this.

413
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,640
Mr. Wang needs
to avoid arousing suspicion.

414
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,960
How about

415
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,030
we ask Zhang Ping for help?

416
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,640
We can't investigate

417
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,960
without the help of other people?

418
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,680
Get ready.

419
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,680
We'll go to Exam Hall now.

420
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,110
But...

421
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,110
But you're also confined to your home
by the Empress Dowager's order.

422
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,480
How to break out

423
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
by following the rules?

424
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,590
There must be something
we need at Exam Hall.

425
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,480
I only need to take a look inside.

426
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,350
I won't spoil the scene.

427
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,200
This is non-negotiable.

428
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,030
Just leave.

429
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,070
What if I can provide a clue

430
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,350
that might help?

431
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,720
We don't solve cases.
We're just gatekeepers.

432
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,790
We don't need your help.

433
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,830
I'll do whatever you want

434
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,920
as long as you allow me in.

435
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,510
Well...

436
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,270
We've been standing here for a while

437
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,640
and our backs are sore,

438
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,110
but no one has brought us
anything to drink.

439
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,240
Yeah.

440
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,750
It's getting dark.

441
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,400
We haven't eaten.

442
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,830
Well,

443
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,270
why is there no one
who can bring us some meat and wine?

444
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,310
How about this,

445
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,400
you guys go eat and drink.

446
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,590
I'll guard the entrance for you.

447
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,070
You used to work at
the Court of Judicial Review.

448
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,640
Didn't Mr. Lan

449
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,920
teach you anything about

450
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,350
bureaucracy?

451
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,030
(What would I do)

452
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,550
(if I were Mr. Lan?)

453
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,310
You want money, right?

454
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,590
You...

455
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,240
How did you say that out loud?

456
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,960
It's okay.

457
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,750
We've known him for a long time.

458
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,350
That's all I have.

459
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,830
That's all you have?

460
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,070
For the two prophecies

461
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,200
about Exam Hall
and the examination question

462
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,440
to come true,

463
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,070
it must be guaranteed that Chen Zishang

464
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,440
would draw Guiyou

465
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,240
and examination question

466
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,790
must be drawn to be

467
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,400
Mr. Liu's question.

468
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,830
You mean

469
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,750
someone tampered with these two things

470
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,110
separately?

471
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:20,720
Sir.

472
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,070
There is no one here.

473
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,750
Come in.

474
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,680
Yes.

475
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,680
Shao Zhi and Ji Wen were in charge of

476
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,720
drawing lots
and keeping exam papers.

477
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,750
They are the most suspicious.

478
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,720
And Mr. Yang who drew the question

479
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,240
is also suspicious.

480
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,640
But the people involved
are all confined to their homes

481
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,240
and guarded by the soldiers
of the Court of Judicial Review.

482
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,920
We can't get in touch with them.

483
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,750
That's why

484
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,350
we need to start
with the physical evidence.

485
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,920
Sir.

486
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,830
Is there something wrong
with this scroll?

487
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,310
We are about

488
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,680
to turn over our duty. Hurry up.

489
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,640
I just got here.

490
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,680
You only gave us five pennies.

491
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
Do you expect to stay here til tomorrow?

492
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,310
You'll have 15 minutes at most.

493
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,790
Sir

494
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
(Exam Paper in the 20th Year of Yongxuan)
What's the stain on the seal?

495
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,720
Mold?

496
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,270
How did the ink

497
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,550
get moldy?

498
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,030
Do you think the mold

499
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,550
has something to do with the fraud?

500
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,920
But Mr. Yang was blindfolded
when he drew the question.

501
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,350
How could he see it?

502
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,680
I think there wasn't any mold
when he drew the question,

503
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
or it must have been noticed

504
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,110
with all these people being there.

505
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,000
But how would the ink

506
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,510
get moldy?

507
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,510
It looks like the kind of mold
growing on rice and flour.

508
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,070
I used to see it all the time
when I was little.

509
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,830
Did Mr. Yang touch any rice or flour

510
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,160
and get the mold from it?

511
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,350
There is nothing else unusual
about the scroll.

512
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,270
The mold must be
the key to solving the case.

513
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,000
But

514
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,200
how did it was drawn?

515
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,480
If we can't figure this out,

516
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,240
there is no way to convict anyone

517
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,440
just by the mold.

518
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,070
How would I look into this

519
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,110
if I were Zhang Ping?

520
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,590
(It's strange.)

521
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,510
(The bottom of these rocks)

522
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,200
(wasn't washed by rain.)

523
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,110
(It should be dirty.)

524
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
(Why is this rock the only one
with a clean bottom?)

525
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,790
(It looks like someone
rinsed it on purpose)

526
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,350
(and put it back.)

527
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,350
(There are footprints.)

528
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,110
This could be

529
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,510
the primary crime scene.

530
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,680
Dogs are more capable than you.

531
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,160
Get the carriage here now!

532
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,790
Yes, yes.

533
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,200
Yes.

534
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,520
