1
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,160
Is this the Empress Dowager's
phoenix head?

2
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,800
Look at what you asked.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,640
Of course.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,710
I mean,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,280
is this the phoenix head
made of pure gold

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,550
by the Empress Dowager's order
with rubies from Lingnan District

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,280
as the eyes?

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,230
Of course.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,510
There's something wrong with it.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,830
Everyone knows

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,470
the Empress Dowager's phoenix head
is made of pure gold,

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,030
but

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,150
it reveals the cooper color here.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,710
Clearly, there is a layer of gold paint
on top of copper.

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,560
And

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,520
these two rubies

17
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,790
are clearly spliced together.

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,750
The marks are obvious.

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,670
It's different from the earlier one.

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,350
The phoenix head is a fake.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,430
Sir!

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,280
Sir!

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,320
Sir.

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,000
There is someone slandering
the Empress Dowager.

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,710
He said the phoenix head is a fake.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,750
Director Wang.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,350
(Director Wang, Ministry of Works)
He claimed to be a helper at the Court,

30
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,390
but he pretended to be a craftsman
and went to the top of the Immortal Instrument

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,630
and spread rumors

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,070
that the phoenix head is fake.

33
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,040
Trespassing on the site of
the Immortal Instrument is a felony.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Spreading rumors

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,470
made you doubly guilty.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,070
What are you up to?

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,040
Sir, I have no ulterior motive.

38
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,230
I heard from Mr. Ma who is a cleaner here

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,720
that he saw the phoenix shed tears of blood
in the middle of the night,

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,910
so I came there to find out the truth.

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,320
During my investigation,

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,040
I found that the phoenix head is a fake.

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,560
As for the strange phenomenon of the phoenix
shedding tears of blood that night,

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,840
I think it was because
the spliced ruby fell off

45
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,230
and was seen by Mr. Ma.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,560
You're talking nonsense!

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,910
Falling pieces?
The phoenix shedding tears of blood?

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,880
I think you're here to stir up trouble.

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,910
But that ruby

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,040
is obviously a patchwork.

51
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,630
Enough!

52
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,510
Someone.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,230
Put him in the woodshed.

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,720
We need an explanation
from the Court of Judicial Review.

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
Sir, this is of great importance.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,160
It must be investigated.

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,790
Take him away.

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,230
Mr. Chen.

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,790
Yes.

60
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Tell the craftsmen

61
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,230
not to discuss the phoenix head,

62
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,280
or they will be heavily punished.

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,630
Yes.

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
The Director of Palace Construction
is sensible.

65
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,600
He didn't put the blame on
the Court of Judicial Review.

66
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,720
You are just a little helper.

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,670
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,040
no one will save you.

69
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,190
But the phoenix head
is obviously a fake.

70
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,400
Why would they lie?

71
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,320
Don't talk nonsense!

72
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,790
Have you not suffered enough?

73
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,400
I can send you back to the woodshed.

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,000
Sir, why do you...

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Say no more.

76
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,120
Come with me.

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,670
Look at this.

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,160
The phoenix head is an emblem
of the Empress Dowager's prestige.

79
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,400
Who dares to say anything bad about it?

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,440
You are

81
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,720
just a little helper
at the Court of Judicial Review.

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,000
From now on,

83
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,600
don't overstep your bounds.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,560
All right.

85
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,950
You don't need to come
in the next few days.

86
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,870
Go home and reflect on yourself.

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,870
Mr. Zhang.

88
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,430
Our master wants to see you.

89
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,280
Please.

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Mr. Qi?

91
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,500
(Royal Hunting Ground)

92
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,280
You're just in time.

93
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,990
The lamb is almost ready.

94
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,520
You can taste my cooking today.

95
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,720
Your Majesty.

96
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,430
All right.

97
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
Just say whatever you want

98
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,160
like the first time we met.

99
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,080
However,

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,990
when did you realize who I am?

101
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,520
Right after you left.

102
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,990
The name of

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,470
our Emperor is Jing Qizhu,

104
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,160
and you called yourself Qi Zhu

105
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,760
after it.

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,760
You deserve to be called
Detective Noodle.

107
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,670
Let's go.

108
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,520
Sit down.

109
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,200
Make yourself comfortable.

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,990
Those are my men
who hunt and play polo with me.

111
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,790
Sit.

112
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,910
Since you told me a lot

113
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,430
about a bowl of noodles that day,

114
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,760
I'm gonna tell you something

115
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,230
about this sheep.

116
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,110
I'm all ears.

117
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,550
This sheep

118
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,310
has been marinated in pepper, and cumin

119
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,400
for one day.

120
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,840
Then it was stuffed with

121
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,200
more than ten kinds of spice and sewn on

122
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,670
before being grilled.

123
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,960
After being cut open,

124
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,040
it was spread with sea salt
and fine well salt three times.

125
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:01,790
Of course,

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,110
the final step

127
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,840
is to add

128
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,520
my secret sauce.

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,640
Here.

130
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,310
Just like you said,

131
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,080
food should be

132
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,430
enjoyed with respect.

133
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,600
Your bowl of noodles didn't come easy.

134
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,160
The same goes for this sheep.

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,080
It's a Yantan sheep from Longyou.

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,470
A Longyou Yantan sheep?

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,960
I haven't seen it for many years.

138
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,640
At the beginning of our dynasty,

139
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,840
Taizu set up
the Directorate of Animals in Longyou.

140
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,110
There were mot than 600,000 sheep
in Longyou's pasture.

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,040
The staple food was mutton at that time.

142
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,960
There were one million people
in the capital.

143
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,640
One person ate one sheep every month,

144
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,430
which required one million sheep a month.

145
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,350
Not to mention the hundreds of officials

146
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,040
who should be given ten sheep each person
as the monthly salary.

147
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,640
Here.

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,310
After I left you that day,

149
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,870
I took my men

150
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,350
to the hinterland of Longyou.

151
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,430
But the military governors

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
staged armed rebellions
over the last few years.

153
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,990
They took control of

154
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
all the lush pastures.

155
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,280
Without these pastures,

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,990
there are fewer and fewer sheep

157
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,550
for us to eat.

158
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,550
Luckily, we brought back
a few Yantan sheep

159
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,350
so that I can share
my cooking skills with you.

160
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,040
There is even no sheep for you to eat.

161
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm afraid

162
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,720
there will be no sheep to eat
in the whole country.

163
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,790
How can we sleep in peace

164
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,350
without putting down the rebellions?

165
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
We can't gallop with pleasure

166
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,400
in the hinterland of our Longyou.

167
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,840
We can only swagger around
in the hunting ground.

168
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
It's no fun.

169
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,110
One day,

170
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,790
I will take back

171
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,230
all the land in Longyou.

172
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,160
I've tasted

173
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,550
your cooking skills.

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,400
You seem to have something
on your mind today.

175
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm just having a little trouble

176
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,550
with the case.

177
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,590
Do you know

178
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,950
why I got mad at you that day?

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,910
Because you called me a fop.

180
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,830
That word hit me right on my head.

181
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,190
You should know

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
not everyone

183
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,000
in this world

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,040
can act according to their own will.

185
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,830
That's why

186
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,280
I envy you.

187
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,160
I envy that you can
live your life to the fullest

188
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,760
and do what you want to do.

189
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
You care about
a bowl of noodles in Dafu City

190
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
and a sheep in Longyou.

191
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,480
You're doing what you want.

192
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,400
It's getting late.

193
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,480
I should get back to investigate.

194
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,830
Go ahead.

195
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,400
Zhang Ping.

196
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,760
I want you to make

197
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,950
the best noodles in the capital

198
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,880
and achieve the highest score

199
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,400
in the imperial examination.

200
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,310
When you're investigating,

201
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,000
I want you to be fearless

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
and find out the truth!

203
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,190
I will!

204
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,430
I will.

205
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,140
(Hanhui Pavilion, Ning'an)

206
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,280
Zhang.

207
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,040
Are you still thinking about that case?

208
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,590
The dough is over-kneaded by you.

209
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,400
Forget it.

210
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,880
Your mind is not here.

211
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:29,880
Here.

212
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,070
Okay.

213
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:32,950
By the way,

214
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,480
have you heard

215
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,310
that the Empress Dowager's head is gone?

216
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,430
Shh.

217
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,400
Don't talk nonsense.

218
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,310
Do you want to die?

219
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,120
It was the phoenix head that was lost.

220
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,160
Isn't the phoenix head

221
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,120
equal to the Empress Dowager's head?

222
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,280
Everyone in the capital says

223
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,950
that the Empress Dowager
stole the power of the Emperor.

224
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,280
What she did is unjustified.

225
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,040
Even God can't stand it anymore,

226
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,240
so God took away the phoenix head.

227
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,280
Really?

228
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,240
The current phoenix head

229
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,120
is a fake to deceive the public.

230
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,070
Don't talk nonsense.

231
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm not talking nonsense.

232
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,360
Little detective.

233
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,710
It's said that you said it.

234
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,640
Tell them if I'm talking nonsense.

235
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,280
Yeah.

236
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,950
Tell us.

237
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,830
Who did you hear it from?

238
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,360
They said you said it.

239
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,880
Immortal Instrument or Mortal.

240
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,670
The Phoenix was lost overnight.

241
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,590
(Detective Noodle)
The Empress Dowager lost her head.

242
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,830
You can't say that!

243
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,790
Who did you hear it from?

244
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,070
Don't talk nonsense!

245
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,520
The Empress Dowager lost her head.

246
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,160
Get out of the way.

247
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Zhang Ping.

248
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
It's audacious of you

249
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,830
to spread rumors
about the Empress Dowager.

250
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,910
Take him away.

251
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,400
I didn't spread rumors.

252
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,790
No, it wasn't me.

253
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,430
Go!

254
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,040
Zhang!

255
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,760
Oh, no.

256
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,950
What to do now?

257
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,640
Mr. Lan.

258
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,120
Song.

259
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,000
Watch the stall for me.

260
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,670
Okay.

261
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,070
Mr. Ma?

262
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,400
How dare you use lynching?

263
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,160
Let go of me!

264
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,280
How dare you use lynching?

265
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,190
Zhang Ping.

266
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,280
There is only one way
for you to stay alive,

267
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,760
which is to clear up the rumors

268
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
in person.

269
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,040
You spread rumors
and spout nonsense in the capital

270
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,000
to get attention.

271
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,950
I didn't spread any rumors.

272
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,830
What should I clear up?

273
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,240
The phoenix head is a fake.

274
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,190
That's the truth.

275
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,830
A fake?

276
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,830
Which one of your eyes saw

277
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,950
that the phoenix head is a fake?

278
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,760
I went up there.

279
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,880
They all saw it.

280
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,070
Did they?

281
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,070
Did you see it?

282
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,040
No.

283
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,160
Who else saw it?

284
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,430
Is it Ma, the cleaner?

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
Do you think

286
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,480
he can talk now?

287
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,280
You...

288
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,590
Are you going to clear things up

289
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
or not?

290
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,670
I'm not lying.

291
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,670
What should I clear up?

292
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,520
Fine.

293
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,910
You're a tough guy.

294
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,070
You won't cry until you see your coffin.

295
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,830
Put him in.

296
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,070
Let me go!

297
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,310
I'll give you one last chance.

298
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,590
Is the phoenix head

299
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,310
real or not?

300
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,240
A fake is a fake.

301
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,670
Will you correct yourself or not?

302
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,550
This is the truth.

303
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,000
What should I correct?

304
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,760
Fine.

305
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,190
Take away another brick.

306
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,120
If you don't correct yourself,

307
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,710
you'll never have the chance
to speak again.

308
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,880
Director Wang.

309
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,360
As an official of the court,

310
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,400
it's bold of you to use lynching.

311
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,480
How should you be punished
according to the law?

312
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,400
Mr. Lan?

313
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,070
Mr. Lan.

314
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,790
Zhang Ping.

315
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,070
Are you not gonna

316
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,070
show some respect to me?

317
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,240
He spread rumors

318
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,160
and slandered the Empress Dowager.

319
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,310
If you dare to cover up for him,

320
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,830
the Empress Dowager

321
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,310
will make you suffer!

322
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,190
Spread rumors.

323
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,190
Do you dare to take the phoenix head

324
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,310
to the Empress Dowager
and see if it's real or not?

325
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,950
I...

326
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,670
Here comes Her Majesty!

327
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,480
Greetings to Your Majesty.

328
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,480
I didn't know Your Majesty
would be here.

329
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,590
Sorry for not waiting for you
at the door.

330
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,190
I deserve to die.

331
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,830
You do deserve to die.

332
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,710
Everyone in the capital city

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,710
is talking about the loss
of the phoenix head.

334
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,640
Director Wang.

335
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,590
Do you think I'm deaf?

336
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,190
Your Majesty, forgive me!

337
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,280
Yes,

338
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,640
I failed to guard it well.

339
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,190
I wanted to find
the phoenix head quietly.

340
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,710
Who would know...

341
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,710
It's all because of Zhang Ping.

342
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,550
It's him

343
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,520
who spread rumors

344
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,710
and made it known to everyone.

345
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,670
It's him who disrespected you!

346
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,950
It's the little scholar again.

347
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,310
You're investigating me now?

348
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,000
Your Majesty.

349
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,880
The rumors started

350
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,790
because of Zhang Ping.

351
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,640
If he is not punished,

352
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,280
I'm afraid the storm can't be calmed.

353
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,430
Mr. Lan.

354
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,830
Do you think

355
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,910
I should reward him

356
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,000
or behead him?

357
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,360
Now you're here to save him.

358
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,310
What should I

359
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,360
do with you?

360
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,710
Your Majesty entrusted me with the task

361
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,640
of holding a completion ceremony
of the Immortal Instrument.

362
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,550
After I heard the phoenix head was lost,

363
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,400
I've been worried about it
day and night.

364
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,910
I'm here today

365
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,520
not only to save Zhang Ping,

366
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,040
but also to share Your Majesty's worries.

367
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,760
To share my worries?

368
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,670
Yes.

369
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,590
I have something to say.

370
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,760
You may leave.

371
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,480
Yes.

372
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,040
I dare not

373
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,520
deceive Your Majesty.

374
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,760
Zhang Ping is

375
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
a student of mine.

376
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,150
I know his character.

377
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,790
The rumors out there

378
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,000
started because of him,

379
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,790
but he would never say anything

380
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,520
that is not confirmed.

381
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm afraid

382
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,920
someone wants to take this chance

383
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,150
to deliberately spread rumors.

384
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,960
If you kill him,

385
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,310
the rumors will be confirmed.

386
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,280
Mr. Lan.

387
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,830
Are you here to reason with me?

388
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,310
I dare not.

389
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,310
I'm a man of sin.

390
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
If you allow me,

391
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,920
I'd like

392
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,960
to help you with your worries

393
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,520
and relieve your boredom.

394
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,590
How are you gonna

395
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,310
relieve my boredom?

396
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
There is

397
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,720
a good game right now.

398
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,310
A detective game.

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,240
Zhang Ping and I will make the effort.

400
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,590
You'll give us time.

401
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,870
If we win,

402
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,240
we'll reclaim the phoenix head for you,

403
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,240
catch the criminal, and dispel the rumors.

404
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,920
During this time,

405
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,240
you only need to think of it as a play.

406
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,070
Mr. Lan.

407
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,590
Since it's a game,

408
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,280
there must be rules.

409
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,920
Do you know

410
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,070
the rules of the game?

411
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,000
I think

412
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
the truth and rumors aren't important.

413
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,830
The most important thing is

414
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,440
who got the nerve

415
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,720
to replace the real

416
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,150
with the fake

417
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,110
and fuel the rumors.

418
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,920
Mr. Lan.

419
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,110
You are smart indeed.

420
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,680
I think you'll be able to find
the mastermind behind it.

421
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,870
This case

422
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,390
is complicated.

423
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,280
I don't have a clue yet

424
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,040
who

425
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,830
the mastermind is.

426
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,310
Mr. Lan.

427
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,110
Among these officials,

428
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,550
who is the one

429
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
that doesn't want to erect
the golden phoenix the most?

430
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,480
Who is desperate to see

431
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,000
the Empress Dowager lose face
and end up in a disgraceful position?

432
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,070
I don't think you have no idea.

433
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,680
It's against the rites system to place

434
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,720
a golden phoenix instead of a golden dragon

435
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,070
since Emperor is the supreme ruler.

436
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,830
May Your Majesty

437
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
strictly observe the rites system.

438
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,200
Mr. Lan.

439
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,960
I don't play games
with uncertain outcomes.

440
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,310
Do you know
what the consequences will be

441
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,310
if you fail to achieve your mission?

442
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,960
You must be

443
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,240
able to afford to lose.

444
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,070
Here is the Empress Dowager's message.

445
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,110
Vice Minister Lan and Zhang Ping

446
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,350
will be given two days
to find the phoenix head

447
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,070
and the mastermind behind it.

448
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,000
If the mission is accomplished,

449
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,240
your lives will be spared.

450
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,240
As for Director Wang,

451
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,680
if you want to stay alive,

452
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,070
just cooperate with them.

453
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,790
Thanks to Her Majesty for her kindness.

454
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,480
If I find the phoenix head,

455
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,960
will everyone be spared?

456
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,110
Including Mr. Ma?

457
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,280
Of course.

458
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,920
The Empress Dowager has promised you.

459
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,040
Thanks to Her Majesty for her kindness.

460
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,350
Sir.

461
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,830
This gilt satin

462
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,350
has been finished by Mr. Xu.

463
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,150
It can be presented
to the Empress Dowager.

464
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,760
Leave it here.

465
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,480
It's too late.

466
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,790
Yes.

467
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,350
Thank you for saving me, Mr. Lan.

468
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,280
If it wasn't for Chen Chou's message,

469
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,070
you would have died today.

470
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,680
I didn't spread rumors.

471
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm telling the truth.

472
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,110
I know.

473
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,920
But you should learn it

474
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,070
from what happened today.

475
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,200
In this world,

476
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,040
sometimes you don't need
to tell the truth.

477
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,920
The Ministry of Works,

478
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,680
the Immortal Instrument,

479
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,680
the Court of Judicial Review,

480
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,630
even the whole capital,
and the Yong Kingdom

481
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,150
won't change a little bit

482
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,480
because of the truth.

483
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,960
This case has nothing to do with you.

484
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,760
Is it worth it?

485
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,590
I just want to find out the truth.
I never thought about that.

486
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,630
Even if you will die for it?

487
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,870
Aren't you afraid?

488
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,630
I'm afraid.

489
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,520
Then why

490
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,870
won't you give up?

491
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,280
If everyone cares about the truth,

492
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,310
there will be no place for darkness.

493
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,520
Weren't you also touched by that?

494
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,960
That's the world in the story.

495
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
The real world

496
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,720
is not that simple and beautiful.

497
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,440
Then

498
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,630
why did you recommend me
to work in the Court of Judicial Review?

499
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,480
You know it?

500
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,150
The registrar said I have
a powerful background.

501
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,550
I can't

502
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,110
think of anyone else but you.

503
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,110
I know you're bent on getting into
the Court of Judicial Review.

504
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,870
I was worried that
you would get into trouble,

505
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,790
so I discussed it with Mr. Tao

506
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,760
and put you in the case archive.

507
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,590
Mr. Lan.

508
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,350
I can't

509
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,720
repay your kindness.

510
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,040
I even brought you into trouble.

511
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,480
But,

512
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,790
there is a clear distinction
between white and black,

513
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,310
right and wrong.

514
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,830
That's the way it should be
no matter where we are.

515
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,920
Unfortunately, I only got you two days.

516
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,390
I'll find

517
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,870
the phoenix head
and the thief in two days.

518
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,720
Now,

519
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,520
we're in the same boat.

520
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,150
Sorry

521
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,390
if I offended you before.

522
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,310
I hope you two

523
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,720
can forgive me.

524
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Don't worry, Mr. Wang.

525
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,590
Let's work on the case first.

526
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,830
I hope

527
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,000
you can tell us everything.

528
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,790
Okay.

529
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,280
Please.

530
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,480
Another layer can be added

531
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,680
to fill the foundation.

532
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,630
The logs in the middle are overloaded.

533
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,590
Yes, the soil layer here.

534
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,550
Well,

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,830
you're free

536
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,040
to ask them.

537
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,870
How did the phoenix head get lost?

538
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,960
It was a night ten days ago.

539
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,550
I made my usual rounds

540
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,680
and didn't find anything abnormal.

541
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,480
The workers

542
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,870
put the rainproof cover on it
and fastened it as usual

543
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,480
when they got off work.

544
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,680
There was a guard every ten steps away
in front of Zhaode Hall

545
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,110
and a patrol every half
of a burning joss stick.

546
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,870
It was heavily guarded.

547
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,790
But at midnight,

548
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,920
Supervisor Lin who was going on a patrol

549
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,760
found the phoenix head missing.

550
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,280
Is it possible

551
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,040
that a craftsman hid

552
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,310
in the Immortal Instrument

553
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,790
and stole the head
when no one was around?

554
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,200
We do a head count every day

555
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,520
before we go to work and get off work.

556
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,350
It's impossible for anyone
to hide in the Immortal Instrument.

557
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,350
It was like the phoenix head

558
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,550
grew wings and flew away.

559
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,070
It's too strange.

560
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,440
I'll check
the Immortal Instrument again.

561
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,760
You were the first one who came here

562
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,960
after the head was stolen?

563
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,070
Yes.

564
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,150
I know best

565
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,920
the situation then.

566
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,520
Can you tell us

567
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,000
everything about it?

568
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:06,830
Yes.

569
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,760
When I came up,

570
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,240
I found that the phoenix head,

571
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,350
the cover,

572
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,150
the scaffolding,

573
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,790
and everything on it

574
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,760
(Supervisor Lin, Ministry of Works)
were all gone.

575
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,590
What you're looking at now

576
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,000
was put here later.

577
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,040
The scaffolding and everything on it
were taken away.

578
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,550
Wasn't it

579
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
more noticeable?

580
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,390
Yeah.

581
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,830
How is the head of the phoenix
connected to the body?

582
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,920
It was a mortise and tenon joint.

583
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,760
You need to turn the phoenix head
in a semicircle to remove it.

584
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,720
I remember it.

585
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,590
When I came here that morning,

586
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,070
I did see some dead bugs,

587
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,960
but Director Wang

588
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
asked us to clean them up.

589
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,240
I guess we missed some when we did it.

590
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,920
The bug was burned to death.

591
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,040
The thief

592
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,680
probably used fire.

593
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,550
But there is no

594
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,440
mark of soot.

595
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,720
If there was a fire,

596
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,200
the Imperial Guards on night patrol

597
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
couldn't have missed it.

598
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,070
Open fires are strictly prohibited here.

599
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,390
The entry and exit of fuel

600
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,720
will be strictly controlled.

601
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,110
Can you pull out the stock records

602
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,150
of the construction site?

603
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,440
I can,

604
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,280
but there are too many things
going in and out every day.

605
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,240
I don't think you can read them all

606
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,350
in a short time.

607
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,070
I'll check the records.

608
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,350
You go and find out

609
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,350
how the thief did it.

610
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,240
Thank you, sir.

611
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,280
You only have one day left.

612
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,630
If you don't find out the truth,

613
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,960
we'll lose our heads.

614
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,110
Zhang.

615
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,550
Tell me

616
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,920
what I can do for you this time.

617
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,280
The cloth cover

618
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,520
was probably used
to wrap the phoenix head

619
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,630
to hide it.

620
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,280
But why would the thief

621
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,630
steal the scaffolding?

622
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,590
Like you said,

623
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,110
if no one

624
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,110
can sneak in from the outside,

625
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,040
then no one can hide in it,

626
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,480
which means there was no one at all.

627
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,280
Could the phoenix head

628
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,870
fly away?

629
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,390
No.

630
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,110
The phoenix head
must have been stolen,

631
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,110
and it has something to do with fire.

632
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,830
The fire was bright at night.

633
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,200
The thief wouldn't risk doing it

634
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,280
if he didn't have to.

635

I can't believe
you still have the mood for tea.

637
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,550
I only went on a business trip.

638

As I got back, I heard

639
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,830
you promised the Empress Dowager

that you'll find the phoenix head
with Zhang Ping.

How was your business trip?

Don't change the subject.

644
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,310
Zhang Ping is not sensible.
What about you?

645
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,350
(Stock Records)
He wants to find out the truth.

646
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,550
Why do you have to
get involved in this mess?

647
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,040
Have you thought about

648
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,760
what the consequences
will be if you fail?

649

What about the efforts you made
over the last ten years?

650

What about

your father's grievance?

652

all of a sudden.

653

why is there no froth in the tea today?

I can't hide it from you.

Tell me.

659
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,350
What does the Empress Dowager want?

660
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,040
The Empress Dowager wants

the person behind the theft
of the phoenix head

662

to be Mr. Liu.

663

She wants the thief to be Mr. Liu.

664

She's not asking you
to investigate the case.

Zhang Ping doesn't know about it, right?

667

If that's the case,

what do you expect

We haven't found anything yet.

How can we accuse
Mr. Liu of stealing it?

It'd be much easier if it was him.

but I still can't figure out

675
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,310
how the thief

676
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,680
stole the phoenix head

677
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,630
with not being there,

678
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,070
how he lighted the fire,

679
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,000
and where he got the fuel.

680
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,720
Zhang.

681
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,720
Why don't we take flight

682
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,110
before meeting the deadline?

683
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,590
I put too much water in it.

684
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,040
The heat threw the lid off.

685
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,240
Don't move!

686
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:11,920
Chen Chou.

687
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,590
You've been a great help.

688
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,480
I finally know

689
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,720
why they needed the fire.

690
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,440
It was the heat.

691
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,550
They needed the heat.

692
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,920
Look.

693
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,070
The cloth cover and scaffolding

694
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,310
weren't made into any tools.

695
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,550
They were there all the time.

696
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,630
The heat went up,

697
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,630
and it flew away.

698
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,240
Flew away?

699
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,520
You should have told me that.

700
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,720
It's just a Kongming Lantern.

701
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,870
The thief made a huge lantern

702
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,040
out of the cloth over
and the scaffolding,

703
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,960
which flew away

704
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,040
with the phoenix head in the dark.

705
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,480
The cloth cover was in a dark color,

706
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,280
that's why no one
at the construction site noticed it.

707
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,270
But

708
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,920
can they do it

709
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,440
without being there?

710
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,880
I haven't figured it out yet.

711
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,150
The fuel is also a problem.

712
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,920
I need to check it with Mr. Lan.

713
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,750
Go ahead.

714
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,360
Zhang Ping!

715
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,520
Mr. Lan found it.

716
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,000
Everything that went in
and out matches up.

717
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,360
There are only four barrels
of raw tung oil paint missing.

718
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,480
That's right.

719
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,550
Xu Dong.

720
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,750
Tell Mr. Lan

721
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,800
to bring more men

722
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,960
and go to Yunxiao Mountain.

723
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,920
Okay.

724
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,200
