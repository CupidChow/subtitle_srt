1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,000
Mr. Wang hasn't finished the arrest,

2
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,480
so we have to ask
the coroners to do autopsy.

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,640
I came late.

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,440
How could it be such coincident?

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,280
The content of the scroll
repaired by the Fengs before their death

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,830
turns out to be
the legend of the Six Sages.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,200
I think the murderer did it on purpose.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,960
He seemed

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,320
to hide the red poison

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
into the pigments.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,200
There are only three
headless and armless corpses.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,470
Why do there lack three heads,

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,240
six arms,

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,390
and a complete corpse?

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,520
One body has four heads and eight arms.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,110
The limbs that were lost at the scene

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,070
could be pieced together
into the image of Morengen.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,400
When Mr. Sun was poisoned,

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,840
he was checking the seeds of herbs,

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,710
and his body

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,350
was fixed into this posture.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,640
Chu Qi'er was also
fixed into the posture

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,430
of dancing when she was poisoned.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,120
Did the murderer
poison and fix the victims

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,590
to use their corpses to create

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,310
the images of Six Sages?

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,790
In that case,

28
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,350
the murderer also needed the corpses of

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,790
Mr. Sun and Chu Qi'er.

30
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,680
I've never heard someone

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,680
would use humans to create statues.

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,920
Then why were the gavel

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,350
and silk

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,310
put here?

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,350
Maybe they were the clues
to the rest two victims' identities,

36
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,320
and the murderer left them deliberately.

37
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,660
=A League of Nobleman=

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
=Episode 8=

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,680
Sir,

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,560
the autopsy was done.

41
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,360
Sir,

42
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,150
the three victims' death
states were the same as Miss Chu's.

43
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,430
They were killed by the same poison.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,710
Then why did the three corpses

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,030
bleed a little?

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
They had been bled out

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,400
before their heads

48
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,240
and arms were cut.

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,000
Then where was their blood?

50
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,870
No blood was left in the pavilion.

51
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,030
Besides, there was another problem.

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
All the three corpses

53
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,630
were bitten by fleas.

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,750
Fleas?

55
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,190
The Feng family is reputable,

56
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,190
and the Wuming Pavilion is also clean,

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,710
so how could there be fleas?

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,520
Fleas like shady and damp places,

59
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,000
so they couldn't
appear here groundlessly.

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,630
The Wuming Pavilion is guarded heavily,

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,840
and the four gentlemen
from the Feng family

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,470
had been drawing here without leaving,

63
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,630
so how did the murderer

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,120
manage to enter here and poison them?

65
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,360
How did he remove

66
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,630
the corpses and limbs?

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,000
I think there are other channels.

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,470
What sound is it?

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,630
The smell of blood is so strong.

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,720
The murderer actually dug
a secret channel behind the cabinet.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,430
Inform Mr. Wang right now.

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,070
Yes.

73
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,160
The murderer actually
dug through a secret canal.

74
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,750
It's a secret canal again.

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,800
It seems the murderer

76
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,000
acts through secret canals.

77
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,720
I think he is not far away from us.

78
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,190
There are traces of dragging.

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,720
The sound just now seemed

80
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,600
to be made by dragging heavy things.

81
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,310
He went to the left.

82
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,190
The flow washed the traces away.

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,510
There is another fork ahead.

84
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,830
I don't know

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,750
which direction we should choose.

86
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,240
Close the sluice.

87
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,750
When the water ebbs,

88
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,680
the murderer's footprints

89
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,830
will be shown.

90
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,160
Xu Dong,

91
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
we'll chase after the murderer ahead,

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,270
and you go to close the sluice.

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,000
Sir,

94
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,800
be careful.

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll be back soon.

96
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,310
The water level falls.

97
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,920
His traces will be shown.

98
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,990
Shush.

99
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,950
Go.

100
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,360
The corpses' limbs

101
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,360
are all here.

102
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,310
I'm sure the murderer
isn't far away from us.

103
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,390
There is a hole.

104
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,390
Let's enter and check.

105
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,390
What place is it?

106
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,510
It seems like a prison.

107
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,270
It's a medicine jar.

108
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,870
The patients were prisoned here.

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
It's not a prescription of medicine

110
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,480
but poision.

111
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,200
What sound is it?

112
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,440
It's the Shocking Thunder Bomb.

113
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,550
Zhang Ping.

114
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,150
Zhang Ping.

115
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:26,790
Zhang Ping.

116
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,750
Zhang Ping.

117
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,000
Zhang Ping.

118
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,000
Zhang Ping.

119
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,000
Zhang Ping.

120
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,550
Zhang Ping.

121
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,630
Zhang Ping.

122
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,360
It's not safe here.

123
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,320
Get up now.

124
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,670
We're stuck.

125
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,240
Stop trying.

126
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,600
Who is it?

127
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,150
I'm a ghost,

128
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,720
hiding in secret canals all the time.

129
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,960
Stop mystifying deliberately.

130
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,390
Who are you?

131
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,840
Look at the intelaced channels.

132
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,480
Don't they look like
the network of Capital City?

133
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,750
If we regard
Capital City as a human,

134
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,360
this place

135
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,870
is a tumor in his veins.

136
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,200
What have you done here?

137
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,270
Everyone that came here

138
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,750
experienced the pain
of poison eroding their bones

139
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,750
and died.

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You killed them.

141
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,630
You're ignorant.

142
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,360
Everyone will experience life and death.

143
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,320
Only when they experience death

144
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,600
will they know what life means.

145
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,870
Why did you kill Mr. Sun

146
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,840
and Chu Qi'er?

147
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,510
You're smart,

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,750
so why don't you deduce?

149
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,150
Where is Gong Yuzhen?

150
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,320
What did you do to her?

151
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,120
She's my Musician-sage,

152
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,910
Ronakin.

153
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,750
It's not time for her to die.

154
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,630
Don't you hurt her.

155
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,390
Do you know why

156
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,080
it is covert here?

157
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,200
It's because everyone that comes here

158
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
is doomed to die.

159
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,240
People inside

160
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,320
could leave

161
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,750
only when they die.

162
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,270
You're hurt.

163
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,870
It's shady and dirty here,

164
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,030
so you're easy to get infected.

165
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,030
You'd better wrap it up now.

166
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,510
Zhang Ping,

167
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
I know you're still mad at me,

168
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,720
but we're trapped here,

169
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,120
and I don't know
if we'll be alive or not.

170
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,720
I'm willing to work together with you

171
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,550
and...

172
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,150
I have an idea.

173
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,320
The murderer killed people

174
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,000
according to the chronological
order of the Six Sages' births.

175
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
The Musician-sage was born the last.

176
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,600
That's why the murderer said

177
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,390
it was not time for Miss Gong to die.

178
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,600
As long as we find the rest two people

179
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,550
before he kills her,

180
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,030
we'll have a chance to stop him.

181
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,150
You're casting pearls before swine.

182
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,120
I was thinking about the case just now,

183
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,960
but I heard your words,

184
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,000
Mr. Lan.

185
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,030
You saved me,

186
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,080
so I should thank you.

187
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,320
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

188
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,150
However, you indeed did it wrongly

189
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,870
on Miss Gong's matter.

190
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,360
No matter what reason you have,

191
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,080
- you can't deny the fact.
- You can't deny the fact.

192
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,870
How priceless

193
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
your loyalty is.

194
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:01,960
By the way,

195
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,480
you said

196
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,600
there were rest two people.

197
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,910
Who are they?

198
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,630
I don't know.

199
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
Judging from the standard
the murderer used to choose victims,

200
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,790
I think the rest two people

201
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,000
are the top in their respective fields.

202
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,840
Wait.

203
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,390
Do you remember the silk
on the scroll of the Six Sages?

204
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,510
I didn't have time to
ponder about it by then,

205
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,000
but now I remember

206
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
that is the Red Gilding Silk

207
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,910
from Yunshang Community.

208
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,750
The silk is woven
by gold foil and silk yarns,

209
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,080
and it's classified as a tribute.

210
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,790
Only Miss Wu from
Yunshang Coummity can weave it.

211
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
If so,

212
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,000
she is most likely to be
chosen by the murderer

213
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,600
to be the Farmer
and Sericulturist Sage, Zansang.

214
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,240
How about the gavel?

215
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,360
There is a mark of the
Court of Judicial Review on it.

216
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,840
The Warden-sage, Uyu,

217
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,550
is Mr. Tao, the judge of
the Court of Judicial Review.

218
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,550
Oh, no.

219
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,910
He's going to kill the two of them.

220
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,510
We have to leave as soon as possible.

221
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,910
The more we delay,

222
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
the more dangers they are in.

223
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,390
I don't know when Xu Dong and Mowen

224
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,630
will find us.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,910
Don't you feel strange?

226
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,600
The murderer has
been usually leaving clues

227
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,000
since his first murder.

228
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,030
He seems to play games with us.

229
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,270
Perhaps he left a riddle

230
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,120
in his

231
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,510
mysterious words.

232
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,320
Everyone will experience life and death.

233
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,390
Only when they experience death

234
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,720
will they know what life means.

235
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,320
Does he mean

236
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,480
everything mutually reinforces,

237
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,480
neutralizes, and depends on each other?

238
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,960
Since the entrance is the life gate,

239
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,750
there must be the death gate.

240
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,480
People will die

241
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,360
after entering from outside.

242
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,960
People inside can leave alive

243
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,360
only when they die.

244
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,480
This is the incinerator.

245
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,360
It is the death gate.

246
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,240
Mr. Lan,

247
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,390
the chimney is the exit.

248
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,080
Is anyone here?

249
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,870
Is anyone here?

250
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,080
Please.

251
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,960
Save us.

252
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,840
We are here.

253
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,360

It's Xu Dong.

Zhang Ping.

258
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,070
They are underneath.

259
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,680
Come on.

260
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,960
Remove them.

Are you okay?

Never mind.

266
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,030
Miss Wu and Mr. Tao are in danger.

267
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,880
We're pressed for time.

268
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,000
Let's split out.

269
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,960
I'll go to save Miss Wu.

270
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,590
Okay.

271
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,550
I'll go to save Mr. Tao.

272

Go.

wants to kill you.

to educate and civilize criminals,

so how could they

kill me?

no matter how bad criminals were,

they had consciences,

Why does he

want to kill me?

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,510
Okay.

340
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,790
Father,

341
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,790
this letter is from your son, Ziyi.

342
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,480
How are you?

343
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,160
I live well in the army,

344
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,030
so you don't need to send money to me.

345
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,680
Summer is coming,

346
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,960
so please check the price of the silk,

347
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,480
and ask the tailor to make new clothes

348
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,000
to spend summer.

349
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,720
Even if you spend festivals alone,

350
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,070
you can't spend them carelessly.

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,160
You must eat
glutinous rice of five colors

352
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,590
to pray for good lucks.

353
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,590
In the army,

354
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,590
I'm looking forward
to going home every day,

355
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,590
by Ziyi.

356
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,720
He's grown up.

357
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,790
My son has grown up.

358
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,680
If you receive letters in the future,

359
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,830
you can come to me directly.

360
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,590
I'll read them for you.

361
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,680
I won't bother you.

362
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,590
I heard

363
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,310
you and Mr. Wang
from the Ministry of Justice

364
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,270
are investigating Miss Chu's case.

365
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes.

366
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,400
Unfortunately,

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,000
we haven't caught the murderer yet.

368
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,240
I suddenly remember

369
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,590
the way of Miss Chu's death

370
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,920
is like a southern legend

371
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,550
that Ziyi told me.

372
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,310
Please tell me that.

373
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,070
In a mysterious place

374
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
in southern area,

375
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,830
there was a mysterious clan.

376
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,920
This clan

377
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,270
was isolated

378
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,350
and lived

379
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,480
in deep forests over the years.

380
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,440
They had a skill,

381
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,920
which was

382
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,110
to deprive people's souls.

383
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,070
Because of that,

384
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,550
they broke the taboo

385
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,240
and suffered the divine
retribution in one night.

386
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,720
It's said that night,

387
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,680
the sky became as bright
as the daytime in an instant

388
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,790
after rumbling.

389
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,070
Above the village,

390
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,720
a cloud of scarlet mist

391
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,270
was enveloping the sky and moon.

392
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,750
All clansmen

393
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,000
stood to the spot and died stiffly,

394
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,720
and their bodies

395
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,440
were cracked

396
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,830
as if their souls had been deprived.

397
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,750
All big and important
cases from every county

398
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,400
will be sent to the Court of
Judicial Review to be reviewed again.

399
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,070
If it's true,

400
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,830
(The fourth year of Qingfeng)
its recording scroll can be found

401
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,680
in the case archive
in the Court of Judicial Review.

402
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,350
(The first year of Yongxuan)
Twenty years ago,

403
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,510
our emperor ascended the throne

404
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,000
and changed the era name to be Yongxuan.

405
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,460
(Wu Village)

406
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,700
(Moluo Village, Yueshang County, Lingnan District)

407
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,750
Scroll of Moluo Village,
Yueshang County, Lingnan District.

408
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,030
That's it.

409
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,620
(Moluo Village, Yueshang County, Lingnan District)

410
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,270
In the first July of Yongxuan,

411
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,510
a homicide case

412
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,480
happened in
Moluo Village, Lingnan District.

413
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,110
No villagers survived.

414
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,480
All of them were stiffened and died.

415
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,350
At that time, a cloud of scarlet mist

416
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,790
enveloping the sky and moon.

417
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,440
Because of the flash flood,

418
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,440
the gallery road was destroyed.

419
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,790
It cost several months to fix it.

420
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,720
It was found the villagers
had practiced the sorcery

421
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,790
and suffered the divine
retribution in the scarlet mist.

422
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
There were
no objections after the review.

423
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,270
The case was ended.

424
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,960
There are no
divine retributions in the world.

425
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,550
It seems

426
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
people in the Moluo Village
were also killed by the red poison.

427
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,640
How long did it take from Capital City
to Moluo Village at that time?

428
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,400
Go back now.

429
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,070
Where are you going?

430
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,270
It's none of your business.

431
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,070
Do you find clues?

432
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,750
Maybe I can help you.

433
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,510
Don't you want to know how long it took

434
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,240
from Capital City to Moluo Village?

435
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,750
The terrain was complex there,

436
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,720
so the moving speed was different.

437
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,440
It's hard to calculate it specifically.

438
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,110
but I can help you.

439
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,030
You had to spend five days

440
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,160
to cross the lakes by boat

441
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,640
and spend seven days

442
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,960
to pass the forests.

443
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,270
It was hard to pass the marshes,

444
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,510
so you had to spend twenty days.

445
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,270
If the map is correct,

446
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,640
it cost about ninety days,

447
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,790
(Moluo Village)
which was one month longer

448
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,440
than going on the official road.

449
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,510
Zhang Ping,

450
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,350
go back now.

451
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,000
I have something to talk with Peizhi.

452
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,790
I should know

453
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,880
everything that is related to this case.

454
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,680
It's none of your business.

455
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,200
Why?

456
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,880
If the two cases are related,

457
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,880
it could help to catch the criminal

458
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,270
if we find out the truth.

459
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,200
Zhang Ping,

460
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,480
this is my private thing.

461
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,160
Don't you worry about Mr. Tao?

462
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,200
No one is guarding
the Court of Judicial Review,

463
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,510
so go back to check it now.

464
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,160
No.

465
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,000
Send off the guest.

466
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,310
Moluo Village

467
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,550
was on the post road.

468
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,960
My father left home in early
April in the first year of Yongxuan.

469
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
He encountered
the flash flood on the way,

470
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,270
and the gallery road was destroyed.

471
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
He sent a letter to me,

472
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,790
saying he had to make a detour

473
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,590
and walked three
months to arrive in the southern area.

474
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,310
After three months,

475
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,200
it was early in July.

476
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,350
Didn't the village suffer
the divine retribution at that time?

477
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,790
He was condemned when returning
to Capital City early in October.

478
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,240
After calculating the time,

479
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,240
I found he started
the return journey near the village.

480
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,240
He spent three months back,

481
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,680
and the time matched.

482
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,030
That's right.

483
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,160
Peizhi,

484
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,720
don't you think the two things

485
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,830
are very coincident?

486
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,000
As soon as your father came there,

487
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,400
the village was perished.

488
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,480
It was indeed strange

489
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,590
back then.

490
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,310
As I recall my father's
words before his leaving,

491
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,510
I always feel he wouldn't do bad things

492
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,720
although the trip to the
southern area was dangerous.

493
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,550
I'm going to

494
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,550
the southern area.

495
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,200
If it's smooth,

496
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,310
I'll spend about two months.

497
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,920
If not,

498
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,310
I'm afraid I have to spend more time.

499
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,550
If it's not smooth,

500
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,790
will you encounter dangers?

501
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,240
Could you

502
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,590
cancel the trip?

503
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,720
Zengzi once said to Zixiang,

504
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,240
"Are you brave?

505
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,960
I heard

506
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,030
the real braveness from Confucius."

507
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,640
Then

508
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,640
what is the real braveness

509
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,590
in Confucius' words?

510
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,160
He said thousands of people stopped me,

511
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,440
but I would still go,

512
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,550
so I'm not afraid.

513
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,440
I just don't want others

514
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,790
to take this risk

515
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
for me.

516
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,160
Father,

517
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,960
keep this sachet.

518
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,240
Regard it

519
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,550
as my accompany to you.

520
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,070
When I met my father again,

521
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,160
he was on the guillotine.

522
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,350
Although everyone said he was a traitor,

523
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,160
I know

524
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,590
he wouldn't betray the country

525
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,440
even if he was threatened to be killed.

526
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,270
I know.

527
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,000
If the criminal of this case

528
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,510
is related to the Moluo Village's case,

529
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
we may find out the truth

530
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
of my father's wrong death

531
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,030
if we catch him.

532
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,920
Then why don't you
tell this to Zhang Ping?

533
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,200
He is organized

534
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,030
and knows the Water Illusion,

535
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,000
so perhaps he can help you.

536
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
The Army for
Southward Crusade were defeated,

537
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,240
and thousands of people died in the war.

538
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,750
The court didn't want to mention it.

539
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,550
My father admitted
betraying the country,

540
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,030
but the court didn't investigate

541
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,440
the strangeness inside it

542
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,960
and tried to end
the case as soon as possible.

543
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,920
Since they hid it hard,

544
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,240
there must be something behind it.

545
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,000
If we investigate the case again,

546
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,880
it means we'll challenge
the authority of the court.

547
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,880
If Zhang Ping,
who is reckless, knows that,

548
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,590
he will cause bigger trouble

549
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,590
within two days.

550
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,240
Sir.

551
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,110
Sir.

552
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:03,830
Sir.

553
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,400
Why does he spend
so long in the bathroom?

554
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,640
Are you okay?

555
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,590
How about I enter to check you?

556
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,960
I might have eaten
something that caused a diarrhea.

557
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,310
Zhang Ping is straightforward

558
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,270
and has experienced
nothing in officialdom.

559
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,110
That's why he could
insist to his conscience.

560
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,400
This is

561
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,830
very priceless.

562
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,960
But because of that,

563
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,790
he doesn't know
how dark the officialdom is

564
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,480
and always has a breach

565
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,510
of propriety when doing things.

566
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,550
I'm worried that he will
fail from his strong toughness.

567
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,310
Peizhi,

568
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,110
leave this matter to me.

569
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,480
I'll find out the truth of your father's

570
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,400
wrong death at all costs.

571
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,920
We've been guarding the
Court of Judicial Review for so long,

572
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,270
but why hasn't the murderer acted yet?

573
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,830
You've been guarding for a night,

574
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,640
so go back to rest early.

575
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
No one is in the street

576
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,480
since it's early in the morning.

577
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,200
What is he doing?

578
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,020
(Court of Judicial Review)

579
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,070
I've investigated overnight

580
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,070
and found the corpses
of Mr. Sun and Chu Qi'er

581
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,680
were stolen

582
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,790
besides Miss Wu's and the four
gentlemen' from the Feng family.

583
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,590
The hole under
the secret canal also collapsed.

584
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,270
How about you?

585
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,400
Sir,

586
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,200
we were divided
into three teams to guard.

587
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,880
Two teams would
guard by turns every hour,

588
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,240
and the rest team would keep
searching the Court of Judicial Review.

589
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,790
We didn't find the Scarlet Mist Spray.

590
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,270
Mr. Tao went to bathroom twice

591
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,070
and ate night snacks twice.

592
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,510
No other extraordinary things happened.

593
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,960
Don't slack off,
and continue to guard heavily.

594
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

595
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,160
Although there are no clues,

596
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,720
I'm afraid it's not a long-term solution

597
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,960
for us to stay in
the Court of Judicial Review

598
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,750
and wait for the murderer.

599
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,350
Sir,

600
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,590
when I and Zhang Ping
finished guarding and left,

601
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,960
we met a dumb embalmer on the way.

602
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,880
He was pulling a flatbed cart of corpses

603
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,790
and signed he was unable to pull it.

604
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
He didn't stop pestering us

605
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,240
and wanted us to help him.

606
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,640
He looked weird,

607
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,790
and so was the way
Zhang Ping looked at him.

608
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,830
Then

609
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,270
Zhang Ping went to help him.

610
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,590
I also wanted to help Zhang Ping,

611
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
but he teased me.

612
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,720
Even pepper made you feel pungent,

613
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,440
not to mention smelly corpses.

614
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,110
What did he mean?

615
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,350
Who was disgusted at pepper?

616
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,830
What else did he say?

617
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,440
Won't Mr. Lan come later?

618
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,270
Just wait for him

619
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,160
here.

620
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,030
He also said other words.

621
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,510
My home is in the same direction,

622
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,880
but the Lan's Mansion isn't.

623
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:27,960
No.

624
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,750
Zhang Ping's home is in Xiaohaozi Lane,

625
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,350
so he must go
in the southeast direction.

626
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,270
But the Cemetery is
in the west direction,

627
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,550
so how could his home
be in the same direction?

628
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,960
It must be a hint.

629
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,960
Xuexiao,

630
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,920
keep one team here to guard.

631
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,200
Others, follow me to the Cemetery.

632
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,880
Yes.

633
