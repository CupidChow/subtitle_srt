1
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,790
Why did all these people outside

2
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,760
die in an instant?

3
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,920
- Empress Dowager!
- Empress Dowager!

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,350
The Empress Dowager came back to life!

5
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,460
=A League of Nobleman=

6
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,060
=Episode 28=

7
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,100
Isn't the Empress Dowager in the coffin?

8
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,340
How could she be outside?

9
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,340
Exactly.

10
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,780
What's on the Empress Dowager?

11
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,060
What's this?

12
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,620
The letter written in blood.

13
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:51,860
Read it.

14
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,380
30 years ago,

15
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,700
the prince was seriously ill

16
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,140
and there was no cure.

17
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,620
Under the guise
of the Resurrection Array,

18
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,900
the Empress Dowager replaced him
with a folk baby boy.

19
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,620
The witch of the Moluo Clan found out
about it by chance,

20
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,860
and she couldn't bear it,

21
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,780
so she took the dying real prince away
and healed him,

22
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,940
treating him as her own.

23
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,900
Impossible.

24
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,940
- No way.
- Impossible.

25
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,300
This...

26
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,300
Go ahead.

27
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,780
20 years ago,

28
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,140
the witch wanted to return the prince

29
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,620
and discussed it with Mr. Lan Lin.

30
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,380
Unexpectedly, when the Empress Dowager
heard that the real prince was alive,

31
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,100
she was afraid that what she did
would be exposed,

32
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,780
so she decided to
remove the source of the trouble,

33
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,580
and ordered

34
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,500
the assassination of her child.

35
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,020
How could the Empress Dowager
do such a thing?

36
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,260
She also killed the entire Moluo Clan

37
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,020
and exterminated Lan Lin's family

38
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,620
for treason.

39
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,180
For 20 years, the clansmen of Moluo
have never died with grievance,

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,940
and their wronged souls linger
in the world, unable to leave.

41
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,060
God can do justice.

42
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,700
The Empress Dowager killed her son
and exterminated a clan,

43
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,380
which is a serious crime.

44
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,180
Only when she dies tragically

45
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,820
can the souls of our clan

46
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,700
rest in peace.

47
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,020
The Empress Dowager killed the prince,

48
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,420
disrupting the royal lineage?

49
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,180
Could it be that

50
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,980
what Mr. Liu just said is true?

51
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,020
No offense.

52
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,700
But please show us the birth certificate.

53
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,100
When the Empress Dowager

54
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,260
ordered Xuan Ji to bury me alive,

55
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,780
she also handed over this page

56
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,300
of birth certificate to him

57
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,540
and ordered him to burn it.

58
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,140
But suddenly there was lightning

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,660
and a strong wind.

60
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,740
Xuan Ji felt guilty.

61
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,980
Seeing this,
he dared not stay any longer.

62
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,620
Before the birth certificate was lit,

63
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,020
he fled away.

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,220
Later, the birth certificate

65
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,420
fell into the hands
of my adoptive mother.

66
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,580
It has the palm prints of mine from childhood
and that of the Empress Dowager.

67
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,180
You will know the truth

68
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,100
after comparing them.

69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,620
In addition to me,

70
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,900
those who have seen His Majesty's
birth certificate back then

71
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,580
also include Mr. Wang and Mr. Dou.

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,540
Please check it out.

73
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,980
Bring the birth certificates here.

74
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:13,980
This...

75
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,420
It's gone.

76
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,660
Why is it gone?

77
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,620
It's true.

78
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,220
Everything's

79
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,940
matched.

80
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,940
The Chief of Imperial Astronomy.

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,660
Please verify.

82
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,860
I have done divination calculations
for the royal family for many years,

83
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,020
and studied countless palm prints.

84
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,180
I guess I can tell the truth
from the false.

85
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,900
The baby's palm print on Dr. Gu's
birth certificate

86
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,020
is indeed the same as his own.

87
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,140
The late emperor's seal and
the Empress Dowager's palm print both match.

88
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,900
Mr. Dou.

89
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,780
What is the conclusion?

90
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,740
It has been verified to be true.

91
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,420
With the birth certificate as proof,

92
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,100
you should

93
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,980
have no objection, right?

94
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,740
This matter

95
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,900
is related to royal orthodoxy.

96
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,580
I think it's of great importance,

97
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,980
and needs to be discussed
in the long run.

98
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,420
Everyone.

99
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,060
Who do you choose to rely on,

100
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,420
and how can you ensure that
you succeed in the end,

101
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,780
instead of becoming a nobody?

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,380
We should obey God's will,

103
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,900
set things right, and support the return
of the true emperor.

104
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,940
Grand Tutor Liu Xian
is now leading the officials

105
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,580
to welcome Your Majesty to the throne.

106
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,380
Welcome

107
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,660
Your Majesty to the throne.

108
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,580
Welcome Your Majesty to the throne.

109
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,780
Welcome Your Majesty to the throne.

110
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,580
Today is the funeral
of the Empress Dowager.

111
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,420
The new Emperor's ascension
to the throne

112
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,380
may not conform to the etiquette system.

113
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,260
Where is Vice Minister of Rites?

114
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,580
There are indeed precedents
for the parallelism of the two rites

115
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,300
in the classics of all dynasties.

116
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,060
Protect His Majesty!

117
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,420
Peizhi.

118
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,900
Are you going to kill me?

119
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,900
I consider you my only true friend.

120
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,420
Even you want me to die?

121
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,820
I have no choice.

122
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,300
I am the real emperor.

123
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,260
My enthronement today

124
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,260
is a foregone conclusion,

125
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,580
and no one can stop me.

126
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,580
That being the case,

127
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,940
I want you to watch me ascend
the throne with your own eyes.

128
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,460
Wait!

129
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,900
The prince was never exchanged.

130
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,740
And Gu Qingzhang
is not the real emperor.

131
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,740
Zhang.

132
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,420
What are you doing?

133
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,100
I got a way.

134
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,620
You are really smart.

135
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,100
But you shouldn't
go against me all the time.

136
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,460
Zhang.

137
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,700
Zhang.

138
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,860
Zhang.

139
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,060
You are betting your life on it.

140
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,180
If anything goes wrong, you're dead.

141
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
It's the first time
I've heard of this method.

142
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,340
You dared to be directly
stabbed by a knife.

143
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,420
Good for you.

144
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,740
It was Mr. Xiong who accurately

145
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
avoided the vital position
with the knife.

146
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,580
It looks dangerous,

147
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,100
but after the bleeding stops,
it will be fine.

148
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,100
You said that His Majesty
is not the real emperor,

149
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,340
and there is no such thing
as transferring the prince.

150
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,940
How do you explain

151
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,220
the birth certificate?

152
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,220
(The real birth certificate that can prove
his identity as the prince)

153
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,100
(is in my hands.)

154
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,580
(Then the one with him must be fake.)

155
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,420
Open the coffin,

156
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,300
and I can prove that
his birth certificate is forged.

157
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,660
Nonsense!

158
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,700
The coffin has been sealed,

159
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,980
how can it be opened again?

160
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,180
It is related to the authenticity
of the royal blood,

161
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,820
why not open the coffin for inspection?

162
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,300
The Empress Dowager's body is kneeling
outside the hall,

163
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,020
dragged out by the ghosts
of the Moluo clan.

164
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,380
This is what everyone saw
with their own eyes.

165
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,660
Those so-called ghosts

166
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,860
were all pretended by
Gu Qingzhang's subordinates.

167
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,940
Go.

168
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,220
Okay.

169
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,380
Go.

170
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,220
They used the underground structure
of the Immortal Instrument

171
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,420
to connect the underground canals
and the Zhaode Hall Square,

172
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,420
keeping their whereabouts secret
and coming and going freely.

173
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,820
Exactly.

174
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,260
Everything that happened today

175
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,580
is the work of men.

176
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,700
They played tricks in the square
outside the hall just now.

177
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,660
We all saw it.

178
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,780
Nonsense!

179
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,180
How could manpower

180
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,140
transfer the Empress Dowager's body

181
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,180
from the coffin to the outside of the hall

182
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,860
in an instant?

183
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,900
According to what you said,

184
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,340
the coffin should be empty now.

185
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,700
Then why don't you dare to test it?

186
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,620
If I'm right,

187
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,220
there should be another
Empress Dowager in the coffin.

188
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,900
The Empress Dowager inside the coffin

189
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
and the one outside the hall

190
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,460
are basically two people.

191
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,780
The corpse kneeling outside the hall
is the fake Empress Dowager.

192
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,740
She never entered the coffin
from beginning to end.

193
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,860
What are you talking about?

194
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,060
How can there be such similar people
in the world?

195
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
He replaced the Empress Dowager
with a fake one

196
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,420
on the Resurrection Array,

197
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,900
so that he could enter the palace
to conduct the plan conveniently.

198
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,300
(That is to say,)

199
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,340
(the one who died the day before yesterday
was the fake Empress Dowager.)

200
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,780
(The fake Empress Dowager
was not put into the coffin)

201
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,100
(after the grooming ceremony,)

202
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,460
(but was transferred to the culvert)

203
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,900
(by Eunuch Liu
and Gu Qingzhang's subordinates.)

204
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,620
(The tulip ointment and mercury)

205
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,860
(we found in the culvert are proof.)

206
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,540
(Then)

207
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,180
(they dragged the body
of the fake Empress Dowager)

208
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,460
(from the culvert
to the outside of the palace)

209
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,140
(when they were playing tricks.)

210
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,380
(They put the letter
written in blood on her,)

211
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,060
(creating the illusion of accusations
from the ghosts.)

212
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,460
(And the person lying in the coffin)

213
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,500
(is the real Empress Dowager
who was kidnapped by Gu Qingzhang)

214
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,260
(from Banyue Pavilion.)

215
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,620
(They exchanged
the real Empress Dowager back)

216
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,060
(after the grooming ceremony,)

217
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,900
(and sealed her in the coffin
under the witness of all of you.)

218
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,060
And

219
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,260
the Empress Dowager is still alive.

220
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,780
Everyone.

221
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,100
The female officer who encoffined
the Empress Dowager has confessed.

222
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,820
The real Empress Dowager

223
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,060
is right in the coffin.

224
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,060
Guards.

225
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,460
Open the coffin.

226
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,580
General.

227
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,380
She's still breathing.

228
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,020
A silver needle inserted
into this acupuncture point

229
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,620
can make one unable to move or speak,

230
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,180
but with clear consciousness,

231
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,460
one will recover soon after
the needle is removed.

232
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,020
Your Majesty.

233
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,100
She's awake.

234
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,060
Your Majesty.

235
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,420
Your Majesty.

236
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,660
What a situation.

237
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Are you in a hurry to hold a funeral

238
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,900
before I die?

239
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,220
Since

240
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,300
the Empress Dowager is still alive,

241
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,140
please answer my question

242
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,440
in front of all the officials.

243
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,940
Is Gu Qingzhang

244
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,220
the real emperor?

245
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,380
Didn't you see

246
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,180
what this rebel

247
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,180
did

248
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,020
to me?

249
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,020
If he is the real emperor,

250
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,260
even if he disrespects you,

251
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,380
he is still the king
of the Yong Kingdom.

252
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,540
Zhang Ping.

253
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,580
Didn't you just say that

254
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,740
as long as the coffin is opened,

255
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,780
you can prove that
the birth certificate is fake?

256
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,260
Right.

257
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,980
Even if Gu Qingzhang

258
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,740
can forge the birth certificate
seamlessly,

259
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,460
there must be a mismatch in one detail.

260
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,500
The Empress Dowager's palm print
on the birth certificate

261
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,020
should have been forced by him

262
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,860
after he kidnapped her.

263
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,180
(Jing Qizhe,
Emperor Qingfeng's eldest son)

264
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,420
He thought he could deceive the world
by doing this.

265
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,700
But what he didn't know was that

266
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,460
the Empress Dowager was weak
after giving birth

267
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,660
and had herpes.

268
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,180
Look.

269
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
The scars on the Empress Dowager's palm

270
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,380
are evidence of herpes.

271
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,620
Imperial physicians should be aware of

272
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,580
the symptoms of this disease.

273
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,220
When she got sick that year,

274
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,020
mucus would ooze from her palms,

275
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,820
which was difficult to be wiped off.

276
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,460
After being rubbed on clothing or paper,

277
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,580
they dry up into crumbs.

278
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,860
If the Empress Dowager's palm print
on the birth certificate

279
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,540
was really left over by her
30 years ago,

280
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,940
it would definitely leave traces.

281
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,700
Since Gu Qingzhang

282
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,260
was not aware of this detail,

283
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,180
he must have not counterfeited it.

284
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
To check the authenticity
of the birth certificate,

285
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,740
you only need to check whether
there are any crumbs on the inkpad

286
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,220
of the Empress Dowager's palm print.

287
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,780
Can your birth certificate

288
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,180
stand the test?

289
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,620
No need.

290
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,060
The birth certificate

291
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,700
is fake.

292
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,060
You!

293
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,580
You!

294
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,620
How dare you lie to me?

295
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
General Cao.

296
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,940
Take him down.

297
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,180
Why don't you tell them

298
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,580
why I hijacked you,

299
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,780
and why I planned today's show?

300
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,620
Zhang Ping.

301
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,300
Haven't you been obsessed
with the truth?

302
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,540
Why don't you dare to say it now?

303
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,300
Of course I dare to.

304
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,980
You are Mr. Jinghu who appeared

305
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,460
in the imperial examination last year.

306
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,340
You instigated scholars

307
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,500
to create turmoil,

308
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,580
kidnapped the Empress Dowager,

309
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,580
and conspired to usurp power.

310
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,100
All kinds of signs indicate that

311
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,180
you are just a crazy person

312
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,460
who wants to be the emperor.

313
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,140
So

314
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,180
I made up the grievances

315
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,780
of Moluo Village and Lan's Mansion?

316
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,460
Kuruo.

317
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,260
You lied.

318
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,060
You've grown up.

319
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,420
Empress Dowager.

320
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,860
All the epiphyllum
in the Imperial Palace

321
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,460
will bloom for you tonight.

322
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,060
Do you remember the scarlet mist?

323
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Before I made the embalmer
commit suicide,

324
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,380
I used him to complete
the improvement of this poison.

325
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,740
Now the toxin is hidden in the pollen.

326
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,180
When in bloom, the scarlet mist
will spread all over the city.

327
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,420
Don't worry.

328
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,940
People who inhale it will not
experience any pain,

329
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,420
they will just die of stiffness

330
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,660
with a smile on their face

331
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,020
in the illusion of happiness.

332
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,380
Now the Imperial Palace

333
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,460
has epiphyllum everywhere.

334
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,420
Tonight

335
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,460
is when the flowers bloom.

336
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,100
Even if you hide the toxin
in the pollen,

337
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,860
it is impossible to manipulate
the flowers to bloom.

338
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,420
Zhang.

339
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,740
What's that?

340
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,500
The whistle of our clan.

341
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,900
Dead...

342
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,140
No!

343
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,740
The epiphyllum is in full bloom outside.

344
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,980
The red pollen inside is poisonous.

345
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,140
Once you touch it, you will die.

346
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,580
It's true.

347
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,580
What's going on?

348
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,500
What to do?

349
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,500
How come?

350
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,940
Run!

351
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,740
Or it will be too late!

352
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,700
We are done.

353
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,460
Run!

354
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,900
Run!

355
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,060
No!

356
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,620
The Empress Dowager
and Gu Qingzhang are missing.

357
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,060
Go find the Empress Dowager.

358
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:52,860
Hold on.

359
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,580
Calm down.

360
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,020
Cover your mouth and nose
with a damp cloth.

361
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,460
Zhang.

362
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,740
Be careful!

363
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,860
Come back.

364
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
How dare you touch it?

365
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,140
I see.

366
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,860
Epiphyllum blooms
when the night is cool.

367
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,500
Gu Qingzhang buried
a large amount of saltpetre

368
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,420
in the soil in advance,

369
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,220
and then notified his men
hidden in the culvert

370
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,580
(to flood the saltpeter with water,)

371
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,940
(causing the soil temperature
to drop suddenly)

372
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,460
(and meet the conditions
for flowers to bloom.)

373
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,900
Epiphyllum is now planted
all over the Imperial Palace.

374
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,420
The poisonous mist
has spread to the city.

375
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,220
Find a way to save the people
as soon as possible.

376
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,860
Go.

377
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,180
- Go.
- Go.

378
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,900
What happened in the front?

379
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,340
It seems to be nice.

380
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,100
Let's go take a look.

381
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,980
Something's wrong.

382
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,100
Wait.

383
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,820
Wait...

384
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,060
The scarlet mist is killing. Run!

385
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,140
The scarlet mist is killing. Run!

386
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:08,980
Come on.

387
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,900
The scarlet mist is killing.

388
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,340
Run!

389
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,300
The scarlet mist is killing.

390
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,980
The scarlet mist is coming.

391
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,860
Run!

392
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,580
The scarlet mist is coming. Run!

393
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,580
Zhang Ping.

394
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,300
Save them.

395
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,660
Go.

396
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,660
Zhang, watch your wound.

397
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,020
Uncle Yu.

398
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,100
Don't pick it up. Run!

399
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,940
Zhang Ping?

400
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,740
Yes.

401
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,180
Zhang Ping is back.

402
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:18,940
Granny Li.

403
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,500
Why are you back?

404
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,300
Zhang Ping came back to save us.

405
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,700
Now is not the time to talk about this.

406
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,860
Run!

407
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,340
Hold on.

408
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,660
Don't be afraid.

409
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,660
Cover the mouth and nose
with a damp cloth.

410
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,540
Go up high, quick.

411
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,220
Go upstairs.

412
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,260
Cover the mouth and nose.

413
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,940
Wait, stop.

414
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,420
The poisonous mist is thicker behind.

415
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,620
Have you found the Empress Dowager
and Gu Qingzhang?

416
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,340
General Cao.

417
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,660
Focus on the present.

418
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,580
The safety of the people
is more important.

419
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,940
The poisonous mist
has filled the whole city.

420
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,900
Let's find a place to hide first.

421
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,580
Calm down.

422
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,820
Follow us.

423
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,900
Xiong Xiao.

424
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Everyone, follow us.

425
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,700
Cover the mouth and nose.

426
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,540
Cover the mouth and nose.

427
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,420
Follow me.

428
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,580
Follow us.

429
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,340
This way.

430
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,180
Cover the mouth and nose.

431
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,820
Cover the mouth and nose.

432

Get inside.

433
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,540
Once get in,

434
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,780
block the doors and windows.

435
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:13,900
Come on.

436
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:14,940
Come in.

437
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,860
Hurry up.

438
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,860
Go up high.

439
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,340
Get in and seal the doors and windows.
