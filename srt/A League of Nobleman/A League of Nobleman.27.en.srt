Why did Mr. Liu

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,550
urgently call us into the palace
in the middle of the night?

4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,920
Right.

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,230
And he didn't allow us to enter.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,160
What is he doing inside?

Guards!

Take him down!

- Yes.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,670
You never let me down.

is dead now.

Has your plan changed?

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,110
Everything will go according to the plan.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,670
I just want to get back
what belongs to me.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,590
Then I will abdicate the throne.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,310
Abdicate?

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,870
Yes.

20
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,710
All capable people in the world
can compete for it.

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,400
Wouldn't that
cause turmoil in the court,

22

and chaos in the world?

23

in the end?

99
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,280
Just to respect the deceased.

100

He's just an imperial physician.

I can arrest him for interrogation.

141

Dr. Gu

is Mr. Jinghu.

146
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,000
He made troubles in the Yong Kingdom,

147

kidnapped
and burned the Empress Dowager,

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,070
and then sneaked into the palace
under the pretense of treating injuries,

149
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,430
lurking beside the Empress Dowager
for several months.

150
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,710
He even bewitched the Empress Dowager

151
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
to alienate her cronies like you

152

who have followed her for many years.

His purpose is

155
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,070
to control the situation,

156
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,790
and after disrupting
the Immortal Instrument's ceremony,

157
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,190
create even greater turmoil.

158
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,000
Zhang Ping and I
entered the palace this time

159
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,400
to ask the Empress Dowager

160
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,520
to stop Gu Qingzhang.

161
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,550
Unexpectedly,

162
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,120
he suddenly assassinated
the Empress Dowager.

163
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
This is similar to what Zhang Ping said.

164
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,880
Mr. Lan.

165
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,000
Even if you don't come,

166

I'm about to send someone to invite you.

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,430
Just now Zhang Ping said that

168
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,910
he discovered another secret.

169
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,000
But he can't tell me exactly what it is

170
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,790
until he meets you.

171
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,310
Zhang Ping.

172
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,280
Zhang Ping.

173
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,590
Can you say it now?

174
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
Mr. Lan, do you think it is abnormal

175
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,910
for Gu Qingzhang

176
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,950
to kill the Empress Dowager
suddenly today?

177
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,160
According to Gu Qingzhang's usual style,

178
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,790
he would not kill the target directly,

179
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,240
but designed to torture

180
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,120
and tease them.

181
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,280
He spent so much time

182
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,590
trying to disturb the Immortal Instrument's ceremony
and take revenge on the Empress Dowager,

183
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,550
how could he suddenly kill her?

184
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,070
Looking back on the day
when the Empress Dowager disappeared,

185
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,190
not only was her face
burnt beyond recognition,

186
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,640
but her throat was also burnt out.

187
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,360
In other words,

188
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,790
since the Empress Dowager was burned,

189
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,880
(except for Eunuch Liu and Gu Qingzhang)

190
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,590
(who were suddenly
transferred to her side,)

191
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,670
(no one has seen the real face of her.)

192

(Eunuch Liu, Hanyuan Hall)
(And Eunuch Liu)

197
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,520

198
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,360
(The person rescued from the fire)

199
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,280

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,480
(was the fake Empress Dowager.)

201
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,000
(The face and voice
of the fake Empress Dowager were burned)

202
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,190
(for the convenience of Gu Qingzhang
to mix the false with the genuine.)

(should be the fake Empress Dowager.)

205
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,480
I recalled

206
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,590
what Shulin had said.

207
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,310
The world will fall into chaos
at that time.

208
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,040
They will be disillusioned with

209
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,670
power and status.

210
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,910
Can you say

211
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,790
it's not gonna be a good show?

212
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,910
I'm not just gonna watch it.

213
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm gonna invite her
to watch it with me.

214
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,910
(If that's his plan,)

215
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,830
(he would not let the real
Empress Dowager die easily.)

216
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,190
It shows that

217

the real Empress Dowager

218
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,070
is very likely to be alive.

219
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,280
Exactly.

220
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,280
General.

221
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,760
The entire palace has been searched.

222
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,790
Dr. Gu was not found.

223
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,280
Then search outside the palace.

224
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,360
Yes, sir.

225
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm afraid that

226
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,190
now he is hidden in the dark

227
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,760
and is about to start his plan
to usurp power and seize the throne

228
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,430
and bring chaos to the world.

229
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,790
General Cao.

230
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,040
The real Empress Dowager is still alive.

231
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,310
We have to rescue her
as soon as possible,

232
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,950
so that we can

233

stop Gu Qingzhang's plan

234
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,400
and stabilize the situation.

General Cao.

236
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,520
You have followed the Empress Dowager
for many years,

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
so you naturally hope that she is still alive.

a ray of hope in this matter,

How do you

290
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,480
explain?

May I borrow the
Immortal Instrument's blueprints

292

from the Ministry of Works?

293
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,590
When the Ministry of Rites supervised
the construction of the Immortal Instrument,

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,120
I had seen the blueprints.

295
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,240
Could it be that the Empress Dowager

296
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,430
is hidden in the Immortal Instrument?

297

Gu Qingzhang is thoughtful.

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,190
He not only wants
to hide the Empress Dowager,

299
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,160
(Zhaode Hall, Imperial Palace)
(but also wants her to witness)

301

(To satisfy both conditions...)

302
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,360
It's here.

303
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,880
There is an exhaust window

304
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,190
on the base of the Immortal Instrument,

305
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,640
which is at the same height
as Zhaode Hall,

306
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,310
allowing one to have a panoramic view

307
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,310
of everything that happens in the hall.

308
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,830
But the Immortal Instrument's exterior

309
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,480
has been completely sealed off,

310
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,640
making it impossible to enter.

311
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
So Mr. Xiong

312
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,310
couldn't search there.

313
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,190
Look.

314
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,590
There is a repair passage
in the hydraulic drive chamber

315

under the
Immortal Instrument's foundation,

316
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,760
allowing direct access
to the interior for maintenance.

317
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,240
This hydraulic drive chamber

318
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,670
communicates with
the main canal of the palace

hurry up.

323

The main canal of the palace

for several generations,

326
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,430
and some sections

327

335
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,120
Go with Zhang Ping.

336
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,400
I am waiting for your news.

337
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes, sir.

338
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,710
Come.

339
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,830
Zhang Ping.

340
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,070
I have to preside over the funeral

341
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,000
and control the tempo.

342
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,550
I'll try to

343
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,790
buy you time.

344
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,070
I can't help you

345
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,880
find the Empress Dowager.

346
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,430
Be very careful.

347
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,710
Don't worry, sir.

348
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,880
Mr. Lan.

349
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,190
If I haven't replied to you

350
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,760
by the time of the ceremony,

351
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,190
I'm afraid I'm in danger.

352
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,040
Don't worry.

353
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,070
If it's a last resort,

354
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,760
I know what to do.

355
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,710
Take care.

(Memorial)

357

Xu Dong.

358
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,110
How long have you been working for me?

359
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,110
Nine years.

360
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,790
I just entered the official career
nine years ago,

361
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,830
and my future was uncertain.

362
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,480
At that time, I was a desperado,

363
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,590
being used to the dangers in this world,

364
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,110
and I was disheartened.

365
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,630
Until I met you,

366
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,830
you thought highly of me

367
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,870
and let me serve you.

368
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,070
I have

369
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
always been grateful.

370
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,920
You've paid the debt of gratitude.

371
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,390
You don't owe me anything.

372
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,350
Sir.

373
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,150
Take out the money from the treasury

374
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,000
and distribute it to Feixing, Liuyun

375
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,760
and other servants.

376
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,920
I don't want to leave you.

377
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,830
Go.

378
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,760
This is the entrance to the main canal
of the palace.

379
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,870
Who's that?

380
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,350
Chen Chou.

381
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,390
Why are you here?

382
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,630
Why can't I come?

383
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,480
This is what Mr. Lan

384
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,590
asked me to bring to you.

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,520
Take it.

386
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,150
All right.

387
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,000
You should leave.

388
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,870
Don't get involved.

389
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,200
Since I'm here,

390
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,390
of course I will stay to protect you.

391
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,390
Mr. Lan also asked me to tell you that

392
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,150
the Immortal Instrument
will be unveiled at 11 o'clock,

393
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
and Gu Qingzhang will ascend
the throne after that.

394
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,870
So

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,720
we have to find the Empress Dowager
before 11 o'clock.

396
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,440
National mourning.

397
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,920
Farewell to the Empress Dowager.

398
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,350
Replace the regular clothes
for the Empress Dowager.

399
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,440
Empress Dowager of the Yong Kingdom.

400
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,390
Your Majesty.

401
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,040
Your Majesty.

402
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,960
Zhang.

403
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,390
Why do I feel so gloomy here?

404
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,870
I'm so scared.

405
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,040
You think too much.

406
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,110
The underground canals in the palace
have gone through several dynasties,

407
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,040
and many places have been in disrepair
for a long time.

408
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,960
No wonder it's windy here.

409
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,760
Zhang.

410
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,110
In the 21st Year of Yongxuan,

411

March of the Gengzi Year,

412

the first day of the lunar year,

413
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,240
Empress Dowager Yide died
in Hanyuan Hall.

414
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,720
The funeral was held in Zhaode Hall.

00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,760
is obliged to

421
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,590
hold the ceremony.

422
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,480
The moon rises,

423
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,870
round and bright.

424
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,630
The sun represents the mortal world.

425
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,040
And the moon represents the underworld.

426

Zhang.

427
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,040
Which way should we go?

428
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,310
In the underground, I can't tell

which direction
leads to the Immortal Instrument.

Someone's there.

How come?

The spider webs
of the other two culverts

441

were covered with dust

442
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
and dead mosquitoes.

443
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,150
This one looks like
a freshly formed spider web.

444
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,550
It means that

445

someone walked here not long ago.

446
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,310
Never forget the demeanour
of Empress Dowager Yide.

You are really smart.

But you shouldn't go
against me all the time.

Where did you hide the Empress Dowager?

The world is so dangerous.

505
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,630
He betrayed you in an instant

506
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,310
just to survive.

507
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,040
Is it worth your life

508
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,520
to save such people?

509
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,240
Even if I do it ten thousand times,
it's worth it.

510
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,760
The world you hate

511
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,310
has people like my mother.

512
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,070
Even if she knew what happened today,

513
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,110
she would have still saved you
in the first place.

514
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,200
Where is...

515
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,110
Where is the Empress Dowager?

516
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,720
The Empress Dowager

517
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,720
is in a better place for her,

518
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,630
enjoying it all.

519
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,630
Kuruo.

520
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,310
When you see your mother,

521
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,040
tell her for me that

522
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,040
I will avenge her and her clansmen

523
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,480
soon.

524
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,440
Let me go.

525
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,350
Piss off.

526
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,790
Gu Qingzhang!

527
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,150
You jerk!

528
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,790
What qualifications do you have
to mention Zhang Ping's mother?

529
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,630
She'd never let you go.

530
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,200
Kill me if you dare.

531
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,790
Kill me.

532
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,350
Wait.

533
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,440
Keep him alive

534
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,150
to collect Kuruo's body.

535
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,520
Zhang.

536
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,520
Zhang, come on.

537
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,440
Zhang.

538
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,550
Wake up.

539
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,280
Wake up, come on. Zhang.

540
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,070
It'll soon be 11 o'clock.

541
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,960
Zhang.

542
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,520
Wake up, Zhang.

543
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,760
Zhang.

544
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,480
Wake up, Zhang.

545
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,390
(If I haven't replied to you)

546
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,960
(by the time of the ceremony,)

547
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,630
(I'm afraid I'm in danger.)

548
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,070
What's up?

549
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,150
Farewell to the Empress Dowager.

550
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,110
Farewell to the Empress Dowager.

551
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,350
Move the coffin.

552
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,040
Hold on.

553
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,070
There is another important person

554
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,040
who has not bid farewell
to the Empress Dowager,

555
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,440
how can you carry the coffin?

556
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,390
Who's that?

557
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,040
It's

558
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,390
the biological son
of the Empress Dowager,

559
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,390
the real emperor

560
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,150
wandering about destitute.

561
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,480
- What?
- How come?

562
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,280
It's him.

563
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,760
Greetings to Your Majesty.

564
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,480
Your Majesty.

565
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,200
This is

566
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,310
the crown prince
conferred by the late emperor

567
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,830
in the 15th year of Qingfeng.

568
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,280
His Majesty is now
leading the troops into battle

569
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,760
in the South.

570
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,520
How could he

571
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,960
be the prince?

572
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,000
Exactly.

573
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Could it be that

574
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,200
you want to take advantage
of the fact that there is no emperor now,

575
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,440
and intend to rebel?

576
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,590
I

577
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,440
have been through three dynasties,

578
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,390
and I have been the teacher
of two generations of emperors.

579
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,310
I have been loyal to the Yong Kingdom

580
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,830
for more than 50 years,

581
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,480
and devoted myself to supporting
the orthodoxy of the royal family.

582
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,440
How could I

583
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
intend to rebel?

584
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,390
Indeed.

585
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,920
Is there something hidden in it?

586
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,790
Right.

587
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,280
All seigniors and military governors
are in the capital.

588
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,520
The situation is delicate.

589
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,040
If there is any carelessness...

590
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,350
It's 11 o'clock in the evening.

591
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,200
The dynasty shall change.

592
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,720
Guards.

593
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,150
Ghosts!

594
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,720
Ghosts!

595
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,670
Empress Dowager!

596
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,710
The Empress Dowager came back to life!
