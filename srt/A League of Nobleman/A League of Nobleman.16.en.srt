This is our kid, Ping.

144
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,040
He's been considerate since little.

145
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,160
Once I went to my daughter's home

146
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,480
and was supposed to return
before dinner.

147
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,670
But something held me up

148
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,790
until it got dark.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,520
I was scared when walking on the road.

150
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,550
But when I looked ahead,

151
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,950
I saw a little boy holding a lantern.

152
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,190
It was Ping waiting for me.

153
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,040
He said,

154
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,910
"Mrs. Li, you promised to come back

155
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,910
and I knew you would."

156
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,070
He was little at that time.

157
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,550
Just this tall.

158
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,910
Accidentally, he bit the dust.

159
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,910
It's raining so hard.

160
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,000
Wang, let me help you.

161
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,240
What a heavy rain!

162
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,120
Hurry.

163
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,360
Come for the shelter.

164
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,400
I hate the rain.

165
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,240
I begged but got no food at all.

166
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,070
I don't like to move, anyway.

167
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,670
I would rather starve to death.

168
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,550
Then I could have a new life early.

169
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,550
Someone would be stuffed to death

170
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,160
while someone would starve to death.

171
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,040
This is

172
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,710
so unfair.

175
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,000
This is my tool for fortunetelling.

176
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,520
You three look extraordinary.

177
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,880
How about

178
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,120
I tell your fortune?

179
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,240
Let's start with you.

180
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,120
Me?

181
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,430
You've got a great destiny.

182
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,430
In the future,

183
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,480
you can fight wars and give commands.

184
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,480
What does it mean?

185
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,910
It means you'll be a commander.

186
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,070
But...

187
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,710
What?

188
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,670
I can be a general?

189
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,790
Tell my fortune, too.

190
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,760
Please.

191
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,070
You're destined to be rich.

192
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,640
And you... You would be greater.

193
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,950
You can be a lord.

194
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,880
I can be a lord? A lord?

195
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,950
I didn't see this coming.

196
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,830
In such a small town,

197
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,280
there are so many great guys.

198
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,310
I'm the General of Xichuan.

199
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,040
You must take orders from me.

200
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,360
What's the big deal of a general?

201
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,240
Can you eat dried persimmon every day?

202
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,360
Can you farm with gold hoes?

203
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,190
How dare you!

204
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm the Great Lord
titled by His Majesty.

205
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,480
You should have knelt!

206
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,120
- Greetings, My Lord.
- Greetings, My Lord.

207
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,710
Come on, let's go.

208
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,590
For this prophecy, let's celebrate it

209
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,480
and spend my precious money.

210
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,190
But it's still raining.

211
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,790
The rain can't stop a general.

212
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,830
Go.

213
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,120
Master,

214
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,670
you talked nonsense again, right?

215
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,430
What if I did?

216
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,830
What if I didn't?

217
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,000
Think about destiny and luck.

218
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Destiny is fixed,

219
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,880
but luck can be achieved.

220
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,280
Beggars, haven't had dinner yet, huh?

221
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,360
Here.

222
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,590
Take the food.

223
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

224
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,590
Poor guys. Go enjoy the food.

225
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,360
Come on.

226
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,000
Trade it for some good wine.

227
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,190
Thank you, sir.

228
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,710
It's so kind of you.

229
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,040
Thank you, My Lord.

230
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,110
Come on, cheers.

231
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

232
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,760
Cheers.

it's the tenth day.

252

I came to get the letter.

The last step to go.

254

Will you give it up before success?

Ping,

00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,520
would you like a try?

267
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,720
Come on, then.

268
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,920
Put the copper coins in it.

269
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,830
Ping,

270
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,440
you lost your parents
when you were three

271
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,240
and had no other relatives.

272
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,960
You're destined

273
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,240
to have a broken family.

274
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,520
However,

275
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,790
I feel you'll have
an extraordinary official career.

276
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,680
You'll solve all mysterious cases,

277
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,040
become a famous detective,

278
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,720
and serve as a great minister.

279
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,110
But an official said

280
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,440
I couldn't survive

281
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,630
even three days in my official career.

282
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,680
Nonsense.

283
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
I heard in the Capital City,

284
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,870
you solved many mysterious cases

285
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,960
and were known as Detective Noodle.

286
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,000
Come on.

287
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,550
Since little,

288
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,790
you've loved to hash things out

289
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,040
and read detective storybooks.

290
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,630
In your childhood,

291
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,110
you often helped neighbors
with problems.

292
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,280
You were only ten.

293
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,040
At that time, I realized

294
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,110
you would work
in the Court of Judicial Review.

295
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,960
But before that,

296
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,480
I must figure out who I am.

297
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,440
Fine.

298
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,000
Our trip to the foot of the mountain

299
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,760
seems to be wasted.

300
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Don't worry, Master.

301
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,830
I understand

302
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,960
what you expect me to know.

303
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,550
I know destiny and luck

304
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,760
are two things.

305
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,680
I won't be trapped in my origin.

306
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,480
I just want to figure out

307
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,790
where I came from.

308
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,240
And that's all.

309
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,350
That year,

310
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,830
I was traveling around

311
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,440
when I found you in the forest.

312
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,870
You were wearing exotic clothes.

313
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,200
I looked for your family

314
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,550
somewhere near,

315
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,790
only to find

316
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
that they were all dead.

317
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,520
No survivors.

318
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,150
So,

319
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,870
did Xuan Ji tell the truth?

320
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,350
Master,

321
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,920
do you know the details?

322
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Could you tell me

323
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,390
whether my clansmen

324
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,000
were good or evil?

325
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,550
I broke into that place by accident.

326
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,920
In the valley,

327
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,350
red mist hung over

328
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,200
as if doomsday was coming.

329
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,830
I didn't dare to stay

330
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,720
and then I carried you away.

331
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,240
When I found you,

332
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,760
you kept crying.

333
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,000
I tried so hard

334
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,150
but couldn't calm you down.

335
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,680
Accidentally, I found

336
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
whenever you smelt

337
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,150
the sachet around your neck,

338
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,440
you stopped crying.

339
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,590
Maybe,

340
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,590
the sachet

341
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,310
means something special to you.

342
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,590
It smells so familiar.

343
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,110
I think I smelled it at home.

344
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,590
When I opened the sachet,

345
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,720
I saw

346
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,480
a kind of rare orchid.

347
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,790
Only petals and scraps, though.

348
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,720
In case you still cried

349
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,440
after they were used up,

350
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,590
I searched the entire Xichuan County.

351
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,040
I found some seeds
and planted them in the mountain.

352
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,000
After years of meticulous care,

353
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,760
only two or three survived.

354
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,550
Every time you had a nightmare,

355
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
I made the orchid into spice

356
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,390
which could protect you from nightmares

357
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,920
and help you sleep better.

358
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,240
(This orchid is)

359
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,440
(the same as that in Mr. Lan's house.)

360
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,630
(Jue?)

361
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,920
(It's Mr. Lan's sachet.)

362
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,550
You want this sachet?

363
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,590
I'll give it to you

364
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,000
and please stop crying.

365
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,000
Was this sachet

366
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,070
from Mr. Lan's father?

367
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,480
Looks like

368

your story in the Capital City

369
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,350

Master,

374

don't see me off.

375
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,590
Or I'll have to walk you back here.

376
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,110
There you go.

377
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,350
Master,

after I leave,

take good care of yourself.

Ping,

381

you know that.

382
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,390
I can't tell the fortune at all.

383
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,830
I just brag to make people happy.

384
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,480
But sometimes,

385
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,200
one should

386
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,390
have some hope.

Ping,

pin your hope on the coins.
