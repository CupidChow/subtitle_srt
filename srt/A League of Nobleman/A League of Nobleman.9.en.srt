00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,920
Could I take a look

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,120
at your face?

4
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,840
Did we meet somewhere?

5
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,000
I've also looked for you for a long time.

to find Zhang Ping.

10
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

11
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,240
Sir.

12
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,240
I can't believe the embalmer
would throw the body here.

13
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,550
Search carefully.

14
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,390
Don't let go of the faintest clue.

15
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,110
Yes.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,870
Wait.

17
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,590
Look for pepper.

18
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,760

(made of dead bodies by the killer.)

21
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,240
Why did you drug me

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,920
and tie me up here?

23
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,960
Help.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,520
Help.

25
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,360
Miss Gong.

26
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,870
Why is she here?

27
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,670
She's my Ronakin.

28
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,710
You said you'd also looked for me for long.

29
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,710
Why?

30
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,590
Answer my question first.

31
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,550
Why did you help me with the cart

32
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,730
and come with me?

33
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,040
I knew you were the killer.

34
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,550
How did you know?

35
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,520
Your eyes told me.

36
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,320
Back then in the dark culvert,

37
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,480
your eyes startled me.

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,870
You looked at me

39
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,200
with your left eye dull and empty.

40
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,760
It occurred to me later

41
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,990
that it was an artificial eye,

42
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
which explained

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,640
the strange footprints

44
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,870
in the culvert.

45
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,520
Your left footprints

46
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,680
are heavier than the right ones

47
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,710
because of your blind left eye.

48
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,560
When you walk,

49
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,270
you keep your weight on the left

50
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,960
to compensate for your biased vision.

51
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,560
Could it prove that I'm the killer?

52
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
You also left your trace

53
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,440
at the murder scene.

54
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,200
You got an itch from flea bites

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,590
and thus keep scratching yourself.

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,520
I found bite marks by fleas

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,790
on the bodies of the Feng brothers.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
Those fleas must come from you.

59
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,790
An embalmer takes care of transporting corpses.

60
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,790
Because of this identity,

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,910
you can move these bodies

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,680
as you like without being suspected.

63
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,270
And I notice the red powder

64
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,520
out of the cloth bag on your waist.

65
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,470
At that moment, I confirmed

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,150
that you were the murderer.

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,910
Excellent.

68
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,830
Now you should answer my question.

69
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,200
Why did you say you had also
looked for me for a long time?

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,320
I knew it. You are the best man for Warden-sage.

71
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,270
Uyu.

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,080
Uyu?

73
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,230
That's me.

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,270
Sir.

75
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,230
This is the cart of the embalmer.

76
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,080
Zhang Ping's pepper bottle is also on it.

77
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,150
Are we near the mass grave

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,640
burying the refugees of Guiyi Community?

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,200
All poor people who no one cares.

80
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,000
So the government appropriated
a small amount of money

81
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,030
to have embalmers collect the bodies

82
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,830
and buried them here in the forest.

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,000
Then this forest

84
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,790
must be his lair.

85
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,640
Search this place.

86
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,030
Find him at all costs.

87
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,910
Fire off a signal flare after you find him.

88
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,830
Yes.

89
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,150
We'll also act separately.

90
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:10,910
Okay.

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,080
Be careful.

92
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:15,830
Let's go.

93
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,680
Why am I Uyu?

94
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,030
The conundrum

95
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,880
in the book of the Physician Mr. Sun
and the lotus flower of Chu Qi'er,

96
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,760
was designed by me to select Uyu.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,520
In the end,

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,790
you solved it.

99
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:35,910
That day,

100
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,470
I waited  under the Wuming Pavilion

101
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,350
to see who could get my clues and come.

102
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,960
You didn't let me down.

103
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,640
If that's the case,

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,830
why did you leave the gavel as a clue?

105
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,230
I thought the Warden-sage you wanted was

106
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,910
Mr. Tao, head of Court of Judicial Review.

107
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,560
If I had directed at you,

108
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,440
you would have been alerted

109
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,270
and I wouldn't have been able to lure you in.

110
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,350
I've always wanted to know

111
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,230
where your Scarlet Mist Spray

112
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,350
comes from.

113
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,680
Where?

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
I made it myself.

115
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,270
Have you ever used it elsewhere before?

116
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,320
I did countless evil things with it.

117
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,640
Which one did you refer to?

118
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,030
Moluo Village, Lingnan District.

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,470
20 years ago.

120
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,470
Too many questions.

121
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,390
You just need to know

122
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,000
that I developed the spray

123
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,390
and did everything else

124
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,350
for my friends.

125
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,080
It's your mission.

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,230
Your friends?

127
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,150
After I offer the six sages again

128
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,200
to the god of creation, Injeeten,

129
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,390
he will start a new world

130
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,760
and send my friends and me to a place

131
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,350
where there will be no more suffering

132
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,680
and we will all get a new life.

Now

137
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,790
the time has come

138
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,320
for you and Ronakin to return to your places.

139
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,750
My eyes.

140
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,590
Lime powder!

141
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,920
You won't be able to change anything.

Finally.

148

I finally

149
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,320
found the six sages

150
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,710
and could offer them to you,

This is the Pure Land.

I made it.

I delivered my promise.

174
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,200
Hu.

175
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,510
Shi Nu.

176
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,470
What's happening?

177
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,510
Impossible.

178
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,800
It's impossible.

179
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,960
I've sacrificed the six sages.

180
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,230
Why is this happening?

181
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,680
Why?

182
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,110
Why?

183
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,230
I've been sent to the Pure Land?

184
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,200
Why am I still in the Drug Mound?

185
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,080
Where am I?

186
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,830
Where the heck am I?

187
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,320
My eyes.

188
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,110
Lime powder.

189
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,750
The moon is reflected in the water.

190
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,160
I want to neither leave nor stay.

191
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,590
Whatever in my mind

192
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,470
will become reality.

193
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,560
The six sages have returned to their places.

194
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
I could finally

195
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,560
offer the six sages to you.

196
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,800
You can go to the Pure Land now.

197
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,280
This is the Pure Land.

198
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
I succeeded.

199
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,590
Why am I back in the Drug Mound again?

200
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,710
(He has lost his mind.)

201
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,830
Why?

202
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,280
Why?

203
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,440
Why is all this?

204
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,040
(Go on asking.)

205
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
Why am I still in the Drug Mound?

206
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,750
Why?

207
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,320
Because they haven't forgiven you.

208
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,560
Tell me the ins and outs.

209
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,080
I can help you.

210
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,560
You?

211
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,560
Help me?

212
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,440
Right.

213
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,320
You are Uyu,

214
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,160
the Warden-sage.

215
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,040
You can help to prove

216
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,160
that I've fulfilled my promise.

217
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,710
I'll tell you.

218
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,830
I'll tell you everything.

219
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,040
Drink it.

220
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,230
Drink it.

221
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,870
Drink it.

222
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,870
35 years ago,

223
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,630
a plague swept through the Yong Kingdom.

224
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,230
My parents died of the disease

225
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,590
while I survived

226
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
and got stranded in the capital city.

227
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,350
However, a quack doctor lured me here.

228
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,960
He ran a clinic on the surface

229
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,870
but sold poisons in secret.

230
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,870
Used as his drug testers,

231
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,280
we lived in hell.

232
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,350
Fortunately, I met Hu and Shi Nu there.

233
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,440
We depended on each other.

234
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,200
So I have the strength to live on.

235
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,920
I remember one time

236
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,400
we prepared ourselves to escape.

237
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,790
Drink it.

238
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,230
Drink it.

239
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Will you drink or not?

240
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,880
Drink it now.

241
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,440
You want to run?

242
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,990
Stop.

243
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,070
Get back here.

244
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,960
Run!

245
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,710
What are you doing?

246
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,680
Get help to save us!

247
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
You brats, let go of me!

248
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,750
I'll come back for you.

249
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,750
Come back!

250
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,160
Hu and Shi Nu risked their lives

251
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,640
to help me escape.

252
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,550
I hid here and there.

253
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,840
A few months later,

254
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,200
I ventured back to the Drug Mound.

255
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,920
But

256
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,070
it was too late.

257
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,960
Too late.

258
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,200
With resentment and hatred,

259
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,070
I also began to develop poison.

260
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,310
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.

261
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,960
It took me many years

262
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,030
to make the poison of poisons,

263
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,230
Scarlet Mist Spray.

264
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,440
And I found that quack doctor's place,

265
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,310
Huian Pharmacy.

266
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,030
I took revenge for Hu and Shi Nu.

267
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,750
That day,

268
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,030
the air was heavy with red mist.

269
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,600
His whole family paid with their lives.

270
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,360
Skin ashen

271
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,750
and body cracked,

272
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,680
they died in extreme pain.

273
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,120
However,

274
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,640
after all this was done,

275
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,400
I didn't feel relieved at all.

276
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,750
I returned to the culvert

277
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,120
and became a wandering ghost.

278
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,120
And one day.

279
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,790
a master told me about the legend of Injeeten

280
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,640
and this magic circle.

281
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,200
He said

282
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,230
I could use Scarlet Mist Spray

283
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
to gather the six sages.

284
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,510
That way,

285
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,750
Injeeten would realize my wish

286
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,230
of reuniting with Hu and Shi Nu

287
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,470
in the Pure Land.

288
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,120
Who?

289
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,270
Who told you that?

290
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,070
In the legend of Injeeten,

291
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,230
there's no such thing as a magic circle.

292
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,440
Why is that?

293
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,640
He lied to you.

294
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,470
Impossible.

295
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,200
He wouldn't do that.

296
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,600
The legend is real.

297
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,550
Tell me.

298
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,120
Why did I fail?

299
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,710
Why didn't it work?

300
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,600
Why?

301
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,550
Why?

302
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,640
What went wrong?

303
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,990
(Who's the person that misled him?)

304
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,600
What went wrong?

305
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
What went wrong?

306
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,120
(His mental state is quite unstable.)

307
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,440
(He's about to wake up.)

308
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,600
(Has Mr.Lan arrived?)

309
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,920
These tombs seem to form a pattern.

310
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,790
Someone arranged them this way on purpose.

311
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,640
This star chart of Seven Mansions
which belongs to Azure Dragon

312
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,310
In the legend,

313
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,840
Injeeten was the incarnation
of the Erina Star on earth.

314
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,160
Erina is how the Mo people

315
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,160
call the star of fire
in the Seven Mansions of Azure Dragon.

316
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,030
If the murderer was Injeeten...

317
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,070
I know why.

318
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
You are still alive.

319
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,070
That's why my ritual didn't work.

320
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,990
You ruined my plan.

321
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,160
It would never work.

322
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,990
That man lied to you.

323
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,600
It's impossible.

324
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,880
As long as you're dead,

325
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,680
I will succeed.

326
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,200
Oh, no.

327
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,400
He's gonna wake up.

328
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,470
This must be a dream.

329
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,070
I want to wake up.

330
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,750
I want to wake up.

331
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,960
His inner world is falling apart.

332
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,680
Zhang Ping.

333
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,550
I want to wake up!

334
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,990
Zhang Ping.

335
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,270
Zhang Ping.

336
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,120
Mr. Lan.

337
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,360
Mr. Lan.

338
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,680
Are you all right?

339
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,400
I'm fine.

340
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,750
I used Water Illusion on him.

341
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,790
But he's going to wake up.

342
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,990
Mr. Lan.

343
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,200
Mr. Lan, help.

344
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,790
Don't move.

345
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,160
Miss Gong.

346
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,360
You must be Lan Lin's son.

347
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,750
20 years ago,

348
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,600
was the murder case of Moluo Village

349
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,030
committed by you?

350
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,880
And how much

351
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,880
do you know about my father?

352
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,440
What a pity.

353
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,880
It's too bad

354
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,880
that you'll never know the truth.

355
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,470
What is the truth?

356
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,510
Go to the Pure Land together with me.

357
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,160
There's a trap rigger on the altar.

358
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,160
Destroy it.

359
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,960
Hu.

360
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,600
Shi Nu.

361
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,440
I'm coming for you.

362
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
He just died like that

363
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,270
and didn't tell you anything?

364
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,070
In that critical situation,

365
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,270
we had to save Yuzhen first.

366
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,360
It's not easy to find someone in the know.

367
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,310
What about your father's case?

368
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm only sure that he knew my father.

369
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,880
So he probably also knew
what happened to Moluo Village.

370
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,310
But in his lair,

371
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,360
(Seven-star Begonia)
except for bottles and jars of poison,

372
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,680
we found nothing.

373
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,510
It's okay.

374
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,200
We still have time.

375
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,840
Call it a day.

376
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,600
Yes.

377
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,120
Mr. Lan.

378
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,510
I can help you investigate.

379
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,550
I know

380
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,200
that for you

381
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,070
the case is not over yet.

382
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,960
I'll go invite him once again.

383
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,310
I heard that

384
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,510
a serious murder happened in the capital.

385
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,070
Your Majesty.

386
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,640
Mr. Wang did a great job

387
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,200
and found the criminal.

388
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,840
But he was a little bit late.

389
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,070
The criminal killed himself

390
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,710
before we could interrogate him.

391
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,470
What about the rumor about soul absorbing?

392
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,790
Soul absorbing is absolute nonsense.

393
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,070
Those weird deaths were caused by drugs.

394
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,400
After a thorough investigation,

395
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,160
I've destroyed the lair of the killer

396
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,070
and confirmed that there is no poison left.

397
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,550
The rumor has been clarified.

398
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,640
In addition,

399
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,440
Minister Gong's granddaughter was also involved.

400
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,680
I've submitted a report about the details.

401
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,070
Please be lenient with her

402
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
for the sake of Minister Gong's hard work

403
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,790
and her ignorance.

404
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,600
Gong Yuzhen can be spared from death.

405
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,360
But Minister Chu lost his beloved daughter

406
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,030
and has been on sick leave for days.

407
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,510
Miss Gong can't go unpunished.

408
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,510
The Minister of Justice will decide.

409
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,510
Mr. Lan, you also contributed
to the investigation of the case.

411
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,440
Your Majesty.

412
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,750
I just did what I could.

413
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,310
I don't know much about the details.

414
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,790
Mr. Wang did most of the work.

415
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,230
Even the Minister of Rites could do their part.

416
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,230
But the Court of Judicial Review did little.

417
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,600
I am

418
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,840
guilty.

419
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,600
This case caused a sensation.

420
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
Aren't you ashamed?

421
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,510
Your Majesty.

422
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
It's not the fault of Mr. Tao.

423
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,550
The murderer was crafty.

424
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,440
Mr. Tao's hands were tied.

425
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,680
That's why I acted without authorization.

426
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,990
How is it that you're defending him?

427
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,880
Your Majesty.

428
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,200
I saw Mr. Tao

429
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,360
write Brochure of the Persuasion for Goodness

430
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,790
and educate criminals with his subordinates.

431
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,600
He's so dedicated to his work.

432
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,470
All right.

433
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,200
Find a way to redeem the reputation

434
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
of your court, Mr. Tao.

435
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

436
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,200
His Majesty said

437
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
he was tired from the hunt yesterday.

438
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,640
The emperor feels ill

439
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,270
and won't come to hold court.

440
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,990
You can report your official business.

441
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,400
Your Majesty.

442
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,510
Xuan Ji, Chief of Imperial Astronomy,
has something to report.

443
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,600
Speak.

444
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,550
Your Majesty.

445
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,200
Hunxiang Instrument is under construction.

446
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,600
But how to build its top

447
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,030
has been pending for long.

448
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,120
I thought about it all day,

449
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,990
hoping to share the burden
of you and His Majesty.

450
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,160
Finally, a few days ago,

451
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,840
I found two rubies as big as a watermelon

452
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,640
under the plum tree on Zilang Mountain.

453
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,640
They are extremely rare.

454
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,920
It seems to be an act of providence.

455
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,200
Therefore,

456
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,360
I have hundreds of skilled craftsmen

457
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,120
carve them and cover with gold threads

458
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,840
to put it atop Hunxiang Instrument.

459
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,070
Your Majesty, please appreciate it.

460
