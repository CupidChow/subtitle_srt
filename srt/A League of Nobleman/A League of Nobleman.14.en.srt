00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,390
Mr. Lan,

2
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,390
have some porridge at least.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,390
Your stomach would feel better.

4
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,760
Mr. Lan,

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,640
you had nothing to eat the whole day.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,150
Your body couldn't handle that.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,350
I have no appetite.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,390
Take it away.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,070
Peizhi.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,560
Mowen.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Having a stomachache again?

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,070
When I'm home on sick leave,

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,320
how's everything in the court?

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,350
Her Majesty is

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
holding her temper.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,960
But the courtiers all know

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,590
that she failed to topple Mr. Liu

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,950
but lost Xuan Ji unexpectedly

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,870
and she's being really upset.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,200
In the phoenix head's case,

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,920
I first offended Her Majesty,

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,760
and took advantage of His Majesty.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,710
I'm afraid I can't be

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,710
the Minister of Rites.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,310
Nor can I go to Nandong as an envoy.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,070
In Moluo Village's case,

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,950
all insiders are dead.

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,120
Only the whistle can be kind of a clue.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,150
But it's too far away.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,760
All ways to vindicate my father

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,870
have failed.

32
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,760
Peizhi,

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,590
be patient.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,560
Let's take our time for a solution.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,510
Take our time?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,070
I don't know how long it has to take.

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,000
Sir!

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,520
Sir, I'm back!

39
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,190
What have you got?

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,870
Sir.

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,120
Following the marks on the map,

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,310
I went near Moluo Village

43
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,590
but couldn't find it.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,560
The village is said

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,750
to be in a secret location
deep in the mountain.

46
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,630
Only one or two old guides knew the way.

47
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,150
But 20 years later,

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,910
they've been dead.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,710
What...

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,630
What about the whistle?

51
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,590
Only some old guys found it familiar.

52
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,030
But none of them

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,280
could remember the detail.

54
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,870
Is this a dead end, too?

55
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm sorry, sir.

56
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,120

but to vindicate you.

70
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,960
For this,

71
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,400
I did many things against my will.

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Funnily, after 20 years of effort,

73
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,080
I still failed to vindicate you.

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
If I always have to fail,

75
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,080
what's the point of my life?

76
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,230
There's a point.

77

As long as you live,

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,160
there's hope.

These days,

I've been thinking of the secret buyer.

81
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,160
Then I checked Chang Wei's house again.

82
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,160
I found no clue, though.

83
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,960
Let's think of another way.

84
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,520
All ways have failed.

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,040
Continue the investigation

86
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,640
and we will find something.

87
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,430
Mr. Lan,

88
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,910
I haven't figured out

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,670
what on earth happened that year.

90
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,470
And I'm not sure
whether you were good or evil.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,280
But I'll try my best
to find out the truth.

92

Who's knocking so early?

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Zhang Ping?

94
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,990
What for?

95
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,600
To take care of Mr. Lan's stomach.

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,640
We've got a doctor.

97

You're not needed.

98
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,870
The doctor uses medicine
while I use food.

99
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Yeah. We've brought the ingredients.

He cooks perfectly.

105

Write it down.

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,870
He ate very little.

107
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,080
No dishes.

108
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,960
A mouthful of porridge.

I don't know what he's busy with lately.

to bring you the haw jelly,

119
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,160
he went back to his room.

must we buy
such expensive herbs for Mr. Lan?

Mr. Lan saved my life many times.

131

I can't be stingy.

I must repay him.

133

I haven't got a discount yet.

173
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,910
Please decoct it for us.

174
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,310
Two more pennies?

175
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,280
Zhang,

176
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,480
we can decoct it back home.

177
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,880
Just save as much as possible.

178
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,830
I saw that prescription before.

179
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,360
It's special for Xuan Ji's disease.

180
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,160
But Xuan Ji is dead.

181
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,550
Who would still use this prescription?

182
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,760
Well, it sounds really weird.

183
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,160
- There you are.
- Is everything ready?

184
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,550
Yes.

185
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,310
All right.

186
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,880
Here.

187
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,760
I should go.

188
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,520
See you.

189
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,190
He's Xuan Ji's servant.

190
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,710
Right, right.

191
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,190
Put the valuable luggage in that cart.

192
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,760
That one.

193
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,400
All right.

194
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,070
Tie it tightly

195
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,640
in case it falls. Do you hear?

196
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,280
Yes.

197
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,040
Are they leaving the Capital City?

198
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,760
Go inform Mr. Lan.

199
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,400
All right.

200
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,000
Here. Give it to me.

201
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,880
Be careful.

202
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,400
Careful with that.

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,070
Chen Chou told me about it.

204
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
So, you're suspecting

205
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,240
Xuan Ji faked his death
to leave the Capital City?

206
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,760
Yes.

207
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,190
Xuan Ji is dead for only one week,

208
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,360
but his servants are packing already.

209
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,190
Really weird.

210
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
We must check it out immediately.

211
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Otherwise, if they leave,

212
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
we would get no clue.

213
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,070
But if we investigate openly,

214
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,360
we'll alert them, right?

215
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,710
When I heard about Mr. Xuan's death,

216
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I didn't have time to pay my respects.

217
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,280
Today, I brought some presents

218
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,480
as compensation.

219
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,190
It's so nice of you, Mr. Lan.

220
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,000
Thank you, on behalf of my dead master.

221
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,550
Two more boxes.

222
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,160
Why have you hired so many porters?

223
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,040
Here's the thing.

224
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,790
Our master's last wish

225
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,640
was to return to his hometown
after he died.

226
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,310
So,

227
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,830
we'll carry his coffin
to his hometown for the burial.

228
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,400
Get to your business.

229
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,910
I'll wait here.

230
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,280
Pardon me, then.

231
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,190
I'll be right back.

232
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,240
Butler.

233
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,280
What's up?

234
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,950
I'm the clerk from the pharmacy.

235
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,190
In the drug you took away,

236
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,790
some poisonous aconite
was mistakenly used.

237
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,670
What?

238
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,120
You...

239
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,070
How could you make
such a terrible mistake?

240
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,040
- I...
- You wait here.

241
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,190
Butler delivered the drug
to the secret chamber.

242
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,400
Xuan Ji must be hiding in it.

243
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,240
This is the mechanism
to open the chamber, I guess.

244
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,880
"Fire" is in the south

245
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,630
with "Wind" and "Earth" on both sides.

246
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,708
(Heaven, Lake, Thunder, Fire)
But the positions are wrong now.

247
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:06,680
(Earth, Mountain, Water, Wind)
But the positions are wrong now.

248
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,440
If we put them in the right positions,

249
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,200
can we open the chamber?

250
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,350
Try it and we'll know.

251
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
The cabinets are set with crossbows.

252
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,110
If we turn the wrong way again,

253
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,590
they'll keep shooting, I'm afraid.

254
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,240
The out ring is fixed

255
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,480
and can't be turned.

256
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,390
I turned the inner ring first

257
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,720
but it was wrong.

258
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,350
Must we

259
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,440
turn the center ring?

260
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
You have to try again.

261
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,550
Be very careful.

262
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,240
Mr. Lan.

263
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,440
Here.

264
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Take it.

265
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,680
Just be careful.

266
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,500
(Heaven, Lake, Thunder, Fire,
Earth, Mountain, Water, Wind)

267
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,040
Xuan Ji.

268
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,390
I had His Majesty informed

269
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,830
that you faked your death

270
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,590
and is hiding in the secret chamber.

271
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,350
How much longer can you still hide?

272
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,040
Want to kill me?

273
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,280
Not that easy.

274
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,520
Go to hell!

275
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,920
Why?

276
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,550
We're not enemies.

277
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,280
Don't be scared, Mr. Xuan.

278
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,280
I didn't come to catch you,

279
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,520
but to ask you

280
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,000
about Moluo Village.

281
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,680
Moluo Village?

282
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,350
What is that?

283
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,440
Don't know what you're talking about.

284
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,480
At Chang Wei's house,

285
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,830
we found the letter you wrote.

286
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,480
You summoned him to the South.

287
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,480
He set out on the same day

288
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,110
Mr. Lan's father visited Moluo Village.

289
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,790
How is this village involved

290
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,760
in my father's case?

291
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,280
There's no way out for you.

292
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,790
If you confess,

293
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,200
maybe I'll consider helping you.

294
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,390
Fine, then.

295
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,630
I took my men

296
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,630
to kill all villagers in Moluo Village.

297
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Because they were spies
from Nandong Kingdom

298
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,480
and colluded with
your father for treason.

299
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,790
My father was upright and loyal.

300
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
He would never do anything like that.

301
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
But he disclosed our military intel

302
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,040
so that our troops were annihilated.

303
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
It's true, isn't it?

304
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,390
Think carefully.

305
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,350
What I want is the truth.

306
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,480
Tell me about it now,

307
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,310
or tell His Majesty about it!

308
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,350
Your father

309
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,920
was indeed framed.

310
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,350
Moluo Clansmen were vicious

311
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,040
and they could do witchcraft.

312
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,550
They deceived your father to the South

313
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,960
and got intel from him with witchcraft.

314
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,720
Your father felt something wrong

315
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,760
and wrote to me for help.

316
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,790
Because I was in charge
of the Department of Incantation

317
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,680
and I ruled some excellent wizards

318
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,280
who could deal with Moluo Clan.

319
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,520
Upon receiving your father's letter,

320
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,630
I took my men to Moluo Village

321
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,390
and killed all the villagers!

322
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,590
Unfortunately, I was still late.

323
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,310
The intel had been delivered.

324
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,720
And our troops were slaughtered.

325
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,350
So,

326
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,870
your father

327
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,350
was charged with treason.

328
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,070
Did they send a woman

329
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
to get my father?

330
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,760
Yes.

331
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,040
The witch from Moluo Clan.

332
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,870
It's her.

333
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,390
It's indeed her.

334
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,000
Go.

335
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,480
Tell everything to His Majesty

336
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,480
and Her Majesty!

337
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,350
I can't go!

338
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,150
You promised me.

339
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,920
Be patient, Mr. Lin.

340
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,240
His confession is suspicious.

341
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,110
If Moluo Clansmen were spies
from Nandong Kingdom,

342
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,070
you could have exterminated them

343
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,280
with the right reason.

344
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,590
But why did you disguise it

345
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,550
as the divine retribution?

346
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,350
I...

347
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,720
Confess!

348
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,150
Fine.

349
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,630
What I just said is true.

350
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,870
But the disclosure of intel

351
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,310
had something to do with me.

352
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,830
- With you?
- With you?

353
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
20 years ago,

354
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,630
I was the one who recruited the witch

355
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,040
to the Department of Incantation.

356
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,920
In case the court found it out

357
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,830
and punished you,

358
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,240
you massacred Moluo Village, right?

359
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,760
Yes.

360
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,580
(Moluo Village, Lingnan District)

361
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,310
This is Moluo Village?

362
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,390
I'll count on you, then.

363
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,150
I recruited two wizards.

364
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,070
One was good at making poison.

365
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,920
He could make some red powder
that was instantly lethal.

366
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,590
The other was Chang Wei.

367
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,240
He was unmatched in making sky lanterns.

368
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,550
To disguise the massacre
as the divine retribution,

369
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,150
I put a lot of gunpowder

370
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,830
and red poisonous power

371
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,680
in the sky lantern.

372
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,550
Then I made the lanterns fly
above Moluo Village

373
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,280
with the help of the wind.

374
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,070
When the fuel was burned to a level,

375
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,830
gunpowder would be triggered

376
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,960
and the sky lantern would explode.

377
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,680
The scarlet mist hung over.

378
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,200
Then, you wanted to kill them, too.

379
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,150
So, Chang Wei and Embalmer

380
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,110
lived behind false identities for years.

381
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,280
I had to keep myself alive!

382
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,680
Chang Wei often went to
the site of the Immortal Instrument.

383
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,960
Haven't you ever seen him?

384
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,830
I have heart palpitation.

385
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
So, I've never been up there.

386
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,830
If you hadn't come to me,

387
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,480
I would still not know

388
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,310
what it had to do with Chang Wei.

389
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,200
I thought it was a perfect chance

390
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,070
to help Her Majesty topple Mr. Liu.

391
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,110
A secret buyer asked Chang Wei
to steal the phoenix head.

392
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,790
Do you not know him, too?

393
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,310
Someone asked Chang Wei to steal it?

394
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,590
Is it him?

395
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,480
The survivor of Moluo Village.

396
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,200
Is he back for revenge?

397
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,550
It must be him.

398
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,350
He's back for revenge.

399
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,200
There's a survivor?

400
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,000
Hiding in the shadow,

401
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,480
he did witchcraft.

402
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,110
The entire Sacred Lake

403
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,040
was bubbling.

404
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,110
It was witchcraft.

405
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,200
