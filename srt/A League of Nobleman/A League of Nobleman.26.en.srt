A plague?

Mr. Lan.

208
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,040
I've found out the truth.

209
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,240
Gu Qingzhang

210
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,710
is the real prince.

211
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,950
30 years ago,

212
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,670
he was switched
at the Resurrection Array.

213
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,480
I know.

214
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,310
He told me himself

215
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,520
and admitted

216
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,120
that he is Mr. Jinghu.

217
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,070
Why did he admit it?

218
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,950
Now

219
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,480
he's a doctor in the palace

220
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,670
and he plans to cause chaos

221
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,830
at the Immortal Instrument Ceremony.

222
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,280
He also invited me to join him

223
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,880
in taking revenge
on the Empress Dowager.

224
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,070
Did you

225
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,520
say yes to him?

226
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,520
The Empress Dowager's crimes
were too numerous to record.

227
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,120
We could never forgive her.

228
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,670
But Shulin is like gunpowder.

229
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,590
He is desperate for revenge

230
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,480
and has no regard
for the lives of innocent people.

231
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,240
If he triggers a convulsion
at the ceremony,

232
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,160
the consequences would range from

233
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,790
causing turmoil
in the central government

234
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,880
to chaos throughout the world.

235
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,160
What should we

236
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,070
do next?

will be held soon.)

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,160

made a big gesture this time)

valuable night-blooming cereus.)

(at the ceremony.)

246
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,960
I see.

247
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,150
What I saw

248
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,310
should be a flower convoy.

249
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,280
Move!

250
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,310
Get out of the way!

251

Hey!

252
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,150
What are you looking at?

253
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,110
You don't deserve to see
the Empress Dowager's flower convoy.

254
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:19,920
Get lost.

255
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,720
Shulin only told me that
he would run riot

256

at the Immortal Instrument Ceremony

257

at the Immortal Instrument Ceremony

261
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,240

from the top of power.

(But he doesn't trust me.)

264
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,520
He didn't mention anything
about his plan.

265
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,790
He has been planning for years

266

just to make the Empress Dowager
fall from the top of power.

when she finds out everything,

277
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,630
she will kill us

278
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,310
and continue to cover her crimes.

279
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,040
But if that's the case,

280
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,070
there will be no chance

281

to clear your father's name

282

and my clansmen's names.

283
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,680
We must choose
between the lesser of two evils.

284
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,680
We have to solve the gunpowder first

285
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,240
to stabilize the situation.

286
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,760
If we're lucky enough to live
until the return of the Emperor,

287

we'll find a way

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,790
when we drank and talked together?

340
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,480
Peizhi,

341
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,070
you can speak freely.

342
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,680
There's something
I've always wanted to know.

343
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,960
Did you drink

344
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,870
the poisoned wine for me ten years ago?

345
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,960
I did drink the poisoned wine.

346
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,590
That was when I just learned

347
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,870
the person who wanted to kill me

348
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,550
was my own mother.

349
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,720
I felt hopeless

350
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,150
and tired of earthly life.

351
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,350
To my shame, I thought
you were just playing around

352
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,590
and didn't care about the exam.

353
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,150
I didn't know

354
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,960
you were suffering so much.

355
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,440
Maybe it was providence

356
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,760
that I managed to survive.

357
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,720
But from that moment on,

358
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,520
I've been only living for revenge.

359
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,200
Gu Qingzhang

360
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,790
is your son who you tried to kill

361
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,000
back then,

362
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,070
(but he didn't die.)

363
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,440
(He is lurking by your side)

364
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,680
(and waiting to take revenge on you.)

367
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,200
(Why haven't you gone to apply medicine
to the Empress Dowager?)

368
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,240
I wrote this after you left

369
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,830
without saying goodbye.

370
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,040
I've been waiting for a chance
to give it to you.

371
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,760
Parting at death is so painful
that groaning is hard to hush.

372
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,920
Parting in life, on the other hand,
is always devastating.

373
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,520
My old friend...

374
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,920
My old friend came into my dream,

375
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,240
likely in knowing I always think of him.

376
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,000
Shulin.

377
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,390
I want to take revenge with you.

378
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,480
Don't worry, Peizhi.

379
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,790
After the Immortal Instrument Ceremony,

380
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,870
your father's name will be cleared.

381
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,070
I know you have planned well.

382
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,440
What can I do?

everything.

389

Please stop Gu Qingzhang first.

Kuruo.

You're back.

392
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,390
Is our home still the same?

393
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,960
Has the water of the Sacred Lake

394
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,720
dried up?

395
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,040
Is there any fruit hanging from

396
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,520
the apricot trees on the back hill?

397
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,790
When I was a kid,

398
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,790
I got toothache because of it

399
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,240
and I couldn't eat for days.

400
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,440
Are the bookmarks

401
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,350
made of a sacred branch
still on the table?

402
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,440
Your mother made them for me.

403
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,630
You hadn't learned how to talk
at that time.

404
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,830
While she was using wax
to create the image,

405
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,070
you were messing around.

406
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,920
I didn't take those bookmarks with me

407
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,480
cause I didn't want them
to be stained by the filth outside.

408
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,310
It was

409
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,960
still the same as before.

410
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,150
No.

411
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
It was frozen in that moment.

412
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,790
Our clansmen are all dead.

413
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,070
It's all because the Empress Dowager

414
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,920
thirsted for power so much

415
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,440
that she would kill her own
flesh and blood

416
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,630
and wipe out the paradise.

417
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,150
Now

418
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,040
I will make everything
she worked so hard for

419
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,960
fall apart in front of her.

420
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,830
Kuruo.

421
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,680
When the time comes,

422
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,590
you'll stand beside me

423
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,000
and we'll watch the initiator of evil

424
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,590
receive the most severe punishment.

425
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,280
No.

426
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,390
I will never be on your side.

427
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,200
Don't you want to
take revenge for your mother

428
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,040
and your clansmen?

429
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,440
Do you know

430
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,070
that would only create more misery?

431
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,960
Misery?

432
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,480
You had such a good mother

433
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,720
and met such a good master.

434
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,390
You lived a carefree life
for many years.

435
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,200
Do you even know what misery is?

436
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,310
Do you know how I
have survived all these years?

437
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,480
(I used to like to read on the hill
behind the Sacred Lake.)

438
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,150
(I was tired from reading that day)

439
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,200
(and fell asleep on the hill.)

440
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
(Suddenly I was awakened
by a loud noise,)

441
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,590
(and I saw a scarlet mist
over the village.)

442
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,870
(I was confused
and rushed back to the village,)

443
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,520
(but what I saw was)

444
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,240
(the dead bodies of all the villagers.)

445
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,350
Sir, over here!

446
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,070
Find him.

447
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Don't miss a single hair.

448
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,590
Sir, how can we find him?

449
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,630
Look for a boy

450
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,830
about ten years old

451
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,310
with a night-blooming
cereus headdress.

452
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,630
Search.

453
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,480
(When I heard they were looking for
the night-blooming cereus headdress,)

454
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,830
(I realized)

455
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,280
(that they came to kill me.)

456
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,960
(Fortunately, I had
the clan whistle with me,)

457
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,200
(so I blew the whistle
as hard as I could)

458
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,240
(to make the water of the Sacred Lake
vibrate and boil)

459
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,550
(as it was during the ceremony.)

460
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
What's happening?

461
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,040
Sir.

462
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,720
It's witchcraft.

463
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,760
It's witchcraft!

464
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,720
Run!

465
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,280
Run!

466
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
(I scared them away with a trick,)

467
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,280
(but I was afraid they wouldn't give up)

468
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,760
(if they couldn't find my body.)

469
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,960
(I had to sneak back to the village)

470
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,870
(and hid the night-blooming
cereus headdress)

471
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,040
(on the body of a dead boy
of my same age.)

472
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,200
(Then I lived on my own.)

473
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,390
Over the last ten years,

474
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,440
I've been through thick and thin

475
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,870
and suffered scorn and ridicule.

476
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,550
I returned to the capital at all costs

477
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,440
only to find out the one

478
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,920
who wanted me dead is my own mother.

479
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,350
Well,

480
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,040
she brought me to this world,

481
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,350
but why did she send me

482
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,790
to the infernal hell?

483
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,630
If she hadn't given birth to me,

484
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,240
if your mother hadn't saved me,

485
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,390
if I had died quietly

486
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,000
in the scarlet mist,

487
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,000
or if the poisoned wine

488
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,680
for Peizhi had no antidote,

489
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,630
then my life

490
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,280
would have been considered lucky.

491
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:05,870
That's why

492
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,680
you should stop.

493
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,630
Then you won't suffer anymore.

494
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,630
Now you've known everything.

495
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,710
Can't you still

496
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,110
feel my pain?

497
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,670
No.

498
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,800
You can't feel it.

499
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,960
Maybe if you had come back
ten days earlier,

500
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,630
you would have seen your master's body

501
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
hanging from the gate tower.

502
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,400
That would have been the last time
you see him

503
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,230
and your last chance
to fulfill your filial duty.

504
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,800
Kill her.

505
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,590
Not only to avenge the deaths
of your mother and your clansmen,

506
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,960
but also the death of your master.

507
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,590
No.

508
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,040
I can feel your pain.

509
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,880
Your hatred.

510
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,320
But

511
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,880
pain can't be healed with pain,

512
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,800
and hatred

513
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,360
can't be healed with hatred.

514
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,070
Her Majesty has known everything.

515
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,190
It's over now.

516
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,360
Is it?

517
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,040
Didn't I tell you
to take good care of Mr. Lan?

518
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,670
It's good that you're here.

519
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,800
Her Majesty has been killed.

520
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,630
You saw

521
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,230
who did it.

522
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,360
Mr. Lan.

523
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,880
Guards!

524
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,270
Zhang Ping assassinated
the Empress Dowager.

525
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,110
Take him down!
