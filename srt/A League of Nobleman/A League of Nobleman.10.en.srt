1
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,000
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,120
I have something to say.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,000
What is it?

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,510
Your Majesty,

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,120
Hunxiang Instrument is under construction,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,510
but the shape of its top

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,920
remains to be determined.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,000
I have been working around the clock,

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,000
hoping to relieve Emperor and your worries.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,070
Finally, a few days ago,

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,670
I found two rubies the size of a melon

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,600
under a plum tree in Zilang Mountain.

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,520
They're rarely seen in the world.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,840
It seems to be providence.

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,110
Therefore,

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,280
I asked hundreds of skillful craftsmen to weave

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,000
an auspicious golden treasure with them.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,710
It can be placed on Hunxiang Instrument's top.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,920
It's now presented for you to take a look.

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,710
Your Majesty,

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,840
in my opinion,

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,640
it's against the rites system to place

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,510
a golden phoenix instead of a golden dragon

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,920
since Emperor is the supreme ruler.

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,150
Mr. Liu, I disagree with you.

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,510
You may not know that

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,950
Empress Dowager was born in a plum forest.

28
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,840
These two rubies

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,950
happened to be discovered under a plum tree.

30
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,710
Zilang Mountain looks like a female figure,

31
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,870
even showing the shape of hands and feet.

32
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a rarely seen phoenix nest.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,710
I think

34
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,350
Hunxiang Instrument

35
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,640
can be named Immortal Instrument.

36
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,800
It symbolizes

37
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,310
not only the continuity of our kingdom

38
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,150
but also Empress Dowager's

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,960
virtues and longevity.

40
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,960
Such being the case,

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,470
it will be in your charge.

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,000
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
As you wish.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,520
It's absolutely not right.

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,030
That's all for today.

46
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,470
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,280
This is unprecedented.

48
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,190
Please strictly observe the rites system.

52
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,320
Xuan Ji surprised me.

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,640
He can read Empress Dowager's mind.

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,040
Simply being an alchemist

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
wouldn't make him favored by Empress Dowager.

56
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,150
Excuse me, Mr. Lan.

57
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,200
Mr. Liu, what can I do for you?

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Emperor is not yet in power

59
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,080
and it's the weak time of his reign.

60
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,240
Xuan Ji presented the Phoenix Head today.

61
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,320
Empress Dowager must have known it in advance

62
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,990
and was simply coordinating with him.

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,150
Well…

64
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,560
Minister Gong has resigned.

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,590
You're in charge of the Ministry of Rites.

66
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,710
Just now in the Hall, you should

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,910
stand out against it in the name of rites.

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,390
I…

69
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,150
Mr. Lan.

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,200
Mr. Wang.

71
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,030
We have to submit the embalmer's case file.

72
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,470
We got to take a statement right away.

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,910
Mr. Liu,

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,270
it's important.

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,030
Please excuse us.

76
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,910
You…

Zhang.

Zhang.

Zhang.

80
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,910
Zhang,

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,790
I've been looking for you.

82
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,560
What do you want to do with reed leaves?

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,270
Wrap zongzi (glutinous rice dumpling).

84
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

85
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,390
I can help you.

86
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,390
Choose fresh and large leaves,

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,390
preferably 16 inches.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,830
For the two of us,

89
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,790
is it necessary to be so picky?

90
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,390
You know what?

91
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,680
When you're away in the last few days,

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,080
the noddle stall was almost overwhelmed.

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,960
Since you solved the big case

94
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,270
and won the fame of Detective Mr. Wang,

95
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,830
many people have been attracted here,

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,080
just like a school of carps.

97
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,830
You used the wrong words.

98
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,910
Whatever.

99
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
I've come up with a title for you.

100
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,790
From now on,

101
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,520
you'll be the capital city's

102
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,350
Detective Noodle.

103
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,270
Zhang,

104
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,000
did you hear me?

105
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,270
I'm thinking about the case in Moluo Village.

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,230
How could there be

107
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,150
the blood-mist effect?

108
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,590
What happened

109
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
to make the night sky as bright as day?

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,710
I've talked to a wall.

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,790
Besides,

112
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,680
who told the embalmer

113
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,440
about the legend of Injeeten?

114
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,230
Why did he do it?

115
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,270
How did the embalmer know Mr. Lan's father?

116
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,080
What's the connection

117
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,640
with the treason case 20 years ago?

118
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,640
We've got rid of that fuddy-duddy.

119
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,080
He

120
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,000
just wants you to bear the brunt.

121
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,320
But thanks to Mr. Liu,

122
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,640
the court is not completely
under Empress Dowager's control.

123
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,520
You mean

124
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,030
I shouldn't interrupt you.

125
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,880
Without you,

126
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,640
I could handle him by beating around the bush.

127
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,880
I didn't expect you to help me out

128
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,760
and owe you a favor.

129
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,880
Anyway,

130
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
what's done is done.

131
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,080
You owe me a favor now.

132
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,760
Mr. Wang,

133
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,790
Mr. Lan,

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,230
thank you both

135
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,790
for speaking for me in the hall.

136
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,520
Well,

137
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,790
Mr. Lan is the one you should thank.

138
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,440
I did it at his repeated request.

139
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,270
We're colleagues and should help each other.

140
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Maybe someday,

141
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,390
I'll need your help too.

142
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,200
I get it.

143
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,350
I'll surely return the favor.

144
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,470
When will you return the my favor?

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,350
I won't return it since I owe you a lot.

146
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,880
Speaking of

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
the bet you lost to Zhang Ping,

148
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,150
when are you going to fulfill your promise?

149
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,000
He is waiting for you

150
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,030
to help him make doughs.

151
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,470
If you're not mentioning it,

152
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,830
I'd forgotten it.

153
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,990
Detective Noodle.

154
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,920
Dear folks,

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,280
let me formally introduce someone to you.

156
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,110
This is

157
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,400
Detective Noodle

158
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,960
Zhang Ping, a scholar from Xichuan County.

159
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,400
So he is Zhang Ping.

160
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,280
Detective Noodle?

161
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,350
I came up with the name for you overnight.

162
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,040
What do you think?

163
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,960
Isn't it good?

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,870
Detective.

165
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,560
Detective.

166
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,280
Come on.

167
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,080
I learned that the embalmer went in and out

168
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,040
through a tunnel to commit a murder

169
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,590
and disappeared without a trace.

170
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
How did you catch him?

171
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,800
Moreover,

172
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,320
what about the poison?

173
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,710
Detective,

174
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,040
my nephew couldn't find his bamboo horse.

175
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,320
Can you help him find it?

176
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,440
Can you help me find my colander?

177
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Calm down.

178
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,160
Just take a seat, order one bowl of noodles

179
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,160
and then tell your stories slowly.

180
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,280
We will answer your questions one by one.

181
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,630
Everyone has a chance.

182
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,320
Come on.

183
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,440
- One large bowl of noodles.
- One large bowl of noodles.

184
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,280
Add one more egg.

185
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,750
I'd like one bowl of noodles.

186
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,230
You must be happy.

187
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,040
Mr. Wang.

188
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,470
The two detectives

189
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,040
must have something important to discuss.

190
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
We'll come again later, later.

191
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,870
Don't go.

192
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,830
Wait, wait.

193
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
I lost the bet.

194
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,470
I made this

195
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,870
for making good on my promise.

196
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,200
Hot wonton.

197
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,590
(Hanhui Pavilion, Ning'an)//Would you like one bowl of wonton?

198
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,870
Would you like some? Meat stuffing.

199
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,440
(Detective Noodle)

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,830
What did Mr. Wang come here for?

201
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,230
He scared all the guests away.

202
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,870
Mr. Wang

203
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,710
did make a dough personally.

204
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm really surprised.

205
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,920
It's not easy for Mowen.

206
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,750
Mr. Lan.

207
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,320
Mr. Lan,

208
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,830
please.

209
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,040
Mr. Lan,

210
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,230
this long gown is plain in color,

211
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,710
looking really nice with the white jade.

212
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,870
Mr. Lan,

213
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,560
they're perfectly matched.

214
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,920
To be honest,

215
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm here today

216
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,990
to ask you a favor.

217
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,080
This is the Red Gilding Silk

218
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,510
from Yunshang Community

219
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,510
Yes.

220
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,280
Empress Dowager

221
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,320
wants a dress made of this fabric.

222
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
Unfortunately, Miss Wu was murdered

223
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,870
before finishing it.

224
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,440
As the Minister of Rites,

225
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm responsible for this.

226
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,510
Mr. Xu, would you please help me

227
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,400
study this?

228
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,830
Red Gilding Silk

229
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,590
is the culmination of weaving technique.

230
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,040
It's Miss Wu's secret craftmanship.

231
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,230
I've always wanted to figure it out.

232
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
I'll surely

233
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,870
try my best in this.

234
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,960
Then,

235
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,110
my future career is counting on you.

236
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,080
I feel almost back-breaking.

237
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,750
It would kill me

238
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,920
if we didn't close earlier today.

239
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,510
Okay.

240
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,960
Okay, okay.

241
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,870
Zhang,

242
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,990
are you going to wrap zongzi now?

243
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,750
Why are you suddenly so generous?

244
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,560
You kept nagging me

245
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,630
for stealing one of your salted duck eggs.

246
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,830
It's great that

247
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,630
we'll have zongzi stuffed with egg yolk.

248
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,160
I'm looking forward to a good meal tomorrow.

249
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,960
Zhang?

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,750
Zhang?

251
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,870
Where is he so early in the morning?

252
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,830
He left me some zongzi.

253
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,990
All stuffed with red dates?

254
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,960
Zhang, where are those with egg yolk?

255
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,510
Come on, come on, everyone.

256
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,960
Please go back. Please go back.

257
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,960
Mr. Lan doesn't take gifts.

258
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,350
No gifts.

259
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,630
Why are there so many people there?

260
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,280
Stop.

261
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,990
Listen to me, listen to me, just listen to me.

262
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,040
Please go back.

263
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,350
Mr. Lan is not home today.

264
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
It's no use waiting here.

265
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,040
Mr. Lan doesn't take gifts.

266
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,560
Please go back. Please go back.

267
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,230
It's Mr. Lan.

268
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,160
Mr. Lan,

269
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,630
I'm bringing you some egg yolk zongzi.

270
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
Mr. Lan is over there.

271
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,510
Mr. Lan is over there.

272
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,990
Mr. Lan.

273
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,080
Mr. Lan.

274
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,920
Mr. Lan.

275
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,680
Hurry up.

276
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,590
Come on.

277
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,630
- Mr. Lan.//- Mr. Lan.

278
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,470
I'm Li Jing from Shunhua Cunty, Qing Prefecture.

279
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,590
I'm slow-witted

280
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,680
and there's a lot in the ancient books

281
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,510
that I don't quite understand.

282
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,230
Would you please give me some advice?

283
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,990
It's painted by Mr. Yan.

284
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,960
It's very expensive.

285
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,080
You must pay a lot for this.

286
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,830
It's just a token of my respect.

287
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,200
Please take it.

288
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,470
Mr. Lan,

289
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,680
this is mine.

290
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,990
A century-old ginseng.

291
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Excuse me,

292
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,280
what is it in your hand?

293
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,830
It's the egg yolk zongzi I made.

294
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,400
It's delicious. You may have a taste.

295
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,870
Egg yolk zongzi.

296
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,110
Can you open it and show me?

297
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,750
It's really zongzi.

298
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,920
It's too worthless.

299
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,280
I would never give this as a gift.

300
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,120
Speaking of sincerity,

301
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
the zongzi shows more of his sincerity.

302
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,680
But no matter how expensive your gifts are,

303
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,840
I can't accept them.

304
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,070
I appreciate your kindness.

305
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,120
I hope you could keep studying

306
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,070
and go back

307
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,640
to bury yourselves in your studies.

308
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,030
- Mr. Lan.//- Mr. Lan.

309
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,400
Why is he leaving?

310
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,680
I spent so much money,
but he didn't even take a look at it.

311
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,990
Zhang,

312
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,880
let's sell zongzi instead.

313
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,120
It'll be surely more profitable.

314
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,360
By the way,

315
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm just back from Xingye Community.

316
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,440
I saw a "help wanted" notice
at the entrance of the Court of Judicial Review.

317
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,680
According to the notice,

318
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,270
they're recruiting some new men

319
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,550
due to Empress Dowager's dissatisfaction.

320
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,400
What are the requirements?

321
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,640
Do I meet them?

322
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,200
Yes, you do.

323
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,230
But

324
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,640
they only want helpers.

325
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm okay with that.

326
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,790
Zhang,

327
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,360
I don't mean to discourage you.

328
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,030
You can't get

329
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,640
even such a job

330
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,790
without a connection.

331
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,550
Well,

332
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,230
I have an idea.

333
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,640
But you may not be willing to do it.

334
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
What is it?

335
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,920
If you can get Mr. Lan's help,

336
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,960
the result would be different.

337
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,160
Well,

338
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,960
Mr. Lan has saved you several times.

339
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,920
You may go thank him with a gift

340
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,230
and mention this to him.

341
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,600
I went to see him,

342
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,200
but he doesn't take gifts.

343
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,510
What?

344
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,160
You already went to see him with a gift?

345
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,750
And voluntarily?

346
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,640
Then tell me

347
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,750
what did you give him?

348
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,550
And how did you give it?

349
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,790
I just gave…

350
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,510
Zhang Ping.

351
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,470
Mr. Lan,

352
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,230
what are you doing here?

353
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,640
Where is the zongzi for me?

354
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,750
Then I'd like one bowl of noodles.

355
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,070
No more noodles.

356
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,680
There's only millet congee.

357
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,550
Millet congee will be fine.

358
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,510
Salted egg white.

359
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,270
It's the leftover.

360
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,680
Mr. Lan,

361
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,710
Zhang means

362
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,550
you came late and there's no more zongzi.

363
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
There's only some egg white left.

364
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,880
He'll make some zongzi for you another day.

365
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
It's egg white,

366
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,120
but it tastes fresh and tender.

367
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,030
I used sheld duck eggs

368
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,470
and pickled them with Xinfeng Wine

369
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,750
and fine salt.

370
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,510
I didn't eat the zongzi, but thank you anyway.

371
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,120
I should thank you too.

372
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,470
Mr. Lan,

373
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,640
actually,

374
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
I've been meaning to ask you a favor.

375
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,710
What is it?

376
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,160
We'd better talk about it in your place.

377
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,880
OK.

378
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,160
Chen Chou, you clean this up.

379
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,790
Dear me,

380
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,960
Zhang has finally got it.

381
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,880
I want to use Water Illusion on you.

382
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,550
What did you say?

383
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,960
I want to use Water Illusion on you.

384
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,160
Why do you offer to do it this time?

385
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,120
After learning about what happened
in Moluo Village,

386
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,990
I've been thinking

387
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,710
what caused the scarlet mist sky.

388
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,160
And this case involves your father.

389
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,360
So, I want to find the truth.

390
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,920
Zhang Ping,

391
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,680
do you know the accusation against my father?

392
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
It's collision with the enemy.

393
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,200
That's a disgrace to the imperial court.

394
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
The subject has been a taboo
over the past 20 years.

395
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,750
Not to mention an investigation,

396
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,750
even asking about it

397
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,120
would cost your life.

398
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,440
I've thought it over

399
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,550
and I'm well prepared.

400
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,030
I won't tell anyone about it.

401
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,750
But you'll fall into a long comatose state

402
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,160
after casting a spell.

403
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
Aren't you afraid of losing your life?

404
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,880
I've been used to it.

405
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,440
I'll be fine after a sleep.

406
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
Then let me be straight with you.

407
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,160
What I'm really worried about

408
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,680
is your straight temper

409
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,790
You're reckless while looking into a case,

410
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,070
which may ruin what I've planned for years.

411
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,680
Then,

412
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,710
everyone in the know will die.

413
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,310
I give you my word and I won't break it.

414
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,680
The divine punishment for Moluo People,
the embalmer's poison,

415
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,200
the man who instructed him
to sacrifice to Six Sages

416
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,230
and your father's case

417
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,790
might all be correlated.

418
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,920
Therefore,

419
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
I want to find out the truth.

420
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,120
But what does these have to do with you?

421
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,360
If everyone cares about the truth,

422
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,960
there would be nowhere to hide for darkness.

423
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,070
That's what Mr. Mu Yesheng said.

424
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
I grew up

425
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,310
reading his detective stories.

426
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,030
OK.

427
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,600
You may do it.

428
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Under a spell,

429
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,440
I would let down all my defenses, right?

430
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,360
Right.

431
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
You would

432
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,840
have no doubts,

433
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,120
no secrets

434
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,640
and feel no pain.

435
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,790
That's how you could clear your mind,

436
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,230
return to your true nature

437
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
and find the truth.

438
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:41,840
Sir,

439
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,030
if Zhang Ping asks anything improper,

440
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,710
I could…

441
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,550
Sir,

442
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,360
to succeed,

443
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,030
you must open your heart.

444
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,880
Xu Dong, you may leave.

445
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,550
Yes, sir.

446
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,470
Zhang Ping,

447
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,030
deep inside me,

448
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,160
you would see

449
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,990
a trapped bast.

450
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,160
Sorry for you to see it.

451
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,230
Everyone has a demon insinde

452
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,710
So do I.

453
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,750
The only clue I could remember

454
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,270
was a mysterious woman.

455
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
She went to the south

456
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,710
with my father.

457
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:29,960
As I remember,

458
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,160
she suddenly appeared

459
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,470
and talked privately with my father for days.

460
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,790
Then,

461
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
they left to the south overnight.

462
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
When my father returned,

463
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,440
he was accused of colliding with the enemy.

464
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,840
It's been 20 years.

465
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,120
I can't remember her looks.

466
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,470
I hope

467
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,230
you could help me recall a bit about her.

468
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,960
Sir,

469
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,790
please stare at the water bowl.

470
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,310
Is this

471
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,960
the realm of truth and purity?

472
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,440
You may meditate and recall the past here.

473
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,960
Where is the traitor?

474
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,550
Hanging at the market entrance.

475
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,510
Who is the traitor?

476
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,400
This is the demon inside me.

477
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,920
Where is the traitor?

478
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,160
Hanging at the market entrance.

479
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,360
Who is the traitor?

480
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,840
Either a pig or a dog.

481
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,790
Where is the traitor?

482
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,160
Hanging at the market entrance.

483
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,270
Who is the traitor?

484
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,550
Either a pig or a dog.

485
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,990
Where is the traitor?

486
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,310
Keep my mind as clear as ice.

487
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,750
Not afraid of the falling sky.

488
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,990
Stay calm in changes.

489
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,310
Relax my nerves.

490
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,360
Either a pig or a dog.

491
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,440
Where is the traitor?

492
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,200
Hanging at the market entrance.

493
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,440
Who is the traitor?

494
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
Either a pig or a dog.

495
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,270
Where is the traitor?

496
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,400
Hanging at the market entrance.

497
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,790
Who is the traitor?

498
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,200
Either a pig or a dog.

499
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,400
Where is the traitor?

500
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,920
Hanging at the market entrance.

501
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,750
Who is the traitor?

502
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,270
Keep my mind as clear as ice.

503
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,790
Not afraid of the falling sky.

504
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,230
Stay calm in changes.

505
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,840
Relax my nerves.

506
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,120
Who is the traitor?

507
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,990
Either a pig or a dog.

508
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,030
Keep my mind as clear as ice.

509
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,960
Not afraid of the falling sky.

510
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,920
Stay calm in changes.

511
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,030
Relax my nerves.

512
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,920
Keep my mind as clear as ice.

513
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Not afraid of the falling sky.

514
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,400
Stay calm in changes.

515
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,990
The demon inside you came from your confusion.

516
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,360
I can't help you break it.

517
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
Every time I think of my father being wronged,

518
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,070
this children's folk rhyme would haunt my ears.

519
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,120
My father was not a traitor.

520
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,070
He was not a traitor.

521
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,680
He was not a traitor.

522
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,360
Where

523
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,990
is the traitor?

524
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,440
Hanging

525
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:55,990
Father.

526
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,120
at the market entrance.

527
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,160
Father.

528
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,710
Who is the traitor?

529
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,600
Father.

530
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Either a pig

531
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,510
or a dog.

532
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,310
Father.

533
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,640
Where is the traitor?

534
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,160
Mr. Lan,

535
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,960
you must settle your mind.

536
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,960
Who is

537
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,710
Father.

538
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,920
the traitor?

539
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Either a pig or a dog.

540
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,640
Where is the traitor?

541
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,600
Hanging at the market entrance.

542
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,360
Father.

543
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,030
You're not a traitor.

544
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,270
Who is the traitor?

545
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,510
Either a pig or a dog.

546
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,920
Father.

547
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,880
Father.
