1
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,670
Mo Wen,

2
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,230
thank you so much for tonight.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,000
But investigating a case like this

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,390
would damage your reputation
as the top detective in the capital.

5
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,230
I'm really sorry about that.

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,960
Reputation is all about vanity.

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,200
It's incomparable to your life.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,750
It's all thanks to you.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,710
I can't take all the credit.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,200
Tonight's game changer

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,560
is you.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,640
If it weren't for the second blood letter
from Miss Li

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,750
that let me know
where the real culprit came from,

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,880
I wouldn't be able to realize that.

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,560
Sir,

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,240
something's wrong.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,430
a beggar just brought a blood letter.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,200
It says

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,470
Secret letters with the enemy

20
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,430
reveal the hidden evil intent.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,750
Having no shame

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,070
drives a son
to go on with his father's will.

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,150
("Having no shame)

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,400
(drives a son
to go on with his father's will")

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,560
(refers not only)

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,040
(to my secret letters,)

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,590
(but also Father's past.)

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,280
(The writer believes Father colluded
with the enemy back then)

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,560
(leading to the utter annihilation
of the Army for Southward Crusade.)

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,790
(It's been so long.)

31
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,070
(Except for me,)

32
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,070
(who else would still remember this?)

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,950
(This person must have something to do
with the Army for Southward Crusade.)

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,510
We only know it's a young girl

35
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,510
who asked him to bring this blood letter
around 9 p.m.)

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,710
(It's a young girl.)

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,200
And only people

38
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,120
in our theatrical troupe
know about this ladder.

39
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,150
(She works in the theatrical troupe.)

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,560
Mo Wen,

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,280
when you checked everyone's credential
in the theatrical troupe, do you notice

42
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,120
that there's a young girl relevant
to the Army for Southward Crusade?

43
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,510
Thinking of this, when I was checking,

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,790
there is a dancer from Jiannandao
in the theatrical troupe.

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
When I further looked into it,

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,560
her father turned out
to be in the Army for Southward Crusade.

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,560
I believe

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,710
she must have disguised herself

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,080
long enough
to seek an opportunity for revenge.

50
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,120
First, she stole the bead,

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,000
and then she killed Xie Hao.

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,840
Now, she left a blood letter.

53
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,360
She doesn't simply want me to die.

54
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,680
She also wants to ruin my reputation
before I die.

55
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,470
(The master must be executed for his evil puppet.)
This person planned this so elaborately.

56
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,720
(The corrupt official is ruining our country.)
I don't believe she will let this plan fail.

57
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,190
I have an idea.

58
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,560
We can turn this plan to our advantage.

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Han Yan has confessed
that she's the murderer.

60
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,520
Han Yan?

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,750
It's over. Go back to your rooms.

62
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,280
Get back.

63
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,710
By now,

64
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,190
the culprit who started all this

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,150
in Banyue Pavilion

66
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,710
finally revealed herself.

67
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,080
She knew
Han Yan wasn't the real culprit

68
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,310
but pleaded guilty
and would be judged by the law.

69
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,470
In that case,

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,960
all her efforts would be wasted.

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,400
So, to turn the table and kill me,

72
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,280
she had to get the bead
as soon as possible

73
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,710
and let everyone know

74
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,590
about my secret letters.

75
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,800
All I had to do was
have Xu Dong watch her,

76
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,520
and she would be caught
with hard evidence.

77
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,080
If you didn't anticipate her every move,

78
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,470
your play tonight

79
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,710
would be ruined.

80
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,710
The bead is Miss Li's last move.

81
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,400
It had gone this far.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,630
She had no choice.

83
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,840
And what got trickier was

84
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,590
if I wanted to crack the case tonight

85
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,240
without having Miss Li confess,

86
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,240
the only thing I could do was
to make Han Yan cooperate with me.

87
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,710
I needed to start another play.

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,870
But if I wanted her to cooperate,

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,150
I first need to let her know
Guo Yun's true colors.

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,920
Guo Yun is a victim
of his own wrongdoings.

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,700
If he didn't treat Han Yan
so venomously,

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,310
we wouldn't know
how to crack this case at first.

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,520
Han Yan is...

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,870
She can be broken
neither by persuasion nor force.

95
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,740
We've overcome so many difficulties
along the way.

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,590
I can't imagine that we can't break her.

97
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,470
Even though we didn't break Han Yan
at that time,

98
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,240
when I looked at those medicines
for the protection of a baby,

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,510
it suddenly occurred to me

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,430
that Guo Yun was merciless
and ungrateful.

101
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,270
He didn't even dare to offend his wife

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,190
because of his father-in-law.

103
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,120
How could he be so considerate

104
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,870
to protect his mistress' baby?

105
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,680
You mean Guo Yun tampered with

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,070
these medicines?

107
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,310
Did you just say

108
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,480
the stem ginger in these medicines

109
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,270
was added especially for you by Guoyun?

110
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,070
Yes.

111
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,310
This is the proof
that he killed your baby.

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,120
Most of the stem ginger in the medicines

113
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,480
was actually Bletilla striata.

114
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,830
These two look similar.

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,040
It's hard to notice the difference.

116
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,430
But if stem ginger
was replaced by Bletilla striata

117
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,600
and taken by a pregnant woman,

118
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,040
she would easily suffer a miscarriage.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,830
That's impossible!

120
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,270
Guo would never harm me!

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,270
You're just trying to turn me
against him!

122
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,270
If you want to know the truth,

123
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,630
be my guest and try the medicines.

124
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
As a saying goes, "Even a vicious tiger
will not eat its cubs."

125
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,430
How could he be so venomous

126
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,240
to kill his own baby

127
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,680
without even showing it?

128
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
If you can't forgive what he did,

129
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,600
today would be a perfect opportunity
to punish him.

130
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
After it's done,

131
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,390
I will help you leave this sad place

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,270
with a new identity.

133
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,480
I hope you can think it through.

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,070
What do you want me to do, sir?

135
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
If we wanted Empress Dowager
to believe this play,

136
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,190
Han Yan would have to convict Guo Yun

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,680
with twists and turns

138
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,310
while looking overwhelmed by sorrow.

139
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,360
By now,

140
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,950
there was one last step to go.

141
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,510
And Zhang Ping would be perfect
to finish this.

142
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,800
Since Empress Dowager
has been suspicious of me tonight,

143
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,190
we could only have an outsider
catch the culprit

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
to dispel her doubts.

145
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,600
Let's go and find Mr. Jia.

146
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,390
When Zhang Ping went to Mr. Jia,

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
I had someone tamper with Fire Bead.

148
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,160
Later,

149
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,830
Zhang Ping followed my lead

150
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,190
and found Han Yan.

151
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,160
In the meantime,

152
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,480
Xu Dong replaced the secret letters
in Rhino-Horn Bead

153
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,720
with fake ones

154
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,360
and put them into Han Yan's room.

155
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,510
And Han Yan was standing
in front of Empress Dowager

156
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,040
confessing her crime as we had agreed
in advance.

157
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,600
She pointed out the whereabouts of
the bead while pretending to accuse me

158
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,830
of colluding with the enemy
and committing treason.

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,720
The proof of his guilt

160
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,190
was hidden in a bead
made from rhinoceros horns.

161
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,430
Where is it now?

162
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,240
It's under the bed in my room.

163
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,070

and Zhang Ping's cooperation

165
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,830
it could've been very dangerous for you.

166
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,830
Now, danger is hiding everywhere.

167
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
I surely have to be careful.

Han Yan

169
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,630

Please

171
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,480
take care of her.

172
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,480
No problem.

173
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,310
I'll have people send her out of here
now.

with Miss Li?

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,550
Bring her back to my house
and I'll figure it out later.

178
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,080
She had such a big plan to set you up.

179
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,240
She's not easy.

180
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,030
Be careful.

181
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,360
I'll leave you to it.

Something's wrong with Mr. Lan.

I know why you came here.

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,630
You believe that the Army
for Southward Crusade died in the wrong

207
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,750
because my father colluded
with the enemy.

208
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,470
But there's more.

209
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,800
My father is a righteous man.

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,040
He would never commit treason.

211
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,510
How did tens of thousands of soldiers
die then?

212
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,800
Liu Wen, my father,

213
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,990
was the Military Governor of Jiannan.

214
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,560
I grew up with him in the army.

215
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,630
His fellow officers

216
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,200
taught me how to ride a horse

217
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,590
and shoot arrows.

218
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,080
They taught me about martial arts.

219
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,800
Every one of them

220
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,400
is my family.

221
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,470
When I was eight years old,

222
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,230
The southern border
was in urgent danger.

223
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,800
My father was loyal to his country.

224
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
So, he led his army to fight the enemy.

225
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,510
Tens of thousands of soldiers
ran to the battlefield.

226
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,110
But none of them came back.

227
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,230
All of this

228
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,230
is because of your father.

229
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,990
When I was collecting bodies there,

230
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,870
I saw hungry wolves

231
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,590
eating their bodies
all over the mountains.

232
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,990
Every one of them was dismembered
by those wolves.

233
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,230
I couldn't even find an intact one.

(The tomb of Liu Wen, late father)

235
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,080
I could only find

236
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,710
several clothes and personal items.

237
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,320
I buried them under this cenotaph.

238
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Today,

239
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,990
I want to sacrifice your life

240
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,710
and console their souls with your blood.

241
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,680
Let's separate and find him.

242
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,830
If it wasn't for your father,

243
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,510
soldiers of the Army
for Southward Crusade now

244
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,470
might have returned to their hometown
living happily with their adorable kids.

245
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,920
And I

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,080
would be pulling lethal bows

247
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,710
and taming fierce horses.

248
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,800
I would be fighting on the horseback
on the battlefield with my father

249
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,870
while smiling and remaining graceful.

250
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,510
Instead, now,

251
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm bearing hatred.

252
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
I spent half of my life drifting

253
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,990
and disguised myself day and night

254
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,110
just for today.

255
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,470
Dad,

256
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,110
This cup of wine
mixed with our enemy's blood

257
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,080
came late.

258
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,470
Lan Jue,

259
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,710
do you want to know what it feels like

260
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,080
if you were abandoned in a wasteland

261
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,750
and had your body eaten
by hungry wolves?

262
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Today,

263
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,200
I'll let you know how it feels.

264
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,360
Who?

265
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,030
I can't believe you could chase here.

266
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,750
It looks like I estimated you after all.

267
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,550
It is hard to find.

268
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,840
This place is so big.

269
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,960
You're like Xie Hao,

270
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,270
one of Lan Jue's lackeys.

271
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,640
I didn't come for him.

272
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,680
I came to figure out a clue.

273
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,880
I have to ask you.

274
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,640
Are you really a fool,
or you're just pretending to be?

275
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,960
Who on earth applied nail polish

276
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,230
to Fire Bead?

277
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,470
You or him?

278
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,600
I was locked up.

279
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,470
My hands aren't long enough.

280
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,840
Then you did.

281
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,270
I asked Xu Dong to do it.

282
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,360
Why do you have to use me so many times?

283
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,310
I have to be off the hook tonight,

284
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,470
so I need a fake culprit
for Empress Dowager.

285
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,310
Only when you're the one
who cracks the case

286
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,960
can dispel Empress Dowager's doubts.

287
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,750
You're an insidious viper.

288
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Like father, like son.

289
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,640
You.

290
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,790
Are you done?

291
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,990
Get lost if you are.

292
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,470
Okay. I'll be out of here at once.

293
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,470
You.

294
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,470
Zhang Ping,

295
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
what exactly are you here for?

296
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,990
I told you.

297
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,990
I came for an answer.

298
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,160
You!

299
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,120
No one would risk their lives

300
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,070
to rescue you.

301
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,360
Stop your wishful thinking.

302
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,990
But I still have to rescue him.

303
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,990
He did make some mistakes.

304
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,750
But whether he should die or not

305
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,920
is up to the government.

306
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
You can't lynch him.

307
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,750
Since you want to die with him,

308
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,510
I'll make it happen for you.

309
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,230
Wait!

310
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,440
Do you remember this turpentine oil?

311
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,600
You used this to burn Xie Hao.

312
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,120
Are you done?

313
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,120
Get lost if you are.

314
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,070
Okay. I'll be out of here at once.

315
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,600
Zhang Ping,

316
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
what exactly are you here for?

317
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,790
I told you.

318
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,840
I came for an answer.

319
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,230
But I still have to rescue him.

320
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,440
Go to hell together!

321
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,470
Zhang Ping!

322
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,270

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,230
Zhang Ping!

325
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,600
I've taken an oath

326
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,310
to kill you by myself today

327
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,400
for tens of thousands of soldiers

328
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,120
of the Army for Southward Crusade.

329
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,750
Peizhi!

Don't kill her.

of revenging the whole army.

00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,510

die

340

She was also buried here.

Her soul would finally come back here.

please rule this matter.

I need to find a left-hander

I want to know how to pull the bow

I asked him exclusively.

He didn't admit that.

386

He lied to me! It's a felony!

387

He must be punished severely.

you're gentle and weak,

so you're an easy target.

In my opinion,

395

why don't you learn how to hunt

as Chief of Imperial Astronomy,

411
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
I've diligently done my research
for decades,

412
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
and finally, I designed an astronomic
instrument called Hunxiang Instrument.

413
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,160
It's unparalleled in the world.

This instrument

415
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,440
(Hunxiang Instrument of Yong Kingdom)
is powered by flowing water,

416

A day is a cycle.

418

It can operate for a year,

and its margin of error would just be
a snap of the fingers.

420
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,990
Your Majesties, it can help you

find the opportune time.

Nothing serious.

your father's case.

445

We can investigate it
after this period of time.

446
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,370
I've been in the imperial court
for ten years.

447
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,610
All the hustling and bustling

448
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,440
is to look into this matter.

449
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,510
My father's indictment back then

450
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,710
said clearly

451
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,990
that Nantong promised him
substantial profits.

452
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,510
They promised him that he would be
a lord with his land.

453
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,440
If that's true,

454
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,790
the King of Nantong must know about this.

455
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,310
And he doesn't need to hide this
from me.

456
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,790
Once I meet him,

457
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
I'll know the truth.

458
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,400
I know

459
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,270
the reason why you communicate
with Nantong's Ministry of Rites

460
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,640
is to find a clue
by threading the needle

461
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,470
and lure the real culprit out.

462
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,710
But

463
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,750
it's too dangerous.

464
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,510
Is there another way out?

465
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,880
I've been looked into this

466
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,960
in the army and the imperial court
for ten years.

467
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,230
I got nothing.

468
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,920
I have no choice.

469
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,400
It's said that
there was an exotic woman.

470
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,200
She brought your father to the south.

471
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,230
Where is she?

472
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,070
It's said she was a spy from Nantong.

473
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,710
But I can't remember a single thing

474
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,990
about her.

475
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,640
Unfortunately, we stopped
trading with Nantong

476
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,270
after the defeat twenty years ago.

477
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,200
Only the Minister of Rites can be sent
to Nantong on a diplomatic mission

478
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,200
and pay tribute.

479
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,310
If it wasn't for that,

480
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,270
you wouldn't have to take such a risk

481
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,880
and get yourself involved
in the open and secret fight

482
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,960
with Guo Yun.

483
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,440
Since I've chosen this path,

484
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,270
I'll never regret this
even if I have to die a hundred times.

485
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,680
It's an accident

486
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,160
that I'm holding a note board
as a Vice Minister now.

487
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,030
What I'm supposed to be

488
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,030
is a criminal
with wooden fetters and handcuffs.

489
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,790
Stop.

490
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,230
Don't say such inauspicious words.

491
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,470
What am I afraid of?

492
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,360
I still have you, right?

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,600
things suddenly go south for Zhang Ping.

495
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,360
Kuruo.

496
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,840
Kuruo.

497
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,200
Kuruo.

498
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,600
Kuruo.

499
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,840
Kuruo.

500
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,680
Kuruo.

501
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,600
Kuruo.

502
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,360
Kuruo.

503
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,990
Zhang...

504
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,510
Doctor,

505
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,990
what's wrong with him?

506
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,510
Although he was injured by a broadsword,

507
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,960
it shouldn't turn this way.

508
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,070
I've practised medicine for many years.

509
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,920
But I've never seen a disease like this.

510
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,070
In my opinion, you should prepare
for his funeral as soon as possible.

511
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,550
Zhang...

512
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,400
Zhang...

513
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,400
Six copper coins in total.

514
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,160
We could sell your noodle stand.

515
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,640
We can afford a coffin lid.

516
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,440
Xudong,

517
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,470
have someone
choose a high-quality coffin

518
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,120
Zhang...

519
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,160
and hold an elaborate funeral for him.

520
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,990
Yes, sir.

521
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,840
Thank you, Mr. Lan. Thank you, Mr. Lan.

522
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,200
Zhang Ping also has something to do
with me.

523
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,680
I will take care of

524
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,360
his funeral.

525
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,680
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

526
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,360
Even God is jealous of talents.

527
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,550
It's such a pity.

528
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,790
When you were still alive,
you were determined to know

529
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,120
why I stole the beads.
I might as well tell you the truth.

530
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,600
Indeed, there was a letter written by me

531
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,790
to Nantong's Ministry of Rites
in the bead.

532
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,310
But I didn't collude with the enemy.

533
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,510
I just want to know the truth
twenty years ago.

534
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,030
I have my difficulties.

535
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,470
Although you put me in danger
for several times.

536
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,070
But accidentally,

537
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,400
you're also the one

538
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,750
who saved my life.

539
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,960
You're an inflexible and honest man.

540
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,920
But when the water is too clear,
there are no fish.

541
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,510
If there is an afterlife,

542
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,710
I hope you will not be
as inflexible as you are now.

543
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,400
He! He! He!

544
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,720
