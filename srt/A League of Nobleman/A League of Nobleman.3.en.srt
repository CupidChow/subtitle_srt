She is the suspect, Han Yan.

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,960
Zhang Ping.

29
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,040
You solved the case, didn't you?

30
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,390
I want you to interrogate her for me.

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,390
In detail.

32
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,520
Han Yan.

33
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,640
Did you kill Xie Hao tonight

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,590
and burn her body

35
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,550
with Fire Bead and pine resin?

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,640
Yes.

37
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,870
Why did you kill her?

38
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,320
Xie Hao is evil.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,950
She poisoned my water

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,520
and wanted to kill me.

41
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,270
In my first sip,

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,830
I felt a weird smell.

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,590
Now I've survived,

44
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,430
but I was aborted

45
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,640
due to the poison.

46
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,270
My poor baby.

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,590
He was poisoned.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,080
Why did

49
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,520
Xie Hao poison you?

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,200
Because the other day,

51
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,200
I saw her conspiring
with the evil official Lan Jue.

52
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,550
Someone had evidence of Lan Jue's crime.

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
Then he asked Xie Hao

54
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,480
to seduce the man to take it back.

55
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,270
I knew about their conspiracy,

56
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,360
so she wanted to kill me.

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
Why did you send the doggerel
written in blood?

58
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,080
To show their conspiracy.

59
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,870
Let everyone

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
know their crime.

61
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,830
What crime?

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,520
Treasonous collaboration.

63
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,470
Treasonous collaboration

64
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,640
is a serious crime.

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,150
You are now accusing
the imperial official.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,350
If you slander him,

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,320
you will also be punished to death.

68
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,960
I heard it clearly.

69
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,760
The evidence of his treasonous crime

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,880
was hidden

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
in a Rhino-Horn Bead.

72
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,830
I found a bead

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,230
hidden under a candle

74
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,880
in backstage.

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,710
Was it

76
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,830
the Rhino-Horn Bead?

77
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,350
That's it.

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,390
Where is it now?

79
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,030
Under the bed in my room.

80
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,350
Mr. Lan.

81
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,590
What's your comment

82
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,710
on her accusation?

83
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,080
I...

84
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,320
I don't know

85
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,200
why did this criminal make up a big lie

86
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,150
to frame me.

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,960
Please figure it out, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,790
Didn't you know anything about it?

89
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm the son of a traitor.

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,230
Ten years ago,
the imperial amnesty granted me

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,440
to be an official.

92
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm not an ungrateful man.

93
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,760
You still remember

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
these things.

95
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,760
Traitor Lan Lin's

96
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,080
treasonous collaboration

97
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,640
is atrocious.

98
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,560
He is no longer my father.

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,270
I will be the son

100
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,080
of Da Yong Kingdom.

101
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,910
I will throw my lifelong passion

102
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,880
to our kingdom.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,640
Your Majesty.

104
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,470
Hope you will go to Nandong Kingdom

105
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,080
for our collaboration.

106
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,830
Lan Jue.

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,080
Well done.

108
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,640
Go and get your reward.

109
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,320
But...

110
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,910
It's a matter of imperial secrets.

111
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,520
You should leave.

112
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,000
Zhang.

113
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,590
How's it going?

114
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,270
Han Yan accused Mr. Lan

115
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,390
of treasonous collaboration.

116
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:44,960
What?

117
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,150
Treasonous collaboration?

118
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,030
But...

119
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,270
Mr. Lan's father has committed
the same crime.

120
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,350
I heard that

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
his father made our army lose

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,470
in the war
against the Nandong Kingdom's army.

123
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,390
Isn't this a crime
of nine familial exterminations?

124
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,910
How did he survive?

125
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,590
It's said

126
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,440
Her Majesty pardoned him.

127
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,150
I'm here

128
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,080
to testify your innocence.

129
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,320
But you let me down.

130
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,520
Come on.

131
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,440
Take Lan Jue to the Judicial Prison

132
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,030
for interrogation.

133
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,000
Your Majesty.

135
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,560
Please allow me

136
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,390
have a look
on the so-called handwritten letter.

137
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,500
(With your help, I'll win soon...)

138
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,640
Your Majesty.

139
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,030
This letter

140
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,590
is fake.

141
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,830
Fake?

142
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,560
Character qi

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
is one of the characters
of His Majesty's name.

144
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,750
When I write memorials,

145
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,510
I always delete the above little stroke.

146
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
But the character qi in this letter

147
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,560
kept the full strokes.

148
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,510
I think

149
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,990
someone is framing me

150
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
and misleading you.

151
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,630
Your Majesty,

152
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,400
please find it out.

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
I know

154
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,110
Mr. Lan did have this writing habit.

155
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,440
But it's the secret letter
to Nandong Kingdom,

156
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,960
maybe you wrote

157
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,560
in this way deliberately

158
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,280
to avoid exposure.

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,350
If I wrote this letter in this way

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,920
to avoid exposure,

161
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,080
why should I sign my name here?

162
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,590
Wouldn't that

163
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
be paradoxical?

164
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Besides,

165
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,750
the letter seems to be written

166
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,400
by me,

167
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,440
but on the back of the paper,

168
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,990
all these left-fallings are longer
and more powerful

169
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,990
than the right-fallings.

170
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,960
It must be written in my left hand.

171
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,230
But I couldn't write

172
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,960
with my left hand.

173
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,200
Every official in the kingdom

174
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,630
knew it.

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
Minister Gong.

176
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,320
You and Mr. Lan are both officials

178
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,200
in the Ministry of Rites.

179
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,920
You know his handwriting.

180
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,200
Have a look.

181
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,110
Your Majesty,

183
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,680
this letter is not written

184
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,160
by Mr. Lan.

185
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,960
I knew

186
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,710
one of the officials

187
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,320
who writes with his left hand is Mr. Guo.

188
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,200
In our last colleague gathering,

189
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
after drinking,

190
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,870
he excitedly gave

191
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,710
a piece of left-hand-written calligraphy

192
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,750
to me.

193
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,440
This is fresh in my memory.

194
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,960
Mr. Wang.

195
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,510
You are too targeted.

196
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,160
That's my guess.

197
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,800
Mr. Guo is not the only one
who could write with his left hand

198
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,590
among civil officials
and military officers.

199
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,560
But only he has motivation

200
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,680
to forge the letter.

201
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,510
Minister Gong is about to retire.

202
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,400
He and Mr. Lan

203
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,160
are the candidates for this position.

204
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,510
Every official knew that.

205
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,870
Take Mr. Guo here.

206
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,680
Mr. Guo.

207
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,960
Have a look.

208
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,350
Mr. Lan, you are faithless.

209
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,350
Your Majesty and His Majesty
took great care of you.

210
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,040
But you repaid their kindness
with complaint.

211
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,920
You bitterly disappointed us.

212
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,630
Mr. Guo.

213
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
Stop it.

214
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,830
Minister Gong has checked it.

215
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,350
There are many doubts

216
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,230
in this letter.

217
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,830
This is left-hand writing.

218
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,560
Not written by Mr. Lan.

219
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
Your Majesty.

220
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,870
I can write with my left hand.

221
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,200
But I haven't written this letter.

222
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,920
Mr. Wang.

223
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,800
What is the evidence

224
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,110
for accusing me of framing Mr. Lan?

225
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,040
Your Majesty.

226
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,560
When I investigated Han Yan's abortion,

227
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,350
I heard a secret that

228
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,830
you are the father

229
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,440
of the baby.

230
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
Mr. Guo.

231
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,960
Is it true?

232
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,590
Your Majesty.

233
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,400
He is framing me.

234
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,470
Her Majesty asked you

235
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,870
what's your relationship
with this woman.

236
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,590
I have nothing to do with her.

237
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,160
Really?

238
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,960
I have never met her before.

239
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,960
My wife is the daughter
of the head of the secretariat.

240
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,750
She is gentle and virtuous.

241
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,630
We loved

242
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,870
each other.

243
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,920
Everyone knows it.

244
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,470
And I have no contact with other women.

245
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,710
How could I have something

246
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,630
with the vile musician in a brothel?

247
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,440
I risked my life for you.

248
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,470
Are you forgetting?

249
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,200
Don't lie

250
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
and frame me.

251
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,040
I'm a Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Rites.

252
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,750
How could I like you, a vile musician?

253
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,560
Vile musician?

254
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,710
Am I a vile musician?

255
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,200
How about I take out the Chinese lute
you gave me

256
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,510
to show everyone?

257
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,590
There is a poem inscribed by you.

258
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,040
How about I invite the doctor
you called after my abortion

259
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,560
to let everyone see him?

260
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,830
He knew

261
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,440
our relationship.

262
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,710
Your Majesty.

263
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,350
I confessed my crime.

264
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,080
I committed

265
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,040
my perjury.

266
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,800
What perjury?

267
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,710
My accusation of Mr. Lan

268
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,630
is fabricated.

269
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,400
I framed him.

270
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,510
Mr. Guo asked me to do that.

271
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,200
When did I ask you to do that?

272
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,080
He vied with Mr. Lan
for the position of Minister of Rites.

273
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,080
He knew his talent and knowledge

274
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,230
are poorer than Mr. Lan's

275
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,680
and was full of resentment.

276
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,510
So he framed Mr. Lan’s crime

277
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,350
of treasonous collaboration

278
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,590
while you are watching the play.

279
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,280
What happened tonight

280
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,920
was planned by him.

281
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,080
Mr. Guo.

282
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,830
You knew my route
to watch the play with plain clothes.

283
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,110
How well-informed you are!

284
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,560
Your Majesty.

285
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,350
I was wronged.

286
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,710
I didn't know you would go out
to watch the play

287
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,470
and didn't frame Mr. Lan.

288
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,750
Lan Jue.

289
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,630
I knew you hated me.

290
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,350
But how could you do this for me?

291
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,560
Mr. Guo.

292
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,280
I'm the one who's been wronged.

293
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,920
What happened today

294
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,680
is an unexpected disaster for me.

295
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,800
How have you been wronged?

296
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,350
It's late.

297
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,230
I'm tired.

298
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,400
Ministry of Justice will do the rest.

299
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,280
Your Majesty.

300
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,870
I was wronged, Your Majesty.

301
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,830
Lan Jue.

302
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,630
You are evil.

303
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,750
I won't let you go.

304
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,590
- What happened tonight...
- Your Majesty.

305
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,670
I... I was wronged.

306
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
... is interesting.

307
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,280
Your Majesty,

308
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,470
thank you for proving my innocence.

309
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,200
Hope

310
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,960
you always remember the oath

311
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,110
when you became an official.

312
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,080
I'll

313
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,230
never forget it.

314
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,280
Be quiet.

315
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,220
(Crimes are under the Goddess statue.
Evil Lan Jue should be killed now.)

316
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,620
(Banyue Pavilion)

317
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
You always know.

318
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,110
One more doggerel
written in blood came.

319
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,280
The murderer left a note that

320
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,710
he will expose your crimes

321
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
at midnight.

322
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,230
He sent the second doggerel written in blood

323
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,560
an hour

324
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,280
before midnight.

325
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,560
But he didn't mention
the fake secret letter of mine.

326
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,040
At midnight,

327
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,830
he would frame me for the third time.

328
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,750
Luckily, you saved the day.

329
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,560
Burn it.

330
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,230
Yes, sir.

331
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,320
It's 12 o’clock.

332
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,350
All is well.

333
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,870
I think something was wrong.

334
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,350
As soon as I found Fire Bead,

335
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,630
I found the clue of nail care,

336
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,200
as if the answer

337
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,920
was waiting for me there.

338
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,590
It's tracking down

339
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,230
by following clues.

340
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,680
Well,

341
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,830
their nail care is useful.

342
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,990
My fingernail

343
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,230
split.

344
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,350
I asked Mr. Jia for some nail care
to apply,

345
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,830
after a while,

346
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,630
my fingers are hard

347
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
as wood.

348
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,280
Look.

349
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,560
What did you say?

350
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,040
What did I say?

351
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,280
Did you say

352
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,870
the nail care dried

353
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,320
after a while.

354
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,510
Zhang, where are you going?

355
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,790
Zhang.

356
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,470
Zhang.

357
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,440
What's wrong with you?

358
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,070
It had been two hours

359
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,710
since we found the Fire Bead,

360
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
but the nail care was not dry.

361
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,440
This...

362
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,960
It means someone just applied it on.

363
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,030
Han Yan is not the murderer.

364
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,440
Not her?

365
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,440
Zhang.

366
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,840
Who is the murderer?

367
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,640
Sir.

368
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,030
How to deal with him?

369
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,360
Take him to my mansion.

370
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,510
Yes, sir.

371
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,160
Mr. Jia.

372
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,840
Please help Zhi Xia.

373
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,360
She is crazier.

374
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,030
Let's see her.

375
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,790
Mr. Jia.

376
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,680
Scholar, what are you doing back here?

377
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,400
Fire Bead.

378
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,470
That evidence was taken away

379
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,680
by the Ministry of Justice.

380
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,510
Where are they?

381
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,600
No one is here.

382
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,360
The case is solved. They are all gone.

383
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,790
Solved?

384
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,440
Right.

385
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,070
The truth is that Mr. Guo

386
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,920
and Han Yan framed Mr. Lan.

387
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,790
They forged the crime

388
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,030
of treasonous collaboration.

389
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,070
That's not true.

390
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,840
Alright.

391
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm in a hurry.

392
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,550
I need to go.

393
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,600
Zhang.

394
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,070
What... What happened?

395
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,160
Maybe...

396
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,510
I was deceived by Mr. Lan again.

apply Xie Hao's head oil？

497

I don't know.

498
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,070

516
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,990
The hand bell

517
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,440
is from the costume
of the previous scene.

518
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
We should take it off

519
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,920
during the dress-up time.

520
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,070
Why was she still wearing it?

521
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,470
How long did it take to take off the bell
and change into the costume?

522
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,230
Without stopping,

523
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
we can barely keep up with time.

524
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,070
This bell is hung on the hand

525
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,750
with an armband.

526
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
It's hard to take off.

527
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,360
Maybe

528
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,070
she didn't change the costume
of last scene

529
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,470
and just put on the costume

530
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,960
of the next scene outside.

531
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,550
Did she save this time

532
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,790
for sneaking out

533
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,360
to kill Xie Hao?

534
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,990
Who is the dancer?

535
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,230
It's

536
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,960
Miss Li.

537
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,400
She has four ear piercings.

538
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,440
She was born in Jiannandao.

539
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,920
In her hometown,

540
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,920
girls should get four ears pierced
at an early age.

541
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,470
She killed Xie Hao.

542
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,880
How is that possible?

543
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,470
She is kind.

544
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,470
Maybe...

545
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,960
She was too lazy to take off the bell.

546
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Did she flick her sleeves

547
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,880
with the same force

548
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,440
as usual?

549
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,070
No.

550
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,550
Xie Hao was already on fire,

551
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,640
and you applied the same head oil.

552
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
If you touched the spark,

553
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,230
you would suffer too.

554
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,270
She pushed me away

555
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,710
to save me.

556
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,310
Only the murderer knew

557
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,070
the head oil thing.

558
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,680
She saved you.

559
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,710
It means

560
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,070
she is the murderer.

561
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,470
Miss Li.

562
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,550
Should I hate you

563
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,030
or thank you?

564
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,990
Where is Miss Li?

565
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,120
She was scared

566
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,750
after the accident,

567
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,880
Mr. Wang arranged his men
to take her to see the doctor.

568
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,360
How is Zhi Xia now?

569
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,160
She is fine.

570
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,200
Chen Chou.

571
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,990
Put the Water Bowl away.

572
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,680
Wait for me.

573
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,600
