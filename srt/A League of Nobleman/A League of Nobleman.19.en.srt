1
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,350
After trying for one night,

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,670
I made no progress.

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,710
Sir,

4
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,790
how about

5
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,960
asking others for help?

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,430
We've already taken a high risk

7
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,200
to steal the scroll,

8
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,030
so how could we expose it to others?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
I think there must be
someone who has an idea

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,950
and won't expose you.

11
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,870
I just said it

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,230
casually.

13
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,200
Don't take it seriously, sir.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't want to drink.

15
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,840
Sir,

16
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,070
I've gone to Court of Judicial Review

17
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,070
to ask about the case as you ordered.

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:22,950
How is it?

19
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:15,060
=A League of Nobleman=

20
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,580
=Episode 19=

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,030
It looks the same.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
What a coincidence.

23
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,430
This gold leaf

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,080
could be left by Ma Lian accidentally

25
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
when killing Chen Zishang.

26
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,400
Is this the key clue you've mentioned?

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,360
Undoubtedly, you made a mistake.

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Chen Zishang died after 9 p.m.,

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,840
but Ma Lian had been
staying in Banyue Pavilion

30
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,800
the whole night since 7 p.m.,

31
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,960
so how could he
have time to kill Chen Zishang?

32
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,960
How do you confirm

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,630
Chen Zishang died after 9 p.m.?

34
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,840
The autopsy might not be correct.

35
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,870
You don't know that.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,470
Chen Zishang's neighbor

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,000
saw him at 9 p.m.,

38
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,560
which clearly meant

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
he died

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,360
after 9 p.m.,

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,310
right?

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,800
Then how could you prove

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,630
Ma Lian had been staying
in Banyue Pavilion since 7 p.m.?

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,430
Many people saw him.

45
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,520
Miss Jiexiang,
who accompanied him the whole night,

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,520
could also prove that.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,910
Ma Lian actually went to Banyue Pavilion

48
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,630
to enjoy music
before the imperial examination?

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,430
I also feel strange.

50
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,680
But what is stranger

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,630
is that Cheng Bai,

52
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,000
the vice director of the Ministry
of Personnel, invited Ma Lian to a banquet,

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,910
but Ma Lian broke the appointment.

54
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,710
The Ministry of Personnel

55
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,240
takes charge of nominating and
transferring successful candidates

56
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,590
after the imperial examination.

57
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,150
Ma Lian often wanted to bribe me,

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,150
but he actually went to
Banyue Pavilion to enjoy music

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
instead of taking the great chance?

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,630
So what's your opinion, sir?

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,960
Perhaps he just deceived the public
by enjoying music.

62
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,710
His real purpose

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,150
was to trade for examination questions.

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,910
Make a preparation.

65
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,150
Let's go to Banyue Pavilion.

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,840
This is the testimony
of Ma Lian and Jiexiang.

67
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,960
It all matches.

68
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
The waiter

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,520
who received Ma Lian,

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,430
and some guests who drank with him,

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,680
could also testify for him.

72
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,280
It can't be wrong

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,270
since there are so many witnesses.

74
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,040
(The waiter's testimony 1)
The drinkers said

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,190
Ma Lian didn't only treat them to drink

76
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,390
but also gave the waiter a high tip.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,270
He's a righteous and straightforward man

78
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,600
who shows solicitude for understrappers.

79
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,040
But I saw him

80
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,070
scolded servants randomly on that day

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,190
with an overbearing attitude.

82
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,160
Trash. Get the carriage here now!

83
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,630
Yes, yes.

84
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,360
Yes.

85
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,870
Don't you think it's
a sharp contrast and very doubtful?

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,630
It's just your own wishful thinking.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,360
You have a preconception
that Ma Lian is the murderer,

88
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,160
so you keep doubting him.

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
Chen Zishang's death

90
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,680
has nothing to do with Ma Lian.

91
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,510
I've found the murderer

92
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,510
and can end the case today.

93
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,390
Who is the murderer?

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,310
It's a habitual thief.

95
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,600
He sneaked into Chen Zishang's home
and planned to steal,

96
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,480
but

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
he was caught by Chen Zishang.

98
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,720
Anxiously, he picked up the stone,
which was used to steady the vat,

99
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,360
and smashed it to
Chen Zishang's afterbrain.

100
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,870
Then he managed to cover up his crime
for fear it would be exposed.

101
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,190
This part matches your guess.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,870
Where is the murderer?

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,510
Could you let me
interrogate him, Mr. Tao?

104
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,630
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When the murderer heard
Chen Zishang's death

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,310
startled the Empress Dowager,

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,070
he was so panicked

108
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,680
that he hung himself
for fear of punishment.

109
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,750
What I found

110
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,630
is only a letter of confession

111
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,430
and

112
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,310
the coroner's autopsy report.
Read it yourself.

113
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,510
But Chen Zishang's draft

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,310
is the same as Ma Lian's answer sheet.

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,040
It's the proof of their joint fraud.

116
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,920
There is no fraud.

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,600
Ma Lian admitted

118
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,750
he had spotted some questions
before the examination

119
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,310
and prepared some essays in advance.

120
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,950
Chen Zishang

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,120
probably discovered that one by accident

122
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,160
and copied it,

123
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,720
so when Mr. Jinghu made the prediction,

124
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,240
he wanted to go home

125
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,830
out of guilt.

126
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,000
Everything matches.

127
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720
Did you simply believe his explanation?

128
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,870
Zhang Ping,

129
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,240
people couldn't avoid making mistakes,

130
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,310
and it's not a big deal
to make a wrong investigation.

131
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,240
Besides,

132
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,510
when you investigated
the phoenix head before,

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,600
our Court of Judicial Review
didn't get any benefit from that.

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,560
And the Empress Dowager

135
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,830
keeps an eye on us this time,

136
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,360
so I don't dare to let you interfere.

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,160
Mr. Tao.

138
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,270
Goodbye.

139
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,160
I'll stop sending you off.

140
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,390
Miss Jiexiang,

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,510
I'll come straight to the point.

142
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,240
What time did Ma Lian
come to Banyue Pavilion

143
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,560
on the day
before the imperial examination?

144
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,070
Did he meet anyone during that period?

145
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,510
Mr. Ma probably arrived here at 7 p.m.,

146
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,800
and he didn't meet anyone except me.

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,560
By the way,

148
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,680
he drank with some drinkers
when he just came here

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,630
and then stayed in my room

150
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,950
without leaving.

151
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,120
Who are the drinkers?

152
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,680
Can you recognize them?

153
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,920
They are frequenters of Banyue Pavilion

154
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,430
and were born into rich families.

155
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,480
All ladies in the pavilion know them.

156
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,720
Did anyone of them

157
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,680
give something to you,

158
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,040
such as essays or manuscripts?

159
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,190
No.

160
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,000
Did Ma Lian bring his book box here?

161
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,270
Did he recite any manuscripts
during the period?

162
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,600
No.

163
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,240
He said he couldn't focus on
reviewing books any longer

164
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
and came with nothing.

165
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,720
Even his book box was sent to the
exam room by his servants in a hurry

166
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,240
the next day
he attended the examination.

167
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,270
Sir,

168
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,600
Jiexiang's answer isn't leaky.

169
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,120
Ma Lian seemed to only
drink and have fun in Banyue Pavilion.

170
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,510
It had nothing to do
with trading for answers.

171
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,480
And the time couldn't match
if he murdered Chen Zishang.

172
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,720
I saw Mr. Chen here on that day.

173
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,680
Are you sure he was alone?

174
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Yes.

175
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,670
And are you sure the time was 9 p.m.?

176
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course.

177
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,910
Wasn't it going to rain on that day?

178
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
I was busy
getting in wheat in the field

179
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,270
and didn't go back
home until late at night.

180
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,870
At that time, I happened to hear
the bellman ring the bell of 9 p.m..

181
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,600
Since it was 9 p.m.,

182
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,670
it must be very dark,

183
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,240
so how could you confirm

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,840
that man was Chen Zishang?

185
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,840
I bumped into him by accident that night,

186
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,200
and my wheat was spilled at him.

187
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Sorry.

188
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,910
However, Mr. Chen didn't complain.

189
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,150
I'll go on with my work.

191
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,380
(Guiyou)

192
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,550
Mr. Lan is still grounded.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,960
How did you enter here?

194
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,270
You haven't known that, have you?

195
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,510
Court of Judicial Review
has ended the case,

196
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
and the grounded order
has also been canceled.

197
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,320
The government troops at the door

198
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,550
have all retreated.

199
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,000
The case is ended?

200
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,550
Ma Lian is acquitted.

201
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,510
What?

202
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,240
Tao Zhoufeng is very cunning.

203
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,750
He is good at muddling.

204
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,320
If Ma Lian is successfully
exonerated from the charge,

205
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,630
he'll never admit

206
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,120
his connection to Mr. Jinghu.

207
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,030
Besides,

208
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
he's the fiance of
the Empress Dowager's niece.

209
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,240
Even if I want to play artifices,

210
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,750
I'm weak in power.

211
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,550
Yes.

212
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,440
If we don't have evidence
to reverse the verdict,

213
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,510
I'm afraid it'll end up
with nothing settled.

214
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,000
Mowen,

215
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,670
actually, I have some evidence.

216
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,000
It's just...

217
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,750
I also want to help you,

218
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,840
but I can't interfere in this case.

219
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,750
My father and Shangfeng
set the examination,

220
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,200
so people may doubt the evidence

221
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,150
that I handle with,

222
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,790
which will put you at a disadvantage.

223
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,480
But apart from me,

224
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,270
there is another person
who can help you.

225
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,600
I know you can't let it go,

226
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,510
but it's because you two
investigated respectively

227
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,630
that Tao Zhoufeng took the advantage.

228
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,270
If you delay any longer,

229
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,510
when can we find Mr. Jinghu?

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,750
Make the choice

231
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
yourself.

232
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,600
Please bend the rules, misters.

233
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,240
I really have something important
to talk to Miss Jiexiang.

234
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,390
You're crying for the moon.

235
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,320
Get out, and don't be an eyesore
since you're poor.

236
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:12,910
Get out.

237
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,720
Is this the way you receive guests?

238
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,870
Isn't that Mr. Lan?

239
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,840
Mr. Lan,

240
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,030
please come in.

241
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,550
And so do you.

242
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,780
(Banyue Pavilion)

243
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

244
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,270
It's just a trifle.

245
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,480
Don't take it seriously.

246
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,670
Well,

247
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,840
I'll leave now.

248
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,240
Wait.

249
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,510
Don't you come to Jiexiang?

250
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,030
Me, too.

251
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,240
Go.

252
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,360
Please.

253
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,120
Mr. Lan.

254
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,750
I've repeated Mr. Ma's matter

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,870
for many times.

256
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,840
Do you have any other doubts, sir?

257
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,720
It should be...

258
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,320
You misunderstand me, Miss Jiexiang.

259
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,790
I don't come to investigate the case

260
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,200
but to enjoy music today.

261
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,320
Enjoy music?

262
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,440
I've chartered here,

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,910
so just continue playing, Miss Jiexiang.

264
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,910
What happened to your hand?

265
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,320
I played music the whole night
for Mr. Ma on that day,

266
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,390
so my fingers were rubbed.

267
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
Didn't Ma Lian feel bored

268
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,720
after listening to music for one night?

269
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,480
Didn't he hire some singers
or dancers to add to the fun?

270
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,790
No.

271
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,910
No one came here

272
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,910
except servants serving food.

273
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,510
Miss Jiexiang,

274
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,550
why did you commit perjury for Ma Lian?

275
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,510
It's not too late to tell the truth.

276
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,510
You must be joking.

277
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,790
I've been telling the truth all the time.

278
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,790
According to your words,

279
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,120
Chen Zishang didn't
come here that night, did he?

280
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,630
Of course not.

281
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,960
I've never met Chen Zishang.

282
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,320
Then why is

283
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,440
his thing in your room?

284
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,790
The germinant wheat

285
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,200
was left by Chen Zishang.

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,840
To be exact,

287
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,200
it was left by Ma Lian
who dressed up as Chen Zishang.

288
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,960
Chen Zishang's neighbor said

289
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,870
it seemed to rain on the day of the murder.

290
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,600
He wanted to get in wheat before the rain,

291
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,440
so he didn't go back home until 9 p.m..

292
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,000
He met Chen Zishang on the way home,

293
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,600
and his cart was overturned by accident.

294
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,840
The wheat was spilled to Chen Zishang.

295
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
What he didn't know

296
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,120
was that the man he saw
wasn't Chen Zishang

297
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,670
but Ma Lian.

298
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,200
It was dark at night,

299
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,670
and Ma Lian's shape
was similar to Chen Zishang's,

300
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,870
so the neighbor
couldn't see the difference

301
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
and thought Chen Zishang
was still alive at 9 p.m..

302
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
Mr. Ma.

303
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,670
What's wrong?

304
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,510
Serve me to shower.

305
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,480
When Ma Lian returned to
Banyue Pavilion,

306
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,840
he brought back a few
grains of wheat accidentally.

307
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,080
When he changed Chen Zishang's clothes,

308
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
the wheat fell into the pot.

309
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
This is the evidence of
his disguise as Chen Zishang.

310
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,080
How did you know
the wheat was dropped on that day?

311
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,320
What if

312
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,030
it was dropped by others

313
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,910
a few days ago?

314
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,030
This is new wheat,

315
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,000
which is early to sprout now.

316
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,750
It will only sprout
after being exposed to the rain,

317
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,030
but it hasn't rained in Capital City

318
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
except the night
before the imperial examination.

319
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,120
It means

320
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,630
the wheat was brought back by Ma Lian

321
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,910
after he left Banyue Pavilion

322
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,600
and dressed up as Chen Zishang.

323
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,150
And you committed perjury for him.

324
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,870
Besides,

325
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,000
I found a gold leaf
broken by an external force

326
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,840
was next to the murder weapon
for killing Chen Zishang

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,670
at his home.

328
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,790
And this gold leaf

329
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,480
(OS: Stop looking.)

330
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
belonged to Ma Lian's
necklace of precious stones.

331
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,880
It means he fought with Chen Zishang

332
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,110
and touched the murder weapon.

333
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
With the evidence,

334
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,550
we can deduce

335
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,200
that Ma Lian had murdered Chen Zishang

336
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,720
before 9 p.m.

337
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
Then he thought

338
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,030
as long as he dressed up as Chen Zishang

339
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,480
to postpone the death time after 9 p.m.

340
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,200
and colluded with you

341
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,030
that he had never left Banyue Pavilion

342
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,590
after 7 p.m.,

343
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,350
he would

344
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,480
have a perfect alibi

345
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,540
to be acquitted.

346
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,310
Miss Jiexiang,

347
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,680
the Emperor and Empress Dowager ordered
to investigate this case in person,

348
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,350
but you committed perjury,

349
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,000
which was a crime of
cheating the Emperor

350
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,590
and all your relatives
should be executed as a punishment.

351
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,350
Ma Lian has a powerful background,

352
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,350
so he may run away from punishment,

353
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,680
but what about you?

354
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,790
You'd better think it twice.

355
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,110
Sir,

356
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,310
I was so dumb

357
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,270
that I agreed to
commit perjury for Ma Lian.

358
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,240
Please spare my life.

359
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,640
That night,

360
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,640
Ma Lian indeed gave me money

361
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,400
to let me lie that we were
together for the whole night

362
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,310
and help him to sneak out

363
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,790
without being discovered by the guards.

364
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,000
As for the murder,

365
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
I really knew nothing, sir.

366
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,720
If you're willing to
withdraw your testimony,

367
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,880
I can help you.

368
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,750
Yes,

369
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,920
I am.

370
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,110
Thank you for today,

371
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720
Mr. Lan.

372
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,030
If there is nothing else to talk to me,

373
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,750
I'll leave now.

374
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,880
You worked hard at investigating today,

375
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,920
so why not go to my mansion
to have dinner?

376
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,920
It's very late now,

377
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,680
so it'll be troublesome
if you go back to make dinner.

378
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
If you go to my mansion to have dinner,

379
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,720
we just need to add your tableware,
which is simple.

380
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,880
Although the pretzels' side dishes

381
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,690
are very normal,

382
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,490
they taste delicious.

383
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,350
I liked them the best when I was young.

384
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,400
Zhang Ping,

385
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,310
thanks to the evidence you found today

386
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,110
so that we can see through Ma Lian's trick.

387
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,400
I...

388
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,270
I think Zhang Ping is starving.

389
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,030
Sir,

390
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,270
please have dinner first.

391
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,200
Okay.

392
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,590
You have gastropathy,
so you can't starve, sir.

393
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,350
Please grab a bite.

394
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,350
Fortunately, you came to
Banyue Pavilion today.

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,350
Otherwise, Miss Jiexiang

396
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,030
wouldn't have withdrawn
her previous testimony.

397
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,750
Do you also know this way of eating?

398
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,720
How

399
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,000
did you know that?

400
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,240
I seemed to be taught
by someone when I was young.

401
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,110
I created it myself in my childhood.

402
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Perhaps

403
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,440
as Xuan Ji said,

404
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,510
my mother took me
when she went to Capital City

405
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,720
20 years ago.

406
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,510
And I learned the way of eating pretzels

407
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
from you.

408
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,960
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

409
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,750
Sir,

410
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,960
I've made the decision.

411
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
If we finally find out

412
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,640
my mother killed

413
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,070
your family,

414
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm willing to prosecute
myself to the Empress Dowager

415
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,310
to reverse the verdict for your father.

416
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,640
Zhang Ping,

417
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
no matter what answer
Mr. Jinghu will say,

418
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,000
I will never be mad at you,

419
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,920
nor should I do that.

420
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,310
You said you would keep investigating.

421
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,550
Does it count now?

422
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,240
Let's eat.

423
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,750
Mr. Tao,

424
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,070
Miss Jiexiang withdrew her testimony.

425
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,270
Please retry the case.

426
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,960
What is going on?

427
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,590
Why did she contradict herself?

428
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,200
Mr. Tao,

429
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,880
how is your decision?

430
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,750
I have to

431
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,480
deliberate the testimony.

432
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,030
Stop deliberating it, Mr. Tao.

433
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,440
Miss Jiexiang confessed everything.

434
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,880
She was bribed by Ma Lian

435
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,960
and committed perjury for him.

436
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,720
I've seen through the way Ma Lian
postponed Chen Zishang's death time,

437
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,480
and found the evidence of his murder.

438
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,350
Zhang Ping,

439
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,750
since Jiexiang could
commit perjury for Ma Lian

440
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,310
because of money,

441
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
couldn't she also withdraw the testimony

442
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,790
for money?

443
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,510
Doesn't the evidence you found

444
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,480
become inconclusive

445
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,790
without her testimony?

446
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,880
Mr. Tao.

447
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,640
Since Mr. Tao is suspicious,

448
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,640
why don't we ask Ma Lian and Jiexiang to
confront each other?

449
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm really confused.

450
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,880
The evidence

451
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
of this case is clear,

452
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,030
and the murderer left a suicide letter

453
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,110
to commit his crime,

454
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,880
so why do you insist on
investigating the case?

455
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,590
You come to Court of Judicial Review

456
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,750
to shout for reversing the verdict
because of this fictitious evidence.

457
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,110
Are you critical of Ma Lian

458
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,750
or me

459
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,640
or the Empress Dowager?

460
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,550
We just...

461
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,270
Zhang Ping.

462
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,480
Since Mr. Tao firmly believes
his judgement is right,

463
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,240
we can't help that.

464
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,070
Goodbye.

465
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,200
Mr. Lan.

466
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,830
Go.

467
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,740
(Spirit Tablet of Chen Zishang)

468
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,510
Chen,

469
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,720
we come to mourn for you.

470
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
Mr. Jinghu flew paper cranes
a few days ago,

471
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,440
saying you had grievance to say
on the 7th day after your death.

472
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,310
Now we are here,

473
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,510
so reveal yourself

474
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,640
if you had grievance.

475
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,480
Bureaucrats shield one another,

476
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,510
and they actually made
a dead person a scapegoat

477
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,720
while the true criminal
is still getting away with murder.

478
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,680
Chen,

479
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,790
we're burning everything you had

480
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,030
to you.

481
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,400
We hope you can study hard

482
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,110
and be at the top

483
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,720
in the hell.

484
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,160
Chen,

485
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,240
although we weren't very close to you,

486
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,160
we admired your talent.

487
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,550
If you can see
what happened in the world,

488
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,030
never let Ma Lian

489
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,270
and those fatuous officials
in Court of Judicial Review go.

490
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,200
What's wrong?

491
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,480
What is going on?

492
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,750
Chen's ghost is revealing itself, right?

493
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,160
Chen must want to tell us his grievance

494
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,830
through this brush holder.

495
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,110
Right.

496
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,790
Yes.

497
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,240
Mr. Jinghu said

498
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,070
something abnormal would happen

499
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,790
when we mourned for Chen today.

500
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,590
We must seek justice for Chen.

501
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,200
Yes, we must do.

502
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,920
Let's go.

503
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,240
Let's go to Imperial Palace
to submit our appeal.

504
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
- Yes.
- Right.

505
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,400
Let's go to Imperial Palace
to submit our appeal.

506
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,790
Let's seek justice for Chen.

507
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,440
- Let's submit our appeal.
- Go.

508
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,720
I heard the scholars gathered
to mourn for Chen Zishang today,

509
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,830
and the brush holder

510
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,310
actually burned under the public gaze.

511
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,160
Perhaps

512
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,400
because the brush holder had white phosphorus,

513
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,550
it spontaneously combusted under the
heat of the burning basin for mourning.

514
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,270
But none of the scholars at the scene

515
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,240
saw through this little trick.

516
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,310
Or they saw through it,
but they didn't want to expose it

517
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,830
and made a big fuss,

518
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,000
which showed Court of Judicial Review's
judgement of this case

519
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
was unsatisfactory.

520
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,200
I also couldn't figure out

521
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,480
why Mr. Tao behaved perfunctorily.

522
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,440
The evidence was obvious,
but he was still insensible.

523
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,510
You shouldn't have
taken me away at that time.

524
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,590
He's been an official for a decade,

525
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,960
so he has been sophisticated.

526
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,350
His meaning was very clear.

527
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,270
Ma Lian was the fiance
of Empress Dowager's niece,

528
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,030
so Mr. Tao didn't want to

529
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,030
investigate Chen Zishang's case deeply

530
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,240
in fear of offending Empress Dowager.

531
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,750
It'll be useless even if you don't stop

532
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,880
pestering him.

533
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,030
Do you have other ideas?

534
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,160
Only one person

535
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,830
could confront the Empress Dowager.

536
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,200
I am Liu Xian,

537
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,350
and I have something to report.

538
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,590
Go ahead.

539
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,880
Recently,

540
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,440
Chen Zishang's murder case
has been bubbling with noise.

541
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,960
The scholars doubted
that Court of Judicial Review

542
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,240
covered up for Ma Lian

543
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,720
and submitted an appeal to
the Imperial Palace,

544
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,550
asking the court to retry this case.

545
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,240
I think

546
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,720
selecting talents through
the imperial examination is ancestral

547
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,070
and the foundation of a country,

548
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,550
so we must find out the truth

549
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,680
and give the scholars justice.

550
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,440
They are just mobs

551
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,200
and made use of this case
to elaborate their own ideas.

552
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,310
Just disperse them.

553
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,680
Please think it twice, Your Majesty.

554
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,070
The scholars are indignant,

555
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,550
so if we don't retry the case,

556
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,680
I'm afraid

557
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,000
the court's reputation will plummet.

558
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,240
Mother and Mr. Liu,

559
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,070
stop arguing.

560
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,790
I've found out

561
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,350
the truth of this case.

562
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,270
Yesterday,

563
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,960
Zhang Ping

564
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,070
submitted the evidence
of Ma Lian's crime.

565
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Are you Ma Lian?

566
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,350
Yes.

567
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,480
What are you going to do?

568
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,000
We're arresting the criminal
by His Majesty's order.

569
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,750
Take him away.

570
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,790
Wasn't I sentenced to be innocent?

571
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,350
What?

572
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,110
What are you doing?

573
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,030
Let me go.

574
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,790
Do you know who I am?

575
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,510
After the interrogation,

576
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,440
Ma Lian admitted his crimes

577
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,750
of murder and fraud.

578
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,510
Court of Judicial Review
just acquitted Ma Lian,

579
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,310
and the judgement was
simply overturned now.

580
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,030
After changing it again and again,

581
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,590
you're bringing shame to the court.

582
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,960
Mother,

583
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,000
I think

584
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,000
as long as people trust us,

585
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,510
our reputation remains.

586
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
If not,

587
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,400
the court just has a reclame.

588
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,960
Now we've made the mistake,

589
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
and people are unsatisfied.

590
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,750
Only when we set things right

591
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,240
can we redeem the court's reputation.

592
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,270
If you still think it is improper,

593
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,000
I have another idea.

594
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,030
The Immortal Instrument
is about to be constructed,

595
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,400
so we can celebrate for it,

596
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,680
remit criminals,

597
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,110
and free people from tax for one year.

598
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,960
Only when we oblige people

599
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,590
can we redeem our reputation.

600
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,030
And people

601
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,200
will also be thankful for your kindness.

602
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,640
You're considerate.

603
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,830
I'll agree.

604
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,240
Your Majesty is wise
and judges properly.

605
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,960
I am dumb and
failed in dealing with the case.

606
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,270
Your Majesties,

607
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,720
please forgive me.

608
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,400
I

609
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,830
should punish you,

610
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,750
but it's not because
you failed in dealing with the case

611
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,830
but that you broke the law,
although you knew that.

612
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,590
And you deliberately covered up for
Ma Lian by using a fake murderer.

613
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,680
Your Majesty,

614
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,240
I didn't dare to
cover up for the criminal

615
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,110
even if I have guts.

616
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,750
It's because Ma Lian was so cunning

617
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,920
that he deliberately
used a fake murderer

618
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,400
to confuse me.

619
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,400
Mr. Tao,

620
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,750
you've been muddling all the time,

621
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,790
and do you think
you can make it the whole time?

622
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,350
I've found out

623
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,200
the fake murderer
was an abandoned corpse,

624
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,240
and it was drowned two days
before the imperial examination.

625
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,480
You took it away in the name of

626
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,350
Court of Judicial Review,

627
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,590
froze it for one day
before pushing it into water,

628
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,680
making up the scene
of its drowning from palpitation.

629
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,200
Cemetery's guard could prove that.

630
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,640
You cheated everyone
above and below you

631
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,750
and ignored the court's law.

632
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,920
What punishment should you bear?

633
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,830
I should

634
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,640
be punished to death.

635
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,590
Guards.

636
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,400
Yes.

637
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,590
Put Tao Zhoufeng

638
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,270
into Judicial Prison.

639
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,480
Yes.
