1
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,550
Are these only your speculations?

2
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,550
Yes.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,160
(Yunxiao Mountain, Suburb of Ning'an)
The phoenix head was stolen

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,160
under the close watch
of Imperial Guards.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,550
This is the only reasonable speculation.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,710
Then what's your point

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,070
of bringing us here to Yunxiao Mountain?

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,150
It's getting warmer recently,

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,150
with continuous wind
blowing from the south.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,470
If the thief used a sky lantern

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,000
that night,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
the lantern must be blown to the north.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,240
Yunxiao Mountain
lies just to the north of the Palace.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,470
So I guess

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,240
the thief recovered the lantern

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,350
from Yunxiao Mountain.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,560
We might be able to find some clues here.

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,000
Even if you guessed it right,

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,390
it's been so long.

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,030
Maybe the thief

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,670
has already cleaned it up.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,600
If I am right,

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,520
it's not easy to clean up traces

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,280
left by

25
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,600
a huge sky lantern made of a scaffold.

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,640
The mountain is frequented by hunters.

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,400
Burning it could be noticed by them.

28
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,150
Burying it is the best choice.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,040
Did you hear it?

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,710
All keep your eyes wide open.

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,590
Don't miss any part of the mountain

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,350
until we find it.

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,950
Yes, sir.

34
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,040
You guys

35
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,680
come with me.

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,870
Mowen,

37
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,590
thank you for coming to help me.

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,640
You left angrily the other day…

39
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,400
Cut the crap.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
I can help with the investigation.

41
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,840
As for your life,

42
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,040
I can't help you.

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,020

Sir.

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,230
We found nothing in the southern part.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,560
Sir,

49
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,400
nothing is found in the northern part.

50
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,950
Did you find anything?

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,440
Keep looking.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, sir.

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,510
We have only eight hours left

54
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,840
before reporting to Her Majesty.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,880
What if Zhang Ping
fails to solve the case?

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,670
Mr. Lan.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,120
Sir,

58
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,190
we got something
on the back of the mountain.

59
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,950
Let's go take a look.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,560
Sir,

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,120
it's here.

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,750
Sir.

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,470
This is a hook from a crossbow.

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,440
We also found these nearby.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,430
It's crude Tung oil, all burnt out.

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,550
It's really a large sky lantern.

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,910
Ignitor.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,430
The thief was so imaginative and bold.

69
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,520
Sir,

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,760
I found the ignitor's cap on the mesh.

71
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,720
Here you are.

72
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,160
With no person
on the Immortal Instrument's top,

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,670
how did the fire start?

74
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,870
The Immortal Instrument

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,720
is a precision timing device.

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,430
I think the ignitor's cap

77
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
was tied to the timing gear

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,960
by a cotton thread.

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,230
That's how it was opened on time

80
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,910
to ignite the Tung oil.

81
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,550
When the sky lantern flew up,

82
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,760
the phoenix head

83
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,720
was hanging on this hook.

84
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,640
But

85
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,640
what were these four ropes for?

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,350
Mortise and tenon joint.

87
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,670
According to Director Wang,

88
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,200
the phoenix head and the body

89
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,110
were connected
in mortise and tenon structure.

90
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,200
The phoenix head

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,640
must be rotated

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,430
to be detached from the slot.

93
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,960
While hot air made the sky lantern rise,

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,040
the two wood boards on the scaffold
became balancing weights.

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
The ropes tying the boards were attached

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,280
to the phoenix head by a pulley.

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
The ropes under stress

98
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,110
dragged the phoenix head to rotate

99
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,280
and out of the slot.

100
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,470
The southerly wind that night

101
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,670
blew the sky lantern
to Yunxiao Mountain.

102
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,470
Lastly,

103
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,160
the thief

104
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,550
shot out the hook of the crossbow

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,160
to recover the sky lantern

106
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,470
and get the phoenix head.

107
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,310
He discarded the remains of the lantern

108
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,720
because he had no time to bury them.

109
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,470
The cut edge of this wood pulley shelf

110
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,640
is neat without barb.

111
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,520
It's formed

112
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,840
by one cut.

113
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,160
These four pieces are exactly the same.

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,230
It's obvious

115
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,550
that the craftsman is very skillful.

116
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,760
We have no time

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
to praise the craftsmanship.

118
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,640
Is it useful to analyze it here?

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,040
We must find the phoenix head
and the thief first.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,670
The construction site
is heavily guarded.

121
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,870
Only a craftsman
could access the site freely

122
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,600
and had time to cover the tracks

123
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,350
without being noticed.

124
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,990
And the one who is so skillful

125
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,720
is by no means

126
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,470
an ordinary craftsman.

127
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,760
I'll go check with Director Wang.

128
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,110
Wait a second.

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,160
There're guard patrols
in all communities.

130
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,400
The thief

131
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,550
would easily expose himself

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,230
if he carries the phoenix head
into the city.

133
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,760
So I guess

134
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,230
he has probably hidden the phoenix head

135
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,640
here in Yunxiao Mountain.

136
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,280
Jin Ying, Xuexiao.

137
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,430
Did you hear it?

138
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,520
Lead some men to search again

139
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,870
and report back
as soon as you find something.

140
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,600
Yes, sir.

141
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
Bai He, Yin Yuan,

142
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,640
carry the scaffold

143
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,430
and follow me down the mountain.

144
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,160
Yes, sir.

145
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,910
Even the department
of Palace Construction

146
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,640
can't make something so fine.

147
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,870
At the entire construction site,

148
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,870
only one man can do this.

149
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,760
He is Chang Wei.

150
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,960
Where is he?

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Call him back.

152
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,080
He's already off work today.

153
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,080
He also asked for tomorrow off.

154
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,400
No.

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
He's running away.

156
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,670
Let's go check his house.

157
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,280
He's gone.

158
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,110
Search the place.

159
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,840
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,670
Sir.

161
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,670
Sir.

162
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,880
Look,

163
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,280
the trace here looks weird.

164
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,670
It seems to be left

165
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,520
by dragging something.

166
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,190
Let's go.

167
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,400
Follow the trace.

168
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,070
I'll stay with a few men

169
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,240
and keep searching for some clues.

170
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,670
Okay.

171
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,950
These are

172
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
the materials
for making the sky lantern.

173
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,550
The dragging trace

174
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,910
was left by these.

175
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,790
The lantern post is carved with Chilong.

176
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,400
What's the sound?

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,430
Chilong's mouth holds the lantern base.

178
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,280
The base is inserted into the mortise.

179
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,360
It won't fall apart
at a thousand feet high.

180
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,360
It won't fall apart
at a thousand feet high.

181
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,950
Are you Chang Wei?

182
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,950
Take him.

183
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,790
You're simply a craftsman.

184
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,160
How dare you steal the phoenix head?

185
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,070
Who told you to do it?

186
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,910
Who?

187
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,070
I also want to know who he is.

188
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,280
What did I do to him?

189
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,240
Why did he frame me?

190
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,070
What happened?

191
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,000
One month ago,

192
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,590
my mother got very sick

193
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,590
and I needed money.

194
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,400
A man

195
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,670
came to me

196
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,950
and gave me 100 taels of silver.

197
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,550
Did he ask you to steal the phoenix head?

198
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,400
I would do anything

199
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
to save my mother.

200
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,520
But he didn't show up for the deal.

201
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,480
I rechecked

202
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,590
that box of silver.

203
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,520
All but the surface layer

204
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
are fake.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,830
It's all fake.

206
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,910
Fake.

207
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,400
I was set up.

208
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,830
Who would frame
a down-and-out craftsman?

209
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,160
Somehow

210
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,280
my mother suddenly found what I did.

211
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,950
She was so angry that she vomited blood

212
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,070
all over her body.

213
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
It was all over her body.

214
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,830
I just wanted to save her.

215
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,070
But instead, I got her killed.

216
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,480
It's me who killed my mother.

217
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,520
I deserve to die.

218
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,790
Mother,

219
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
wake up.

220
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,640
Mother.

221
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,790

I never dared to tell you.

20 years ago,

227
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,790
I did something terribly bad.

228
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,240
I feared being silenced,

229
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,190
so I'd been taking you

230

to hide from them.

231
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,040
That's why you got the chronic disease.

232
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,190
It's all my fault.

233

Mother,

234
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,070
you told me to scatter your ashes
into the sky

so that you could
see the view from above.

We're running out of time.

What should we report
to Her Majesty?

250

Sir,

the phoenix head is found.

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,120
It's hidden in a cave.

253
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,950
What we can do now is to report

254
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
about the phoenix head and Chang Wei.

255

by only telling her these?

Mr. Liu?

that the Empress Dowager
wanted you to do this?

343
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,160
I've never done such a despicable thing.

344
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,000
No wonder.

345
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,190
Your Majesty,

346
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,590
I've been wondering

347
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,360
why Mr. Lan's follower

348
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,550
refuses to admit

349
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,240
spreading the rumors.

350
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,280
Now I see.

351
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,550
Maybe

352
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,830
someone else added fuel to the flames.

353
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,550
You…

354
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,380
(Judicial Prison)

355
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,590
Mr. Lan,

356
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,440
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,630
It's not your fault.

358
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,240
You've done the best you can.

359
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,960
But your father's case…

360
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,870
Zhang Ping,

361
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,590
if you have another chance,

362
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,790
would you choose to look into the case?

363
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,040
I would.

364
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,390
But

365
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,630
I wouldn't get you into this.

366
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,200
It's worth risking my life to protect you

367
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,590
as long as

368
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,520
you stay true
to your original intentions.

369
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,520
But…

370
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,480
If it's wrong to seek the truth,

371
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,070
then

372
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
it's a wrong world we're living.

373
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,960
Put Mr. Liu in Judicial Prison

374
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,680
before confirming the day
of his execution.

375
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,390
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

376
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,550
Well,

377
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,830
it's time

378
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,350
to go to the execution site.

379
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,920
Your Majesty,

380
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,960
you can't do this to me!

381
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,150
Your Majesty.

382
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,870
Wait.

383
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,390
Mother,

384
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,790
as usual,

385
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,870
I went hunting in the West Forest.

386
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,440
I suddenly saw a place
with gathered beasts.

387
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,350
Those beasts were not scared away

388
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,520
even seeing and hearing us.

389
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,630
I led the others near
to take a closer look,

390
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,920
finding that

391
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,480
they were guarding something
really auspicious.

392
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,310
Carry it in.

393
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,000
The phoenix head.

394
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,110
Where was it found?

395
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,310
There have been some rumors recently,

396
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,200
which are sheer nonsense.

397
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,000
The phoenix head

398
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,790
was not stolen.

399
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,680
It's a rare treasure.

400
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,280
And it has been given a spirit

401
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,310
after absorbing the essence
of the sun and moon.

402
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,680
Therefore,

403
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,790
it just flew away.

404
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,790
You're talking like a kid.

405
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,350
I'm telling the truth.

406
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,040
I think

407
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,720
it must be God's blessing.

408
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,760
Knowing that I want
to share your worries,

409
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,590
God ordered this treasure to come to me

410
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,870
so that

411
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,110
I can present it to you.

412
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Is Mr. Liu wrongly accused?

413
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,680
Mother, you're so gracious.

414
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,040
I don't think

415
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,240
there would be rumors again.

416
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,110
Mother,

417
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,350
I beg you to reset the phoenix head

418
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,350
onto the top of the Immortal Instrument.

419
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,590
And that would be your blessings

420
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,040
to all our people

421
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,680
and all lives.

422
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,280
That's for the best.

423
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,760
Those who are wrongly accused

424
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,920
can be released then.

425
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
Mother, it's very perspicacious of you.

426
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,790
May you live a thousand years.

427
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,240
May you live a thousand years.

428
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,790
But the malicious accusation
against Mr. Liu

429
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,680
must be retried

430
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,790
to find out

431
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,520
the culprit behind it.

432
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,310
The culprit behind it

433
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,520
will be beheaded

434
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,110
together with Chen.

435
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,200
The case is about to come to an end.

436
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,480
I'm tired.

437
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,040
If you have any doubts,
let's talk about it later.

438
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,520
Let me take a break.

439
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,920
Only the Emperor

440
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,310
could turn the table.

441
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,630
You may wait here for a while.

442
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,200
I have something to discuss with Mowen.

443
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,070
I wrote this anonymously.

444
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,870
Please be sure

445
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,390
to forward it to the Emperor.

446
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,870
Be sure

447
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,520
not to expose yourself.

448
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,480
You're risking your life.

449
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,790
I'm ready to risk mine too.

450
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,200
We had a fruitful day.

451
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:34,960
Come on.

452
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,630
Your Majesty,

453
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,310
we found something weird

454
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,040
while fetching water from the river.

455
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,150
What is it?

456
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,110
Tell me about it.

457
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,790
There's also a letter with it.

458
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,870
Your Majesty.

459
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,040
"Break the enemy's formation with blades

460
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,520
to avenge the people."

461
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,920
You wrote this when you were a child.

462
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,960
It's your vision
to revitalize the kingdom

463
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,150
and let the people live a peaceful life.

464
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,040
It shows your lofty sentiments

465
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,760
and high aspirations.

466
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
But now,

467
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,150
you're obsessed with hunting and polo.

468
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,280
You are not aware of

469
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
the dark current in the imperial court.

470
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,480
The people

471
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
are not clear about your thought.

472
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,150
The Empress Dowager gives decrees.

473
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,040
Officials are busy fighting for power.

474
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,590
I'm afraid

475
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,390
it's not far from the time of collapse.

476
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,280
When the time comes,

477
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,110
the imperial situation would be in chaos

478
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,480
and people would not be in unity.

479
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
Internally, people would
live an unstable life.

480
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,390
Externally, we couldn't
resist strong enemies.

481
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,760
Your Majesty,

482
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,000
is that what you want to see?

483
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,070
Minister Lan,

484
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,310
as a loyal dog,

485
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,310
you must know the punishment

486
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,720
for failing to complete the task,

487
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,790
don't you?

488
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,200
I'm ready for any punishment.

489
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,680
Guards.

490
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,000
If Her Majesty failed to kill Mr. Liu
through my hands.

491
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,280
Xuan Ji would make
more vicious suggestions.

492
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,310
Mr. Liu would suffer
a bolt from the blue.

493
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,520
He would be banished,

494
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
and even get all his families killed.

495
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,150
At this point,

496
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,200
this might

497
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,790
go beyond your power.

498
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,920
But turning a blind eye

499
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,200
and doing nothing

500
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
are not right for a wise emperor.

501
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,870
The phoenix head is presented to you.

502
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,280
For the sake of the people and kingdom,

503
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,720
please turn the tide

504
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
and put an end to the case.

505
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,760
John Doe.

506
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,110
That's the whole story.

507
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,280
In this situation,

508
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,310
finding the phoenix head by His Majesty

509
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,790
is perfectly justifiable.

510
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,790
There is

511
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,830
no other way.

512
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,720
But in so doing,

513
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,350
His Majesty has to
confront the Empress Dowager

514
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,070
from now on.

515
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,110
I'm just thinking

516
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,000
that many judgements

517
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,150
at not necessarily right.

518
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,790
Evidence can be conclusive in a case,

519
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,240
but the mind of those
in the imperial hall

520
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,790
can't be read.

521
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,590
I bet

522
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,070
on the virtues of a man.

523
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,550
In our situation,

524
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,870
we could only make a desperate bet

525
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,480
and give it a go

526
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,680
to stay alive.

527
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,150
I'd better go on with my investigations.

528
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,590
But from now on,

529
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,280
you must keep a low key

530
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,200
to look further into the case.

531

Zhang Ping,

532
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,110
we're here.

533
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,520
Oh, sir,

534
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,070
when the sky lantern exploded,

535
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,920
the night sky was as bright as day.

536
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,350
You mean…

537
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,920
I couldn't figure out

538
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,550
why the night sky was as bright as day

539
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,680
in the legend of divine retribution
in Moluo Village.

540
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,150
Was it possible to cover the entire village

541
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,350
by scarlet mist?

542
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,680
It wasn't until last night in prison

543
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,390
that I suddenly understood it.

544
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,870
If

545
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,680
a large sky lantern was used

546
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,830
to carry a lot of red poison into the air

547
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,870
and was detonated,

548
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,480
the legend could come true.

549
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,200
Mowen,

550
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,240
what's going on?

551
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,440
I went to Chang Wei's
house for double check,

552
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,000
finding a letter

553
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,070
from Xuan Ji.

554
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,680
Did Chang Wei know Xuan Ji?

555
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,720
It was written 20 years ago.

556
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,590
Xuan Ji asked Chang Wei to pack up

557
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,520
and go to Moluo Village.

558
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,830
It just proves Zhang Ping's speculation.

559
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,390
Chang Wei can make large sky lanterns.

560
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,680
Embalmer could make scarlet-mist poison.

561
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,390
They must have something to do with

562
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,440
the divine retribution case
in Moluo Village.

563
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,720
Moreover.

564
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,720
the time Xuan Ji told Chang Wei to leave

565
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
happened to be

566
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,920
the same day your father left home.

567
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,110
What?

568
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,830
It's definitely not a coincidence.

569
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,040
Your father's case

570
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,280
must be related to the case
in Moluo Village.

571
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,920
The letter was written by Xuan Ji.

572
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,040
Xuan Ji

573
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,350
must know something.

574
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,870
You'd better go ask him right now.

575
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,280
Chen already gave the mastermind's name.

576
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,920
It's Xuan Ji.

577
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,720
The Emperor is sending men to take him.

578
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,070
You would have no chance

579
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,000

Where is he?

a sudden heart palpitation.

597

How could it be such a coincidence?

598
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,110
Mr. Lan, you must not know

599
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,680
that our master had heart palpitation,

600
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,680
which had become chronic.

601
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,240
The doctor warned him more than once

602
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,630
to stay calm and rest.

603
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,550
But who could know…

Sir.

605

Sir, don't be so worried.

as you told me,

609
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,000
I sneaked into Xuan Ji's Mansion.

610
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,480
He is indeed dead.

611
