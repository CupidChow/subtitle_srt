00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,000
Mr. Liu and the Empress Dowager
have always been at odds,

175
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,080
but today

176
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,870
they are rarely in the same camp.

177
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,910
It shows that

178
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,030
this matter is a foregone conclusion.

179
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,480
Even His Majesty can't change it,

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,910

That's why

183
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,030
I feel

184
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,670
powerless.

185
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,630
I wanted you to

186
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,510
drink with me at Banyue Pavilion.

187
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,910
But Peony Pavilion

188
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,840
was booked out.

189
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,200
So disappointing.

190
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,790
Didn't you tell them who you are?

191
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,840
I did.

192
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,550

they said no.

With Mowen and his father's status,

202
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,510
Mr. Jia still rejected him.

203
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,080
Only a handful of such figures

204
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,440
can do it in the court.

205

Why didn't you tell me in advance
that you were coming?

00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,400
You mean

344
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,590
the actor

345
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,240
may be Mr. Jinghu?

346
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,110
His purpose is to let Her Majesty
take the stage.

347
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,160
If she disagrees,

348
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,070
he will fill the Banyue Pavilion

349
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,030
with red mist

350
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,480
as said in the libretto.

351
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,750
Why doesn't she come down?

352
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,790
Come down.

353
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,270
- Come down.
- Come down.

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,680
Come down.

355
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,510
Come down.

356
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,920
Sir, you can't go there now.

357
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,750

363
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,750
They are gone.

364
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,790
Amazing.

365
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,030
Yes.

366
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,790
Bravo.

Amazing.

368
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,200
Where are they?

369
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
No worries, sir.

370
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,030
It's arranged.

371
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,400

Where are they?

377
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,750
Empress Dowager.

378
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,240
Sir.

379
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,880
Sir, here.

380
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,750
Sir.

381
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,110
When the black silk fell,

382
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,960
they should have gone down here quickly.

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
No more nonsense. Open it.

384
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,270
Take a look.

385
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,270
How many exits are there in this tunnel?

386
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,310
Only one over there.

387
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,160
Enter this way,

388
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,270
and after dancing there,

389
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,200
exit through the hidden exit.

390
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,480
Yunniang.

391
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,480
She's still breathing.

392
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,070
Has anyone come up before?

393
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,590
No.

394
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,110
Isn't the Empress Dowager downstairs?

395
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,550
Come on.

396
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,240
No.

397
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,400
Ask someone to look for her.

398
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,270
Aren't you...

399
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,000
Zhang Ping held a banquet
for the teacher here.

400
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,960
I never expected this

401
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,920
to happen.

402
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,350
General Cao.

403
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,200
What about

404
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,640
asking Zhang Ping to help?

405
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,480
Empress Dowager.

406
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,310
Where have you been?

407
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,510
I saw the paper crane

408
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,550
and said you can't go.

409
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,400
Eunuch.

410
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,200
General.

411
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,000
I searched the tunnel carefully

412
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
and found nothing abnormal.

413
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,000
No way.

414
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,480
Where could she

415
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,440
have been?

416
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Just now everyone was here watching.

417
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,480
After the black curtain fell off,

418
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,830
the shadow disappeared,

419
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,310
and she just went down.

420
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm afraid she's not here anymore.

421
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,160
Mr. Jia.

422
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,200
If anything happens
to the Empress Dowager,

423
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,110
you are done.

424
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,480
I see.

425
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
Under the guidance of the dancers,

426
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,160
everyone thought that

427
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,550
Her Majesty and the actors

428
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,070
would come out from the other side

429
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,270
after going down the tunnel
from this side of the stage.

430
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,110
But in fact,

431
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,480
the actor stunned the actress

432
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,270
after entering the tunnel,

433
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,000
and then led Her Majesty
back the same way

434
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,000
and went out from the backstage.

435
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,510
Because of the occlusion of the screen,

436
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,830
it wouldn't be discovered at all.

437
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,480
You mean

438
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,590
he took Her Majesty away backstage

439
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,070
while we were still paying attention
to the spectator area?

440
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,880
Yes.

441
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,480
General.

442
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,310
Someone is here.

443
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,640
Still breathing.

444
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,310
It seems that the actor in the last scene

445
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,270
was replaced by the murderer.

446
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,350
The lots were arranged before.

447
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,790
Everything is prepared.

448
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,680
No!

449
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,510
The Empress Dowager's carriage
is right at the back door.

450
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,830
Just now we wasted time

451
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,550
searching in the tunnel.

452
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,680
Now maybe...

453
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,720
Where is the carriage?

454
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,030
It's...

455
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,270
It's going over there.

456
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,790
Piss off.

457
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,350
The Empress Dowager's carriage.

458
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,240
Department of Incantation.

459
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,780
(Sealed by Court of Judicial Review
on October 17, the first year of Yongxuan)

460
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,500

461
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,830
Right here.

462
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,510
In the back.

463
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,750
Help!

464
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,680
Help!

465
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,400
Empress Dowager.

466
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,440
Help!

467
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,590
Let me.

468
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,880
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

469
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,350
Hold on.

470
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,750
Be safe.

471
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,750
If anything happens to you...

472
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,310
Obviously

473
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,960
this is a magic formation.

474
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,270
What magic formation?

475
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,240
Mr. Xiong.

476
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,310
What's this?

477
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,000
There are words on this stele.

478
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,750
In Lingnan Secret Realm,

479
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,440
there is a Moluo Village.

480
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,960
The water is clear

481
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,110
and the mountains are steep.

482
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,750
Dormant for 20 years.

483
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,270
Just wait for today

484
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
to kill the enemy with my hands,

485
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,480
and celebrate it with wine and music.

486
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,880
Sir.

487
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,440
I can't figure out

488
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,310
why Mr. Jinghu kidnapped

489
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,590
the Empress Dowager
in full view this time,

490
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
and did such evil things
in the Department of Incantation.

491
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,350
There is already a sensation
in the public,

492
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,830
and everyone was discussing

493
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,480
how the Empress Dowager was kidnapped

494
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,550
by Mr. Jinghu with the magic trick,

495
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,440
and that she was almost burned to death.

496
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,350
Everyone in the court knows it.

497
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,960
What

498
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,550
a move.

499
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,720
What's he up to?

500
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,270
Perhaps he just wants to announce that

501
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,160
the Empress Dowager

502
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
is his goal.

503
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,750
Probably.

504
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,960
It's a pity that we were one step late

505
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,240
and let him succeed.

506
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,310
Now that Her Majesty
is seriously injured,

507
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,070
it is impossible
to find another opportunity

508
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,550
to apply Water Illusion for her

509
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,550
and find out the truth.

510
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,880
Don't worry.

511
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,110
I think the message left by Mr. Jinghu

512
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,960
in the Department of Incantation

513
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,030
seems to convey something.

514
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,590
Perhaps

515
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,160
it is related to the secret of that year.

516
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,920
After figuring it out,

517
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,680
maybe the Moluo Village's case,

518
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,160
my father's old case

519
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,270
and Mr. Jinghu's revenge

520
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,110
will be revealed.

521
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,640
But what is the meaning

522
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,400
of this magic formation?

523
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,070
I drew the patterns
in the magic formation

524
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,960
while I still remembered.

525
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,270
Before the accident,
the Department of Incantation

526
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,640
often performed Zhuyou Arcane
for the palace.

527
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,270
Although it has been abandoned
for many years,

528
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,750
there may still be

529
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,720
some classics
related to the magic formation.

530
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,510
Then let's

531
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,270
try our luck tonight.

532
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,780
(Department of Incantation)

533
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,440
What happened here?

534
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,200
20 years ago,

535
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,350
the leader of the Department
of Incantation was still Xuan Ji.

536
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,750
During a ceremony that year,
the poison was leaked,

537
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,720
and all the
incantation practitioners here died.

538
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,200
It has since been

539
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,750
sealed off.

540
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,510
After Xuan Ji died,

541
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,640
I once visited here.

542
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
But the dossiers from that year

543
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,440
are nowhere to be found.

544
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,440
Be careful of the poison.

545
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,400
It's been 20 years.

546
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,440
Even worms

547
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,510
can't live that long.

548
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,240
There's no harm in being careful.

549
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,920
Sir, look.

550
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,920
The same pattern.

551
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,750
It should be this magic formation.

552
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,160
But the text above is a bit weird,

553
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,200
and I can't tell where it is from.

554
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,750
Take it back for study.

555
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,720
Okay.

556
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,240
Let's go.

557
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,200
Let's go.

558
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:18,790
Zhang Ping.

559
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,110
What happened to you?

560
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,440
Mr. Lan.

561
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,510
You...

562
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,240
The torn page is also poisonous?

563
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:33,920
Sir.

564
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,510
Let's go.

565
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,410
- Come on.
- Let's go.

566
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,640
Let's go.

567
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,680
