1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,280
I pleaded guilty.

2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,030
Why are you here again?

3
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,000
We have a question,

4
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,200
so we're here to ask you.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,110
You obviously have a prominent
family background,

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,790
so why take the risk of cheating?

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,200
Are you instructed by Mr. Jinghu?

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,320
I thought about it.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,280
It's just a trap.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,840
Yes.

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,200
My family background is not bad.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,350
But I also know I'm good for nothing.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,070
I'd like to make my family proud.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,600
So I came to the Capital City
to inquire around,

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,030
hoping to become a blockbuster
in the imperial examination.

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,960
Later, someone came to me

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,560
and said that he could sell

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,880
examination questions to me
at a high price.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,520
I was at a loss

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,950
and fell into his trap.

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,200
So you planned

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,760
to kill Chen Zishang?

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,120
It's all Chen Zishang's fault.

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,510
We had agreed to have both sides clear

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,640
on the night of the lottery.

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,120
But he regretted it after
he got the Guiyou number.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,280
It took me so much effort

28
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,400
to get him to agree to
answer the questions for me.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,070
It's almost done.

30
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,710
How could
all previous efforts be wasted?

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,760
So

32
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,790
you just killed him

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,510
and robbed his essay?

34
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,510
I did so on impulse.

35
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,680
Mr. Lan.

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,590
Could you intercede
with Her Majesty for me?

37
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,070
I was at a loss.

38
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,150
It was the seller who told me

39
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,840
the plan was safe.

40
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,510
And even if things come to light,

41
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,120
the chief interrogator
will stand by my side.

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,510
But when something happened,

43
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,070
he just disappeared.

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
Is the seller you mentioned

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,760
a handsome young man?

46
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,400
He is an old man.

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,510
He was dressed like

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,510
a boatman.

49
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,540

=Episode 20=

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
I didn't expect that
after checking Ma Lian,

52
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,400
there was still no clue
about Mr. Jinghu.

53
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,120
But we got something.

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,950
At least

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,470
we tracked down the seller.

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,720
This matter has to be dug deeper.

57
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,000
By the way,

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
I have one more task

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,600
for you.

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,270
(Exam Paper in the 20th Year of Yongxuan)
There is a mildew spot

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
on the seal of the examination scroll,

62
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,350
which may be a key clue
to the fraud case.

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,790
(Yong)
Can you find any way

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,320
to find out some clues?

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,040
(No way.)

66
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,790
(It's so obvious.)

67
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,580
(Yong)

68
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,400
(This way there is no trace at all.)

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,720
Mr. Lan.

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,840
Mr. Lan.

71
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,790
I know.

72
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,750
I cracked the trick

73
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,630
of scroll cheating.

74
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,500
(The 20th Year of Yongxuan)

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,960
A little sticky.

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,200
How did you make it?

77
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,430
Please look.

78
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,700
(Yong)

79
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,640
Grind glutinous rice into a thin paste,

80
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,990
blend it with ink,

81
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,280
and then bake it into a thin layer.

82
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,470
In this way, there is no abnormality
in the handwriting.

83
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,230
Only the little sweat on your fingers

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,790
can melt the rice paper.

85
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,310
It's sticky to the touch

86
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,470
and gets moldy afterward.

87
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,230
This is how Mr. Yang

88
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,470
got Mr. Liu's exam question.

89
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,600
I knew there was something wrong
with this person.

90
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,470
Let's go

91
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,200
get him.

92
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,350
It's my fault.

93
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,600
It's my fault.

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,080
My family is really poor,

95
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
so I took money from Mr. Shao
to help him cheat.

96
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,110
He said that

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,870
the scholars in the imperial examination
would definitely make trouble.

98
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,790
Mr. Yang.

99
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,910
They would definitely push me out
to draw questions.

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,310
I just need to

101
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,990
pull out the sticky scroll.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,640
Mr. Lan, please check it out.

103
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,720
Shao Zhi.

104
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,080
You and Ji Wen will preside over

105
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,960
the affairs of
the Ministry of Rites temporarily.

106
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,040
Everyone.

107
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,550
Since Mr. Lan has handed over
the Examiner Seal,

108
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
the examination will continue.

109
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,600
I will draw

110
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,550
the question of the examination

111
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,110
on behalf of the Ministry of Rites.

112
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,550
What if I did so?

113
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,960
You have no idea

114
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,720
what Mr. Jinghu has done for me.

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
My parents borrowed usury loans

116
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,310
for my education,

117
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,790
but they were forced to death
by the lenders.

118
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,840
And the person behind the lenders

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,400
is Chu Fangtong,

120
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,310
Minister of Revenue.

121
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,080
It was Mr. Jinghu

122
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,110
who collected evidence for me

123
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,990
and brought him to justice.

124
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,110
He has such great kindness for me.

125
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,720
Not to mention cheating
in the imperial examination,

126
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,600
even if he made me risk my life,

127
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,280
I would not hesitate to do so.

128
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
Do you admit that you were responsible

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,040
for cheating in the imperial examination?

130
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,040
Yes.

131
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,910
It was me who tampered with the seal.

132
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:45,960
When I saw that

133
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,080
Chen Zishang was about to draw lots,

134
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,110
I secretly transferred them.

135
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,110
Inside were are Guiyou lotteries.

136
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,910
Of course he could get it.

137
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,470
It was also you who arranged in advance

138
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,160
for the scholars to recommend Uncle Yang
to draw questions?

139
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,040
I don't have this ability.

140
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,110
The scholar He Xuan admired him,

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,350
so he volunteered.

142
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,550
He got you out of the game

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,550
by dismantling the poems
on the paper crane.

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,160
In this way,

145
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,600
we could cooperate together

146
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,670
to make Uncle Yang draw questions.

147
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,550
He must have colluded
with Mr. Lan to cheat.

148
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,430
They should be arrested
and punished severely.

149
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,870
He's the one to blame.

150
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,720
Kick him out.

151
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,230
Kick him out.

152
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,040
Kick him out.

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,870
No wonder he took the lead
in making trouble every time.

154
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,960
Shao Zhi.

155
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,870
Up to now,

156
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,910
Mr. Jinghu has no escape.

157
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,080
Tell me his whereabouts,

158
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,310
maybe I can intercede for you

159
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,670
and give you a lighter sentence.

160
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,640
Mr. Lan.

161
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,640
his whereabouts

162
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,040
are not known to mortals.

163
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,670
Do you really think he is an immortal?

164
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,670
Of course.

165
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,720
Whenever I encounter any problem,

166
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,870
I just need to put a paper crane
by the Jinghu Lake,

167
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,200
and Mr. Jinghu

168
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,960
will send me a good idea.

169
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,310
After solving two cases,
there are still no clues.

170
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,600
Mr. Jinghu is really with great care.

171
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,550
In order to buy Shao Zhi,

172
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,040
he took great pains

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,670
to get rid of Chu Fangtong,
the Minister of Revenue.

174
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't you find it strange?

175
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,080
Indeed.

176
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,400
If it was just to

177
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,960
deal with Ma Lian and Chen Zishang,

178
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,670
he could just report Chen Zishang

179
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,670
with his manuscript.

180
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,670
Why did he do so?

181
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,790
Another person

182
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,310
was also sentenced in this case.

183
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,720
You mean

184
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:18,840
Mr. Tao?

185
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,910
He is just an outsider in charge of
hearing the case.

186
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,400
Really?

187
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,840
Then why did the person
selling the questions

188
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,310
repeatedly assure Ma Lian

189
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,990
that the plan was safe?

190
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,230
And even if things come to light,

191
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,790
the chief interrogator
will stand by my side.

192
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,280
His statement

193
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,830
seemed to confirm that

194
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,880
the chief interrogator
must be Tao Zhoufeng.

195
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,550
By the way,

196
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,240
after Chu Fangtong was dismissed,

197
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,070
one of the four examiners was vacated.

198
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,910
Among the chief officials
of the six ministries,

199
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
some have retired,

200
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,120
and some have been dismissed.

201
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,040
Only Dou Fang, Minister of Justice,

202
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,430
can replace Chu Fangtong.

203
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Therefore,

204
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,950
once the case occurs,

205
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,240
the Ministry of Justice cannot investigate it
in order to avoid suspicion.

206
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,880
And Mr. Tao

207
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,830
will have the right to hear this case.

208
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,880
Ma Lian is the son-in-law
of the prince's maternal uncle.

209
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,950
Tao Zhoufeng doesn't dare to
offend the Empress Dowager,

210
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,790
so he would definitely cover up him.

211
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,190
On the first day of the imperial examination,
paper cranes descended out of nothing.

212
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,710
Exam questions are implied
in the prophetic poems.

213
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,310
To stabilize the country with virtue.

214
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,590
The person who leaked the question
was pointed at Mr. Liu, a high-ranking official.

215
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,430
This

216
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,160
caused the scholars

217
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,430
to be dissatisfied with the court.

218
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,710
After

219
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,550
Ma Lian was acquitted,

220
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,000
Mr. Jinghu

221
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,480
designed the ghost pen holder.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,710
Presumably, he wanted to incite
the scholars to make trouble

223
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,640
and force the court to conduct
a thorough investigation

224
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,000
to expose Tao Zhoufeng's cover-up.

225
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,360
It seems that

226
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,550
we are also part of Mr. Jinghu's plan.

227
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,640
But

228
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,640
why did he deal with Mr. Tao?

229
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,120
Could Mr. Tao

230
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,310
also be related to
the Moluo Village case

231
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,120
20 years ago?

232
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,590
At that time, he was serving

233
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,590
as the official of Court of Judicial Review
in the capital,

234
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,910
and he had never been to the South.

235
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,430
Maybe there's a clue

236
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,280
we've missed.

237
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,710
This is the dossier of the Moluo Village's
case of divine retribution

238
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,240
brought by Mowen last time.

239
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,550
It's still with me.

240
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,240
Are there any clues?

241
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,590
Nothing new.

242
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,640
How about

243
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,310
asking Mr. Tao directly?

244
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,430
Mowen interrogated him
early this morning.

245
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,950
He was so stubborn

246
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
that refused to say anything,

247
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,550
just waiting to be punished.

248
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,640
What to do?

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,790
If Mr. Tao is dead,

250
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,790
it will be even more difficult
to catch Mr. Jinghu.

251
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,480
Seal of Tao Zhoufeng,

252
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,950
Official of the Court of Judicial Review.

253
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,120
The seal of the reviewer

254
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,950
belongs to Mr. Tao.

255
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,160
He was the one

256
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,360
who reviewed the Moluo Village case.

257
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,550
We have finally found
a new breakthrough,

258
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,360
which can turn passive into active.

259
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,550
What do you mean?

260
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,910
Since it's revenge,

261
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,160
Mr. Jinghu

262
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,590
wants Tao Zhoufeng to die.

263
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,910
As long as we tell the whole story
to His Majesty

264
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,880
and beg him to save Tao Zhoufeng
from the death penalty,

265
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,950
we can

266
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,550
make Mr. Jinghu

267
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,880
take actions again.

268
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,550
Zhang Ping.

269
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,070
Long time no see.

270
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,240
You are Mr. Jinghu?

271
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,280
Your friend is sleeping soundly,

272
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,240
defenseless,

273
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,000
like an innocent baby.

274
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,070
I can stay here.

275
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,160
But you have to answer a few questions.

276
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,670
What did you mean

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
when you said long time no see?

278
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
Are you from the Moluo Clan?

279
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,070
You just need to know that

280
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm really here for the Moluo Clan.

281
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,310
What happened

282
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,640
20 years ago?

283
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,520
The past

284
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,000
is way too heavy.

285
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,430
When my plan is accomplished,

286
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,120
you will understand
the cause and effect.

287
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,590
Are you admitting that

288
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,950
you did

289
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,550
all the previous cases?

290
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,880
Are you the one who told
the legend of Injeeten

291
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,000
to the embalmer,

292
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,760
and the one who bought the phoenix head
at a high price?

293
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,760
Yes.

294
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,550
The killer who killed Xuan Ji

295
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,710
was also sent by you?

296
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,310
Exactly.

297
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,790
Why is your revenge

298
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,550
so troublesome?

299
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,710
Just killing them

300
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,670
is boring.

301
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,120
So

302
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
whatever crimes they committed
when they destroyed the village,

303
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,590
you let them repeat the same mistakes

304
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,830
and die of the same crime.

305
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
The embalmer made poison.

306
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,400
You let him die in a poison sacrifice.

307
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,550
Chang Wei made the sky lantern.

308
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,190
You tricked him into making another one,

309
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
stealing the phoenix head,

310
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,280
and dying for it.

311
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,070
Presumably what happened to Xuan Ji
is the same.

312
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,120
Back then, he did evil to destroy the village

313
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,240
in order to please the Empress Dowager.

314
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,400
Now

315
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,790
you led him to frame Mr. Liu

316
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,880
for Empress Dowager,

317
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,280
and to end up with a tragic death.

318
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,880
I just repaid them

319
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,000
with their way.

320
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,040
Then why are you going to kill Mr. Tao?

321
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,480
Is it because

322
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,550
he reviewed the dossier back then?

323
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,040
I make an exception to see you

324
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
because I want to tell you

325
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,640
not to interfere with my plan,

326
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,550
let alone attempt to rescue Tao Zhoufeng.

327
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,880
No matter what grievances

328
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,120
the Moluo Clan has,

329
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,430
you should not stop killing with killing,

330
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,280
let alone implicate the innocent.

331
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,880
Was last night

332
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,430
a dream?

333
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
I dreamed last night that

334
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,360
we both succeeded in the examination.

335
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,430
His Majesty

336
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,040
hired us as officials in the palace.

Chen Chou.

338
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,550
Did you hear anything

339
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,280
last night?

340
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,040
What?

341
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,880
I slept very well last night.

342
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,640
If it weren't for the stall today,

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,430
I would like an unprotected sleep.

344
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,240
But Zhang,

345
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
do you have to

346
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,240
sleep with a book in your arms?

347
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,710
Mu Yesheng.

348
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,790
This...

349
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,240
Chapter 50.

350
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,820
(Chapter 50 of Strange Night Talk:
The Phantom of Blood Powder, Mu Yesheng)

Chen Chou.

352
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,710
Why is this handwriting

353
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,040
so similar to that of Mr. Tao?

354
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,660
(Brochure of the Persuasion for Goodness)

355
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,360
It's indeed Mr. Tao's handwriting.

356
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,480
Could Mr. Tao

357
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,430
be Mu Yesheng?

358
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,880
Did Mu Yesheng

359
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,790
really work in
the Court of Judicial Review before?

360
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,160
What is his real name?

361
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,280
Where is he now?

362
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,550
You mean the one

363
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,910
who wrote Strange Night Talk?

364
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes.

365
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,480
The folk tales

366
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,950
are all fabricated indiscriminately.

367
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,550
I've never heard of him
in the Court of Judicial Review.

368
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,830
(Isn't this the place)

(Mu Yesheng must be working
in the Court of Judicial Review.)

374
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,190
No way.

375
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,120
How could Mr. Tao be Mu Yesheng?

376
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,190
Mu Yesheng said that

377
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,120
if everyone cares about the truth,

378
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,360
there will be nowhere to hide the darkness.

379
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,590
But Mr. Tao has always been confused
in judging the case,

380
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,310
and even covered up the truth
to shield the murderer.

381
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,950
Also,

382
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,710
the manuscript is also very strange.

383
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,070
Why did the people in the book

384
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,710
seem to

385
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,480
have been poisoned
by scarlet mist and died?

386
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,120
And

387
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,590
Strange Night Talk has only 49 chapters.

388
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
Before finishing it,
Mu Yesheng stopped writing.

389
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,200
How could there be chapter 50?

390
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,350
I see.

391
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,590
Is Mr. Jinghu

392
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,440
trying to tell you that

393
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,200
all the truth

394
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,520
is hidden

395
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,150
in this unpublicized manuscript?

396
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,070
No.

397
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,760
I am going to see Mr. Tao.

398
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,310
But Mr. Tao has already been imprisoned
in Judicial Prison.

399
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,200
It is forbidden

400
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,280
to visit the felons.

401
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I will ask Mr. Lan for help.

402
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,590
I've asked Mowen for a favor.

403
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,680
But time's tight.

404
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,790
We have to find a way

405
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,150
to get what we want soon.

406
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,520
Mr. Tao.

407
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,440
Have you read the chapter 50

408
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,040
of Strange Night Talk?

409
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,520
The book is about

410
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,200
a murder case in the capital.

411
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,480
Hui'an Pharmacy was filled
with scarlet mist overnight,

412
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,720
and the whole family of nine members

413
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,720
froze and died instantly.

414
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,790
And the protagonist in the book,

415
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,870
Mu Yesheng, the Official
of the Court of Judicial Review,

416
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,280
after an overnight investigation,

417
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,920
found that the scarlet mist
was a kind of poison,

418
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,350
which was developed
by an imperial physician.

419
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,870
Mu Yesheng

420
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,200
was going to investigate.

421
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,390
But the story

422
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,200
ends here.

423
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,590
Why are you talking about this with me?

424
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,960
The book was written by you.

425
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
You are Mu Yesheng.

426
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,390
Right?

427
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,680
A few months ago,

428
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,550
the embalmer killed several people
with scarlet mist poison.

429
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,920
You were also involved.

430
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,920
Presumably you have also seen

431
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,150
the file of the case closed
by the Minister of Justice.

432
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,390
The method of committing the crime

433
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,110
is exactly the same as that
written in your book.

434
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,390
Mr. Tao.

435
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,680
Did you find something

436
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,480
back then

437
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,790
so that you didn't

438
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,070
continue to finish writing this book?

439
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,390
I won't say anything.

440
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
You should go.

441
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
Who is the murderer

442
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,000
behind the Moluo Village case

443
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,870
that scares you so much

444
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,110
that you dare not confide in

445
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,040
a single word?

446
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,550
I'm dying.

447
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,280
Why are you still pushing me?

448
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,110
Mr. Lan, you don't need to ask anymore.

449
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,350
He can't be Mu Yesheng.

450
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,240
This

451
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,390
might be Mr. Jinghu's trick.

452
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,870
He forged it

453
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,760
by imitating Mr. Tao's handwriting.

454
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,520
Zhang Ping.

455
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,350
Isn't it possible?

456
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,790
As you can see,

457
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,590
Mr. Tao is a cowardly
and mediocre official

458
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,550
who bullies the weak
and fears the tough.

459
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,440
He only blurs the line
between right and wrong,

460
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,150
while Mu Yesheng
hates injustice like poison.

461
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,480
They are totally different.

462
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,140
(Strange Night Talk)

463
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,870
I grew up reading Mu Yesheng's book
since I was a child.

464
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,200
I have always regarded him

465
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,040
as a role model all my life.

466
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,310
Before coming to the capital,

467
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,960
I traveled around with my master,

468
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,960
went to various places in his book,

469
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,070
and listed all the false inferences

470
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,280
in the book one by one,

471
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,480
so that one day I could
enter the Court of Judicial Review

472
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,200
and talk to Mu Yesheng face to face.

473
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,440
But if Mu Yesheng

474
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
is just a person who lies in the book,

475
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,590
I would rather never read his book.

476
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,960
If everyone cares about the truth,

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,040
there will be nowhere
to hide the darkness?

478
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,000
So ridiculous.

479
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,830
Zhang Ping!

480
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,550

Resurrection from the Grave.

482
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,440
I can't even remember

483
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,070
how Mu Yesheng escaped

484
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,480
from being trapped in the tomb.

485
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,200
Perhaps the former Mu Yesheng

486
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,240
would try his best
and always persevere.

487
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,280
But now Tao Zhoufeng

488
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,480
has lost

489
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,630
all his vigor.

490
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,240
All right.

491
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,310
I have been a coward for 20 years.

492
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,590
Tonight

493
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,110
I will be

494
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,240
Mu Yesheng again.

495
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,870
20 years ago,

496
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,920
I was just an official
of the Court of Judicial Review,

497
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,630
responsible for reviewing dossiers
submitted by localities.

498
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,680
One day,

499
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,350
I received

500
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,000
an urgent dossier from Lingnan District,

501
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,480
which stated that

502
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,350
there was a Moluo Village on the border
between our country and Nandong Country.

503
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,070
All the villagers

504
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,630
died overnight

505
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,630
unmoved,

506
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,480
their bodies were gray and cracked,

507
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,200
and their skin was stiff.

508
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,110
The local government

509
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,790
went to investigate,

510
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,960
but got no clue.

511
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,550
They only heard
from nearby villagers that

512
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,550
there was a vision of scarlet mist
falling from the sky that night.

513
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,720
And this village

514
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,550
advocated witchcraft,

515
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,550
it seemed to

516
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,590
have been condemned by heaven.

517
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,720
I immediately thought of

518
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,390
the Hui'an Pharmacy extermination case

519
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,070
that just happened in the capital.

520
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,350
Hui'an Pharmacy?

521
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,790
Isn't that

522
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,900
the physician's family that
the embalmer took revenge on?

523
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,900
(All stiffened and died)

524
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,590
Yes.

525
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,920
The method of death of the deceased

526
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,390
in the two cases was exactly the same.

527
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,020
(Stiff as if frozen and dead)

528
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,100
(All stiffened and died)

529
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,340
(Stiff as if frozen and dead)

530
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,630
At that time, I thought that

531
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,240
the two cases might be related

532
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,480
in some way,

533
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,720
so I re-investigated
the Hui'an Pharmacy extermination case.

534
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,480
In the corner

535
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,240
of the crime scene,

536
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,110
I found a medicine bottle
specially used by the Imperial Medical Academy.

537
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,150
The red powder remaining
in the bottle is highly toxic.

538
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,920
I guess

539
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,550
the people in Hui'an Pharmacy

540
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,630
were poisoned by this to death.

541
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,960
Could it be that the embalmer

542
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,310
used to be an imperial physician?

543
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
I took the medicine bottle

544
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,720
and went to Imperial Medical Academy
to investigate,

545
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,440
and learned that an imperial doctor
who specialized in poison manufacturing

546
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,790
disappeared mysteriously

547
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
after Moluo Village being wiped out.

548
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,630
After tracing all the way,

549
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,310
I found that

550
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,150
before the tragedy in Moluo Village,

551
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,200
he had left the capital for a period of time

552
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,310
along with Xuan Ji,
Chief of Imperial Astronomy

553
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,240
and Chang Wei,
Official of Ministry of Works.

554
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,790
Some officials

555
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,630
saw the three people

556
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,790
going southward together

557
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,310
near the post station.

558
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,390
Chang Wei also had an official position?

559
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,350
Didn't Xuan Ji say that

560
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,590
they were professionals
recruited from the folk?

561
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,310
What's even weirder is that

562
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,040
I went to investigate Chang Wei

563
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,350
and found that he also disappeared
after the Moluo Village's case.

564
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,590
I suspect that

565
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,350
everyone involved in this matter

566
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,310
was killed

567
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,790
except for

568
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,550
Xuan Ji.

569
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
If the embalmer

570
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,760
was from the Imperial Medical Academy

571
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,920
and Chang Wei was
from the Ministry of Works,

572
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,350
the massacre of the village

573
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,390
would not be able to
be dispatched by Xuan Ji,

574
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,310
the mere head of
the Department of Incantation.

575
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,630
You thought the same as I did.

576
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,200
When I realized that

577
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,310
a lot was involved behind this,

578
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,760
I should have stopped in time.

579
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,550
But I couldn't hold back

580
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,550
and continued to check.

581
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,480
As expected,

582
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,830
I discovered

583
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,040
a deeper secret.

584
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,960
What secret?

585
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,720
The embalmer

586
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,790
was not only an imperial doctor,

587
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,040
but also favored by the Empress Dowager,

588
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,920
and developed various poisons for her.

589
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,960
At that time

590
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,830
Empress Dowager's position
was not yet secure.

591
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,310
In order to control the government,

592
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,630
she often poisoned palace officials

593
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,680
and even

594
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,310
ministers who disobeyed her.

595
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,590
Empress Dowager?

596
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,350
You are right.

597
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,960
The case of Moluo Village

598
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,630
was probably

599
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,550
ordered by the Empress Dowager.

600
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,000
Tao Zhoufeng

601
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,830
shielded the real culprit
of murder and fraud,

602
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,480
which can't be tolerated
by legal principle.

603
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,110
But he

604
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,440
escaped with bare life,

605
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,790
which has aroused
the anger of the scholars.

606
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,200
Now

607
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,240
he knelt outside the imperial city
and refused to leave.

608
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,150
People have been talking about it.

609
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,920
They thought that the cover-up

610
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,630
was ordered by the imperial court
behind the backs.

611
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,390
Since you understand public opinion,

612
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,630
you should not change your sentence.

613
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,960
Only in this way

614
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,960
can you rectify the name of the court.

615
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,390
But Mother...

616
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
Didn't you say

617
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,630
all these things in the court

618
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,200
that day?

619
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,630
No worries.

620
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,720
After all, you are not yet in charge.

621
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,040
If you order a wrong decree,

622
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,390
I will

623
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,310
naturally

624
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,870
correct it for you.

625
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,070
Thank you for your teaching.

626
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,070
Is that why

627
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,790
you stopped writing that year?

628
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,240
Of course I wanted
to defend the injustice

629
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,440
and reveal the whole truth.

630
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,200
But from the moment I knew this secret,

631
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,310
I could no longer be Mu Yesheng

632
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,440
who hated injustice like poison.

633
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,790
How can a mayfly shake a tree?

634
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,920
That's the Empress Dowager.

635
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,590
I couldn't make it.

636
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,480
Neither you

637
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,280
nor Mr. Lan

638
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,000
can make it.

639
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,070
So

640
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,070
Mr. Jinghu hates you

641
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,790
because you didn't report it

642
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,550
when you knew about it.

643
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,310
It's been 20 years.

644
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,830
I thought those people

645
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,390
would have been killed
by the Empress Dowager long ago.

646
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,200
It wasn't until

647
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,200
the embalmer reappeared a few days ago
and killed several people,

648
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,070
and the Empress Dowager

649
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,280
asked about it in the court,

650
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,550
that I realized that it was not over yet.

651
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,070
Later,

652
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,350
the phoenix head was stolen

653
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,150
and Xuan Ji died suddenly.

654
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,480
All these

655
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,680
are aimed at the participants
who slaughtered the village back then.

656
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,550
I became vigilant in my heart.

657
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Mr. Jinghu

658
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,310
has already figured out my weakness.

659
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,440
He is ruthless

660
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,550
and scheming.

661
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,350
I lost sincerely convinced.

662
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,440
It's ridiculous that

663
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,920
I have been terrified and frightened
for the past 20 years,

664
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,240
and sought temporary peace.

665
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,040
In the end,

666
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,240
I still have to die.

667
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,240
What's the point?

668
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,040
What's the point?

669
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,720
Mr. Tao.

670
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,960
You won't die.

671
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,630
We have interceded

672
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,550
with His Majesty.

673
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,200
You are thinking too simply.

674
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Some things

675
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,830
cannot be escaped.

676
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,550
Presumably, the Empress Dowager
has already known about

677
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,590
the chapter 50 of Strange Night Talk.

678
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Zhang Ping.

679
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,680
Back then when I saw you were
obsessed with investigating cases

680
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,440
and had an upright personality,

681
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,550
you were very much like me back then.

682
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,440
But the reality is so.

683
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,870
If you were me,

684
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,790
what would you do?

685
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,500
(Strange Night Talk)

686
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,390
Eunuch Ying Xi,

687
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
why did you come here in person
at such a late hour?

688
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,720
Here comes the killer.

689
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,550
You'd better go.

690
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,440
But...

691
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,680
I didn't find the answer

692
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,760
to that question just now.

693
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,150
Hope you can find it.

694
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,550
Go.

695
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,760
If not,

696
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,070
Mowen would be implicated.

697
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,240
Eunuch.

698
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,000
Hard work for you.

699
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,680
I

700
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,000
have a few words

701
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,960
to say to Mr. Tao in private.

702
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,720
Mr. Wang, please leave us alone.

703
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,310
Please.

704
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,000
Mr. Wang.

705
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,390
Leave us alone.

706
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,350
Okay.

707
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,590
Eunuch, you came at late night,

708
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,720
is it because of
the Empress Dowager's order?

709
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,830
Poisoned wine runs
through the intestines.

710
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,440
A dagger hurts the heart.

711
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,280
For the sake of serving the imperial court
for more than 30 years,

712
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,440
Empress Dowager rewards you

713
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,000
with a complete corpse.

714
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,870
Tomorrow morning,

715
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,070
the people in the Capital City
will know that

716
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,790
you committed suicide in prison

717
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,630
because you felt
ashamed of the imperial court

718
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,550
for covering up the imperial convicts.

719
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,440
Thank you,

720
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,680
Your Majesty!

721
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Calm down.
