Zhang Ping.

Zhang Ping.

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,790
Can you calm down?

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,560
Let go of me!

00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,200
Zhang Ping!

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:36,960
Let go of him.

If you want to seek revenge on
the Empress Dowager,

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,960
you should change into dry clothes
and have some ginger soup,

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,030
lest you should catch a cold and collapse

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,920
before you enter the palace.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,880
Then you need to choose a magic weapon

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,280
or

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,880
you can't beat
the well-equipped Imperial Guards.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,430
You also need to get skillful
in martial arts,

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,670
which will take you five years at least

22

to 20 years,

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,590
or

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,400
you can't beat
a hundred soldiers on your own.

I did come for Moluo Clan.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,120
Moluo villagers were

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,560
unjustly slaughtered.

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
You were at the Court of Judicial Review.

How could you stand by and do nothing?

From the moment I learned this secret,

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,150

or tend to his garden in the suburb.

there is something on your mind?

115
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
I'd be lying to myself

Even if I did offer medicine
to the Empress Dowager,

How would you yield to power and wealth?

Unworldly?

how would I go to the capital

Mr. Wang.

Why are you here?

141
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,230
I was going to ask you that.

142
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,350
You've been living well in the capital.

143
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,320
What are you doing here?

144
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,630
There's a lot going on in the capital.

145
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,630
I'm here

146

to find Moluo Village.

147

All the questions

148
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,400
can only be answered here.

149
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,560
What happened?

150
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,590
Is the Moluo Village you mentioned

151
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
really here?

152
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,710
I've been lost in the forest for days.

153
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,110
I haven't seen any sign of a village.

154
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,680
I remember it clearly.

155
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,280
The archives
of the Court of Judicial Review

156
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,990
say the village is here.

157
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,920
What about you, sir?

158
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,560
Shouldn't you be fighting at the front

159
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,470
with His Majesty?

160
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,590
Why are you here?

161
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,750
The war is not in our favor.

162
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,320
Although we have more soldiers,

163
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,800
our soldiers are ill-adapted
to the southern climate

164
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,750
and are infected with miasma.

165
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,470
Now our war with Nandong

166
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,750
entered into a stalemate.

167
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,960
I was ordered by the Emperor

168
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,350
to lead the vanguard to the South
to spy on their army.

169
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,590
Unexpectedly, we lost our way

170
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,230
just like you

171
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,560
and we were ambushed
by the people of Nandong.

172
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
The rest of our people

173
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,960
are either dead

174
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,800
or wounded.

175
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,510
Here.

176
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,400
Sir.

177
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,470
I'm not hungry.

178
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,710
You should eat it.

179
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,040
Sir.

180
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,870
Water.

181
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,560
Here.

182
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,230
Sir.

183
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,920
We've been stuck in the forest for days

184
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,560
and we're short of food and water.

185
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,350
We still have some pancakes left,

186
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,230
but there's only

187
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,440
half a bag of water.

188
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,230
You...

189
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,920
You shouldn't give it to him.

190
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,230
What do you mean?

191
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,160
I'm giving him my share.

192
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,800
But...

193
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,710
It's okay, Mr. Wang.

194
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm not thirsty.

195
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,350
I have to go find Moluo Village now.

196
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,870
Take care, sir.

197
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,200
You're playing tough.

198
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,990
We're attacked!

199
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,280
Withdraw!

200
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,560
Get up!

201
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,400
Hurry!

202
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,870
Mom.

203
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,080
I will take you home.

204
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,600
The waterfall.

205
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,790
The waterfall.

206
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,030
What did you say?

207
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,440
The waterfall.

208
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,600
We should go in there.

209
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,440
Let's go in there.

210
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,990
There is no time to hesitate.

211
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,200
Let's go in there first.

212
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,960
Be careful.

213
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,880
Come on, be careful.

214
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,750
Sir.

215
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,030
The people of Nandong

216
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,270
didn't see us,

217
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,310
but Zhang Ping can't speak now.

218
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,030
What should we do next?

219
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,160
We don't know the situation outside.

220
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,440
Let's rest here tonight

221
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,510
and talk about it tomorrow morning.

222
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,070
Yes, sir.

223
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,640
He saved us

224
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,200
this time.

225
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,990
But

226
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,880
how did he know
there was a cave behind the waterfall?

227
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,600
He should be home soon.

Listen to the wind in the rice fields.

Do you know what
the Water Vessel is used for?

286
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,200
The people in the world
keep their suffering in their heart

What are you troubled by?

I hid it under the water.

295

People hide what makes them

under the water.
