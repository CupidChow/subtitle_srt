00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,150
Sir, here he is.

2
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,840
Hong Luo, a Merchant of Yueliang Kingdom,

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,920
(Employment system issued by Imperial Court)
needs to enter Dafu Market, Anle Community,

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,110
(Dafu Market, Anle Community, Ning’an City, Dayong)
Ning’an City, Dayong, for transactions.

5
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,200
Relying on the background
of the royal family,

6
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,960
this profiteer has nothing to fear,

7
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,880
and travels between countries

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,120
to collect and sell information.

9
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,120
Over there.

10
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,920
If Guo Yun bought

11
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,680
the secret letter I wrote to Nandong Kingdom

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,760
and used it to accuse me
of collaborating with the enemy and treason,

13
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,200
it would be an inexplicable death penalty.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,710
Don’t worry, sir.

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,000
Today we have deployed arrangements.

16
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,590
We will be able to get this letter

17
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,400
ahead of Guo Yun.

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,350
Look at this piece of jade.

19
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,840
Here.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
And ear of wheat.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,350
Not in the sleeve.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,120
Watch out.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,430
Sorry, sir.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,430
What are you doing?

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I’m so sorry.

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,310
I didn’t notice.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,480
What’s wrong with you?

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,280
Sorry.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,230
Not in the hat.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
Mr. Bi.

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,790
Sorry.

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
Let me clean it for you.

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,640
Not in his arms.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
Scare him as planned.

35
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,590
Yes.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,470
Step aside.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,750
What’s going on?

38
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,520
Catch the thief!

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,470
Catch the thief!

40
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,750
No.

41
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,400
Catch the thief!

42
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,630
Step aside.

43
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,310
Catch the thief!

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Come back.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,630
Got it.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,910
The letter should be hidden
in the bead on the belt.

Little girl.

This is you.

Tie it over there.

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,100
Horses cannot be hitched here.

54
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,660
I can put it wherever I want.

55
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Exactly.

56
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,620
What?

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,460
According to the article 21 of chapter 5
of the Yong Dynasty's regulations,

58
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,300
horses are not allowed to be tied
along the streets of Dafu Market.

59
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,820
Please take the horse to the stable.

60
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,980
Who do you think you are?

61
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,020
What's going on outside?

62
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,220
Leave me alone.

63
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,180
It’s Hong Luo who’s in a dispute
with a vendor downstairs.

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,340
It’s none of your business.

65
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,820
Sell your noodles.

66
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,540
Don’t worry, sir.

67
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,140
Our men have been there.

68
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,220
Just lead Hong Luo into the restaurant.

69
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,140
Calm down.

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:52,860
Sir.

71
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,900
Easy.

72
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,380
There is a stable behind our restaurant.

73
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,860
I'll take your horse there.

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,780
Sir, this way, please.

75
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,900
Here it is.

76
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,540
Come in, please.

77
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,900
Wine for you.

78
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,140
Please take a seat.

79
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,780
Sir, please.

80
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,300
Sir.

81
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,220
What do you want?

82
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,460
The most expensive one.

83
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,860
The most expensive one.

84
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,380
Sure.

85
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,940
One serving of milk sheep pot.

86
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,580
Sir.

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,820
How can you take milk sheep pot
without lamb wine?

88
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,900
Take a try.

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
But that's not

90
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,140
how to drink the wine.

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,820
Sir.

92
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,900
He’s way too wary.

93
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,140
It’s hard to take actions.

94
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,820
The person who contradicted
Hong Luo just now

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
is the noodle seller?

96
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,540
Yes.

97
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,180
One noodle for Table Peony of Zuiwanchun.

98
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,980
One more poached egg.

99
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,620
When it's done, send it over.

100
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,060
Okay.

101
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,620
Your noodle.

102
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,420
I didn’t order it.

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:02,980
Piss off.

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,300
You asked someone to order it.

105
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,580
It’s you again.

106
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,220
Two pennies for the noodle.

107
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,940
Three pennies for the egg.

108
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,780
A total of five pennies.

109
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,580
You are courting death.

110
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,100
Beat him.

111
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,500
The bead.

112
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,700
The bead.

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,140
The bead is missing.

114
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,540
The bead.

115
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,300
Come on.

116
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,380
Look for it.

117
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,820
Come on.

118
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,620
Look for it.

119
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,780
Block the restaurant.

120
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,300
None of them can get out.

121
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,300
Stop.

122
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:45,900
Hurry up.

123
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,740
Sir, easy.

124
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,460
Sir.

125
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,260
Let's think of another way.

126
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,900
You have caught the wrong person.

127
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,700
This...

128
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,660
Boss.

129
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,980
We’ve searched. No found.

130
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,780
Where is my bead?

131
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,500
You got the wrong person.

132
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,860
Then why did you run?

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,980
I’m just an errand man.

134
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,140
Of course I have to run.

135
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,180
I was in a hurry to deliver lamb wine
to the guests.

136
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
It would delay business.

137
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,140
If I can't find the bead today,

138
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,700
none of you can leave.

139
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,940
No worries.

140
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,460
Let’s think of a way.

141
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,140
Man.

142
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,820
Don't you know how to solve crimes?

143
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,340
To tell you the truth,

144
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,820
a few days ago,

145
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,740
he was the one

146
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,100
who helped my wife

147
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,700
find out

148
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,860
the case-dough I hid.

149
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,740
Man.

150
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,820
Do him a favor.

151
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,860
He dropped my noodles.

152
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,460
I don't want to help him.

153
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,380
That noodle...

154
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,780
Before I dropped it, my bead was still there.

155
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,940
Then it was gone.

156
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
The bead was lost
when you dropped the noodle?

157
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,380
It was lost at that time.

158
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,220
Right.

159
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,060
(At that time, I was only concerned
about my noodle)

160
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,860
(and didn't notice someone stealing)

161
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,900
(But why did it happen at that moment)

162
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,700
Have you ever gotten up

163
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,100
before I came in?

164
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,420
No.

165
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,300
(I was taken advantage of)

166
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,460
I can help you.

167
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,860
You really didn't order the noodle.

168
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,100
Someone took advantage of our conflict

169
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,260
to deliberately make me irritate you.

170
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,700
Someone?

171
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,660
Who?

172
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,940
Show me your belt.

173
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,300
Here you are.

174
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,700
(A scratch)

175
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,140
(The chopsticks are clean)

176
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,540
(Bowls and chopsticks are unmoved)

177
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,460
Where are the guests

178
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,540
at that table?

179
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,340
The guest of Table Magnolia
has just paid the bill.

180
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
I don’t know if he left or not.

181
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,300
It’s me.

182
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,180
(Grease on cuffs)

183
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,220
But I'm only here for a meal.

184
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,060
Search him.

185
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,940
No need.

186
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,780
The bead isn’t with him.

187
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,620
But he did a favor.

188
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,820
The person who stole the bead

189
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,460
is the dancer.

190
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,260
What?

191
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,780
The bead

192
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,260
is inlaid on the belt.

193
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,540
The fat around your waist is so thick

194
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,580
that it sticks to the bead when you sit down.

195
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,780
It is only convenient to take action

196
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,620
if someone provoked you to stand up.

197
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,980
The dancer then

198
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,020
scraped the bead off with a thin wire.

199
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,060
So there is a very fine scratch

200
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,460
on the belt.

201
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,180
It’s you.

202
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,740
Hold on.

203
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,780
The bead has been transferred.

204
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,340
But

205
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,060
you can check her hands.

206
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,500
She did steal it.

207
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,380
The best place to assist the dance

208
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,220
is your seat.

209
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,460
You sit behind him,

210
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,660
the easiest to take action.

211
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,540
You blocked the restaurant

212
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,820
when it was stolen.

213
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,420
But he ran out the first time

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,380
to sell the dummy,

215
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,380
so that he had time

216
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,820
to transfer the bead again.

217
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,860
Sir.

218
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,620
Go.

219
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,700
This is the bead I lost.

220
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,580
How do you know the bead is here?

221
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,340
The fishlike smell on his cuffs

222
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,260
suggests that he transferred the bead

223
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,580
(Fishlike smell)
to a plate of fish.

224
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,740
Steamed river fish can't hide the bead.

225
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,420
The steamed sea bass is almost finished.

226
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,300
The spicy boiled fish's oil broth is so hot

227
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,020
that may burn the bead.

228
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,740
Only the eye of chub is the best place.

229
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Amazing.

230
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
Who ordered the fish?

231
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,340
It’s...

232
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,620
Chunguang Pavilion on the second floor.

233

in such a hurry?

246
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,900
Exactly.

247
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,380
He must be looking for a kitten and puppy
for someone else.

248
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,060
The road ahead too narrow to make through.

Why did you make so little money today?

290

a disgrace to the educated class.

because of poverty in his family.

345
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,220
Mr. Lan.

346
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,740
Your name is Zhang Ping?

347
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,140
The imperial examination is coming soon.

348
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,740
You are not studying at home
to prepare for the exam,

349
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,340
but selling noodles on the street.

350
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,460
Are you having trouble?

351
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,940
Because of poverty.

352
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,220
Most of the scholars

353
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,220
who came here for the exam

354
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,420
were funded by their families.

355
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,540
Your willingness to be self-reliant

356
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,900
is quite rare.

357
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,220
I am an orphan.

358
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,300
Mr. Lan.

359
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,620
He’s always like this.

360
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,940
Don’t you mind.

361
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,380
Never mind.

362
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,660
That being the case,

363
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,020
why don't you

364
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
find an official or a wealthy gentry

365
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,660
for a pushover?

366
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,860
If you are interested,

367
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:04,820
I can

368
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,380
recommend it for you.

369
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,220
Are you familiar with the Highest Judiciary?

370
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,460
Why are you

371
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,940
so insensible

372
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,340
and picky?

373
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,660
I’m not familiar with the Highest Judiciary.

374
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,340
But my family

375
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,620
happens to lack an accountant.

376
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,140
Would you like to try?

377
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,900
Then I'd rather sell noodles.

378
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,660
Forget it.

379
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,780
I won’t push you.

380
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,100
If you change your mind in the future,

381
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,980
come to the official office
of the Ministry of Rites to find me.

382
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,940
I am Lan Jue,

383
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,220
Vice Minister of Rites.

384
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:57,940
Sir.

385
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,660
What do you think?

386
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,060
Could it be that he was instructed by someone

387
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,180
to do it on purpose?

388
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,860
No difference from my original judgment.

389
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,660
Just a hothead.

390
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,620
To be cautious,

391
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,020
find someone to check him.

392
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,180
Yes.

393
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,740
Fortunately

394
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,500
you used the escape plan today.

395
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
Otherwise, today...

396
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,020
As solemn as the wind under the pine tree,

397
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,820
and as bright as the moon in the forest.

398
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,700
I didn't expect Mr. Lan

399
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,700
to be so approachable.

400
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
Oh.

401
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,220
Say something.

402
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,140
Oh.

403
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,500
Oh.

404
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,420
If it weren't for Mr. Lan today,

405
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,500
you would have been bullied
by those two scholars again.

406
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,860
I told you many times

407
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,100
not to set up a stall here.

408
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,260
But you didn’t listen to me.

409
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,700
There are many customers here,

410
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,380
so it is easy to make money.

411
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,780
Many customers?

412
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,060
You sold noodles for a day.

413
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,300
But no one ever sat here.

414
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Are you kidding me?

415
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,700
Wait!

416
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,780
Chen Chou.

417
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
Clean it up for me.

418
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:02,940
Zhang.

419
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,180
Where are you going?

420
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,820
(The futon in Chunguang Pavilion)

421

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,380
(You have been in Feiyu Pavilion)

427

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,820
(And you transferred us away)

433

(Fructus Amomi)

436
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,980
Fructus Amomi is tribute,

437
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
mainly for stomach problems.

438
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,820
How could a restaurant

439
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,020
afford it?

440
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,620
We are

441
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,220
so lucky today.

442
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,380
When we were selling noodles,

443
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,300
we met Mr. Lan, the Vice Minister of Rites.

444
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,260
The Ministry of Rites

445
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,980
administers the imperial examination.

446
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,660
Did you notice?

447
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,020
The floor of Daifuku Market is muddy.

448
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,340
But

449
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,260
when Mr. Lan came here today,

450
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,100
the uppers of his shoes

451
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,660
and the hem of his clothes

452
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,940
were clean.

453
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,140
Mr. Lan

454
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,140
of course came by carriage.

455
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,020
But he left on foot.

456
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,340
Where was the carriage

457
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,060
when he returned?

458
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,140
Why do you worry about such trivial matters?

459
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,260
I heard that Minister Gong

460
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,860
will retire soon.

461
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,820
Work harder.

462
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,780
In the future, all matters related
to the imperial examination

463
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
will be handled by Mr. Lan.

464
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,660
Chen Chou.

465
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,300
I think

466
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,820
it's a bit strange for him
to come to the noodle stall.

467
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,060
Mr. Lan, why are you

468
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,020
walking today?

469
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,580
I'm just taking a walk.

470
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,500
Goodbye.

471
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,820
We act rashly this time.

472
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,020
I'm afraid it will not be easy

473
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,340
to take action next time.

474
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,340
Hong Luo is lustful by nature.

475
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,620
A honey-trap would work.

476
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,260
Ask Miss Xie Hao from Banyue Pavilion
to take actions.

477
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,020
(Jingan Community, Lan’s Mansion)

478
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,620
Sir.

479
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,420
Will there be any trouble
caused by Guo Yun?

480
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,580
He was sent to other places by me.

481
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,620
He is not expected to return
for another three to four days.

482
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,580
Guo Yun is so vicious.

483
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,700
In order to fight for the position
of Vice Minister of Rites,

484
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,060
he even wants to kill you.

485
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,500
If he hadn't wanted to buy

486
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,860
the secret letter in the bead
from Hong Luo,

487
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,860
there wouldn't have been so much trouble.

488
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,740
Forget it.

489
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,700
Official circles are just like that.

490
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,780
If I were to get such a handle,

491
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,220
I would never be soft-hearted.

492
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,540
Here.

493
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,220
By the way,

494
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,020
do you know that

495
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,220
there are countless people

496
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,100
who have come to Lan’s Mansion
to give gifts these days?

497
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,620
But Mr. Lan didn't take any of them

498
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,780
to avoid arousing suspicion.

499
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,980
Avoid arousing suspicion?

500
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,900
If so,

501
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,780
why did he recruit me

502
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,940
to work as an accountant in his mansion?

503
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,260
Isn’t it good?

504
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,900
Right now, the scholars in the capital

505
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,580
who want to be the disciples
of Mr. Lan

506
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,860
are oversubscribed.

507
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,860
But God

508
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,140
dropped the opportunity on your head.

509
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,380
You have to take the chance.

510
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,780
But I only want to go to the Highest Judiciary.

511
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,300
Zhang.

512
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,460
I know that

513
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,540
you came to the capital to take the exam

514
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,700
to find the expert detective Mu Yesheng
who you admire

515
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,940
in the Highest Judiciary.

516
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,460
Mu Yesheng.

517
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,220
Who is Mu Yesheng?

518
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,100
Is he in the Highest Judiciary?

519
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,660
Is the "Strange Night Talk"

520
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,260
he wrote made up?

521
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,900
The Highest Judiciary

522
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,180
written in his book is so real.

523
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,980
He must be there.

524
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,540
At least

525
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,500
he used to be there.

526
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,260
Listen.

527
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,660
Get along well with Mr. Lan.

528
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,700
And your enrollment is not far away.

529
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,700
Chen Chou.

530
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,300
Aren’t you Mr. Know-it-all of the capital?

531
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,740
Can you help me find out

532
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,540
if Mr. Lan has stomach problems?

533
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,300
Sir, your stomach trouble struck again.

534
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,580
I'll ask the kitchen to make you
something warm.

535
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,300
No need.

536
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,620
Miss Xie Hao has already made arrangements.

537
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,620
Three days later,

538
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,980
she will lead Hong Luo
to Banyue Pavilion to take actions.

539
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,900
Your birthday party is also scheduled there.

540
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,300
How is the investigation of Zhang Ping?

541
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,140
We have checked.

542
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,180
He has no background,

543
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,620
and is just a scholar who loves
to investigate cases.

544
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,660
Sir.

545
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,020
Just now at the back door,

546
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,380
there was a man rummaging through
the trash can outside the courtyard,

547
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,660
whose behavior was very suspicious.

548
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,940
What was he looking for?

549
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,340
The Fructus Amomi you used.

550
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,260
But

551
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,620
before he could pick it up,

552
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,700
I scolded him away.

553
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,940
The medicine residue in the restaurant
has been cleaned up.

554
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,220
The smell.

555
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,620
The Fructus Amomi has a strong smell.

556
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Where is he now?

557
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,060
Higher.

558
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,820
Zhang.

559
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,100
Are you mistaken?

560
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,420
How could Mr. Lan steal a bead?

561
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,140
That’s why I’m seeking confirmation.

562
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,780
Well.

563
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,380
If you made a mistake,

564
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,220
we’d offend him.

565
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,500
Not finding out

566
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,820
who was behind the bead stealing

567
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,260
made me feel uncomfortable.

568
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,660
Then what about our imperial examination?

569
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,380
What should we do next?

570
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,380
Look for the dregs.

571
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,220
Stop.

572
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,620
It’s you.

573
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,460
Sir.

574
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,500
Take a seat.

575
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,300
Do you know

576
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,060
how serious it is

577
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,380
to break into an official's residence
without permission?

578
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,180
According to the law,

579
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,220
those who break into the houses
without permission

580
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,900
will be killed without guilt.

581
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,620
Sir.

582
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,740
We are not up to anything bad.

583
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,380
It's just that

584
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,220
after meeting you today,

585
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,060
we admire your personality

586
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,660
and admire your demeanor.

587
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,740
So...

588
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,060
So

589
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,060
we came to find out about
your daily preferences.

590
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,540
Why do you want to know this?

591
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,100
It is convenient for us to give gifts.

592
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,860
You came in the middle of the night.

593
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,260
What a perfect timing.

594
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,180
There are too many people in the daytime.

595
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,220
You also came to find out my preferences?

596
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,500
Do you drink tea with Fructus Amomi

597
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,780
because you have stomach problems?

598
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,340
Tea?

599
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,980
We usually take

600
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Hu people's Daye tea,

601
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,660
not that exquisite.

602
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,060
I didn’t expect you to know Fructus Amomi.

603
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,060
But this is Alpinia zerumbet.

604
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,540
The two are similar in shape,

605
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,260
but there are subtle differences.

606
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,820
Fructus Amomi has a strong smell

607
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,660
and can treat stomach problems.

608
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,660
Alpinia zerumbet is astringent,

609
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,460
and is just a spice to enhance the taste.

610
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,620
I don't have stomach problems.

611
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,780
If you are trying to please me,

612
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,940
it’s

613
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,460
a wrong step.

614
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,540
Zhang Ping.

615
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,620
It is not what scholars should do

616
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,060
to show off their talents

617
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,860
and take advantage of it.

618
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,820
Instead of finding out my preferences,

619
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,780
you’d better concentrate on
studying for the exam.

620
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,700
Considering that you are first offenders,

621
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,540
I will let you go this time.

622
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,900

You can’t just...

625
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,820
Send them away.

626
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,620
Go.

Are you really going to let them go?

Are you still thinking about Mr. Lan?

It’s been three days.

The attic above

684
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,420
should be the legendary No. 1 private room

685
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,500
Peony Pavilion.

686
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,660
It is said that

687
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,820
those inside

688
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,180
are the most powerful people in the capital.

689
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,660
Let's go over there.

690
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,260
Let’s look for Mr. Lan.

691
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,580
Everyone is here.

692
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:03,860
Okay.

693
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,460
Mr. Lan.

694
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,700
(Jia Fugui, owner of Banyue Pavilion)
When shall we start?

695
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,700
Some distinguished guests
haven't arrived yet.

696
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:10,860
Okay.

697
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Mr. Lan.

698
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,140
(Ji Wen, Vice director of the Ministry of Rites)
There is no need to wait any longer.

699
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,460
I haven't seen Mr. Gong
attend anyone's banquet

700
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,900
in the ten years since I entered the court.

701
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,580
(Shao Zhi, Vice director of the Ministry of Rites)
Mr. Lan's unsurpassed mind

702
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,100
is unrivaled in the Ministry of Rites.

703
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,220
If it weren't for the background,

704
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,100
I’m afraid...

705
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,860
Whether Mr. Gong comes or not,

706
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,460
I can't be rude.

707
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,660
Please forgive me

708
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,540
if there is any lack of hospitality.

709
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,620
Here comes Mr. Gong.

710
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,140
(Minister of Rites, Gong Songming)
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

711
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,380
It's my honor

712
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,940
for you to come.

713
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,620
The way to be an official

714
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,700
is to be honest

715
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,060
and upright.

716
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,500
You are right, sir.

717
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,420
Zhang.

718
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,060
There are so many rooms in Banyue Pavilion.

719
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,060
When can we find him?

720
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,460
Let's split up.

721
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:09,940
Zhang.

722
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,380
We are here today

723
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,540
to celebrate his birthday and make amends.

724
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,980
After a while, when you see Mr. Lan,

725
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,580
you should be sincere

726
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,300
and give him the gift.

727
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,260
Look for him now.

728
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,220
Okay.

729
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,660
Let's split up.

730
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,100
Mr. Lan, what do you mean?

731
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,140
Why give us porridge and side dishes?

732
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,380
Yes.

733
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,580
I have never been back

734
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,140
to my hometown Guangling
since I arrived at the capital,

735
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,260
and I haven’t had rouge rice for decades.

736
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,380
It is my great honor that

737
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,100
Mr. Gong and all colleagues
are willing to come.

738
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,820
But I really dare not bother you

739
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,940
with this mere birthday.

740
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,180
I invite you

741
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,380
to get together today

742
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,820
out of another intention.

743
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,620
I prepared a gift for you, professor.

744
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,020
Please accept it.

745
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,260
Since I became an official
at the age of twenty,

746
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,220
I’ve never accepted anything.

747
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,380
It is an exception for me to come here today.

748
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,220
If you want to give me a gift,

749
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,020
I have to go.

750
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,100
This thing has no worldly value.

751
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,660
Please take a look

752
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,740
before making a decision.

753
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,740
Please take a look

754
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,100
for my sake.

755
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,940
(Handprints of Hundreds of Kids)

756
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,700
This is collected from the ordinary people

757
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,860
in Zichuan County.

758
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,020
When the Yellow River burst its embankment,

759
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,980
Zichuan suffered the worst disaster.

760
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,820
Professor went to the disaster relief

761
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,380
and saved thousands of lives.

762
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
In order to

763
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,380
thank you for your life-saving grace,

764
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,660
the local people

765
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,100
left the handprints of the newborn babies

766
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,500
after the disaster

767
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,980
and offered them

768
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,340
above the incense table.

769
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,700
Mr. Lan, thank you.

770
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,780
I will

771
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,020
take this painting.

772
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,580
Please accept my worship.

773
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,180
I know what’s on your mind.

774
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,260
But I cannot promise

775
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,660
to recommend you

776
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,780
as the Minister of Rites.

777
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,940
Don’t worry, professor.

778
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,740
I

779
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,460
know what to do.

780
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,380
What are you doing?

781
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,740
Looking for someone.

782
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,300
Looking for someone?

783
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,540
Why are you so stealthy?

784
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,060
I’ve watched you for a long time.

785
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,340
Don’t run!

786
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,620
Take care.

787
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,660
Sorry.

788
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,060
Where is he?

789
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,260
Cheers.

790
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,380
Sir.

791
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,060
Xie Hao has put the thing

792
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,820
in the backstage as agreed.

793
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,380
Mr. Lan.

794
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,580
It’s you again.

795
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,140
I have found proof.

796
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,860
You were the one who stole the bead

797
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,820
in the restaurant that day.

798
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,780
Enough?

799
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,020
I made it clear that day.

800
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,740
I couldn't find any evidence
at your house that day,

801
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,820
it must be because Fructus Amomi
has been replaced long ago.

802
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,340
But you still ignored one thing.

803
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,660
When in Daifuku Market,

804
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,980
the carriage I overtook

805
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,180
should be your cover-up.

806
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,020
At that time,

807
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,300
I wanted to block the carriage
with a bamboo pole,

808
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,860
but I accidentally knocked over
a bucket of red paint,

809
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,820
and the horse just stepped on it.

810
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,180
Just now I checked the stable
of Banyue Pavilion.

811
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,220
That horse

812
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,620
is tied with your carriage.

813
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,820
Paint is everywhere.

814
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,700
How can you be sure that

815
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,900
the paint on the horse's hoof

816
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,100
was stained at that time?

817
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,020
You are so whimsical.

818
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,300
I should recommend you to write playbooks.

819
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,700
Sir, you don't have to argue.

820
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,540
You know if you stole the bead or not.

821
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,980
Zhang Ping.

822
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,740
What are you trying to do

823
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,540
to follow me so hard?

824
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,620
I just want to prove that

825
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,820
my judgment is right.

826
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,140
You used me to commit crimes.

827
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
I have to find out.

828
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,540
Also,

829
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,580
you have to pay for my noodle.

830
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,260
Two pennies for the noodle.

831
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,700
Three pennies for the egg.
A total of five pennies.

832
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,220
That’s all you need?

833
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,900
Forget it.

834
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,420
Zhang Ping.

835
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,100
For the sake of you being a scholar,

836
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,220
I don't want you to ruin your future

837
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,500
because of a mistake.

838
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,340
But if you continue to harass
and frame me maliciously,

839
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,100
don't blame me for being merciless.

840
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,300
If you are short of money,

841
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,540
I’d donate money for you to buy books.

842
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,020
I don't want your donation,
I just want your compensation.

843
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,620
Since you still don't admit it,

844
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,220
I will continue to look for evidence

845
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,860
and find out all the ins and outs.

846
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,380
Sir.

847
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,620
This...

848
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,060
Don't create more troubles.

849
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,620
We’ll get the bead soon.

850
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,860
He can’t do anything.

851
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,020
Have you already

852
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,460
met Mr. Lan?

853
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,940
And then?

854
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,220
I presented the facts to reason with him.

855
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,220
But he just didn't admit it.

856
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,660
I can only find more conclusive evidence

857
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,740
to make him unable to quibble.

858
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,100
You nerd!

859
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,220
Come on!

860
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,220
Look at you.

861
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,980
What are you thinking about?

862
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,420
You didn’t listen to me at all.

863
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,580
What are you doing?

864
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,260
Don't pull me.

865
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,100
Hong Luo.

866
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,220
Why is he here?

867
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,140
Miss Xie Hao.

868
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,500
I still want to have fun with you.

869
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,460
Xie Hao?

870
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,620
- Mr. Lan also mentioned Xie Hao just now.
- Miss Xie Hao.

871
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,340
Stop.

872
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,820
Can you just listen to me for once?

873
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,660
It's a pity that

874
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,700
I wrote the birthday poem for two days.

875
00:43:59,260 --> 00:43:59,860
Never mind.

876
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,740
It can be sold for two pennies

877
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,140
in the market.

878
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,580
I spent ten pennies just for framing.

879
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:08,980
It’s way too expensive.

880
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,500
It doesn't take ten pennies to frame.

881
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,260
You!

882
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,580
Let’s watch the show.

883
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,060
I managed

884
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,060
to buy two tickets.

885
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,620
It can’t be wasted.

(Mr. Lan)

887

(Why is he going to the backstage)

888
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,060
Mr. Lan, Xie Hao.

889
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,580
Sir.

890
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,060
Xie Hao has put the thing

891
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,500
in the backstage as agreed.

The effect is so realistic.

908

Collaboration and treason

Miss Xie Hao.

It’s Miss Xie Hao.

919

It doesn’t seem to be a trick.

920

The sky fire.

921

The sky fire kills.
