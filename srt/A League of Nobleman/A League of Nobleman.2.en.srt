00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,440
(Where is the traitor?)

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,670
(Hanging at the market entrance.)

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,830
(Who is the traitor?)

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,960
(Either a pig or a dog.)

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,350
(Where is the traitor?)

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,750
(Hanging at the market entrance.)

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,750
(Who is the traitor?)

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,070
(Either a pig or a dog.)

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,390
Sir.

10
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,640
Sir.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,430
The bead

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,280
has been taken by someone

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,880
who left only a note

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,320
saying that tonight,

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,790
he would declare me for
collusion with the enemy and treason.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,070
Then Xie Hao and the doggerel
written in blood on the stage...

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,670
Xie Hao bore the blame for me.

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,150
Everything that happened on the stage

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
was deliberately planned.

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,120
Though they killed Xie Hao,

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,150
their real target was me.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,150
Who would take so much trouble?

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,150
What's his purpose?

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,870
The person took the bead away

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,950
and left a note to threaten me.

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,310
(Collusion and treason unpardonable)
He must know about the bead

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,760
(Crime will be declared at midnight)
and the secret letter inside it.

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Hong Luo only wants money.

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,070
I think it has nothing to do with him.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,430
Send a man to the
Ministry of Justice now.

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,280
Let Mowen

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,230
come here immediately.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,430
I'll do it right now.

34
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,400
And that Zhang Ping,

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,230
he knows too much.

36
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,710
He can't stay.

37
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,400
What a bad time!

38
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,960
As soon as I entered,

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,150
I saw the murder case.

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,360
Guo Yun?

41
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,150
Why did he come here?

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,360
Mr. Guo, you're back.

43
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,400
After I finished my official business,

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,280
I dare not delay

45
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,680
and came back as soon as possible.

46
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,800
Minister Gong also came.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm going to greet him.

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,470
Yes.

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,550
Everyone,

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,670
I never thought that

53
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,960
a murder would

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,390
occur on my birthday party.

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,480
I'm sorry to frighten you.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
(Vice Minister of the Ministry
of Rites Guo Yun) I came

57
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,520
to your birthday party
as soon as I returned,

58
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,590
not expecting to run into a murder case.

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,960
Mr. Lan,

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,240
are you fine?

61
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,640
Thanks for asking.

62
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Mr. Guo, you came all the way at night

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
to my party.

64
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm

65
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,550
deeply grateful.

66
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,520
Don't stand on ceremony at this moment.

67
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,430
Get on the stage and check the situation.

68
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,900
(Here the corrupt official
is ruining our country.)

69
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,220
(When a puppet does evil,)

70
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,060
(his master must be executed.)

71
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,350
The means of the murder is cruel.

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,320
This place is very dangerous.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,880
Why don't you

74
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,470
go back for a rest?

75
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
I think the judicial departments

76
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,270
will crack the case

77
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,030
and give you an explanation.

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,030
But the murderer

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,440
already said that

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
the corrupt official was here.

81
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,760
He hurled mud at us.

82
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,640
Now we are all involved.

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,150
Yes.

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
I agree with Mr. Guo.

85
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,080
We must prove our innocence.

86
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,470
What do you think?

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,560
Everyone,

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,390
we'd better report to the government.

89
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,590
There's no need.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,320
I can represent the government.

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
Vice Minister Wang
of Ministry of Justice,

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,120
you came really at a...

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,760
Peizhi,

94
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,960
I'm late.

95
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,030
Sorry for the belated gift.

96
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,640
Thanks, Mowen.

97
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,560
The murderer did come at me.

98
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,520
But there's

99
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,880
another story.

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,910
Tonight,

101
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,230
I need you

102
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
to cover up for me.

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,030
You don't

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,320
have to say anything.

105
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,680
Bai He,

106
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Check the scene of the crime.

107
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,390
Yes.

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,030
Yin Yuan,

109
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,200
question all the guests.

110
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,680
Yes.

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,470
Search the place thoroughly.

112
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,080
Yes.

113
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,710
The Ministry of Justice is taking over.

114
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,120
Let's be flexible in case of urgency.

115
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,000
Gentlemen,

116
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,270
why don't you go back to rest?

117
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,760
Wait.

118
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
Nobody can leave.

119
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,150
- Who's up there?
- This is...

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,030
Empress...

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,880
Empress...

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,790
Your Majesty.

123
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,030
Her Majesty is in good mood tonight.

124
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,150
So she comes out to watch a play.

125
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,150
Let's spare unnecessary

126
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
etiquette.

127
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,270
Yes.

128
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,960
If there wasn't such a mess,

129
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,640
(Mrs. Li of Shuoyang, Empress Dowager)
we would have watched a good play.

130
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,760
Your wild discussions just now

131
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,230
were no inferior to the play.

132
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,350
Does the doggerel accuse anyone falsely?

133
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,270
If not,

134
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,150
who is it

135
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,270
accusing?

136
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,590
Mr. Wang,

137
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,230
do you have any findings?

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,710
Your Majesty,

139
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,390
I've just arrived

140
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,640
and haven't got anything.

141
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Dear ministers,

142
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560
do you have anything to say?

143
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,230
Confession or report,

144
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,230
both will do.

145
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,440
In case your sin will be doubled

146
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,640
when the case is cracked.

147
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,470
Who are you?

148
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,880
What are you doing here?

149
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,960
Go.

150
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,710
Leave me alone!

151
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,200
I'm not the murderer.

152
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,680
Report!

153
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,680
I found a man backstage

154
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,990
who was suspicious.

155
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,870
I said I'm not the killer.

156
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,710
I'm here to investigate the case

157
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,870
Investigate?

158
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,200
Are you with
the Court of Judicial Review?

159
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,630
No.

160
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm a scholar from Xichuan County,

161
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,320
Zhang Ping.

162
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,590
But I like investigating cases.

163
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,280
Nonsense!

164
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,350
The Ministry of Justice
will handle the case.

165
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,630
It's not your place to meddle in it.

166
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
You came late, didn't you?

167
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,870
You...

168
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,560
I found some clues backstage.

169
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,990
If you're not in a hurry,

170
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,440
Can I go back and have a look?

171
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,920
I think you are suspicious.

172
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,800
Take him down and interrogate him.

173
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,400
Yes.

174
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,990
Wait.

175
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,200
Mr. Wang,

176
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,590
let him explain.

177
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,560
Since you're a scholar,

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
you should study for the exam.

179
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,680
Why are you here in Banyue Pavilion?

180
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,630
I came here...

181
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,800
I came here to confront a person,

182
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,280
but he wouldn't admit his fault.

183
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,630
Then,

184
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,990
I ran into the case.

185
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,750
What have you got?

186
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I examined the body first.

187
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,590
It's clean in the victim's

188
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,590
mouth and nose.

189
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,830
No smoke inhaled.

190
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,350
There's a mark

191
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,200
around the neck.

192
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,870
The victim should have been strangled

193
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
before being burned.

194
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,510
When Miss Xie Hao

195
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,870
was hung on the stage,

196
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,990
her head drooped and

197
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,560
her body didn't move at all.

198
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Apparently, at that time,

199
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,750
she was already dead.

200
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,590
I also found two other clues backstage,

201
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,920
but,

202
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,230
before I had checked them out,

203
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,470
I was dragged out by your men.

204
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,160
Tell us.

205
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,440
First,

206
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,400
when I was in Xie Hao's dressing room,

207
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,040
I found a round oil mark.

208
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,470
It smelt like pear blossoms,

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,830
the same smell as on the victim's head

210
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,990
which caught fire first.

211
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Pear blossom hair oil

212
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
can only be lit with an open fire

213
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,470
It can't self-ignite.

214
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,110
Do you suspect that

215
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,750
the missing of the hair oil bottle

216
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,230
is related to the murder?

217
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Yes.

218
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,040
The killer probably found a way

219
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,280
to make it self-ignite.

220
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,920
But I haven't found out

221
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,470
the way he used.

222
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,160
The second doubtful point?

223
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,350
On Xie Hao's dresser,

224
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,710
I found

225
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,590
this.

226
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,510
The candle was extinguished.

227
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,280
When I found it,

228
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,230
it was a little shorter

229
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,200
than the other candles.

230
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,830
It seems to be extinguished
half an hour ago.

231
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,510
There is a hole
in the bottom of the candle

232
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,990
with patterns imprinted inside.

233
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,870
It looks like the carving on a bead.

234
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,320
Half an hour ago,

235
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,040
it was the interlude

236
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,920
and when Xie Hao was killed.

237
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,710
These two things

238
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,470
may be related.

239
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,560
Your Majesty,

240
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,350
this case involves a human life

241
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,590
and concerns the reputation
of the officials here.

242
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,870
I have a question

243
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
to ask this scholar.

244
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,830
Permitted.

245
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
You said that

246
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,960
there was a

247
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,440
round hole
in the bottom of the candle.

248
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,830
But there are numerous
round things in the world.

249
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,830
How can you be so sure that

250
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,230
there was a bead

251
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,710
inside it?

252
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,920
Have you

253
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,920
seen a bead with such carve patterns?

254
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,630
Your Majesty,

255
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,470
the young scholar

256
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,200
seem to have some secrets.

257
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,560
If you have,

258
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,630
feel free to tell us.

259
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,800
Your Majesty,

260
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
I have an advice.

261
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,350
Though I don't know
why he wouldn't tell us,

262
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,510
if it causes panic among

263
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,680
people here and make them

264
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,870
guess without ground,

265
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,230
it isn't necessary.

266
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,710
Therefore,

267
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,080
I suggest

268
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,750
this scholar

269
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,590
participate in the investigation.

270
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,870
Firstly,

271
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,560
his inference is well founded.

272
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,960
Secondly,

273
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,510
he doesn't seem to

274
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,510
have any conflict of interest

275
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,710
with the courtiers.

276
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,750
His participation is conducive

277
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,960
to a fair judgment of the case.

278
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,630
I'd love to.

279
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,870
Mr. Wang.

280
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,830
Yes.

281
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,350
After the murder,

282
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,710
has any fish escaped from the net?

283
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,160
I've kept everyone here

284
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,080
and no fish has escaped.

285
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,560
Good.

286
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,280
You must investigate it thoroughly

287
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,110
and find out who is going to

288
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,560
ruin our country.

289
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,440
Yes!

290
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,800
As for the scholar,

291
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,870
let him act alone.

292
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,870
If he has any conclusions,

293
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,110
report to me directly.

294
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,800
It concerns the national reputation.

295
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,230
Before doubts are cleared up,

296
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,440
you should stay here.

297
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,630
I'm not

298
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,110
leaving either.

299
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,440
Yes.

300
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,110
Sir.

301
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,710
Mr. Wang

302
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,230
asked you to go backstage.

303
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,830
Do Guo Yun and Zhang Ping
have any moves?

304
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,080
Not yet.

305
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,160
But Mr. Wang has

306
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,320
had them under close watch.

307
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,590
We'll either live or die tonight.

308
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,110
We have to bet all.

309
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,590
Zhang,

310
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,800
what's going on?

311
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm going to work the case.

312
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,630
Join me.

313
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,590
We're involved in such a big trouble,

314
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
and you're still thinking about working?

315
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,990
The murder is weird.

316
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,040
I want to crack it.

317
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,320
And Xie Hao probably died

318
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,870
because Mr. Lan sent her

319
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,160
to steal Hong Luo's bead.

320
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,200
If I crack the case,

321
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,040
I'll find out

322
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,590
why he wanted to steal the bead.

323
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,440
There are so many officers and men here.

324
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,400
It's not your work.

325
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,630
The Empress Dowager let me do it.

326
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,680
Empress Dowager?

327
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,280
Is she also in the Banyue Pavilion?

328
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,280
Mowen,

329
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,320
I've told you

330
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,560
the whole story.

331
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,080
The murderer now has
the Rhino-Horn Bead.

332
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,160
Once the secret letter in the bead

333
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
is presented to the Empress Dowager,

334
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,280
I'll be convicted guilty
for collusion and treason.

335
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,750
Then I can never explain it.

336
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,350
Why are you so calm?

337
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,200
That's the Empress Dowager.

338
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,510
Everyone says that the country

339
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,590
is nominally ruled by His Majesty,

340
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,160
but actually by her.

341
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,280
Nevertheless,

342
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,400
the empress dowager

343
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,200
appointed you to work the case.

344
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,870
Zhang,

345
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,800
I knew

346
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,040
you must be promising.

347
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,800
Zhang,

348
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,230
where do we start?

349
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,560
Backstage.

350
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,630
Look for Xie Hao's hair oil bottle.

351
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,350
Taking the bead, killing Xie Hao

352
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,680
and hanging the doggerel

353
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,040
may just be the beginning.

354
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,990
There must be more abominable moves.

355
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,870
About the killer,

356
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,800
do you have any guess?

357
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,110
Guo Yun is most suspicious.

358
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,960
The man is vicious and cunning

359
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
and would seek revenge for nothing

360
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,440
He tried to buy the secret letter
from Hong Luo this time.

361
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,750
Though I sent him away

362
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,960
with an excuse,

363
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,510
he could still let his man
wait in the Banyue Pavilion

364
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,800
for the Empress Dowager to come,

365
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,800
and then staged the incident.

366
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
That's possible.

367
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,080
It isn't surprising that

368
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,310
he tried to kill you.

369
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,470
At the moment,

370
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,030
we have to keep an eye on Guo Yun,

371
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,230
find the killer before Zhang Ping,

372
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,120
retrieve the secret letter,

373
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,270
and hide it from the Empress Dowager,

374
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,200
to gain a slim chance of survival.

375
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,790
Zhang Ping?

376
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,960
I thought your recommended him
to solve the case

377
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,160
was because you had a plan.

378
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,920
I had to strike first at that time

379
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,160
in case the Empress Dowager
would be suspicious.

380
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,510
Then what's your plan?

381
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,070
Now we have to guard against him first

382
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,360
and stop him from meddling in.

383
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,440
We're working.

384
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,600
Irrelevant people

385
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,440
are not allowed in.

386
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,750
We are not irrelevant.

387
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,680
We're appointed by the Empress...

388
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,710
By the high-ups to solve the case.

389
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,270
Haven't you checked up backstage?

390
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,160
I haven't finished.

391
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
I must find the victim's
hair oil bottle.

392
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Since you've checked it,

393
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,270
it's done.

394
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,640
Let's look for it somewhere else.

395
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,510
Peizi,

396
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,270
I've sent people to look for the bottle.

397
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,440
With the best detective
in the capital here,

398
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,270
don't worry about
being defeated by the brat.

399
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,400
Mowen,

400
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,840
it's a cantilever structure

401
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,230
over the stage.

402
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,640
Only big theaters can afford

403
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,230
such a cantilever structure.

404
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,200
On the cantilever are various devices

405
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,550
used to hang things

406
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,470
above the stage.

407
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,600
Do you suspect that

408
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,030
there's something fishy on it?

409
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,960
According to Zhang Ping,

410
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,400
in the last act,

411
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,270
Xie Hao was already dead before

412
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,270
she was hung on the cantilever.

413
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,550
When did the killer kill her?

414
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,270
During the interlude,
Xie Hao wasn't backstage.

415
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,200
I've looked everywhere backstage

416
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,880
without finding any traces.

417
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,710
Did the murderer

418
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,030
really killed Xie Hao up there?

419
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,990
And the two banners

420
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
are also hung on the cantilever.

421
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,120
Yin Yuan.

422
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:25,990
Yes.

423
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,360
Send for Ganger Jin
and the puppetmasters.

424
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,120
Yes.

425
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,180
(Theatrical Troupe of
the Banyue Pavilion, Ganger Jin)

426
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,070
The ladder is hidden pretty well.

427
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,440
Didn't you find that Xie Hao was dead

428
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,440
when you put her down?

429
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,120
Well, well...

430
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,640
Sir, please come with me.

431
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,360
Sir. Sir...

432
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,030
Sir, look.

433
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,640
During the performance,
we were here reeling the rope out.

434
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,230
Well...

435
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,400
We could neither see the ladder

436
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,030
nor see what happened on the cantilever,

437
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
let alone Xie Hao.

438
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,160
Usually, when she was ready,

439
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,160
she would yank the rope three times

440
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,310
to give us a signal.

441
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,710
When it was time for her to perform,

442
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,960
we would put her down.

443
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,750
- It's true.
- It's true.

444
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,880
However,

445
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,790
something was wrong today.

446
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,510
During rehearsal,

447
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,510
when Xie Hao hung herself on the rope,

448
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,960
it would swing.

449
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,790
But today,

450
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,640
it swung especially violently.

451
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,880
Sir, be careful.

452
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,510
This is the crime scene.

453
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,710
Ganger Jin.

454
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
The killer hid in a corner.

455
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,360
When Xie Hao came up
and attached the rope to herself,

456
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,790
he came out from behind
and strangled Xie Hao.

457
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,710
Xie Hao struggled desperately.

458
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,750
That's why the rope swung violently.

459
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,600
After Xie Hao died,

460
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,680
the killer yanked the rope three times.

461
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,030
The puppetmasters then
put Xie Hao down

462
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,160
as they did in the rehearsal.

463
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,640
Now we found out the M.O.

464
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,640
But the killer was very meticulous

465
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,070
and didn't leave any trace.

466
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,270
Sir,

467
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,990
I have a favor to ask of you.

468
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,270
Yes?

469
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,880
Sorry to bother you.

470
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
The unique skills

471
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,360
of our troupe

472
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,600
are all hidden on the cantilever.

473
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,230
We've never let outsiders see it.

474
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,640
If it goes out...

475
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,510
Who else knows

476
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,840
about the ladder?

477
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,960
Only our

478
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,790
own people knows about it.

479
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,230
That's our special skill,

480
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,840
and we never told others.

481
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,640
All right, I get it.

482
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,790
You can leave now.

483
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,680
Yes.

484
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,990
The killer

485
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,550
is one of the troupe.

486
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,030
We must find out now

487
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,030
if anyone works for Guo Yun
in the troupe.

488
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,600
Go away. Go away.

489
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,600
Are you going to take up this place too?

490
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Did I say that?

491
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,920
You do your job

492
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,920
and we'll do ours.

493
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,710
Let's not cross the line.

494
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,230
There's nothing here.

495
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,160
Let's search the other places.

496
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,510
Yes.

497
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,120
Yes.

498
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,310
They outnumber us.

499
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,230
How can we find it before them?

500
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,790
Found it.

501
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,400
Sir. I found it.

502
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
Too bad. They found the bottle.

503
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,270
Zhang!

504
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,070
It's empty?

505
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,840
Yes.

506
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
It was when we found it.

507
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,680
Nothing left in it.

508
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,790
It seems that we can't find
the combustion promoter.

509
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,440
Although the bottle is empty,

510
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,400
the smell still remains.

511
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,230
We may find out what was inside it.

512
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,200
Keep it.

513
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,790
Yes.

514
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,230
What can I do for you?

515
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
Have you found the hair oil bottle?

516
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,070
Yes.

517
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,270
So what?

518
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,920
May I have a look?

519
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,790
We found the bottle first.

520
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,920
Why should we let you see it?

521
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,120
You tried to hold me back all the time.

522
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,470
So?

523
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,270
Do you expect me to follow your orders?

524
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,990
Mr. Lan,

525
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,310
trying to hold me back only implies

526
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,230
how fishy the whole thing is.

527
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,990
I know Xie Hao's death

528
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,200
must have something to do

529
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,030
with your plan of stealing the bead.

530
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,510
Zhang Ping,

531
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,230
do you know what punishment you deserve

532
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,470
to slander a court official?

533
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,990
You know clearly

534
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,920
if it's a slander.

535
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,880
Where's your evidence?

536
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,550
Without evidence, it's a slander.

537
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,750
Now that you wouldn't let me do my job,

538
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,750
I'm going to tell the Empress Dowager.

539
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,030
Stop.

540
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,790
Just because you couldn't find anything,
you're going to tell on us.

541
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,120
Aren't you ashamed?

542
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,790
Tell me.

543
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,120
What do you want to do?

544
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,550
Look into the hair oil bottle

545
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,470
and find out how the killer
made the self-ignition happen.

546
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,880
The bottle is the evidence

547
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,120
found by the Ministry of Justice.

548
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,230
How can we give it to you easily?

549
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,840
Don't you even understand that?

550
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,230
Then let me go backstage

551
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,030
and do my job.

552
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,680
As you please.

553
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,840
Nobody will stop you.

554
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,070
Mr. Lan,

555
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,880
no matter what your scheme is,

556
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll find out what happened.

557
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,600
Mowen,

558
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,120
there's no time to lose.

559
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,790
We mustn't let Zhang Ping
find it out first.

560
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,120
I'm going to question the troupe.

561
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,510
Then I'll search their rooms

562
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,400
and check if anyone

563
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,960
has secret contact with Guo Yun.

564
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,310
Sir,

565
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,790
they are dancers

566
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,960
and they are musicians.

567
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,470
All the troupe members are here,

568
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,600
except a girl, Zhi Xia,

569
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,550
who's freaked out.

570
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,640
We couldn't get anything out of her.

571
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,640
She doesn't seem to fake it.

572
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,310
I locked her in the room.

573
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,310
Find a physician for her.

574
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,710
Question her again when she gets better.

575
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,360
Yes.

576
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,270
I've found out that

577
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,750
the murderer is one of you.

578
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,230
Seriously? One of us?

579
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,990
Xie Hao was so kind to us.

580
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,790
Who would kill her so cruelly?

581
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,230
Are you going to confess

582
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,360
or wait for me to find it out?

583
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,030
Think it over.

584
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,120
Who's the killer?

585
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,230
Who would kill her?

586
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,840
No volunteer?

587
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,710
Then let's have an interrogation.

588
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,160
At the interlude,

589
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,160
did you find anything unusual?

590
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,690
(Dancer of Banyue Pavilion Ling Xiao)
Who knows?

591
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,920
The interlude was very short.

592
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,880
Everyone was busy changing

593
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,470
at the compartments for the next scene.

594
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,980
(Dancer of Banyue Pavilion Li Niang)

595
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,710
Nothing unusual.

596
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,980
(Musician of Banyue Pavilion Han Yan)

597
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,640
(Dancer of Banyue Pavilion Han Yan)
We didn't even have time to change.

598
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,790
How could we

599
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,600
pay attention to anything else?

600
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,160
Was everyone there

601
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,600
when you were changing?

602
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,550
Yes.

603
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,030
We girls are always together.

604
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,160
We can testify for each other.

605
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,790
Sure.

606
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,070
Sir, are you suspecting me?

607
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,840
Sir,

608
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,960
we're only

609
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,310
delicate girls.

610
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,840
How could we

611
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,960
kill someone?

612
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,680
Enough. Leave.

613
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,030
We've searched thoroughly backstage.

614
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,960
Why couldn't we find it?

615
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,360
Where is the least noticeable place

616
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,360
to pour the remaining hair oil?

617
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,990
The bottle is empty.

618
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,880
The killer must have emptied it

619
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,710
in case we'll find out

620
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,640
the combustion promoter.

621
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,550
There is another possibility.

622
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,230
There wasn't much oil

623
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,510
left in the first place.

624
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,880
I've checked it.

625
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,470
The other dancers' bottles are full.

626
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,750
What are you doing?

627
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,750
Collect all the dancers' bottles.

628
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,990
They are all full.

629
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,920
The killer poured

630
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,710
the remaining oil into these bottles.

631
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,990
Even if the trick is figured out,

632
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,960
since it has been diluted,

633
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,470
it's difficult to identify

634
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,920
what the combustion promoter is.

635
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,400
It's done.

636
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,790
I was excited for nothing.

637
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,310
They're useless.

638
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,440
I have an idea.

639
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,750
Sir,

640
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,510
we've searched several dancers' bedrooms

641
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,070
without finding any clues

642
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,400
about secret contacts with Guo Yun.

643
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,550
Sir,

644
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,270
we're not good at investigating cases.

645
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,640
Even though we turn the place
upside down,

646
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,990
we won't find anything useful.

647
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,750
The officials and nobles in the court

648
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,440
Often give the troupe girls

649
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,310
precious gifts to please.

650
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,600
I don't think Guo Yun

651
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,960
is an exception.

652
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,230
Sir,

653
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,310
look.

654
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,200
These are no more than
anti-abortion medicine

655
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,030
and tonic medicine for miscarriages.

656
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,400
In Banyue Pavilion,

657
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,960
it isn't surprising.

658
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,880
Sir,

659
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,070
what's wrong?

660
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,400
Zhang,

661
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,750
you are...

662
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,200
This is my master's idea.

663
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,990
When I was little, he used to

664
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,880
make me cheese in this way.

665
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,920
Pour the milk into an bottle

666
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,160
and swing it like this.

667
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,030
The curds and whey will be separated.

668
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,680
Maybe in this way,

669
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,360
we can separate the hair oil

670
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,400
and the combustion promoter.

671
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,120
How many rounds do we have to swing?

672
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,880
About several thousands.

673
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,960
How long will it take us?

674
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,680
Soon.

675
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,360
Han Yan,

676
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,920
I know you killed Xie Hao

677
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,360
under Vice Minister Guo's instigation.

678
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,990
I think in Banyue Pavilion,

679
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,960
you've seen enough of the intrigues

680
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,640
in the officialdom

681
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,710
I won't preach about
moral principles today.

682
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,400
I want to make a deal.

683
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,920
If you return the bead to me,

684
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,310
maybe I'll let Mr. Wang

685
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
spare your life.

686
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Vice Minister Guo?

687
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,960
I don't even know him,

688
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,600
not to mention
what you're talking about.

689
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,070
The pipa is very valuable.

690
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,920
It's too expensive for you to afford.

691
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,550
The scroll

692
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,230
is made of red sandalwood
inlaid with mother-of-pearl.

693
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,310
And its back

694
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
is pieced together with ivory carvings.

695
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,160
Each piece shows

696
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,400
extraordinary carving skills.

697
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,710
And the love poem on it

698
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,790
must have spoken for your heart.

699
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,440
The lovely lady
makes the city infatuated,

700
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,710
with her red lips, slender fingers
and exquisite tastes.

701
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,880
Hidden in the two lines are your name

702
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,920
and the surname

703
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,790
of Mr. Guo.

704
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,710
Apparently, you not only know Mr. Guo,

705
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,840
but are close to him.

706
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,550
Sir, don't accuse me for nothing.

707
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,270
I share the same interests

708
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,990
with Mr. Guo,

709
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,750
and we occasionally
compose poems and sing together.

710
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,310
Then why do you have

711
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,030
anti-abortion medicine

712
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,790
and tonic medicine for miscarriages?

713
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,920
If I'm right,

714
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,750
it proves that
you once carried his child.

715
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,920
As a fourth-rank official,

716
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,470
you rub it in deliberately.

717
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,190
You're so mean.

718
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,880
Tonight, the Empress Dowager
personally attends to the case.

719
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,360
If you're exposed,

720
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,590
do you think

721
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,510
he would take all the blame

722
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,190
or sacrifice you to save himself?

723
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,110
This is the hair oil.

724
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,840
This should be

725
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,670
the combustion promoter.

726
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,150
The oil isn't flammable.

727
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,150
We'll know if this is a
combustion promoter after testing.

728
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,960
Zhang,

729
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,510
what's this?

730
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,880
It caught fire without even
contacting the fire.

731
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,670
This is turpentine oil.

732
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,320
We need to do a test now.

733
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,190
Wig?

734
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,240
How do you do the test?

735
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,630
Miss Han Yan,

736
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,880
I advice you...

737
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,360
Mr. Lan, you're trying to
pin the murder on me

738
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
by all means.

739
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,150
Even if Guo and I
are attracted to each other,

740
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,280
does it have anything to do
with the murder?

741
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,550
You don't even know
what kind of person Guo Yun is.

742
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,440
How can you be so devoted to him?

743
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,440
I don't know what kind of person

744
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,720
Guo Yun is?

745
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm forced to make a living here.

746
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,630
Even though I'm talented,

747
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,720
men regard me as a plaything

748
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,510
at their disposal.

749
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,280
But Guo is different.

750
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,240
He knows me,

751
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,630
respects me,

752
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,880
and treats me with sincerity.

753
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,240
When I was pregnant,
my pulse was unstable

754
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,880
and I vomited a lot,

755
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,510
he was concerned about my health.

756
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,960
He got anti-abortion medicine
for me personally

757
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,990
and told the physician to

758
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,360
add dry ginger to
relieve my sickness.

759
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,360
If he doesn't care about me,

760
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,920
why would he bother?

761
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,030
You don't even have evidence,

762
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,400
yet you try to plant the crime on him.

763
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,030
I know that you've resented him
for a long time,

764
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,190
but I don't have

765
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,510
what you want.

766
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,510
Don't flog a dead horse.

767
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,990
Han Yan is really

768
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,280
hard to break through.

769
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,190
We've blazed our way forward
through all difficulties

770
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,360
without expecting to be
hindered by a prostitute.

771
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,800
I thought by breaking through her,

772
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,150
I could get the letter back

773
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,550
and uncover Guo Yun.

774
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,880
I never thought that...

775
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,990
Guo Yun is hardhearted and ungrateful.

776
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,400
For the sake of his father-in-law,

777
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,360
he dare not offend his wife.

778
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,110
How could he be so considerate

779
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,920
and care about his mistress's fetus?

780
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,110
Zhang,

781
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,630
why does nothing happen?

782
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,150
- Good!
- Good. Good.

783
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,400
- Great! Good.
- Good!

784
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,030
Great!

785
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,110
Great!

786
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,630
- Good!
- One more!

787
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,440
Good!

788
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,720
Zhang,

789
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,110
will it work?

790
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,110
What's that?

791
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,320
It looks like a light spot.

792
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,720
It's a Fire Bead.

793
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
What's a Fire Bead?

794
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,990
A crystal bead

795
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,070
that can gather light and heat.

796
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,960
As expected,

797
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,190
this isn't a Fire Bead.

798
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,320
Someone must have

799
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,470
done something to the one on the left.

800
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,920
Your analysis

801
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,190
sounds reasonable,

802
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,720
but...

803
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,150
According to the books,

804
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,280
if you hold a Fire Bead with mugwort,

805
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,110
and face the sun at noon,

806
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,400
the mugwort will be ignited.

807
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,360
The hair didn't catch fire

808
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,840
because the light wasn't strong enough.

809
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,920
But during the performance...

810
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,630
Let's go to see Mr. Jia.

811
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,030
Zhang Ping is going to see Mr. Jia now.

812
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
Let us out!

813
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,360
Back off! Stop yelling.

814
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,150
Back off. Back off.

815
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,670
Stop asking.

816
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,030
Back off.

817
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,990
Blood letter?

818
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,360
What does it say?

819
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,320
Sir,

820
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,800
we're in trouble.

821
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,720
A beggar just sent a blood letter

822
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,760
saying that

823
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,550
secret letters with the enemy

824
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,760
reveal the hidden evil intent.

825
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,190
Having no shame drives a son

826
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,920
to go on with his father's will.

827
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,880
Where is the beggar?

828
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,470
Did he say who sent him?

829
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,360
He is blind.

830
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,320
He just said a young girl

831
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,320
asked him to deliver the letter
before midnight.

832
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,990
Except that,

833
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,030
he didn't know anything else.

834
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,590
Slipped away.

835
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,550
Now,

836
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,110
the Imperial Guards have been alarmed.

837
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,980
They asked us to strengthen security

838
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,470
and be strictly on guard.

839
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,110
The Empress Dowager will know soon.

840
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,470
Sir.

841
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,440
Peizhi.

842
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,150
Have we come to a dead end?

843
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,990
Having no shame drives a son
to go on with his father's will.

844
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,880
He just said a young girl

845
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,470
asked him to deliver the letter
before midnight.

846
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,720
Only our

847
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,990
own people knows about it.

848
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,470
But Guo is different.

849
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
He got anti-abortion medicine
for me personally

850
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,150
Don't flog a dead horse.

851
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,150
Zhang Ping is going to see Mr. Jia now.

852
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,510
(I must make Han Yan talk.)

853
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,440
Sir, be careful.

854
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,470
Chen Chou.

855
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,070
As expected,

856
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,400
In order to produce the effect
of lightning and thunder,

857
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,590
they put gunpowder into the brazier.

858
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,720
The light became strong instantly.

859
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,280
Then they used the Fire Bead

860
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,110
to concentrate light rays
on Xie Hao's head,

861
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,550
so as to make self-ignition happen.

862
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,970
There's a murder!

863
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,190
I hope that you think it over.

864
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,510
Your words tonight

865
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,510
will not only decide my fate

866
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,590
but also yours.

867
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,630
The oil is

868
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,110
nail polish used by the pipa players.

869
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,670
Isn't pipa played with a plectrum?

870
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,960
It's a new way to play with hands

871
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,920
instead of plectrums.

872
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,590
It's easy to hurt the hands,

873
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,240
so the players need nail polish.

874
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,760
In the troupe,
who can play pipa in the new way?

875
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Few players in the capital

876
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,960
can do it.

877
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,800
There's only one in the troupe,

878
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,190
the Pipa Fairy,

879
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,670
Han Yan.

880
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,400
Go to see the Empress Dowager

881
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,360
and ask her to question Han Yan.

882
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,280
Are you Han Yan?

883
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,760
Yes.

884
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,070
Take her away.

885
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,960
Here's Her Majesty's order.

886
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,400
Call Vice Minister Lan back!

887
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,510
I'll

888
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,800
follow the order.

889
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,960
