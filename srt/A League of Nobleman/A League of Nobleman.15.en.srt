1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,480
A secret buyer

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,320
asked Chang Wei
to steal the phoenix head.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,440
Do you not know him, too?

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,800
Someone asked Chang Wei to steal it?

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,240
Is it him?

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,070
The survivor of Moluo Village.

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,960
Is he back for revenge?

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,030
It must be him.

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,960
He's back for revenge.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,640
There's a survivor?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,520
Hiding in the shadow,

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,840
he did witchcraft.

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,560
The entire Sacred Lake

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,750
was bubbling.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,670
It was witchcraft.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,510
What's going on here?

17
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,120
Mr. Xuan, it's witchcraft. Witchcraft!

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,480
Run!

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,790
Run!

20
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,200
Mr. Lan,

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,040
this is true.

22
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,350
So, up to now,

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,870
I still can't stand the whistling sound.

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,510
You know that.

25
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,920
Whistling sound?

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,080
Have you seen this whistle before?

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,870
This whistle...

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,400
I saw it before.

29
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,520
It's what Moluo Clansmen always carry.

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,310
And their badge is on it.

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,910
That year,

32
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,400
to deal with Moluo Clansmen,

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
I collected many things related.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
The badge is one of them.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,750
The evidence is...

36
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,870
in that wooden box.

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,750
Mr. Lan,

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,960
I'm sorry for your father.

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,240
But what's done is done.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,520
I begged your father not to tell on me.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
He promised me.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,590
Shut up!

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
You coward!

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
Yes, I am.

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
So, over all these years,

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,150
I never dared to tell you the truth.

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,400
But I'm not to blame alone.

48
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,430
You should blame

49
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,960
Moluo Clansmen

50
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,680
and their witchcraft.

51
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,280
Your father and I are victims!

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,590
You keep saying they can do witchcraft.

53
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,280
What witchcraft?

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,000
And how did they get the intel?

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,630
Witchcraft...

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Witchcraft...

57
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,400
It can read minds.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,470
Once someone is tricked,

59
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,910
he can't keep any secret.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Your father was honest
and incorruptible.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,280
Why did he suddenly do treason?

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,310
And he confessed it personally.

63
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,590
He must have been bewitched.

64
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,600
Does that witchcraft

65
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,870
have something to do with this?

66
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,920
This is it.

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,390
How did you get it?

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,390
It's the witch's water vessel.

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,390
I don't know.

70
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,750
I'm an orphan.

71
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,870
When my master found me,

72
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,720
it was beside me.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,310
Can you be the witch's son?

74
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,750
When she was in the Capital City,

75
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,430
she took a boy two or three years old.

76
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,750
If he's still alive,

77
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,920
he'll be of your age.

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,070
I can't be.

79
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,120
I can't be.

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,510
It must be you!

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,360
When we

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,160
tracked down to Moluo Village,

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
the witch seemed to sense something.

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,240
So, overnight,

85
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,270
she ran away with that boy
and her water vessel.

86
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,720
But when we caught up,

87
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,800
she was all alone.

88
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,800
The water vessel was gone.

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
She must have hidden the boy

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,800
and the water vessel.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,270
No way.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,870
How can you say I'm her son

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,510
just because I have a water vessel?

94
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,800
Maybe...

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
Then why can you draw this badge?

96
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,070
I'm telling the truth.

97
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,600
The water vessel is evil.

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,870
When you gently strike,

99
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,630
it makes a wicked buzz.

100
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,680
And the water ripples.

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,070
If you hear or see it,

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,870
you'll be hypnotized.

103
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,390
That's how

104
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,070
they tricked your father to the South.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
You want to avenge your father, huh?

106
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,270
Your enemy is right here.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,950
You and I have a common enemy!

108
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Who?

109
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,800
Don't kill me!

110
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't kill me!

111
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,070
Don't let Xuan Ji run away.

112
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,630
Mr. Lan...

113
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,800
Go save Xuan Ji.

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,630
Open the door!

115
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,360
Xuan Ji can't be dead now. Wait.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,510
Open the door.

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,000
Xuan Ji.

118
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,480
Xuan Ji!

119
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,550
When Chu Qi'er was performing,

120
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,630
did you feel uncomfortable?

121
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,720
Sorry.

122
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,720
In the crime scenes
of Chang Wei and Embalmer,

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,510
I saw you.

124
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,000
Who on earth are you?

125
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,000
If you're from Moluo Clan,

126
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,750
could you tell me

127
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
what exactly happened that year?

128
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,720
Don't die.

you're faking some evidence.

Mr. Lan,

203
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,440
I haven't figured out

204
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,030
what on earth happened that year.

205
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,110
And I'm not sure
whether you were good or evil.

206
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,070
But I'll try my best

Zhang,

208
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,200
where are you going?

209
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,550
To see my master in my hometown.

210
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,640
But the Imperial Exam is coming.

211
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,790
Do you not want to work
in the Court of Judicial Review?

212
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,510
If I don't know the truth,

213
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,960
what's the point of working there?

214
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,820
(Yuntou Mountain, Xichuan County)

215
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,640
You'll imitate Xuan Ji's handwriting

216
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,400
to fake a letter?

217
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,920
I'll write an apology letter in his tone.

218
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,110
Then Her Majesty and His Majesty
would believe

219
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,750
that Xuan Ji confessed everything

220
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,270
when forced by the killer before he died.

221
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,160
But Peizhi,

222
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,110
this is deceiving His Majesty.

223
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,440
Deceiving His Majesty?

224
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,110
It's not the first time, anyway.

225
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,750
I framed Guo Yun

226
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,640
and Gong Yuzhen.

227
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,880
And now, I'm doing it for my father.

228
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,310
But before,

229
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
you dealt with your rivals in the court.

230
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
This time,

231
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,110
innocent people would be involved.

232
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,920
Can you really do that?

233
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,880
I'll try hard
not to hurt innocent people.

234
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,030
Including Zhang Ping?

235
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,110
It's natural

236
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,590
that he pays her mother's debts!

237
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,350
Don't you know

238
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,750
he was only a boy at that time?

239
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,200
How could you let him...

240
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,030
I've made up my mind.

241
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,720
If you're still my close friend,
stop persuading me.

242
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,160
In ten days,

243
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,550
come get the apology letter.

244
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,160
Why do I always fail
to imitate Xuan Ji's handwriting?

245
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,780
(I heard Your Majesty was so kind
that alien races came...)

246
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,790
Since when did we have a cat?

247
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,000
Maybe it's a stray cat.

248
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,100
(I heard Your Majesty was so kind
that alien races came...)

249
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,270
Get the cat out!

250
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes.

251
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
Cat food?

252
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,070
The cat came for the food, I guess.

253
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,590
Isn't it the vessel
Zhang Ping brought here?

254
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,640
Did he even

255
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,310
feed a stray cat here?

256
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,830
Dump it immediately

257
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,680
in case Mr. Lan sees it.

258
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,350
Sure.

259
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,270
Search carefully.

260
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,550
Mr. Lan,

261
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,640
we can't find the cat anywhere.

262
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,350
Is it so hard

263
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,160
to imitate my handwriting?

264
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
When you framed Guo Yun,

265
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,160
you imitated his handwriting easily.

266
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,310
Do you know why you fail this time?

267
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,070
Why?

268
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,790
Because you aren't merciless enough

269
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,110
or unscrupulous enough.

270
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,550
You're not as fierce as me yet.

271
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,920

272

Listen, listen.

276
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,590
Listen.

277
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,440
I still have hiccups.

278
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,790
I won a lot in gambling the other day.

279
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,590
Sun must have been jealous

280
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,070
and he adulterated my wine with water.

281
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,440
Master, I have something to ask you.

282
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,110
Come on.

283
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,400
Let me change your dressing.

284
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,350
Sit.

285
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,400
Look at you.

286
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,550
How did you get so badly wounded?

287
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,750
When you traveled alone,

288
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,550
you should have been careful.

289
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,750
Master,

290
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,790
I...

291
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,960
Master...

292
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Who will ask first,

293
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,000
you or me?

294
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,720
I want to know my origin.

295
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,070
In the Capital City,

296
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,550
you were badly slashed.

297
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,110
For whom?

298
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,350
A young man like you

299
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,830
shouldn't always be impetuous.

300
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,960
What did I tell you?

301
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,070
When you recover, you'll calm down.

302
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,350
Stay at home for recovery.

303
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,070
Sir.

304
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,070
Get out!

305
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,110
Are you done writing the letter?

306
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,200
Kill all people in Yong Kingdom.

307
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,590
Good job.

308
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,440
People will know Moluo Clansmen

309
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,480
had dark intentions.

310
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
Now that I decide to fake some evidence,

311
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,000
I must do it perfectly.

312
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,110
You made some progress.

313
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Now you can try

314
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,830
imitating my handwriting.

are you all right?

Look.

Zhang Ping put the cat food everywhere.

321
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,920
Mr. Lan has been away for three days.

322
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
I wonder where he has gone.

323
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,200
Yeah.

324
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,830
Before, Mr. Lan never

325
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,200
hid anything from us.

326
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,640
Mr. Lan is back.

00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,110
Mr. Lan.

You were away for three days.

331
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,240
Have you found a witness?

332
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,310
I got an old posthouse attendant

333
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,790
to testify

334
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,960
that 20 years ago,

335
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,750
he saw a witch

hypnotize my father

337

with witchcraft.

338
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,110
But who knew the witch?

339
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,030
At that time,

340
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,400
she carried a token
of the Department of Incantation.
