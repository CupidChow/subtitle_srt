1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,480
Miss Gong,

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,670
about the death of Chu Qi'er,

3
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,200
I want to ask you some questions.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,070
Who are you?

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,110
The case has already closed.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,900
Why do you still pester Miss Gong?

7
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,200
Who did you conspire with

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
to kill Chu Qi'er?

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,110
Was the rouge sprinkled
in the underdrain that day

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
the mark you made for the murderer?

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,150
The rouge was alum free

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,430
and you were the only one who had that.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,710
Who was your accomplice?

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,320
Why did you kill Chu Qi'er?

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
I didn't intend to kill her,

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,920
but she went too far in bullying me.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,840
At first,

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,230
I competed with Chu Qi'er
for being the painting model.

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,920
That day after training,

20
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,350
she had a discussion with me.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,950
The competition is coming soon.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,870
Why don't you consider quitting

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,000
and providing accompaniment to me?

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,950
I've been working hard for long.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,560
Why would I quit?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680
How dare you talk to me like that?

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,430
Your grandpa, the old minister,
is about to retire.

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,760
What right have you to
put on a lady's airs to me?

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,230
You always act delicate and attractive.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,870
You make me

31
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,280
sick.

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,040
I wonder if you can

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,350
still pretend to be pure

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,840
and flaunt your talents

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
after losing virginity.

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,000
After that,

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,520
I hid in my room

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,910
and wept the days away.

39
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,960
Chu Qi'er threatened to

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,630
spread the news all over the capital.

41
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,280
I was so scared that

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,310
I had to quit the competition

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,710
and back her instead.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,910
But I

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
hated her so much.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,030
Please, Heaven, punish her.

47
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,120
Let her fall in relentless hell.

48
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,520
There are so many bad guys in the world.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
How could Heaven
punish them one by one?

50
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,630
Who are you?

51
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,870
It doesn't matter.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,870
You hate her so much.

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,000
Why don't you get rid of her?

54
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,910
Heaven can't help you,

55
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,870
but I can.

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,400
Really?

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,800
Who is he?

58
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,310
Nor did I see his face.

59
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,800
He only told me to drop my rouge

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
at the mouth of the underdrain

61
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,630
to guide him on the competition day.

62
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,800
Bullied by Chu Qi'er,

63
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,280
you deserve of sympathy.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,000
But you conspired with the murderer

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
to kill Chu Qi'er with poison.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,080
You're his accomplice.

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,750
You'd better turn yourself in
to the Ministry of Justice.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,000
Wait.

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,870
You go home first.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Don't mind him.

71
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,030
Mr. Lan,

72
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,870
one should answer for what he does.

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,920
You've helped me a lot.

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,510
I don't want to be a burden to you.

75
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,720
Chu Qi'er bullied good people

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,720
and had no regard for human life.

77
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,870
She deserved it.

78
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,390
It wasn't anyone's fault.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,950
Mr. Lan,

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,750
I've made a big mistake.

81
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,950
It's been preying on my conscience.

82
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,000
I couldn't sleep.

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
So I left your mansion.

84
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,430
I want to go home

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,870
and say goodbye to Grandpa

86
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,240
before I turn myself in.

87
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,390
If you didn't resist

88
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,070
and let her bully you at will,

89
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,800
it wouldn't be fair.

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,800
But...

91
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,920
I know you feel guilty.

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
But think about it.

93
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,070
Your grandpa has been upright
all his life

94
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,310
and enjoyed prestige and respect.

95
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,270
Now,

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,630
he's going to retire honorably.

97
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,480
Do you think it's worth it
to disgrace his name

98
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,560
because of a woman

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,120
like Chu Qi'er?

100
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,680
Moreover, the minister
has no family but you.

101
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,190
How could he

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,310
spend the rest of his life
without you?

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,830
Mr. Lan,

104
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,240
did you really say those righteous words

105
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,630
for the good of Minister Gong?

106
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,000
After the crime,

107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,190
you learned that Miss Gong

108
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,120
conspired with the murderer.

109
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,830
Worrying that the news might get out,

110
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,160
you sent someone to get the rouge case.

111
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,920
So,

112
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,070
a light of fire
came out of the underdrain.

113
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,070
Afterward,

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,750
you obstructed my investigation
again and again

115
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,750
and hid Miss Gong in your mansion.

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,600
No matter

117
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,830
what you think,

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Yuzhen won't plead guilty.

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
You don't have any evidence.

120
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,480
You cover up the truth
and harbor the murderer.

121
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
You're not fit to be an official!

122
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,070
It's not your place to teach me
how to be an official.

123
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
Even if you pass the exam,

124
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,920
such a fool as you

125
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,720
won't last three days
in the officialdom.

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,310
Go back to run your petty business.

127
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,920
At least I have a clear conscience.

128
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,720
What about you?

129
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,270
Dare you say you don't feel guilty?

Minister Gong's Mansion)

133
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,710
Mr. Lan,

134
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,150
Minister Gong is waiting for you
at the study.

135
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,230
Where is Yuzhen now?

136
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,320
Sir, don't worry.

137
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,350
I've sent extra hands

138
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,390
to protect Miss Gong well.

139
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,590
Did you do this

140
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,790
for my recommendation?

141
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
I'm determined to get the position

142
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,120
of the Minister of Rites.

143
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,440
But I also

144
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,960
did that for Yuzhen.

145
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,520
Though she's an accomplice

146
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,760
and doesn't deserve to die,

147
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,080
prison and exile to the border

148
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,320
would be too much

149
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,710
for a weak girl like her to stand.

150
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,110
Yuzhen had no appetite a while ago

151
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,870
and looked listless.

152
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,990
If I had asked her,
everything might not have happened.

153
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Sir, don't blame yourself.

154
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,990
I've arranged everything properly.

155
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,590
Just say the word,

156
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,750
this thing

157
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,110
will disappear forever.

158
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,350
Your son was

159
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,990
the Prefect of Youzhou before.

160
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,960
To reveal corruption,

161
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,630
he and his wife both died,

162
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,710
leaving Yuzhen behind.

163
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,750
If they knew what happened to Yuzhen,

164
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,630
how could they rest in peace?

165
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,350
Sir,

166
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,920
now,

167
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,040
we still have a chance
to turn it around.

168
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,320
If you take a step back,

169
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,400
you can not only save your reputation,

170
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,110
but also get Yuzhen

171
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,470
out of it unscathed.

172
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,680
Covering up the crime
and concealing mistakes

173
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,350
isn't what a gentlemen should do.

174
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,750
Yuzhen is my granddaughter.

175
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,230
I'm responsible for her mistakes.

176
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm willing to take the blame with her.

177
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,080
Even if people curse us,

178
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,400
that's what I must bear.

179
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,680
It turns out I'm the only one

180
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,200
that shamelessly

181
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,800
seeks personal gain.

182
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,470
Of autumn

183
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,750
the cicada sings.

184
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,710
In prison

185
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,230
I'm worn out with care.

186
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,040
Who would believe its spirit high?

187
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,830
Could I express my grief in word?

188
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,630
Lan.

189
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,230
Your father used this poem

190
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,920
to show his aspiration while in prison.

191
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,920
If he knew his son became like this,

192
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,510
what would he feel?

193
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,920
In prison, your father expressed

194
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,110
his ambition with the poem.

195
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,280
The loyalty and anger showed clearly
in his words and manner.

196
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,110
He didn't reveal the truth

197
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,510
even when he was executed.

198
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,470
If you two were close friends,

199
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,990
why had he never mentioned it?

200
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,710
Because he worried that

201
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,440
we would be framed up for ganging up.

202
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,280
Then,

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,280
in the last ten years,

204
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,960
why didn't you tell me anything?

205
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,750
Because your father

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,110
asked me not to tell you

207
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,680
or even recommend you.

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,870
(Lan Lin)
I have one last unreasonable request.

209
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,590
Do tell me.

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,400
I won't

211
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,080
regret my death.

212
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,680
But...

213
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,680
But,

214
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,960
I worry about my son, Lan Jue.

215
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,680
Lan.

216
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,320
Lan.

217
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,750
Don't worry.

218
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,350
I'll take good care of him,

219
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,470
and treat him as my own son.

220
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,990
He is the son of a sinner.

221
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,630
You shouldn't adopt him.

222
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
I only ask you to help him secretly,

223
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,920
and keep him alive.

224
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,680
OK.

225
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,630
Lan.

226
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,960
Lan, get up.

227
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,510
Remember to tell him,

228
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,400
never to enter the official career.

229
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,110
The day twenty years ago,

230
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,200
were you the man

231
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,990
who saved me?

232
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,710
Where is the traitor?

233
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,400
Hanging at the market entrance.

234
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,040
Who is the traitor?

235
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,750
Either a pig or a dog.

236
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,680
Where is the traitor?

237
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,680
Hanging at the market entrance.

238
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,590
Who is the traitor?

239
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,510
Either a pig...

240
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,710
My father wasn't a traitor.

241
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,870
He was wronged.

242
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,400
Beat him.

243
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,750
He was wronged!

244
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,110
He was definitely a traitor.

245
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,710
He was wronged!

246
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,590
Stop!

247
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Forget about redressing the
injustice for your father.

248
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Try to live well.

249
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,710
I wanted you

250
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,960
to forget the past

251
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,080
and live a normal life.

252
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,320
You look after my house.

253
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,920
I'll pay you a wage.

254
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,990
It's much better than

255
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,440
sleeping in the open without food.

256
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,590
What do you say?

257
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,590
Can I get enough candles at night?

258
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,350
Sure.

259
00:14:59,560 --> 00:14:59,990
You can.

260
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,710
OK.

261
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,440
Confucius says,

262
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,560
the disciple within
should exercise filial piety;

263
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,680
without, fraternal respect;

264
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,960
should be prudent and faithful;

265
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,110
highly affectionate to all

266
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,960
and intimate with the good;

267
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,560
when he has leisure;

268
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,400
he should apply to learning.

269
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,350
Confucius says,

270
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,830
the silent treasuring up of knowledge;

271
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,470
learning without satisfaction;

272
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,110
and instructing others untiringly;

273
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,230
which one of these belongs to me?

274
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,510
Confucius says,

275
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,280
the virtuous is free from anxieties;

276
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,960
the wise is free from doubts;

277
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,110
the brave is free from fear.

278
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,320
Go ahead.

279
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,960
But,

280
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
you are brilliant.

281
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,800
You overcame all difficulties
and made it to the Third Category.

282
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I know

283
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,920
you've tried every means
to be the Minister of Rites,

284
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,960
so that you can go to Nandong,

285
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,200
and redress the injustice
for your father.

286
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,120
Over the years in the ministry,

287
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,470
I've been cold to you,

288
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,840
for fear that you would rise too fast

289
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,440
and put yourself in danger.

290
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,200
I haven't accomplished anything

291
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,510
your father requested me to do.

292
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
He wanted you to be alive,

293
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,470
but I watch you become like this.

294
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,920
He asked you not to
enter the official career,

295
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
but I watch you

296
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,120
struggle desperately
in the political whirlpool.

297
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
In the end, you're forced to

298
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,960
go against your will,

299
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,790
and fall into a wrong path.

300
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,470
Lan,

301
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,710
I failed to

302
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,400
live up to your requests.

303
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,200
I can no longer protect your son.

304
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,230
He has to go his own way

305
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,640
from now on.

306
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,120
Sir.

307
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Let the minister decide

308
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
whether to catch Yuzhen.

309
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,790
I won't

310
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,550
interfere with it again.

311
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,400
What about the minister's position?

312
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,840
Let's find another way.

313
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,440
Xu Dong,

314
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,640
escort Yuzhen to Gong's Mansion.

315
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,710
Yes.

316
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,470
Mr. Lan.

317
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,120
What happened?

318
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,310
Miss Gong was missing.

319
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,790
What's going on?

320
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,840
She received a letter,

321
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,550
asking her to discuss the case.

322
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,030
I asked her to ignore it,

323
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,310
but she insisted on going.

324
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,680
She said it might bring the truth
into daylight.

325
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,640
So we went to a corner by the river
to meet the guy.

326
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,550
He wouldn't let me approach.

327
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,470
So I waited at a distance.

328
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,640
But after I waited for a long time,

329
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,360
I heard Miss Gao yelling.

330
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,920
When I got there,

331
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,120
she was disappeared.

332
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,360
We're in trouble.

333
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,820
(Ministry of Justice)

334
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,750
That's

335
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,070
what happened.

336
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,710
Do you still regard me as a brother?

337
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,790
If Gong Yuzhen wasn't kidnapped,

338
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,470
were you going to
keep it from me all your life?

339
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,470
I don't want you

340
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,990
to get your hands

341
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,930
dirty.

342
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,550
It's ridiculous that
by exhausting all efforts,

343
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,030
I only hurt the people who love me

344
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,750
and protect me.

345
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,070
All right.

346
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,960
Right now,

347
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,800
we should catch the murderer first.

348
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:20,750
Let me in.

349
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,310
You can't go in.

350
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:21,990
Zhang Ping.

351
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,470
Zhang Ping.

352
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:22,880
Mr. Wang.

353
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,200
You can't get in.

354
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,070
He, sir.

355
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,270
He...

356
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,470
Have you heard about Dr. Sun's death?

357
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,990
He died exactly like Chu Qi'er.

358
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,200
Dr. Sun?

359
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,550
What happened?

360
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,840
Dr. Sun of Baoshan Pharmacy

361
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,200
died a few days ago.

362
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,070
The body

363
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,030
was also rigid,

364
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,840
the skin gray,

365
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,960
with cracks.

366
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,550
It seems that

367
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,200
Chu Qie'er wasn't
the murderer's only target.

368
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,120
But Mr. Lan, you obstructed
the investigation

369
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,990
for your own interests.

370
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,120
Peizhi didn't kill anyone.

371
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,230
He also wants to find the real killer.

372
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,680
If he didn't cover up for Gong Yuzhen

373
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,640
or mislead the investigation,

374
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,710
the real killer might be caught early.

375
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:54,750
Zhang Ping,

376
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,510
it was my fault

377
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,470
to lie to you

378
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,680
and misguide you.

379
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,200
But Yuzhen has been

380
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,550
kidnapped by the murderer.

381
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,030
I don't know if she's still alive.

382
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,440
I hope more than anyone

383
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,230
to solve the case as soon as possible.

384
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,680
Yeah.

385
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,680
I admit that

386
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,510
you were right before.

387
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,070
Let's continue our competition.

388
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,270
The murderer has killed two people.

389
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:17,920
Perhaps,

390
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,160
he would kill more.

391
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,230
To prevent more from being killed,

392
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,550
I hope to work with you

393
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,270
and crack the case soon.

394
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,750
The poison

395
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,120
is extremely weird.

396
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,470
To catch the murderer,

397
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,030
we should start from the poison.

398
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,880
These are all the things left by

399
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,680
Chu Qi'er and Dr. Sun.

400
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,600
Since they died of poisoning,

401
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,550
there may be a trail of clues.

402
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,270
Mr. Lan, I don't need your help.

403
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,160
Zhang Ping,

404
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,400
Peizhi is granting you a favor.

405
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,990
Why are you ungrateful?

406
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,440
Every time when Mr. Lan did me a favor,

407
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,070
I was misled.

408
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,790
I'd rather him not do me favors.

409
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,810
Isn't this

410
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,270
Dr. Sun's unfinished
Symptomatic Diagnosis?

411
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,030
Something is wrong with the preface.

412
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,120
The signature stamps

413
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,750
should follow the rule of
yang above and yin below.

414
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,710
Yang is the name.

415
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,840
Yin is the style name.

416
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,120
In between

417
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,310
should be space the size of a stamp.

418
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,710
But both the stamps

419
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,880
are yin

420
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,400
with no space between.

421
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,120
There's a layer

422
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,990
of red powder on the stamps.

423
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,790
Is it poisonous?

424
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,880
As expected.

425
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,710
The murderer dusted the powder
over the ink.

426
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,880
Such covert means

427
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,600
wouldn't alarm Dr. Sun.

428
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,990
The two stamps were used to

429
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,270
enlarge the area of the ink

430
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,920
to hold more poison powder.

431
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,640
When he turned the pages,

432
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,310
(Symptomatic Diagnosis)
the poison powder flew out.

433
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
Dr. Sun died of inhaling that.

434
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,360
Exactly.

435
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,710
Search mountains and seas
for everything.

436
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,440
Differentiate and use them
for patients' good.

437
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,510
As flowers bloom
a man reaps what he sows.

438
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,200
The murderer really did a lot.

439
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,270
He even wrote the preface for Dr. Sun.

440
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,070
But the last line

441
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,710
seems not suitable

442
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,440
for the first two.

443
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,440
Is the murderer suggesting something?

444
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,680
(Flowers bloom)

445
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,880
I've checked the lotus.

446
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,640
No poison there.

447
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Witnesses told me that

448
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,920
when Chu Qi'er was dancing,

449
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,710
the lotus

450
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,400
didn't open until the last minute.

451
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,790
Then Chu Qi'er dropped dead.

452
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,470
The poison is red.

453
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,990
Since it could be hidden in the ink,

454
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,920
it could also be

455
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,640
hidden in the red stamen.

456
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,680
When the poison came out,

457
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,200
Chu Qi'er died of

458
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,550
inhaling it.

459
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,270
Now I get the meaning

460
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,880
of the last line.

461
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,120
The murderer is

462
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,750
playing a guessing game with us.

463
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,790
Writing brush.

464
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,680
It seems to be Injeeten.

The ancient book you just read

468

is Scenery Journal
from the ancient Mo Kingdom.

469
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
There are some supernatural stories.

I can help you a little.

Read this one first.

476
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,400
What, is there any clue?

477
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,990
Is there any clue?

478
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,640
Here recorded the legend of Injeeten.

479
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,440
It says that when the ancient
Mo Kingdom was founded,

480
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,470
Injeeten

481
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
sent the Six Sages to the earth

482
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,510
to educate people.

483
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,360
The Six Sages were

484
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,070
Oungwule, Medicine-sage,

485
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,680
turned from a divine bird,

486
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,120
who could ease people's sufferings;

487
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,030
Arnage, Dance-sage,

488
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,310
who danced with grace

489
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,640
and taught people
to convey feelings by dancing;

490
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,030
Morengen, Wisdom-sage,

491
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,550
with four heads and eight arms,

492
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,200
who imparted wisdom to the world;

493
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,310
Zansang, Farmer and Sericulturist Sage,

494

turned from a silkworm,

wearing a crown of branches,

498
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,360
who judged the evil deeds;

499

and Ronakin, Musician-sage,

500

good at playing
various musical instruments,

who brought the gospel to the world.

Why does it sound so strange?

503

Wait.

504
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,120
There's something odd
with the first two sages.

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,030
was an

511
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,960
outstanding dancer.

512
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,230
Do you think that the murderer

513
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,550
selected his victims
according to the Six Sages?

514
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,310
If it's true,

515
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,070
who is the next sage?

516
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,030
Morengen.

517
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,990
He was said to have great wisdom

518
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,840
and a different look.

519
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,920
He had four heads

520
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,120
and they looked

521
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,990
exactly the same.

522
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,270
Four heads?

523
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,710
Exactly the same?

524
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,710
Let's go to Wuming Pavilion.

525
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,360
The four sages of the Feng Family

526
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,200
are the most
famous talent in the capital.

527
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,200
And they are

528
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,310
quadruplet.

529
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,580
Quadruplet?

530
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,740
(Suburbs of Ning'an City
Wuming Pavilion)

00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,710
Sir.

532
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,160
Sir.

533
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,440
One of our scroll paintings
has been damaged recently.

534
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,990
Masters are mending it
with the door closed.

535
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,030
They didn't even come out.

536
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,990
How could anything happen to them?

537
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Smell of blood.

538
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,230
Report it to the Ministry of Justice.

539
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,920
Yes.
