The scholars may enter.

(Benevolence Throughout the World)

4
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,070
We're having the palace examination
for choosing the top three.

5
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,760
Where is His Majesty?

6
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,710
Is His Majesty

7
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,310
still in the hunting ground?

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,920
It's forbidden to carry
weapons in the palace.

9
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,120
Who has the audacity to do so?

10
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,950
Greetings to Your Majesty!

11
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,870
Arise.

12
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,920
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,270
The palace examination
is the most important event

14
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,490
for selecting able talents.

15
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,060
May Your Majesty

16
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,860
treat it with courtesy.

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,780
If you think Mianfu is
[*Mianfu: Formal dress worn by emperors]

18
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,020
too formal,

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,140
you can wear an informal dress.

20
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,740
The military attire

21
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,900
shouldn't be worn on such an occasion.

22
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,900
It's against tradition.

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,300
Mr. Liu, since you mentioned Mianfu,

24
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,940
I have a question for you.

25
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,820
What is Mianfu?

26
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,420
There are patterns of twelve things

27
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,340
on Mianfu,

28
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,860
including the sun, the moon, the stars,

29
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,420
a tiger, a monkey, an axe,
an instrument and etc.

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,540
It contains the universe

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,100
and implies auspiciousness.

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,740
It's a symbol of the Son of Heaven.

33
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,700
What you see

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,300
is the universe.

35
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,220
I can't see that far.

36
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,020
I only want to know

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,780
who the silk spinner is

38
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,540
and if he needs to feed the mulberry leaves
to the silkworms every night.

39
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,020
Who is the embroiderer?

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,100
Can she earn enough money

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,780
to cure her eye disease?

42
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
Who dyed the cloth,

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,420
who cut it,

44
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,020
and who delivered it?

45
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,500
Can they

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,860
fill their stomachs and sleep in peace?

47
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,020
Mr. Liu.

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,940
What did you eat this morning?

49
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,740
Noodles with soup.

50
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,740
Do you think

51
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,140
the noodles

52
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,900
tasted bland today?

53
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,380
Well...

54
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,860
Because of the war,

55
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,300
pepper and cardamom from the South

56
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,700
are no longer available

57
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,420
in the capital these days.

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,660
Officials.

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,700
If you want to have
flavourous food like before,

60
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,620
I'm afraid

61
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,420
you will have to wait
for a few more days.

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,260
The people living on the southern border

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,180
are human beings,

64
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,500
not chips to be traded off.

65
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
Today,

66
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,020
you lack some pepper and cardamom,

67
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,740
and you can eat some light food.

68
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,300
Tomorrow,

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,020
when a greater calamity falls upon you,

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,980
you'll find that you are also chips

71
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,700
and your lives will be treated like dirt.

72
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,780
How are you

73
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,220
gonna live with yourselves

74
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,500
at that time?

75
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,180
There are aged officials

76
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,260
who have been through several dynasties

77
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,300
and also the pillars of the country
in the prime of life among you.

78
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,820
You are the past and present
of the Yong Kingdom.

79
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,380
The scholars

80
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,100
are the future of the Yong Kingdom.

81
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,260
I'm dressed in military attire right now

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,900
just to tell something

83
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,180
to the past, the present,
and the future of the Yong Kingdom.

84
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,420
The flames of war

85
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,700
are raging in the borderland.

86
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,340
For my people,

87
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,700
I've decided

88
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,580
to lead the soldiers on the battlefield.

89
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,580
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

90
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,380
You're the king of our country.

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,380
Your safety is of paramount importance.

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,140
If you lead the soldiers in person,

93
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,100
I'm afraid...

94
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
Without the people,

95
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,700
how would there be families?

96
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,380
How would there be a country?

97
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,420
For all the families,
and for our country,

98
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,420
I will

99
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,580
advance bravely and never withdraw.

100
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,420
I will die without regret.

101
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,540
I only hope

102
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,900
we can be united as one

103
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,500
to overcome the difficulties,

104
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,580
defend against foreign invasion,

105
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,820
and make a show of Yong's strength.

106
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,380
Your Gracious Majesty!

107
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,020
For the well-being of the people!

108
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,660

109

Your Majesty!

110
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,340
I'm willing to follow Your Majesty to war

111
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,180
in my father's stead.

112
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,140
I will advance bravely
and never withdraw!

113
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
I will die without regret!

the Empress Dowager's instruction!

116
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,300
The Empress Dowager said:

117
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,700
"The journey is difficult and dangerous.

118
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,580
May my son take care of himself

119
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,180
and make a triumphant return soon."

120
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,300
May Your Majesty
make a triumphant return soon.

121
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,580
Your Majesty,

122
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,100
may you make a triumphant return soon.

In that case,

the topic

"When a gentleman has to fight,
he must win."

All the selected scholars,

130

you can express your own opinions

131

Peizhi.

139
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,460
Why have you been studying

140
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,700
this torn page all day?

141
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,260
Shulin.

142
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,020
You know a lot of things.

143
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,940
Do you know

144
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,500
what kind of magic formation this is?

145
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,780
I've never seen it before.

146
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,340
I found it in
the Department of Incantation.

147
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,580
There should be a close connection

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,740
between it and the magic formation,

149
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
but the characters on it

150
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,820
are strange and difficult to understand.

151
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,660
Look.

152
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,780
Like this character.

153
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
It doesn't look like a character

154
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,220
or a drawing.

155
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,340
I've read all the books

156
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,980
and still don't have a clue.

157
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,140
If I'm not mistaken,

158
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,740
it should be the character for "back".

159
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,020
How do you know it?

160
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
When I was studying herbal medicine,

161
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,900
I once met a wandering monk
from Pujiu Temple.

162
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,500
He told me about an ancient method

163
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,660
of using insects as medicine,
which is called

164
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,500
poisonous magic.

165
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,220
I saw this kind of characters

166
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
in his book on poisonous magic.

167
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,220
Do you know anything else?

168
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,900
I only met him once.

169
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,820
I went east to seek medicine

170
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,980
before I could study more.

171
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,260
Pujiu Temple.

172
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,860
Do you remember his Dharma name?

173
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,100
I think it should be

174
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,860
Sujue.

175
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,540
I questioned Master Sujue closely

176
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,820
and threatened him

177
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,500
that I would get to the bottom of it
if he didn't say it.

178
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,340
Only then did he admit
that he was the only person

179
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,060
at the Department of Incantation
who survived.

180
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,780
He said the magic formation
was called Resurrection Array,

181
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,460
which is a secret
of the Department of Incantation.

182
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,540
The last time it was used

183
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,860
was 30 years ago.

184
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,900
On whom?

185
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,420
The Emperor.

186
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,140
Why?

187
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,620
It's said that His Majesty was born
with an acute illness.

188
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,860
(There was no cure for it.)

189
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
(The Department of Incantation
was given the order to cast a spell.)

190
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,260
(Therefore, Xuan Ji set up
the Resurrection Array)

191
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,380
(and claimed)

192
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,540
(that it can raise the dead
and make the flesh grow from the bones.)

193
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,580
(Two days and two nights later,)

194
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,380
His Majesty

195
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,060
was miraculously cured.

196
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
How was it possible to save a person
with a magic formation?

197
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,220
How did

198
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,100
His Majesty recover?

199
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,860
Either he healed himself,

200
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,620
or...

201
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,620
Are you saying

202
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,900
the real prince
wasn't saved at that time,

203
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,140
(and the current emperor is a fake?)

204
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,180
I also found it ridiculous at first,

205
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,140
but then I thought about it.

206
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,140
The Empress Dowager has been
estranged from the Emperor.

207
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,220
He is

208
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,620
her only son,

209
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,580
but she has been in control of
the court for years

210
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,500
and unwilling to return power to him.

211
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,940
(Then I think)

212
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,620
it's not impossible.

213
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,740
Still,

214
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,540
what does this have to do
with Moluo Village?

215
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,100
Why did Mr. Jinghu
associate Moluo Village

216
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,660
with the Resurrection Array?

217
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,540
(Just wait for today...)

218
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,580
The accident at Moluo Village

219
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,700
happened 20 years ago.

220
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,300
It was the same year

221
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,660
that everyone in
the Department of Incantation

222
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,100
died in an accident.

223
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,100
(20 years ago,)

224
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,700
(the poison was leaked)

225
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,860
(during a magic ceremony.)

226
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,500
(All the incantation practitioners died.)

227
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,150
(Department of Incantation)
(It has since)

228
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,560
(Sealed by Court of Judicial Review)
(been closed down.)

229
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,700
It was when
the previous emperor just died

230
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,420
and His Majesty ascended the throne
at a young age.

231
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,500
The Empress Dowager
started to take power.

232
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,700
Could it be

233
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,180
that the Empress Dowager ordered to kill

234
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,140
for fear of exposing the secret

235
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,700
of switching the prince?

236
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,620
That could explain

237
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,660
what happened to
the Department of Incantation.

238
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,340
It was them who planned

239
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,420
the Resurrection Array,

240
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,100
but Moluo Village
is far away in the South.

241
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,980
There was no way for them
to participate in it.

242
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,380
How could they be involved?

243
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,980
Zhang, Mr. Lan!

244
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,900
Are you done talking?

245
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,020
You'd better pause for a moment.

246
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
Something is going on.

247
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,620
Here.

248
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,900
A dragon soars to the blue sky.

249
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,900
A dragon sinks into the bottomless pit.

250
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,820
30 years passed after a dream.

251
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,060
Don't know if the dragon is real or fake.

252
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,220
Chen Chou.

253
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Where did you get this poem?

254
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,540
Everyone on the street
is talking about it.

255
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,580
They're saying all kinds of things.

256
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,940
Just when we found out about it,

257
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,740
the rumors got around.

258
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm afraid someone is

259
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,420
adding fuel to the flames.

260
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,700
By the way,

261
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,500
only Master Sujue survived the accident

262
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,380
at the Department of Incantation

263
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,540
and remained anonymous for more than 20 years
without being discovered.

264
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,940
How did you find him?

265
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,500
Well,

266
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,420
Shulin gave me some directions.

267
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,460
Shulin?

268
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,780
Mr. Lan.

269
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,100
There's something I haven't told you.

270
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,220
The way Mr. Gu talks and acts

271
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,300
resembles Mr. Jinghu a lot

272
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
who spoke to me that day.

273
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,340
They even have the similar voice and tone.

274
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,100
Do you suspect

275
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,020
that Shulin is Mr. Jinghu?

276
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,660
It's impossible.

277
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,860
Zhang Ping.

278
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,740
There are countless people
who are alike in this world.

279
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,660
Besides,

280
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,540
you've never seen Mr. Jinghu's face.

281
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,380
You can't make such an arbitrary guess.

282
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,740
No, Mr. Lan. I'm intuitive.

283
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,940
We spent so much time
trying to figure it out,

284
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,780
but we got nothing.

285
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Why did you find the secret
of the Resurrection Array

286
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,180
right after he gave you some directions?

287
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,100
He studies medicine

288
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,060
and happens to know

289
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,780
a certain character on that torn page.

290
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,340
Can't there

291
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,860
be any coincidence?

292
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,260
It's a coincidence when it happens once.

293
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,500
But these things are connected.

294
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,340
How could it still be a coincidence?

295
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,900
Zhang Ping.

296
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,100
I know you're devoted to this case

297
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,580
and eager to find the truth,

298
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,300
but you must seek evidence with care.

299
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,660
Don't use your intuition.

300
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,580
Then you shouldn't be sentimental about this.

301
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,460
I've known Shulin for ten years.

302
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,020
I know what kind of person he is.

303
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:09,900
Besides,

304
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,460
we've made a breakthrough
in the Resurrection Array

305
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,860
and we should start from here.

306
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,260
I only talk about evidence and clues.

307
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,700
The suspect is right there.

308
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,580
We should start with him.

309
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,300
Mr. Lan...

310
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,580
It's getting late.

311
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,500
It'll be too dark for you to see in the alley.

312
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Let me escort you home first.

313
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,580
Yeah.

314
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Why don't you think about it
when you get home?

315
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,220
Maybe you'll figure it out.

316
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,060
Yeah.

317
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,740
Sir.

318
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,660
All right.

319
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,980
Today's conversation is a waste of time.

320
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,300
There's news from the palace

321
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,220
that the Empress Dowager
is in a stable condition now

322
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,860
and determined to track down
the remnants of Moluo.

323
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,660
You must hide the Water Vessel well.

324
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,700
Don't let anyone find it.

325
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,700
Otherwise,

326
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,940
there will be no way to explain yourself.

327
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,460
Yes, yes.

328
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,700
I'll see him off.

329
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,900
(30 years ago, the prince was not saved.)

330
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,340
Mr. Qi.

331
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,740
What brings you here?

332
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,740
Let's

333
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,900
take a walk?

334
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,220
You didn't do well

335
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,260
on the day of the palace exam.

336
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,900
I know

337
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,900
you didn't show your real strength.

338
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,660
You didn't want to be an official,

339
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,980
right?

340
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
Do you know

341
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,740
why I have to wage a war
against Nandong?

342
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,460
For the bigger picture,

343
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,340
the Yong Kingdom needs the victory.

344
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,700
For personal reasons,

345
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
you cannot ignore

346
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,660
the life of every civilian.

347
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,580
If you were me,

348
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
how would you choose?

349
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm just a commoner.

350
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,380
My choice

351
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,020
won't affect the country in any way.

352
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,660
Where is the fearless

353
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,700
and unflinching Zhang Ping?

354
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,100
I think I used to be too naive.

355
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,700
I thought

356
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,900
the Court of Judicial Review

357
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,820
is just a place
where the best detectives gather in.

358
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,740
(Hanhui Pavilion, Ning'an)

359
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,820
I didn't realize

360
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
it's also a bureaucratic place.

361
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,020
Well?

362
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,780
Now you've seen

363
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,980
how cruel the world is

364
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,660
and how complicated the bureaucracy is.

365
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,980
Do you want to bail?

366
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,860
No.

367
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,460
I will only work on cases,

368
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,580
but I won't

369
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,740
enter the official world.

370
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,100
What a joke.

371
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,860
How are you gonna work on cases

372
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,820
when you're not an official?

373
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,140
How can you dispel the darkness

374
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,940
when you're not in the dark?

375
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,180
Here, sir.

376
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,140
Thank you.

377
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
This is roasted milk fan

378
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,900
made of fermented goat milk
from Jiannandao.

379
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,580
The rarer dried matsutake inside

380
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,380
is from the mountains over there.

381
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,860
I didn't know there is

382
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,580
such a delicacy in Jiannandao.

383
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,780
Young man.

384
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,060
This little money

385
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,180
is the least I could do.

386
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,740
Sir.

387
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,260
This is all you have, right?

388
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,380
If you donate it all,

389
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,580
how are you gonna live on?

390
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,340
I've suffered everything.

391
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,940
Don't worry about me.

392
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,420
Besides, my son is also a soldier.

393
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,060
I can't watch him and his brothers

394
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,780
go to war on hungry stomachs.

395
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,380
They are...

396
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,820
They are merchants from Dafu City

397
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,060
who are spontaneously donating
to the Army for Southward Crusade.

398
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,100
Take care, sir.

399
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,820
Leave it there.

400
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,100
You're also here.

401
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,420
The court has finally

402
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,980
gotten tough for once over these years.

403
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,580
Yeah.

404
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,260
The soldiers fight with their lives

405
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,500
so that we can have a square meal

406
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,780
and a good night's sleep.

407
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,460
Well, old man.

408
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,100
You should take the donkey back.

409
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,140
I'll donate your share for you.

410
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,300
How can I let you do that?

411
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,300
The rise and fall of the nation
is the concern of every citizen.

412
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,660
Here.

413
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,780
Mr. Qi.

414
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,460
I've signed up

415
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,820
as an army caterer.

416
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,020
I won't be here from tomorrow.

417
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,180
Now my hometown is in trouble,

418
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,460
how can I seek temporary ease?

419
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,980
If you want to eat
my roasted milk fan again,

420
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,620
you'll have to wait
for the army's triumph.

421
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,420
Here is a picul of rice.

422
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,060
Look.

423
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,300
The world

424
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,820
doesn't just belong to me.

425
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,340
It belongs to every citizen.

426
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,500
One person

427
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,300
can't change everything,

428
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
but if everyone
makes a little contribution,

429
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,820
it will bring hope.

430
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,020
Even Tao Zhoufeng's

431
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,020
script for story-telling

432
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,460
brought you to the capital

433
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,900
and got you here,

434
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,300
which leaves a small shoot of hope

435
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,580
to the world.

436
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,260
I'm not asking you
to answer me right now.

437
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,900
Take your time to think about it.

438
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,620
(30 years passed after a dream.
Don't know if the dragon is real or fake.)

439
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,340
It's just a rumor on the street.

440
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,220
Don't take it seriously.

441
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,740
30 years passed after a dream.

442
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,020
Don't know if the dragon is real or fake.

443
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,660
Do you know it?

444
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,380
Real

445
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,620
or fake,

446
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,020
what does it matter?

447
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,340
If I'm real,

448
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
as the Son of Heaven,

449
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,420
I should fight for my country.

450
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,020
If I'm fake,

451
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,740
as a subject of the Yong Kingdom,

452
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,580
I should fight for my fellow countrymen.

453
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,860
Zhang Ping.

454
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,620
Why cross a river

455
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,580
when you know you would die?

456
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,500
I'll save the position for you.

457
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,700
Wait for me to come back.

458
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,900
Peizhi, it's stingy of you

459
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,340
to prepare such a simple meal.

460
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,500
A simple meal

461
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,580
is like a normal farewell.

462
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,940
Just like

463
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
we'll meet again tomorrow

464
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,340
after we part today.

465
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,300
Okay.

466
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,260
I'll finish my meal first

467
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,260
and look forward to the next meal.

468
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
You said

469
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,700
we should treat this
as a normal gathering

470
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,220
and not mention the sadness of parting.

471
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,180
Why are you so sullen today?

472
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,380
Mowen.

473
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,700
I know you don't want to hear stuff like

474
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,580
"take care of yourself".

475
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,340
You're the one who's been
making trouble all day.

476
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,580
Now I'm leaving,

477
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,300
and there is no one else to protect you.

478
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,420
You're the one who should be careful.

479
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,820
What I owe you

480
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:08,740
is way too much...

481
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,820
We agreed not to talk about this.

482
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,660
I wanted to lie drunkenly on the battlefield
since I was a kid.

483
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,980
Now

484
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,900
my wish is fulfilled.

485
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,580
You should be happy for me.

486
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,660
Good.

487
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,740
Let's get drunk today

488
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,740
and have a good time.

489
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,660
What I really worry about is

490
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,020
that the wine over there

491
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,060
wouldn't be as good
as the wine in the capital.

492
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,700
Then I'll owe you

493
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,900
ten jars of good wine.

494
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,100
I'll keep them for you.

495
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,820
Deal.

496
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,660
But you must
make a triumphant return soon,

497
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,420
or

498
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
Xu Dong and Liuyun will drink it all.

499
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,700
Of course.

500
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,260
When I make a triumphant return,

501
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,380
let's...

502
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,580
Let's

503
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,060
get drunk together again.

504
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,380
The army is on the march!

505
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,420
The army is on the march!

506
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,060
Zhang!

507
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,380
Zhang.

508
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,460
I donated

509
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,860
our five bags of flour as you asked.

510
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,540
The government gave us a big red flower.

511
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,340
Where is the flower?

512
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,660
Hear me out.

513
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,420
On my way back,

514
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,180
I saw two imperial posters

515
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,140
issued by the Empress Dowager.

516
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,420
One is about recruiting good doctors
for burn treatment.

517
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,940
The other is about arresting

518
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,220
the remnant of Moluo
who has the Water Vessel.

519
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,100
The government has started to search

520
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,580
and released the news

521
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,020
that anyone who notifies the government

522
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,820
about the clues

523
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,700
will be well rewarded.

524
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,420
They look serious about this.

525
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,060
It'll be horrible to get caught.

526
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,300
So I dropped the flower

527
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,180
and hurried back.

528
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,060
Seems that the Empress Dowager

529
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,780
didn't see Mr. Jinghu's face.

530
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,740
The Water Vessel
is the only clue she has.

531
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,940
Zhang.

532
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,700
Why can't you grasp the point?

533
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,820
Listen to me.

534
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,260
Don't leave the house from today,

535
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,140
and

536
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,140
don't carry the Water Vessel with you.

537
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,580
And...

538
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,180
There are a lot of people in the capital

539
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,900
who know you have the Water Vessel.

540
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,900
What if they turn you in?

541
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,460
No, no, no.

542
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,180
We have to run now.

543
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,220
It's not that serious.

544
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,660
Seriously?

545
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,500
They found you

546
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
in such a short time?

547
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,900
Oh, no!

548
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,820
The money!

549
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,420
Hurry!

550
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,580
The bag!

551
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,380
My good disciple.

552
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,340
Get down here.

553
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,700
Well,

554
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,700
are you gonna turn your back on me

555
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,180
after you pass the imperial examination?

556
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,420
Master?

557
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,860
It's my master.

558
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,820
Master, why are you here?

559
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,620
Master, what brings you here?

560
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,420
The examination result
will be announced soon.

561
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,940
Of course I should be here
and wait for your good news.

562
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,660
But why did I see a wanted poster

563
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,700
just after I got here?

564
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,300
Don't worry, Master.

565
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,140
I'm fine.

566
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,620
You got a nice yard.

567
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,140
Master.

568
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,420
How did you get here?

569
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,020
Detective Noodle.

570
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,620
Everyone knows you.

571
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,620

Master!

574
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,900
He must be Chen Chou

575
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,060
who you mentioned all the time.

576
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,660
Yes.

577
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,420
He looks smart.

This is the cart

581

we used as our noodle stall.

582
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,100
Master.

583
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,500
Do you want to see my room?

584
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,580
Show me your little room.

585

Let me take a look.

Master.

587
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,140
I'll make some tea for you.

588
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,260
Okay.

589
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,020
Master.

590
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,740
I usually sleep here.

591
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,580
I keep my books

592
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,020

You don't know

599
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,100
that Zhang

600
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,260
has been thinking about

601
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,060
whether to follow in
Mu Yesheng's footsteps

602
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,220
and go to the Court of Judicial Review.

603
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,740
Well?

604
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,780
He doesn't want to get in
the Court of Judicial Review?

605
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,100
Yeah.

606
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,140
Being an official repels him.

607
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,900
That's great.

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,500
You should follow in my footsteps.

Master.

you can go back with me now.

After you go back with me,

614
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,660
you should learn how to

615

tend to the yard first.

616
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,220
Otherwise, those chickens and ducks

617
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,100
will starve to death

618
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,020
after I pass away.

619
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,020
You're in good health, Master.

620

You'll live a long life.

There will still be an end.

Do you think I'm immortal?

Actually,

624
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,700
it's a good thing not to be an official.

625
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
There will be less stress.

626
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,580
As long as I'm still breathing,

627
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,900
I won't let you starve to death

with my ability to tell fortunes, right?

Actually, I'm happy for you.

You used to

632

put Mu Yesheng first

Master.

637
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,340
Were you jealous of Mu Yesheng?

638
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,620
Of course.

639

Master has been in the capital
for a few days.

644
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,260
Has he gotten used to living here?

645

Is there anything else he needs?

646

Of course he has.

647
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,500
Why he shouldn't be?

648
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,740
He leaves at dawn every day

649
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,700

I know I can't stop you.

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,260
He made a mistake with the prescription

677
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,140
and sent me to buy more herbs.

678
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,820
He bought three kinds of herbs.

679
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,340
Which one do you want

680
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,180
and how much?

681
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,300
All three of them.

682
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,060
Five maces for each.

683
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,700
Okay.

684
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,460
Abelmoschus manihot.

685
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,540
Dodonaea viscosa leaves.

686
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,340
Centella.

687
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,100
He bought three kinds of herbs,

688
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,060
centella, dodonaea viscosa leaves,
and abelmoschus manihot.

689
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,300
These herbs are all for burns.

690
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,260
Mr. Lan.

691
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,900
Last time you said
I work on cases on my intuitions

692
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,700
without solid evidence.

693
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
Now I've found the evidence.

694
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,580
Gu Qingzhang bought herbs for burns

695
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,340
right after the Empress Dowager
gave orders to look for them.

696
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,220
I think he is trying
to approach the Empress Dowager.

697
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,180
That's just your preconception.

698
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,460
He's a doctor.

699
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,900
Buying herbs
and getting prescriptions filled

700
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,860
are what he does.

701
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,860
Like I asked you last time,

702
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,980
why did he show up in the vicinity
of the Department of Incantation?

703
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,780
How did he know the whereabouts
of the incantation practitioners?

704
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,340
How do you explain that?

705
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,260
I'll send people to verify it,

706
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,660
but before we find any evidence,

707
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,660
we can't jump to a conclusion.

708
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,180
I have no intention to overhear you two,

709
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,700
but you were talking too loud.

710
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,580
Shulin.

711
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,020
Since I was mentioned,

712
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,340
I would like to defend myself.

713
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,580
Shulin.

714
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,620
You don't have to do this.

715
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,820
That day I was only

716
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,580
passing by
the Department of Incantation.

717
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,580
I didn't know
the Department of Incantation was there.

718
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,620
As for Master Sujue,

719
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,580
I also met him by coincidence.

720
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,900
I was seeking medical help at the time.

721
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,180
I didn't know

722
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,060
anything else.

723
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,460
Did you buy

724
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,580
these three kinds of herbs today?

725
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,860
What do you use them for?

726
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,500
I'm a doctor.

727
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,740
It was my daily routine to buy the herbs

728
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,900
mentioned in
the Compendium of Materia Medica

729
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,780
and study them.

730
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,420
I do it all the time.

731
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,460
Sir.

732
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,620
It's just his side of the story.

733
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,220
Enough!

734
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,140
Master.

735
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,060
You're back early today.

736
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,940
Yeah.

737
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,580
Master.

738
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,780
Where have you been these days?

739
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,620
I went to buy something for Ping.

740
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,860
You're so good to Zhang Ping.

741
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,340
I met him.

742
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,420
It can't be helped.

743
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,140
Master.

744
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,100
I heard that you can tell fortunes.

745
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,660
Well,

746
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,700
can you tell

747
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,700
if I can pass

748
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,060
the next imperial examination?

749
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,940
Why do you have to worry about

750
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,780
the next imperial examination now?

751
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,140
Actually,

752
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,300
becoming an official

753
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,660
isn't that important.

754
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,220
What's important is that you and Ping

755
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,020
can live a happy and delightful life.

756
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,220
It's better than anything else.

757
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,420
Does Zhang Ping live here?

758
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,900
I don't know.

759
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
You don't know?

760
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,660
Tell me!

761
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,500
I really don't know.

762
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,580
Where does he live?

763
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,020
Up there.

764
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,100
Ma-a-aster.

765
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,220
The Imperial Guards are here.

766
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,580
Ping will be back soon.

767
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,140
Go around to the front door

768
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,380
and take Ping to hide.

769
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,340
I'll hold them off

770
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,660
and lead them to the side door.

771
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,860
I'll tell them he went south.

772
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,460
Master.

773
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,180
I can't leave you here alone.

774
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,740
Just go!

775
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,580
Go!

776
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,220
Search it.

777
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,700
Officers.

778
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,860
What are you looking for?

779
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,100
We can talk about this.

780
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,780
Old man.

781
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,180
Where is he?

782
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:50,860
Zhang.

783
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,540
Well,

784
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,780
Xu Dong just came over.

785
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,300
He said Mr. Lan wants to see you.

786
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,500
Why are there so many Imperial Guards
at the door?

787
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,140
Mr. Lan...

788
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,340
Xu said...

789
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,580
Xu Dong said Mr. Lan...

790
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,180
Where is Master?

791
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,180
Where is Master?

792
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,700
Sir.

793
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,900
We found the Water Vessel.

794
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,260
Sir.

795
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,500
I found a side door over there.

796
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,500
A side door?

797
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,740
Ping, run!

798
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,860
Run!

799
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,260
Catch him!

800
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
You old man.

801
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,380
Zhang.

802
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,380
Zhang.

803
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,140
Zhang.

804
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,060
Master.

805
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,460
Master.

806
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,100
Master.

807
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,860
Master.

808
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,860
Master.

809
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,060
Ping.

810
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,060
Master, please.

811
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,140
Master.

812
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,660
Master.

813
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,740
Please.

814
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,340
Master.

815
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,100
Master!

816
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,380
Master!

817
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,300
Master.

818
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
Master, wake up.

819
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,140
Master.

820
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,740
It's my fault.

821
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,460
Master.

822
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,660
It's all my fault.

823
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,780
Master!

824
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,940
Master is gone.

825
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,300
Master is gone!

826
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,140
Zhang.

827
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,620
Zhang.

828
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,980
Master is gone.

829
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,820
I'll kill them.

830
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,500
I'll kill them.

831
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:01,940
Zhang!

832
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,860
Zhang!

833
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,620
Zhang!

834
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,500
You can't go!

835
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,660
Zhang!

836
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,180
Zhang, you can't go!

837
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,060
Zhang!

838
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,380
Let go of me!

839
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,220
Zhang!

840
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,500
Zhang!

841
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,700
Zhang!

842
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,380
I'm sorry.

843
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,660
I can't let Master die in vain.

844
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,700
(No one will take away my Ping.)

845
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,140
I will hire a donkey cart for you.

846
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,900
You can take

847
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,260
