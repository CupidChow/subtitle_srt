00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,830
Banyue Pavilion is fully
booked at this moment

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,320
by Wang Sheren's nephew.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,440
The imperial examination
is around the corner,

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,070
but he's seeking pleasure so blatantly?

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
(Xu Lu, Scholar)
Who is he?

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,050
(Qin Han, Scholar)
And who are we?

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,390
Probably he's secured a place
through nepotism.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,790
How can we compete with him?

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
Then poor scholars like us

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,200
could never see the light of day.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,350

(Wang Cheng, Scholar)

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,560
Can you hear it?

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,350
It's the sound of Xun
(a wind instrument).

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,400
Excuse me,

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,350
why are you getting in our way?

on the Jinghu Lake at this late hour.

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,070
I guess you must be feeling at loss

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,400
as the imperial examination is coming.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,200
I'm here to solve your confusions.

Who are you?

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,430
How do you know
we're going to take the exam?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm Mr. Jinghu.

Wang Cheng,

31
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,560
he dares not even show his face.

32
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,200
He must be a crook.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,790
Yeah.

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,560
No one in the world has that power.

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,870
I don't believe him.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,000
If you don't believe,

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,920
you may come on board to have a try.

38

I'd like to try.

Please.

Sit down, please.

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,120
So how will you solve my confusions?

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,560
Calm your mind

46
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,840
and stare at this.

a small boat loomed up
through the heavy fog,

on which was Mr. Jinghu.

56
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,030
He invited Wang Cheng on board

and inspired him in a few words.

Then he disappeared into the mist.

What happened?

What happened?

The next day,

Wang Cheng surprisingly
wrote some articles

wanted their men
to be the chief examiner.

exploited the advantage to get the job.

He is very stubborn.

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
Everyone sending him gifts
was turned away.

117
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,310
Did he give you the cold shoulder too?

118
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,120
What are you talking about?

119

Do I need to do that?

with Mr. Lan?

No, no.

126
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,720
I didn't expect

that I would be the chief examiner.

But I think

132
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,800
His Majesty has his thought on this.

133
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,120
Yes.

134
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,000
We have to be very careful

135
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,560
in our future actions.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,870
Such being the case,

137
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,800
we have to be more thoughtful.

Zhang, you know what?

139
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,310
I've been praying to God every day

just for your return.

Well,

it must be Buddha's blessing.

147
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,870
Come on.

148
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,800
Let's go inside.

149
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,360
The exam is around the corner,

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,190
so I've been cramming for it.

That man?

155
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,920
He is godlike.

156
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,920
He suddenly showed up
shortly after you left.

157
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,600
Well,

158
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
he has something in common with you.

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
I heard that he can also do a spell

160

to read people's minds

161

and foresee the future.

162
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
And he also uses a water vessel to do it.

163
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,920
Does he also know

164
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,870
Water Illusion?

165
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,120
Sir,

166
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,720
I've gone to check near the Jinghu Lake.

167
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,270
But

168
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,070
I didn't find any sign of Mr. Jinghu.

169
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,750
It's really weird.

who is Mr. Jinghu?

We don't know what really happened.

175
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,000
He must have some connection
with Moluo Clan

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,750
since he knows Water Illusion.

177
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,840
Finding him might be a turnaround.

this is my bro Zhang Ping.

I know what you're here for,

but I can tell you nothing more.

185

Everyone in the city is talking about it.

186

Even Mr. Lan has known it.

187

I'm afraid

188
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,080
that saying would get me into trouble.

I assure you

193
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,030
that Zhang only has a few questions

194
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,030
and he would tell no one about it.

I promise.

What do you want to know?

203
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,120
I heard
that Mr. Jinghu can read people's mind.

204
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,030
Is that true?

205
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,360
Of course it is.

206
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,840
I didn't believe it at first.

207
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,120
But Mr. Jinghu just guessed it right

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,360
that I was trying to get
Notes on Four Books by Xue Ru.

209

This book had been lost for long.

That night,

211
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,030
Mr. Jinghu told me

212
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,670
to do more good deeds

213
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,960
to accumulate blessings.

214
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
Then I walked along the streets

215
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,630
to distribute food

216
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,960
to homeless people and beggars.

217
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,840
Then

218
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,320
guess what?

219
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,480
There was one beggar who insisted on

220
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
not to take the food for nothing.

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,150
He gave me an old box
in exchange for food.

222
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,000
I took it back and opened it.

but don't even think about my book.

Did Mr. Jinghu use a water vessel

like this?

It's indeed like this.

Why do you have this too?

I told Zhang in detail about it.

He just poured some water into it

242
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,600
and asked me to stare at the water.

243

It's pretty much like that.

Mr. Jinghu also knows Water Illusion?

and used it the same way.

But as far as I know,

Water Illusion can't help

No.

He has the same water vessel.

277
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,840
That means

278
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
he has some connection with Moluo Clan.

506
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,790
Can't realize aspirations without money.

507
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,720
What does that mean?

508
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,750
Could it be

509
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,750
that someone has bribed the examiners?

510
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,310
Then poor scholars like us

511
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,350
would come in vain.

512
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:28,880
Is that right?

513
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,400
Right.

514
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,160
Right.

515
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,400
Something will be wrong with Guiyou.

516
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,270
Does that mean

517
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,160
cheating in the exam?

518
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
The questions might have been disclosed.

519
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,110
No,

520
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,790
we must ask for an explanation today.

521
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,350
We want an explanation.

522
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,550
We want an explanation.

523
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,750
Exam Hall is a serious place.

524
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,720
How can you

525
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,350
clamor here?

526
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,070
Everyone, please calm down.

527
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,310
The four examiners
who gave the questions

528
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,070
were all chosen by His Majesty.

529
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,110
And the entire process was supervised
by the Ministry of Rites.

530
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,070
There's no possibility to cheat at all.

531
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,750
Anyone who disturbs
the order by scaremongering

532
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,480
will be severely punished

533
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,440
and disqualified from the exam

534
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,350
according to the law.

535
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,160
Mr. Lan,

536
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,790
are you trying to exclude opponents

537
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,440
and suppress us openly?

538
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,070
I see.

539
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,640
Listen to this sentence.

540
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,920
If there is not enough gold
inlaid with jade.

541
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,160
It seems to be referring to Mr. Lan.

542
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,200
You're right.

543
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,640
Mr. Lan's given name is Jue

544
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,510
Jue is jade.

545
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,880
It's gold inlaid with jade.

546
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,960
The three of you

547
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,680
go inside with me.

548
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,000
That's him.

549
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,830
That's him.

550
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,550
Mr. Lan,

551
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,480
what's your explanation?

552
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,270
It was really unexpected.

553
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,200
It also caught me off guard.

554
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,750
Then

555
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,110
how do you explain the saying?

556
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,880
It can be explained in different ways.

557
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,640
They're accusing me of taking bribes

558
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,270
just based on that.

559
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,350
It's

560
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,400
too far-fetched.

561
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,030
Besides, Mr. Jinghu
hides himself in the dark.

562
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,030
He must have an ulterior motive.

563
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,310
How can we believe what he said.

564
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,720
Zhang Ping,

565
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,790
you have a relationship with Mr. Lan.

566
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,200
He must have colluded with you,

567
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,270
and disclosed the questions to you.

568
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,680
How can you…

569
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,000
Is Mr. Lan helping you cheat?

570
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,350
I saw you acting weirdly
at the seat of Guiyou.

571
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,480
What were you doing?

572
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,790
I was trying to find the truth.

573
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,880
You look honest.

574
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,480
Unexpectedly,

575
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,960
you're so ill-minded.

576
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,720
Yeah.

577
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,440
Yeah.

578
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,510
- Tell the truth.
- It must be you.

579
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
Ministers,

580
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,070
I led some men to search around

581
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,030
but didn't find
where the sound of Xun came from

582
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,240
and who flew the kite.

583
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,400
You go to the Ministry of Justice now

584
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,920
to ask for Mr. Wang's help
with investigation.

585
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,920
It's…

586
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,750
It's not a good idea.

587
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,960
Both Minister Dou and I
are question setters.

588
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,480
My son

589
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,480
should abide by the two provisions

590
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,550
that relatives and subordinates

591
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
must stay out of the exam

592
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,110
and avoid arousing suspicion.

593
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,590
I've been an official for decades,

594
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,000
but I've never seen such a big mess

595
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,070
in previous imperial examinations

596
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,510
In order to

597
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,480
convince the examinees,

598
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,400
I'm afraid

599
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,680
you have to resign
as the chief examiner,

600
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,790
and we'll choose
someone else to replace you.

601
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,480
I neither disclosed the questions

602
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,510
nor took bribes.

603
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,750
Just resigning

604
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,590
due to the accusation by innuendo

605
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,070
is exactly what the mastermind wants.

606
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,110
You are talking nonsense.

607
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,440
How could Zhang
collude with Mr. Lan to cheat?

608
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,110
I think he is the cheater.

609
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,590
We can't let a cheater

610
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,920
to take the exam with us.

611
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,070
It's unfair to us.

612
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,310
Kick him out of here.

613
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,160
Kick him out of here.

614
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,550
What's going on outside?

615
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,070
It sounds like they're quarreling.

616
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,270
Get out.

617
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,880
Get out.

618
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,640
I have no relationship with Mr. Lan.

619
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,400
You…

620
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,240
Stop.

621
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,110
I have no relationship with Mr. Lan,

622
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,270
let alone colluding with him to cheat.

623
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,480
You're lying.

624
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,480
Mr. Liu, Mr. Wang,

625
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,880
he was acting weirdly at Guiyou seat.

626
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,960
He must have colluded
with Mr. Lan to cheat.

627
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,200
They should be arrested
and severely punished.

628
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,590
I didn't do it.

629
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,510
Zhang Ping,

630
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,400
it's so clear now.

631
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,550
You don't need to argue more.

632
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,750
I was wondering

633
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,440
how you would cheat without money.

634
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,310
It turns out

635
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,960
that you're a relative of Mr. Lan's.

636
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,960
I'm not.

637
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,750
You are lying.

638
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,510
You're lying.

639
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,270
Kick him out of here.

640
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,110
How do you explain
what just happened?

641
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,830
I'm not lying.

642
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,830
I'm telling the truth.

643
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,880
Stop.

644
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,240
I have no relationship with Zhang Ping.

645
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,590
According to the law,

646
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,680
all examinees' personal details

647
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,720
should be documented
three months before the exam.

648
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,750
Since you doubt us,

649
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,790
I'll read out
Zhang Ping's personal profile

650
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,270
to clear the air.

651
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,270
Zhang Ping

652
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,110
is from Lijiadian Village,
Xichuan County.

653
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,790
He has no great-grandparents,

654
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,270
no grandparents,

655
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,640
no mother,

656
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,270
no father

657
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,070
and no brother.

658
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,960
He has no relatives.

659
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,830
He is the only one in his family.

660
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,640
I know you've studied hard for years.

661
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,750
I clearly know

662
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,350
what you've been through.

663
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,790
Now that

664
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,310
you have doubts about me,

665
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,160
I'll resign as the chief examiner

666
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,070
to ensure justice.

667
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,240
I'll accept investigations
by the Court of Judicial Review.

668
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,590
If you draw the question I gave,

669
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,880
it can be considered invalid

670
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,480
and you may draw one more time.

671
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,440
Shao Zhi,

672
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,720
you and Ji Wen will temporarily

673
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,590
